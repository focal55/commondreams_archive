<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA - July 9 - An Australian company has bridged the gap between fossil fuel dependence and environmental responsibility, enabling all countries to meet the Kyoto Protocols. USIS Group today introduced the patented Unique Steam Induction Systems (USIS), a low-emission, fuel-saving device that uses water to make vehicles more efficient. 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">USIS mounts to a vehicle's existing gasoline- or diesel-powered engine to create a water/petroleum hybrid. Because it uses water and can easily be retrofitted to any vehicle, the system is affordable and readily available to the average consumer. Initial independent testing has shown that USIS reduces gasoline consumption by 42%, increasing fuel economy to 45mpg in USIS Group's prototype six-cylinder, 2.0 liter sedan - a car that averages 26mpg off the factory floor. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Recent world events have led to fluctuating fuel and oil prices around the globe, resulting in a greater emphasis on stricter pollution standards, more efficient fuel systems and electronic control of engines to achieve better emission standards in first world countries,&quot; said Simon Butler, co-founder of USIS Group. &quot;To date there has been an increased focus on alternative hybrid fuel systems, but due to technology restraints and the unavailability of infrastructure support networks, they have been unattractive to investors and consumers alike. This, combined with pressure on the third world to adopt similar protocols, has created a market opportunity that requires a simple, low-cost, sustainable system for emission reduction. USIS is that system.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition to increased fuel economy, USIS boosts vehicle range by 75% and gives the vehicle 20% more torque. All tests were conducted by independent testing agencies; comprehensive results and certifications are available from USIS Group upon request. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">USIS can be applied to all fixed and mobile platforms that use internal combustion engines. USIS Group's gasoline and diesel prototype vehicles have not needed extensive modification to run with USIS in place. In the modified engines, steam is inducted during combustion, allowing the vehicles to run leaner mixtures of fuel and oxygen and cooling the combustion process. The continuous flow of steam through the engine keeps cylinders and pistons clean and helps prevent &quot;pinging&quot; by cleaning carbon deposits. The higher exhaust oxygen content produces fewer NOX and CO2 emissions; a plume of steam from the exhaust pipes is the only evidence of the vehicles' alteration. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;USIS brings together available, proven technology. It does not rely on technology that is inferior or unavailable,&quot; said Butler. &quot;We see great opportunity for all sectors of the industry to benefit from the system. For instance, by using an existing platform, car manufacturers can license USIS to quickly adapt existing car designs to operate USIS. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Environmentalists will see reduced fuel consumption and dramatically fewer emissions. And petroleum companies will see increased revenues because more cars will be allowed on the roads, still utilizing fossil fuels with existing technology. Everyone wins.&quot;</font></p>
