-  

May 5 - According to a new 

forecast released today by MCH Education Data, the budget pressures 

gripping nearly every state will have an unequal impact on schools 

next year. The company has evaluated each state's budget and 

educational funding methods to determine which school systems will 

be hit hardest. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The company scored each state on numerous factors to assign them 

a budget pressure score from 0 to 7, the worst impact. California 

is the only state that received a score of 7, which is considered 

"Critical Pressure." 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"With across the board state budget cuts, a huge looming budget 

gap for the 2003-2004 school year, and an above average dependency 

on state funding, it's clear that school systems in California are 

in for more rough times," said John F. Hood, president of MCH 

Education Data. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MCH predicts that schools in six states will suffer "Severe 

Pressure" and 34 states will undergo "Major Pressure." Only nine 

states fall into the lowest category of "Minimal Pressure." The 

company has posted supporting documentation of its forecast on its 

Web site, <a href="http://www.mailings.com" target="_new">http://www.mailings.com</a>. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"While these averages are telling at the state level, the impact 

will vary significantly at the district level," Hood says. "State 

funding formulas are designed to put more money into low income 

districts. Ironically, this means that wealthy districts - which 

are mostly funded at the local level -- will avoid the harshest 

effects of state budget cuts." 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hood notes that legislatures and school districts are still 

reacting to the budget pressures. "The jury's out on where and how 

various governing bodies will work to reduce the impact of the 

funding crisis. There are likely to be tax increases in some 

areas, but it's clear that they can't make up all of the missing 

funds." 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The company's analysis is based on information from state budget 

offices, census data, published accounts, and its own proprietary 

database of education data. It released its report today at the 

annual convention of the International Reading Association in 

Orlando, Florida. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The budget woes have a secondary impact on companies that 

provide goods and services to schools. The hardest hit districts 

are likely to restrict spending on a variety of budget items 

including books, supplementary materials, sports programs, and 

travel. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MCH Education Data -- which provides direct mail and consulting 

services to school marketers -- developed the budget pressure 

forecast to help its customers target their marketing efforts. "Our 

clients are currently planning campaigns for the fall buying 

season," Hood said. "We want to steer them toward the districts 

that are more likely to have discretionary dollars available."
