                ICELAND - April 7 -The International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW 

                - <a href="http://www.ifaw.org" target="_new">http://www.ifaw.org</a>) 

                is stunned by reports that Iceland plans to resume whaling, 13 

                years after its last harpoon was fired. It calls on the Icelandic 

                Government to think again and safeguard its growing whale-watching 

                industry -- which generated more than US$6.5 million in industry 

                related sales in 1998 alone. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Iceland has 

                revealed plans to hunt 250 whales a year for "scientific research," 

                just months after rejoining the International Whaling Commission 

                (IWC - <a href="http://www.iwcoffice.org" target="_new">http://www.iwcoffice.org</a>). 

                If it goes ahead, it will become the third country in the world, 

                after Japan and Norway, to flout an international moratorium on 

                killing whales. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Icelandic 

                whale hunt would target 100 fin and 50 sei whales, both listed 

                by the World Conservation Union as endangered species, as well 

                as 100 minke whales. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Iceland's Fisheries 

                Minister, Arni Matthiesen, says that the aim is to collect data 

                on "the impact of whales on the ocean ecosystem." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Vassili Papastavrou, 

                an IFAW whale biologist, said, "This is commercial whaling in 

                a threadbare disguise. Iceland has not yet formally announced 

                its decision to go ahead, and we urge it to look to the future, 

                which is quite clearly whale-watching rather than whaling. Whales 

                are simply worth more alive than dead." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Iceland claims 

                it will not resume commercial whaling before 2006, but Minister 

                Matthiesen says several issues need resolving, including the international 

                trade in whale products, currently banned under the Convention 

                on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He said, "The 

                Icelandic market (for whale products) is very small, hence it 

                is a precondition for any whaling around Iceland to be able to 

                export whale products to the Japanese." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Iceland joined 

                CITES in 2000 but refuses to be bound by its rules on several 

                species, including the highly endangered blue whale. It rejoined 

                the IWC in 2002, controversially making its objection to the whaling 

                ban a condition of its membership. </font>

                Your support is urgently needed to make sure that Icelandic whale
