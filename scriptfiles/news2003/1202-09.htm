- December 2 - In a letter delivered today to the office of Mike Leavitt, newly-installed Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, twenty-five member groups of the Sustainable Energy Coalition called upon him to greatly expand the agency's sustainable energy programs.</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Since most of our environmental problems are caused by our energy use, the role played by the EPA in aggressively reducing pollution in every sector is critical,&quot; according to the signers.  &quot;[Consequently,] a number of [EPA's] energy-related initiatives ... should not only be continued but strengthened and expanded.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Notably, the letter urged that the EPA seek to establish its Energy Star program as a separate line-item within the EPA budget and &quot;propose annual funding increases of 10% beginning in 2005 and continuing through 2008.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">It also encourages the EPA &quot;to actively implement the Combined Heat and Power Partnership&quot; while recommending that &quot;the Smart Travel Resource Center and the annual publication of the Fuel Economy Guide data for new automobiles ... likewise be continued but supplemented by new efforts to substantially curb transportation fuel use.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The letter's signers called upon EPA &quot;to examine new opportunities through which EPA can promote the cross-section of renewable energy technologies in addition to its current Renewable Energy Modeling Series and the Green Power Partnership [such as] using renewable energy in all EPA facilities, employing biomass-based phytoremediation technologies for waste clean-up, and clearing the way for 22% ethanol automotive blends to help address evaporative emissions concerns.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Finally, the groups urged Administrator Leavitt to &quot;take the lead in designing and helping to implement a more ambitious goal for the administration's carbon intensity policy, which, in its current configuration, will likely allow actual emissions to increase by 14 percent over the next decade.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The full text of the letter and the list of signers follows below.</FONT></P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><I>The Sustainable Energy Coalition is a coalition of 65 national and state-level business, environmental, consumer, and energy policy organizations which collectively represent several thousand companies, municipal utilities, and community organizations.

Moreover, since most of our environmental problems are caused by our energy use, the role played by the EPA in aggressively reducing pollution in every sector is critical.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Perhaps foremost among these is EPA's Energy Star program, which helps businesses and individuals reduce pollution and energy costs through the purchase of energy-efficient appliances, air conditioners, heating systems, refrigerators, computers, and other items as well as encourages the construction of energy-efficient homes and offices.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">According to the government's own figures, last year alone, Americans, with the help of Energy Star (including the Ag Star program), saved enough energy to power 10 million homes and avoid greenhouse gas emissions from 12 million cars - all while saving $6 billion.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Unfortunately, this program has recently been a target for funding cuts.  We consequently urge you to demonstrate your strong commitment to protecting and enhancing this program.  Specifically, we recommend that the EPA seek to establish this program as a separate line-item within the EPA budget and propose annual funding increases of 10% beginning in 2005 and continuing through 2008.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Likewise, we urge you to actively implement the Combined Heat and Power Partnership, which works with industry, state and local governments, universities, and other institutional users to facilitate the development of efficient combined heat and power projects and has set a goal of doubling national CHP capacity by 2010.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Other programs that promote improved fuel efficiency, such as the Smart Travel Resource Center and the annual publication of the Fuel Economy Guide data for new automobiles, should likewise be continued but supplemented by new efforts to substantially curb transportation fuel use, including a review of EPA's CAFE testing procedures.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Along the same lines, we encourage you to examine new opportunities through which EPA can promote the cross-section of renewable energy technologies in addition to its current Renewable Energy Modeling Series and the Green Power Partnership.  The latter enlists commercial, nonprofit, and public organizations to purchase a portion of their power as renewable energy, thereby reducing the emissions associated with power generation.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Additional initiatives might include using renewable energy in all EPA facilities, employing biomass-based phytoremediation technologies for waste clean-up, and clearing the way for 22% ethanol automotive blends to help address evaporative emissions concerns.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">However, a far more ambitious and absolutely necessary priority for the EPA is that of climate change caused in large part by emissions of carbon dioxide. We therefore recommend that you take the lead in designing and helping to implement a more ambitious goal for the administration's carbon intensity policy, which, in its current configuration, will likely allow actual emissions to increase by 14 percent over the next decade.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Finally, we urge you to reach out to the sustainable energy, environmental, and public health communities to solicit ideas on how to use energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies to meet the agency's goals.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">We appreciate your taking these views into consideration and would welcome the opportunity to meet with you to discuss them in further detail.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Sincerely,</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Alliance for Affordable Energy</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Alliance to Save Energy</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">American Bioenergy Association</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">American Solar Energy Society</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">American Wind Energy Association</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Bob Lawrence &amp; Associates</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Breakthrough Technologies, Inc.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Cascade Associates</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Colorado Energy Group, Inc.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Environmental &amp; Energy Study Institute</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Environmental Law and Policy Center</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Good Company Associates</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Institute for Local Self-Reliance</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">National Environmental Trust</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">New Alternatives Fund Inc.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">New Uses Council</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Northwest Sustainable Energy for Economic Development</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Nuclear Information and Resource Service</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Pellet Fuels Institute</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Solar Energy Industries Association</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Strategic Clean Energy, LLC</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Stella Group Ltd.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Union of Concerned Scientists</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">U.S. Combined Heat and Power Association</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Vermont Energy Investment Corporation</FONT></P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p></font><!-- #EndEditable --></td></tr>
