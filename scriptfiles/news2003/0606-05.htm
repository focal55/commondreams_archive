- June 6 - News Advisory:

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Physicians for Social Responsibility (PSR), a non-profit public health organization, will release a report the week of June 17, 2003 examining the public health impacts of climate change on the state of Texas, with distinguished Texas officials. The report, entitled Degrees of Danger, also details Texas' leadership potential to supply affordable, clean, renewable sources of energy, which if exploited could reverse fossil fuel-related public health concerns such as increased mercury exposure for women and children, spiking asthma rates and heat-related deaths.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Degrees of Danger, PSR explores the direct public health consequences of global climate change on the air and water of Texas. For example, nearly ninety percent of Texas' energy comes from fossil fuels, which has solidified Texas as the largest producer of carbon dioxide and unhealthy air emissions. Furthermore the state's primary sources of groundwater are already overdrawn, thus jeopardizing water supplies and quality for future generations. On the other hand, Texas has the natural, human and economic resources to reverse theses declining public health trends. By shifting to clean sources of energy like wind and biomass, not only would public health improve, but over 100,000 new jobs would be created in the state.
