                FRANCISCO - April 17 - U.S. COURT of APPEALS for the NINTH CIRCUIT 

                - Late yesterday the Court granted the hemp industry's Motion 

                to Stay the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration's (DEA's) "Final 

                Rule," which was issued March 21, 2003 and would have banned the 

                sale of nutritious hemp foods containing harmless trace amounts 

                of naturally-occurring THC under the Controlled Substances Act 

                (CSA) of 1970. This "Final Rule" is virtually identical to an 

                "Interpretive Rule" issued on October 9, 2001 that never went 

                into effect because of a Ninth Circuit Court Stay issued on March 

                7, 2002. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Both Motions 

                to Stay were brought jointly by the Hemp Industries Association 

                (HIA) and several major hemp food companies in the U.S. and Canada. 

                The court is currently hearing a substantive challenge to the 

                Final Rule, which the hemp industry is optimistic that the Court 

                will ultimately invalidate. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Because trace 

                infinitesimal THC in hemp seed is non-psychoactive and insignificant, 

                the U.S. Congress exempted non-viable hemp seed and oil from control 

                under the CSA, just as Congress exempted poppy seeds from the 

                CSA, although they contain trace opiates otherwise subject to 

                control. The hemp industry is assuring retailers and consumers 

                that hemp food products should continue to be stocked, sold and 

                consumed. Joe Sandler, counsel for the HIA, stated: "The Court's 

                order effectively prevents DEA from enforcing its 'Final Rule.' 

                With this stay in effect, all those who sell, import, manufacture, 

                distribute and retail edible hemp oil and seed, and oil and seed 

                products, can continue those activities secure in the knowledge 

                that such products remain perfectly lawful." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hemp seed has 

                a well-balanced protein content and the highest content of essential 

                fatty acids (EFAs) of any oil in nature: EFAs are the "good fats" 

                that, like vitamins, the body does not produce and requires for 

                good health. Dr. Udo Erasmus, an internationally recognized nutritional 

                authority on fats and oils, writes in Fats that Heal - Fats that 

                Kill: "Hemp seed oil may be nature's most perfectly balanced oil." 

                Not surprisingly, shelled hemp seed and oil are increasingly used 

                in natural food products, such as corn chips, nutrition bars, 

                hummus, nondairy milks, breads and cereals. In the last few years, 

                the hemp foods industry has grown from less than $1 million a 

                year to over $5 million in retail sales. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">North American 

                hemp food companies voluntarily observe reasonable THC limits 

                similar to those adopted by European nations as well as Canada 

                and Australia. These limits protect consumers with a wide margin 

                of safety from any psychoactive effects or workplace drug-testing 

                interference (see hemp industry standards regarding trace THC 

                at <a href="http://www.testpledge.com" target="_new">http://www.testpledge.com</a>). 

                The DEA has hypocritically not targeted food manufacturers for 

                using poppy seeds (in bagels and muffins, for example) even though 

                they contain far higher levels of trace opiates. The recently-revived 

                global hemp market, with retail sales of over $250 million worldwide, 

                is a thriving commercial success. Unfortunately, because the DEA's 

                Drug War paranoia has confused non-psychoactive industrial hemp 

                varieties of cannabis with psychoactive "marihuana" varieties, 

                the U.S. is the only major industrialized nation to prohibit the 

                growing of industrial hemp. </font>
