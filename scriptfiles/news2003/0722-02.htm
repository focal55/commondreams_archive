- July 22 - Floor Action Expected This Week on Sanders-Otter-Conyers Legislation To Rein In One Aspect of USA Patriot Act.

</font>

<p> </p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The House of Representatives is expected to consider an important amendment shielding library and bookstore patrons from one invasive part of the USA Patriot Act.  Section 215 of that law permits the FBI - without public scrutiny, search warrants, or even &quot;probable cause&quot; - to secretly acquire almost anything about an individual's visit to a library or bookstore, including research requests, sales records, circulation records, internet use logs and even computer hard drives.  Section 215 includes a gag order on librarians and booksellers, prohibiting them from informing patrons that they are under investigation.  The Sanders-Otter-Conyers Amendment - known as the &quot;Freedom to Read&quot; amendment - would shield library and bookstore patrons from this part of the USA Patriot Act.</font></p>

<p> </p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The USA Patriot Act poses a grave threat to the privacy and freedom of all Americans and creates a culture of fear among innocent people.  The 'Freedom to Read' amendment is an important first step in protecting privacy rights under fire since the passage of the act,&quot; said People For the American Way President Ralph G. Neas.  &quot;The very real need to protect Americans' safety and security does not require sacrificing our liberty by giving government agents unlimited power to pry into our private lives and reading habits.&quot;</font></p>

<p> </p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PFAW will continue to monitor this and other legislative efforts to restore freedoms under siege since the passage of the USA Patriot Act. We have spokespeople available to comment on the &quot;Freedom to Read&quot; amendment and other efforts to protect the rights of Americans.  Representative Bernie Sanders will hold a press conference to discuss the legislation today, Tuesday, July 22, 2003 at noon in room HC-9 of the U.S. Capitol. </font> </p>
