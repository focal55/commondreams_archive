                YORK - March 24 - Documents obtained by the American Civil Liberties 

                Union suggest that the Attorney General is aggressively wielding 

                a disturbing power that - without the approval of a judge - allows 

                the government to force banks, Internet service providers, telephone 

                companies, and credit agencies to turn over their customers’ records. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Without judicial 

                oversight, there is simply no assurance that the Attorney General 

                is using this authority in keeping with democratic principles 

                and constitutional rights," said Jameel Jaffer, an attorney with 

                the ACLU’s Technology and Liberty Program. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Information 

                about the government’s surveillance powers was obtained through 

                a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit filed jointly with 

                the Electronic Privacy Information Center and the American Booksellers 

                Foundation for Free Expression and the Freedom to Read Foundation. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to 

                documents obtained through the FOIA lawsuit, the government employs 

                "National Security Letters" - signed by Attorney General Ashcroft 

                or a delegate and with no judicial approval - to "compel the production 

                of a substantial amount of relevant information." The government 

                can use this power to obtain records about people living in the 

                United States, including American citizens, without probable cause 

                that the person has committed any crime. Entities that are forced 

                to turn over records are prohibited from disclosing to their customers 

                - or to anyone else - that the FBI has demanded the records. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The ACLU has 

                always been critical of the letters because they do not require 

                judicial review. However, said Jaffer, under the Patriot Act, 

                "the letters have become a far more invasive and nefarious tool." 

                Before the Patriot Act, Jaffer explained, National Security Letters 

                could be issued only against people who were reasonably suspected 

                of espionage. The Patriot Act allows the Attorney General to issue 

                National Security Letters even against people who are not suspected 

                of criminal activity or of acting on behalf of a foreign power. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The government 

                has refused to say how extensively it is using its authority to 

                issue the letters. But Jaffer said that the length of the blacked-out 

                lists of National Security Letters suggests that the government 

                is using this power more extensively than other surveillance powers 

                under the Patriot Act that require court approval. The ACLU has 

                created a special web feature with samples of the blacked-out 

                documents and government memos describing the new powers, online

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Other recently 

                obtained documents confirm that: </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The FBI is 

                conducting wiretaps and secret searches in criminal investigations 

                without complying with the usual probable cause requirements; 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The government 

                has begun to use an extraordinarily broad surveillance provision 

                that could be used to force libraries and bookstores to report 

                on their patrons’ and customers’ reading habits; </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The FBI is 

                aggressively using pen registers and trap-and-trace devices that 

                allow them to track phone calls and emails; </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The government 

                plans to use its new surveillance powers not only against suspected 

                terrorists but also against ordinary Americans and permanent residents.

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The ACLU explained 

                that it has challenged the government’s refusal to release a number 

                of other relevant documents, which consist principally of aggregate 

                statistical information indicating the extent to which the government 

                has relied on new surveillance powers. On Friday, the ACLU asked 

                a federal judge to order the government to release these documents, 

                saying that the information is essential to the public’s ability 

                to evaluate the new surveillance provisions and that its release 

                would not compromise national security. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a related 

                case concerning expanded government spy powers, the Supreme Court 

                today rejected a request by the ACLU and Arab-American groups 

                to review an extraordinary decision by a secret appeals court 

                that broadly expanded the government’s powers to spy on U.S. citizens.
