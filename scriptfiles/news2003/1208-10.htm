- December 8 - The International Climate Symbol is being launched during the Climate Change Conference (CoP 9) with a fashion show today by WWF, UNEP, Greenpeace and with support from the Dutch Ministry of the Environment. The new symbol, developed jointly by WWF, UNEP, Greenpeace and with financial support from the Dutch Ministry of the Environment, aims to raise awareness on climate change and to act as a common and recognizable thread in all communications concerning climate change. The fashion show launch will feature special designs incorporating the climate symbol created by the Amsterdam Fashion Institute. The unique clothing line will show how people all over the world can express their concern and help fight climate change by 'wearing' the climate symbol.</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WHEN:       Tuesday 9 December, 18:30 - 19:00 CET (Central European Time). </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WHERE:      Milan: Fiera Milano.

The effects of climate change are evident in the increasing amount of extreme weather events such as the floods and heat waves experienced this past year. Despite the known risks, global emissions of green house gases are still on the rise and the issue of climate change is still not felt in the hearts of people. The aim of this symbol is to help engage the general public much more in the climate change issue than has been done so far. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WHO:        Michael Williams, Information officer, United Nations Environment Program (UNEP). </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The President of the Climate Summit, Dr. Mikl&oacute;s Pers&aacute;nyi, Hungarian Minister of Environment and Water, has been invited to attend the event and receive one of the specially designed fashion items (to be confirmed). </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Presentation of the fashion show: Ellen Hidding (Italian TV-presenter). </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The climate symbol and additional information is available at <A HREF="http://www.saveourclimate.org" TARGET="_new">www.saveourclimate.org</A></FONT></P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p></FONT><!-- #EndEditable --></td></tr>
