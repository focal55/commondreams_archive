- May 14 - The Brady Campaign to 

Prevent Gun Violence, United with the Million Mom March, today 

urged President Bush to keep his promise to renew the federal 

assault weapons law: 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">President Bush, We Read Your Lips. Keep Your Promise. Call House 

Majority Leader Tom DeLay: 202-225-5951. Tell your Party to Protect 

Our Communities and Police Instead of Arming Killers 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During his 2000 Presidential campaign, now-President George W. 

Bush repeatedly promised to renew the Federal assault weapons law. 

But it now appears the President plans to break his promise, and 

work with House leaders to let the law die. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">That means barring a change that can only come from the 

President or a major public outcry, the American people will see 

legal sales of banned assault weapons starting in September 2004. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In today's Washington Post, a House GOP leadership aid said the 

White House doesn't want a vote on the assault weapons ban. Last 

week, key Bush advisor Karl Rove was quoted in New Hampshire saying 

the bill would never reach the President's desk. The current law 

is supported by every major police organization in the country. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The announcement that there would not be a House vote represents 

"a shameful abrogation of the responsibilities members of Congress 

were elected to undertake -- which is to do the people's work," 

said Michael Barnes, President of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun 

Violence United with the Million Mom March. "The President ought 

to pick up the phone and tell the House leadership he disagrees -- 

instead of having his staff encourage those who oppose the ban. 

Indeed, he ought to be telling them to strengthen the existing 

law." 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This is a travesty," said Mary Leigh Blek, Director of the 

Million Mom March. "If the ban expires, police will once again be 

outgunned, our children will be at further risk. Many of us voted 

for President Bush because he was willing to break with his party 

on this issue. It's troubling to think he didn't mean what he 

said." 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The facts: 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Assault weapon bans work. In 1989, when President Bush 

stopped the import of certain assault rifles, the number of 

imported assault rifles traced to crime dropped by 45 percent in 

one year. After the 1994 ban, there were 18 percent fewer assault 

weapons traced to crime in the first eight months of 1995 than were 

traced in the same period in 1994. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Assault weapons are not just "ugly guns." Semi-automatic 

assault weapons are designed to maximize death and injury from a 

very rapid rate of fire. Assault weapons are designed with military 

features such as silencers, folding stocks, flash suppressors, 

barrel shrouds and bayonets which are ludicrously unsuited for 

civilian use. In contrast, semi-automatic hunting rifles are 

designed to be fired from the shoulder and depend on the accurate 

shooting of one bullet at a time. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Assault weapons were used... 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- To kill five children and wound 29 others in a Stockton, 

California schoolyard in 1989. The AK-47 held 75 -- that's right, 

75 -- bullets. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- To kill eight people and wound six others at a San Francisco 

law firm in 1993. Two TEC-9's with 50-round magazines were used in 

the massacre. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- To kill two CIA employees and wound three others outside the 

CIA's Langley, Virginia headquarters in 1993. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- To kill four ATF special agents and wound 16 others at the 

Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas, when the officers were 

attempting to serve warrants on the cult in 1993. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence United with the 

Million Mom March supports renewal, enforcement and strengthening 

of the current law. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">President Bush -- if you want to keep your promise, the phone 

number to dial is 202-225-5951. That's the number for Rep. Tom 

DeLay, the House Majority Leader. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pick up the phone.
