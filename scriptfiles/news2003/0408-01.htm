                YORK - April 8 - The War Resisters League has just published "War 

                Tax Resistance, A Guide to Withholding Your Support from the Military," 

                which advocates the nonpayment of federal income taxes as a means 

                protest military spending. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This 144-page 

                book comes at a time when there is a dramatic upsurge in Americans 

                looking for ways to withdraw their support from the war in Iraq, 

                in addition to marches, rallies, letter-writing to elected officials, 

                and civil disobedience. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"There are 

                a lot of anti-war people in this country who feel their protests 

                against the U.S. war in Iraq are being ignored," said Ed Hedemann, 

                author of the book. "Many of these people are seeking for ways 

                to protest that cannot and will not be ignored by the government. 

                War tax resistance is one very effective way to do that." Hedemann 

                is speaking from experience as someone who has been rerouting 

                his federal tax dollars away from the IRS to nongovernmental organizations 

                continuously since the Vietnam War. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"War Tax Resistance" 

                not only deals with how to refuse to pay taxes to the military 

                and the likely consequences, but also the philosophical and political 

                questions of this kind of civil disobedience, which taxes are 

                the war taxes, the history of military spending in the United 

                States, as well as personal histories of people -- in the U.S. 

                and in other countries -- who have taken this dramatic step and 

                what has happened to them. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The publishing 

                of "War Tax Resistance" comes on the heels of the release of An 

                Appeal to Conscience, a statement whose signers announce their 

                support for those who are or will become war tax resisters. Among 

                the signers of the Appeal are Joan Baez, Father Dan Berrigan, 

                Noam Chomsky, Rev. William Sloan Coffin, Dave Dellinger, Daniel 

                Ellsberg, Bishop Thomas Gumbleton, David McReynolds, Grace Paley, 

                Howard Zinn.
