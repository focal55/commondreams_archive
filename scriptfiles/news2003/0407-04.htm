                - April 7 - The Sierra Club today strongly applauded Senator Richard 

                Durbin (D-IL) for spearheading an attempt to reduce our oil dependence 

                by making real changes to fuel economy standards. Senator Durbin 

                is introducing a bill that would require automakers to achieve 

                a fleet-wide average of 40 miles per gallon (mpg) for passenger 

                vehicles. The move comes amid heightened awareness about the role 

                of oil in U.S. foreign policy, particularly towards the Middle 

                East. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"American troops 

                are right now risking their lives in a war that is at least in 

                part about oil," said Daniel Becker, director of the Sierra Club's 

                Global Warming and Energy program. "Responsible leaders such as 

                Senator Durbin understand that we need to make ourselves less 

                reliant on oil. Raising fuel economy standards is the biggest 

                single step we can take to do that." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By raising 

                fuel economy standards to 40 mpg, the U.S. would save 3 million 

                barrels of oil a day - more than we currently import from the 

                Persian Gulf, and could hope to get from the Arctic Refuge, combined. 

                Cutting our oil consumption would improve national security, reduce 

                global warming pollution, and save consumers money at the gas 

                pump as gas prices continue to skyrocket. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Automakers 

                have the technology to comfortably get to 40 mpg. By adding existing 

                components like the integrated starter generator, and the variable 

                valve control engine, they could significantly improve the fuel 

                economy of all cars, trucks, and SUVs, without compromising performance, 

                safety, or affordability. These fuel-saving technologies are already 

                being used successfully on select models. Making these technologies 

                standard would allow automakers to meet a 40 mpg requirement, 

                and would put the U.S. auto industry at the forefront of the race 

                for fuel efficient vehicles. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Today's attempt 

                to raise fuel economy standards comes almost a year after Congress 

                caved to an aggressive lobbying effort by the automakers by rejecting 

                a similar proposal. Since that time, a spike in gas prices and 

                war in the Persian Gulf have placed a renewed focus on the need 

                to reduce our oil consumption. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Senator Durbin 

                deserves immense credit for putting the long-term interests of 

                national security and the environment over the short-term interests 

                of automakers," continued Becker.
