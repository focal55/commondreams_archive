                - March 13 - Flouting a decision by the United States Supreme 

                Court that found a ban on so-called "partial-birth abortion" to 

                be unconstitutional, the U.S. Senate today passed a nearly identical 

                version of the abortion ban (S.3) in a 65-32 vote. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Today, the 

                Senate passed a law that they know is unconstitutional and endangers 

                women's health," said Nancy Northup, president of the Center for 

                Reproductive Rights, which won the Supreme Court case striking 

                down a similar abortion ban three years ago. "Supporters of this 

                bill refused not only to cure the flaws pointed out by Supreme 

                Court, but also failed to pass an amendment to help prevent pregnancies 

                in the first place. More than anything else, these actions demonstrate 

                that the bill's supporters care more about banning abortions than 

                upholding the Constitution or protecting women's health." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">President Bush 

                has publicly committed to signing the ban into law once it passes 

                Congress, as is expected. The Center for Reproductive Rights previously 

                announced that it intended to take the Bush Administration to 

                court to block enforcement of the ban as soon as it is enacted. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although proponents 

                of the ban claim that only "late-term" abortions would be prohibited, 

                the Center's legal and medical experts affirm that the ban would 

                outlaw use of the safest and most common pre-viability abortion 

                procedure used after the first trimester of pregnancy - dilation 

                and evacuation (D&E). </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Just three 

                years ago, in Stenberg v. Carhart, the U.S. Supreme Court found 

                Nebraska's so-called "partial-birth abortion" ban to be an unconstitutional 

                threat to women's health and lives. The Justices struck down the 

                ban for two reasons: first, the ban would have prevented women 

                from obtaining the safest methods of abortion; second, it lacked 

                an exception in cases where the health of the mother was in jeopardy. 

                The bill passed by the Senate today fails to remedy these flaws.
