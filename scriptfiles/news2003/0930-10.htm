- September 30 - Americans for Democratic Action (ADA), the nation's oldest independent liberal political organization, calls for an independent investigation into role of Bush Administration officials in revealing the identity of a CIA operative.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This kind of reckless behavior for political motivations is unacceptable and made even more so by the potential threat to human life and national security. &quot;The White House is playing a dangerous and malicious game. The time has come to take the gloves off and hold the Bush Administration accountable,&quot; says ADA National Director Amy Isaacs. As the President's father, President George H.W. Bush, described it in 1999, &quot;I have nothing but contempt and anger for those who betray the trust by exposing the name of our sources. They are, in my view, the most insidious, of traitors.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Isaacs also stressed that this incident is only the latest in a long line of unprofessional and damaging policy coming out of the White House. &quot;With 3.2 million jobs lost, 3.4 million more Americans in poverty, and 4.9 million more people without health insurance, the Bush presidency is on its way to new lows. Where's the accountability? Some heads need to roll,&quot; continued Isaacs.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The United States is losing its standing in the world because of Bush Administration blunders. By continually misrepresenting the facts about Iraq

-- weapons of mass destruction, the imminent threat to the United States, links to the 9/11 disasters -- the Bush Administration has put the United States in a dangerous diplomatic situation. Our once enthusiastic allies now doubt our motives and are reluctant to provide resources and support to help clean up a mess we created.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Last week, ADA called for the removal of Defense Secretary Rumsfeld and Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz. Mr. Rumsfeld and Mr. Wolfowitz repeatedly hinder the United States by their arrogant handling of relations with foreign leaders. Their collective words and actions have served only to enflame an already volatile situation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now we call for an investigation into the disappearance of a responsible and productive Executive Branch. Where are the Emperor's clothes? It's past time to employ new tailors.</font></p>
