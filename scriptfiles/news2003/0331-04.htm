                - March 31 - The Environmental Protection Agency today is holding 

                five public hearings about proposed changes to the Clean Air Act, 

                soliciting comments from the public about a plan to weaken protections 

                that require polluting industries to improve pollution controls 

                when upgrading their plants. </font> 

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The 

                  new regulations will allow corporations to spend tens of millions 

                  of dollars modifying power plants and other industrial smokestacks 

                  without requiring them to improve pollution controls-no matter 

                  how much pollution increases because of the modifications,&quot; 

                  said Joy Oakes, spokesman for the National Parks Conservation 

                  Association. &quot;That means more pollution harming our national 

                  parks, park visitors, and people across the country. Most Americans 

                  want clean air laws to be enforced, not weakened. Yet the administration 

                  already has weakened existing protections, and now proposes 

                  even more. If the administration continues to ignore public 

                  opposition to weakening clean air programs, these public hearings 

                  are nothing more than an elaborate April Fool's joke on the 

                  American people.&quot; </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The proposed 

                  changes to the New Source Review program (NSR) represent the 

                  most dramatic rollback of clean-air laws to date. NSR requires 

                  coal-fired power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants, and 

                  other large polluting facilities to adopt modern pollution controls 

                  and to examine impacts on downwind populated areas and national 

                  parks before undertaking actions that would otherwise increase 

                  the amount of pollution that the facilities release. Under the 

                  proposed rule changes, facilities will no longer be required 

                  to install modern pollution controls regardless of any emissions 

                  increases as long as they satisfy either of two permissive conditions. 

                  First, structural alterations will not trigger the control requirements 

                  if the cost of making the changes is less than a certain percentage 

                  of the cost of the entire facility. Second, no modern pollution 

                  controls will be mandated, regardless of cost, if the change 

                  can be portrayed as the replacement of one piece of equipment 

                  with another piece of equipment that serves the same function, 

                  even if pollution increases as a result. </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Air pollution 

                  from the few dozen industries sued by the Department of Justice 

                  in 1999 for violating the long-standing NSR program are responsible 

                  for as many as 7,000 premature deaths and 170,000 asthma attacks 

                  yearly. Approximately 17,000 industrial sources currently are 

                  subject to the program's requirements. &quot;Congress gave industries 

                  time to phase in necessary controls when it strengthened the 

                  law 25 years ago,&quot; Oakes said. &quot;National parks and 

                  communities continue to suffer from the effects of pollution. 

                  To rewrite the laws meant to protect people and parks, and to 

                  allow overhauls of old facilities without installation of state-of-the-art 

                  pollution controls, violates the public trust. So far, EPA has 

                  weakened the law and is protecting polluters, not people and 

                  parks. We urge EPA to hear the public's concerns, and choose 

                  to protect and enforce existing clean air programs, not weaken 

                  them.&quot; </font></p>
