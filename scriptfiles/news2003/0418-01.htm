                  less than 24 hours after issuing a press release highlighting 

                  the apparent failures of the U.S. military's humanitarian operations 

                  in Iraq, the international group Voices in the Wilderness was 

                  banned from meeting with the U.S. Civil Military Operations 

                  Center or with international journalists at the Palestine Hotel 

                  in Baghdad. The group asks: &quot;If the freedom to critique 

                  U.S. policies in Iraq regarding humanitarian issues is being 

                  curtailed already, then exactly what does this mean for building

                  in the Wilderness representatives met today with the U.S. Military's 

                  Civil Military Operations Center in their headquarters at the 

                  Palestine Hotel to discuss the emergency, humanitarian crisis 

                  facing Baghdad. Trash removal has not occurred for a month. 

                  Electricity, sanitation and communications were all seriously 

                  damaged during the U.S. war, and have yet to be restored in 

                  Baghdad. Cholera outbreaks have been reported in Basra, and 

                  rumored to have been found in the central Iraqi city of Hilla. 

                  Some of the local clinics are up and running, but medications 

                  for conditions such as hypertension and diabetes are no longer 

                  available. Quality control equipment and systems are also unavailable, 

                  and the lack of quality control could lead to serious problems 

                  in treatment, as well as creating the potential for epidemics 

                  due to contaminated blood products. The previous distribution 

                  system set up under the &quot;Oil-for-Food&quot; program is 

                  in total collapse, and -- unless essential services are immediately 

                  restored -- Iraq faces a humanitarian catastrophe....&quot;</font></p>

                  Communications director of the Institute for Public Accuracy, 

                  Husseini said today: &quot;Paul Wolfowitz yesterday called for 

                  the ending of the economic sanctions, saying that the Iraqi 

                  people 'have suffered enough.' Now, this is quite an admission. 

                  While some protested for years about the economic sanctions 

                  because of the hundreds of thousands of Iraqi deaths they caused, 

                  the U.S. government continuously responded that it was Saddam 

                  Hussein's regime and not the sanctions that was to blame for 

                  the suffering of the Iraqi people. Now that it's convenient 

                  for them, the Bush administration is moving to lift the sanctions 

                  immediately. Given the belated admission by the U.S. government 

                  of the effects of the sanctions, we must come to grips with 

                  the realization that the U.S. government has conducted a nearly 

                  13-year war of military and economic warfare against Iraq. This 

                  siege of a civilian population, as a matter of U.S. policy, 

                  was maintained regardless of the conduct of the Iraqi regime 

                  and so violated U.N. Security Council resolution 687, which 

                  stipulated that the economic sanctions should be lifted when 

                  Iraq was verified to be free of weapons of mass destruction, 

                  a subject the Bush administration seems to have suddenly lost 

                  interest in.&quot;<br>
