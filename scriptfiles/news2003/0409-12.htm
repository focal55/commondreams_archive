                - April 9 -The Internet Journal TomPaine.com today ridiculed House 

                Majority Leader Tom DeLay's statement that "Nothing is more important 

                in the face of war than cutting taxes." The Opinion Ad continued, 

                "Crazy? Yes. But that's Tom DeLay. He's demonstrating the twisted 

                allegiance that now dominates Washington - tax cuts for the wealthy 

                before all other needs." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The ad - the 

                latest in the journal's ongoing series - points out that it's 

                not just Tom DeLay who has a bizarre view of what's important 

                today: "You can see it in President Bush's agenda, and in the 

                budget just passed by the House: huge tax cuts for millionaires, 

                corporations and investors, funded by deep cuts in programs for 

                needy Americans - Medicaid, food stamps, school lunches and, even 

                in the midst of war, benefit cuts for veterans. It's obscene." 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DeLay's comment, 

                TomPaine.com notes, is in keeping with other proponents of the 

                extreme tax-cut ideology. For example, Grover Norquist of Americans 

                for Tax Reform has said that he wants to shrink government until 

                "we can drown it in the bathtub." Dan Mitchell of the Heritage 

                Foundation has compared tax evaders to civil rights leader Rosa 

                Parks while lobbying to preserve tax havens used by wealthy Americans 

                to avoid paying their fair share. Stephen Moore of the Club for 

                Growth has said, railing against Social Security, "One of the 

                biggest myths in politics today is this idea that grandparents 

                care about their grandkids." </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TomPaine.com 

                charges that "If they didn't push such an agenda, Moore, Mitchell, 

                Norquist and their ilk wouldn't get financial support from Microsoft, 

                GM, Ford, Dow, GTE, American Express and other leading compabies. 

                They'd be out on the fringe instead of at the center of power 

                ... And Tom DeLay, a former exterminator, might still be stomping 

                roaches in Texas. " </font>
