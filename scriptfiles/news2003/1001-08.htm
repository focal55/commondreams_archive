<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">CAMBRIDGE, MA - October 1 - The Progressive Government Project today announced the launch of their new Web site, <a href="http://www.progressivegovernment.org" target="_new">www.progressivegovernment.org</a> . The Progressive Government Project, deepens public understanding about the executive branch of the federal government and offers an in-depth online resource designed to educate Americans about the power and impact of presidential appointees.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Progressive Government Project&#146;s user-friendly guide to the executive branch currently provides detailed job descriptions and salaries of the top 300 presidential appointments with plans to add many hundreds more, as well as biographies of the people who currently serve in those positions.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Very few people understand the critical decision-making role played by un-elected bureaucrats,&#148; said the Progressive Government Project Founder  Dal LaMagna.  &#147;From family planning to environmental protection, worker&#146;s rights to student loans, these people have a significant influence over the policies that the current administration enacts. Our goal is to inform the public about a part of the government that is rarely subject to the level of scrutiny  that elected officials are, despite the fact that they often have a comparable amount of influence and authority. We want to make the operation of the government transparent to all Americans.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;This exciting new Web site will be a great tool, not only for concerned citizens, but for students, journalists and policymakers,&#148; said board member Frank Suttell. &#147;Few resources exist to educate concerned citizens about the policy-making process in the executive branch, inform them of critical decisions being made, or give them a voice in the process.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Progressive Government Project is also establishing an ideal presidential Cabinet - a shadow government - composed of notable spokespeople that offer original policy viewpoints based on a fresh progressive platform.  Visit <a href="http://www.progressivegovernment.org" target="_new">www.progressivegovernment.org</a> for more information.
