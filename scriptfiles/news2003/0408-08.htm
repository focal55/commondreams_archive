                YORK - April 8 - A new report by the Center for Economic and Social 

                Rights (CESR), "Water under Siege in Iraq," examines the possibility 

                that the United States and United Kingdom may commit war crimes 

                by depriving Iraqi civilians of safe water. In urban centers throughout 

                southern and central Iraq, millions of civilians face disease 

                and possible death due to inadequate access to water as a result 

                of the US-British invasion. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">100,000 children 

                in Basra are already threatened with severe illness due to a crippled 

                water treatment plant, according to UNICEF. As American troops 

                advance on Baghdad, the city of five million has lost electric 

                power and the population there also faces a pubic health crisis 

                from water-borne disease. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"International 

                law on this matter is unambiguous--depriving people of life-sustaining 

                resources is a war crime," said Roger Normand, Executive Director 

                of CESR. "While President Bush has warned Iraqis not to commit 

                war crimes, Anglo-American forces at the gates of Baghdad risk 

                committing war crimes themselves against a population that is 

                half children." </font>
