- June 25 - The Green Party of the United States today expressed outrage at the latest in a long string of lies about human-induced climate change. The EPA's June 23rd Report on the Environment has been so significantly altered by the Bush Administration, that an internal EPA memo, dated April 29, stated in part &quot;The Bush Administration changes watered down the language to the point where it no longer accurately reflects the scientific consensus on climate change&quot; (NBC Nightly News, June 19). </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The officials within the Bush Administration are not climatologists, and have no sound reason for denying the scientific expertise in the initial EPA report. By meddling in this report, they show an overt bias in favor of their close friends in the oil business,&quot; said Kirstin Marr, Colorado Green Party State Media Director and spokesperson.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

 

Greens encourage Senator Jeffords and other members of the Senate Environment and Public Works committee's initial inquiry for the original climate portions of the EPA report. This administration is so bold and so wrong; a true opposition party is needed to raise the U.S. public's awareness about Bush's behind-the-scenes work. This is a true test of the major political players in Congress who among them is willing to fight for our environment?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Over 1,500 scientists representing many countries have been working, using consensus, for nearly two decades on the realities of climate change. Using many different sources of data including ice core samples, the Keeling Curve, and the changing patterns of El Nino and La Nina, scientists have been able to confirm the rapid rise in the global temperature over the past 150 years. The industrial revolution has created a variance in the global temperature beyond any naturally occurring climate changes, including recurring ice ages.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It is outrageous that since we are either at war or threatening most of the oil-producing countries, the Bush Administration is running away in a polluted sea of denial from the need to diminish our heavy dependence on oil,&quot; said Mark Dunlea, Chair, Green Party of New York State.</font></p>
