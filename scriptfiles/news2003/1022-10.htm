<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 
- October 22 - Statement of Joan Claybrook, President, Public Citizen.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We are relieved that enough Senate lawmakers today saw the class action bill for what it was &#150; a boon to big business but a dreadful measure for consumers, who would have found significant roadblocks when attempting to have their day in court. The opponents of this anti-consumer bill were subjected to incredible pressure from the biggest business lobbies in the nation as well as the White House. We commend them for stopping a bill that would have closed the courthouse door on millions of consumers.</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The bill would have given corporate defendants an undue advantage in fighting legitimate lawsuits involving consumer fraud and unfair workplace practices. Today&#146;s narrow vote means that consumers and workers will retain strong protections against the growing abuses they face.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This rebuke to the business lobby came because it was unwilling to negotiate in good faith. This failure gave lie to the contention that the bill was a bipartisan effort to improve the legal system. A fair compromise was proposed by Sen. John Breaux (D-La.) that would have benefited both businesses and consumers, and the bill&#146;s proponents were foolish to spurn it.</font></p>
