                9 - Rebuilding Homes, an organization which works with both Israeli 

                and Palestinian citizens to rebuild Palestinian homes demolished 

                by Israeli Defense Forces, has announced the launch of its Rapid 

                Response Rebuilding Program in cooperation with the Israeli Committee 

                Against House Demolitions (ICAHD). The announcement comes on the 

                heels of 16 new demolitions in the Jerusalem area on April 3, 

                including the home of Salim Shawamreh, an ICAHD spokesperson.

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"We had no 

                notice. Families were prevented from removing belongings," said 

                Shawamreh. "Though I've never been charged with any crime, this 

                is the fourth time my home is demolished by the IDF. Nevertheless, 

                we will keep rebuilding to let the world know that our families 

                have a right to live on the land we own. With help from all who 

                care, we will start rebuilding as fast as they demolish. We refuse 

                to be enemies." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With the 90 

                Palestinian homes demolished in the past 3 months, the Rapid Response 

                Rebuilding Program is designed to bring world-wide attention to 

                Israel's policy of demolishing Palestinian homes. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Only a small 

                percentage of demolitions are related to Israeli security-related 

                issues," said Donna Baranski-Walker, Campaign Manager of Rebuilding 

                Homes. "The practice is designed to break the Palestinian spirit 

                and family structure. Rebuilding Homes asks people worldwide to 

                support the Rapid Response Rebuilding program to encourage Palestinians 

                and Israelis who are working together, nonviolently and constructively, 

                for a just peace. We are mobilizing now to begin immediately rebuilding 

                Mr. Shawamreh's home and clear debris from 5 other homesites."

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In each rebuilding 

                effort, Rebuilding Homes, ICAHD, and Palestinian partner the Jerusalem 

                Center for Social and Economic Rights, recruits Israelis to work 

                hand-in-hand with Palestinians to foster solidarity between the 

                two peoples. "Of course our goal is to rebuild homes," said Fred 

                Schlomka, ICAHD Operations Manager, "But we're mainly a political 

                organization. Each rebuilding day brings both sides to work together, 

                eat together, and plan next steps. With worldwide support, we'll 

                stop the bulldozers and build momentum for a just peace." </font>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Fellowship 

                of Reconciliation supports the Rebuilding Homes Campaign and ICAHD 

                through its Middle East Interfaith Peace-Builders program. Our 

                Middle East delegations meet regularly with ICAHD and have visited 

                families whose homes have been demolished. The work of ICAHD and 

                the Rebuilding Homes Campaign is a good example of efforts of 

                reconciliation in the conflict as they reach across borders to 

                work with Palestinians. </font>
