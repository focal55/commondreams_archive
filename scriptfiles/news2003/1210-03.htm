- December 10 - While upholding restrictions on soft money and political advertising, the Supreme Court's failure today to strike down McCain-Feingold's radical increases in hard money contribution limits ensures that wealthy donors will continue to strongly influence who runs for office and who wins elections in the United States, according to the organizational plaintiffs in the Adams v. FEC case that challenged these increases.</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Represented by the National Voting Rights Institute, CALPIRG, MASSPIRG, NJPIRG, U.S. PIRG, ACORN, and The Fannie Lou Hamer Project were joined by non-wealthy voters and candidates in challenging the increases in hard money contribution limits of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (BCRA).  The suit charged that these increases deny non-wealthy Americans equal participation in the political process, and therefore violate the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The Court has turned a blind eye to the interests of non-wealthy voters,&quot; said the state PIRGs' Democracy Advocate Dana Mason.  &quot;The concerns of ordinary Americans, whose voices are drowned out by those who can write $2,000 checks, fell on deaf ears when the Court upheld the increase in hard money limits.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The increased contribution limits are already having a significant impact on the current presidential campaign.  Candidates in the 2004 presidential elections have raised nearly 30% of their funds from contributions that would have been illegal before BCRA doubled individual contribution limits, according to a U.S. PIRG analysis.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Yet very few Americans are able to afford these sizeable donations.  Only 0.11% of the voting age population contributed sums of at least $1,000 to a 2002 congressional candidate, but these large contributions accounted for 55.5% of the candidates' individual fundraising.  In light of these observations, the reform groups strongly protested the Court's decision.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The Supreme Court has overlooked the will of common Americans, and ruled in the interest of the wealthiest few in this country,&quot; said ACORN National President Maude Hurd.  &quot;The Court has missed another opportunity to speak for all of us.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Not only do the reform groups assert that McCain-Feingold excludes non-wealthy Americans from the electoral process, but they also point to the doubling of contribution limits from $1,000 to $2,000 under the new law as a major factor in the current breakdown of the presidential public financing system.  As candidates are able to raise more money from fewer donors, it is much easier to surpass the voluntary spending limits.  When, as occurred in the 2002 congressional elections, 94% of the candidates who raise the most money win the general elections, candidates can ill afford to fall behind in the fundraising race.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The reform groups applauded the Court for upholding the restrictions on soft money and political advertising.  On behalf of the organizational plaintiffs in the Adams case, the National Voting Rights Institute filed a separate friend-of-the-court brief in support of the soft money restrictions.  The reform groups point out, however, that the decision to uphold those provisions of the law is completely undermined by the Court's failure to strike down the increase in the hard money limits.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In upholding the restrictions on soft money and political advertising, the Court cited &quot;the ill effects of aggregated wealth on our political system.&quot; Yet, the reform groups say, those &quot;ill effects of aggregated wealth&quot; will be exacerbated by the hard money increases, particularly given the dominant practice of elite donors bundling hard money contributions to their favored political candidates.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;While McCain-Feingold makes a step towards returning the election system to ordinary Americans with one hand,&quot; noted the state PIRGs' Senior Democracy Advocate Adam Lioz, &quot;the doubling of hard money limits effectively removes it from our reach again with the other.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Given that the Court has declined to uphold standards of fairness and equal participation in the electoral system, the groups renewed their call to Americans to demand an overhaul of the current campaign finance system.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Instead of dramatically increasing contribution limits, our lawmakers should enact real reform that includes both lowering the limits to levels that average Americans can afford and increasing the public financing of elections,&quot; said Mason.  &quot;Such reforms would put us on the path to making elections into contests of ideas rather than financial arms races fueled by the wealthy.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;History will prove us right,&quot; said John C. Bonifaz, NVRI's executive director and lead counsel for the plaintiffs.  &quot;In 1937 and in 1951, the United States Supreme Court upheld the poll tax as constitutional, allowing an electoral barrier to poor voters to exist in this country for decades. But those rulings did not stand the test of time.  The constitutional promise of political equality eventually prevailed and the poll tax barrier was eliminated.  The Court's ruling today upholding the hard money increases violates that same constitutional promise and will eventually be proven wrong.&quot;</FONT></P><P></P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p></font><!-- #EndEditable --></td></tr>
