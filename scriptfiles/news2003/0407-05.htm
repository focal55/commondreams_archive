                IRELAND - April 7 -The leader of Northern Ireland's trade union 

                movement has accused George Bush and Tony Blair of staggering 

                hypocrisy over Northern Ireland's 'War Summit'. Politicians claim 

                to talk peace while plotting the destruction of Baghdad and the 

                occupation of Iraq. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Peter Bunting, 

                Assistant General Secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions 

                (ICTU) said today: </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Everyone in 

                Northern Ireland wants lasting peace and we appreciate past and 

                present-day encouragement from the United States in reaching that 

                goal. But Tony Blair and George Bush know no shame in holding 

                a 'War Summit' in a city racked by conflict and struggling for 

                peace. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To have President 

                Bush and Tony Blair talk peace to Northern Ireland politicians 

                while plotting the destruction of Baghdad and the occupation of 

                Iraq is the ultimate in hypocrisy. We want peace, not just for 

                the people of Northern Ireland, but also for the people of Iraq. 

                Unfortunately President Bush has another fate for them in mind 

                - death and destruction from air and land. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Our own experience 

                in Northern Ireland shows that peace can only be achieved through 

                dialogue and not bullets, bombs, or pre emptive strikes. We would 

                question if this Belfast visit is in support of peace or more 

                likely because of the wide spread opposition to the war throughout 

                the UK that this summit could not be held in London or any other 

                city in Great Britain." </font>

                Ireland Committee of the ICTU is co-ordinating the Stop the War 

                Coalition and has announced plans for what it expects to be Northern 

                Ireland's biggest ever anti-war rally following George Bush's 

                announcement that he and Tony Blair are holding a 'War Summit' 

                in Belfast. Organisers of the two massive Belfast peace march 

                and rally, now say that they expect thousands to demonstrate across 

                Northern Ireland following Bush's arrival in Belfast. </font>

                of Belfast and Northern Ireland can join the millions around the 

                world in showing their opposition to the war and this latest conspiracy 

                of hypocrisy . Busses will be leaving from Belfast, L'Derry, and
