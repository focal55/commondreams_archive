- June 19 - Common Cause and Free Press, two groups that have worked together in recent months to make an issue of the impact of media ownership decisions on American democracy, applaud today&#146;s actions of the Senate Commerce Committee in approving bipartisan legislation that will roll back the Federal Communications Commission&#146;s June 2 vote that relaxed media ownership rules.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The Commerce Committee&#146;s vote today is essential to ensure the American public receives its news from a variety of independent sources and not from a handful of media moguls,&#148; said Chellie Pingree, president of Common Cause.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;This is the first time in decades that Congress has stood up to the powerful media lobbies and acted to defend freedom of the press,&#148; said Free Press co-founder Robert McChesney. &#147;Jefferson and Madison would be proud of our Senators for taking a stand.&#148; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If passed by Congress, as amended today, S.1046, the &#147;Preservation of Localism, Program Diversity, and Competition in Television Broadcast Act of 2003,&#148; will preserve the rule that restricts one company to owning television stations that reach no more than 35 percent of U.S. TV households.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A bipartisan amendment sponsored by Senators Dorgan, Snowe and Hutchinson will also prevent one company from owning a broadcast station and a newspaper in the same market or a radio station and TV station in the same market. An amendment added by Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-CA) also passed, responding to the closed process conducted by the FCC before the June 2 vote. The amendment will require the FCC to hold at least five geographically diverse formal public hearings the next time an ownership rule change comes up for consideration.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the weeks before the FCC&#146;s vote, more than three-quarters of a million people showed their opposition to the rule changes by sending their comments to the FCC. An unusual coalition of groups--from Common Cause to the National Rifle Association--joined together concerned about media deregulation. After the FCC decision, hundreds of thousands of Americans told members of the Senate Commerce Committee to roll back the rule changes.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Our founding fathers would be prouder still of the hundreds of thousands of Americans who communicated first with the FCC and then with Congress to say that we will no longer accept decisions made behind closed doors without our knowledge and informed consent,&#148; said McChesney.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;While Common Cause and Free Press praise the Commerce Committee and are encouraged by the Senate&#146;s action, this is only the first step in giving the airwaves back to the public,&#148; said Pingree. &#147;We need the support of the House of Representatives to overturn the changes made by the FCC.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Whatever the end result of today&#146;s legislation, a new era has begun. A diverse and independent media is integral to a healthy democracy, and people know it. The media has become an issue in America.</font></p>
