<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">SACRAMENTO, CA - September 21 - Sacramento &#150; A group of leading California environmental organizations &#150; Sierra Club

California, the California League of Conservation Voters and Vote the Coast -- responded

today to Arnold Schwarzenegger&#146;s pending environmental statement scheduled for

Sunday in Santa Barbara, warning voters that the lack of a record to measure him by pits

his statements against his personal choices.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#147;Schwarzenegger is not the environmental candidate in this race. He has no record, no



experience making tough choices,&#148; said Rico Mastrodonato, executive director of the

California League of Conservation Voters (CLCV). &#147;When it comes to candidates who

don&#146;t have a record, voters need to look at the company they keep. The majority of

Schwarzenegger&#146;s closest advisors are the same people who worked for former Governor

Wilson, who spent 8 years attacking our air, water and coast.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

The grassroots groups noted that Schwarzenegger did not respond to their invitation to

participate in an environmental endorsement process. The groups make voting

recommendations to voters after evaluating candidates through a process that includes

research on candidates&#146; environmental records, a standard questionnaire that seeks

candidates&#146; answers on current environmental issues, and an in-person interview.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

Schwarzenegger is expected to announce this weekend a proposal to set up a hydrogen&#147;super-highway.&#148;&#147;The hydrogen economy claim is an attempt to dodge the real issues. It is at least 20

years away. We need real pollution reduction now, and we can get them from a variety of

fuel efficiency, and clean vehicle technologies that exist today,&#148; added Mastrodonato.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

The groups said Schwartzenegger&#146;s late day conversion raises questions about his past

behavior. Schwarzennegger is the most well known public face associated with the gas

guzzling Hummer. They noted that his ties to the &#147;urban tank&#148; and the owner of the

company that manufactures it are cause for concern. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">AM General, the manufacturer of

the Hummer is owned by Ira Rennert of the privately held Renco Group. Rennert who

has been labeled &#147;the biggest polluter in America,&#148; owns a host of companies currently

being sued by the federal EPA for gross pollution violations. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Schwarzenegger claims that

he receives no monetary compensation based on his promotion of the Hummer, though

acknowledges Hummer has donated to his favorite charities; one charity received $13.5

million dollars in 2001. However, the financial disclosure forms Schwarzenegger filed for

Classic Productions in 2002 list Hummer as a source of income over $10,000</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.&#147;Schwarzenegger is responsible for glorifying the gas-guzzling Hummer to the American

public. While environmental groups were working to make cars get better gas mileage in

order to combat global warming, Schwarzenegger was essentially sending the automobile

industry in the opposite direction,&#148; said Susan Jordan, legislative liaison of Vote the

Coast. &#147;The reality is that he may be able to spend the money to retrofit his own

Hummer, but it is questionable whether an affordable technology is there to change the

entire fleet in the near future.&#148;

</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The groups are united in their opposition to the recall of Governor Davis, and warn

voters that a recall could point to oil drilling off the coast, smog in the air and toxins in

drinking water. Last week the groups announced they are supporting Cruz Bustamante

for the second part of the ballot.&#147;If you care about your health, if you care about the environment you will vote &#147;No&#148; on

the recall of Governor Davis and &#147;Yes&#148; for Cruz Bustamante,&#148; said Bill Magavern,

legislative representative for Sierra Club California. &#147;In the event the recall is successful,

we support Cruz Bustamante because he is the only candidate with a real record and

experience to safeguard California&#146;s air, water and coast.&#148;</font></p>
