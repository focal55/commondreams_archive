- December 9 - Today Dr. William F. Schulz, executive director of Amnesty International USA, released the following statement regarding a Pennsylvania man who is the 112th innocent person exonerated from death row in United States since 1973: &quot;The United States has come very close to freeing-on average- almost one innocent person from death row every month in 2003. What further evidence is needed to demonstrate that our judicial system is so fundamentally flawed that public officials cannot guarantee that innocent people are not being put to death?</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;This exoneration further confirms that the death penalty system is utterly defective and fallible at its most fundamental level. As evidenced by numerous cases, the system is biased, arbitrary, and riddled with multiple errors that render it a useless anachronism. Moreover, the release of 111 people previously freed from death row has already convinced more than 80 percent of the US public as well as many public officials that one or more innocent people may well have been executed in the last few years. Given this likelihood and the multitude of problems associated with the death penalty, US governors should call for a halt to all executions or risk the very real potential of sending an innocent person to his or her death. To do anything less would be unconscionable.&quot; </FONT></P><P></P><P></P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p></FONT><!-- #EndEditable --></td></tr>
