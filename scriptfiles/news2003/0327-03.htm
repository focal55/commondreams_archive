                - March 27 - Responding to the exploding humanitarian crisis facing 

                innocent children and adults in war-torn Iraq, 8,400 Internet 

                users donated more than $641,000 in just six days via the Web 

                to a humanitarian relief fund organized by Oxfam America. MoveOn.org 

                sent out an email Friday night encouraging its list of more than 

                2 million activists to donate to Oxfam via its website at <a href="http://www.oxfamamerica.org" target="_new">http://www.oxfamamerica.org</a>.

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Before the 

                war even started, nearly a half a million Iraqi children suffered 

                from malnutrition and more than 16 million Iraqi people rely on 

                limited food supplies from the United Nations," said Raymond C. 

                Offenheiser, president of Oxfam America. "Now that war is underway, 

                food distribution has stopped and access to clean water has become 

                increasingly difficult. We know from the last Gulf War that most 

                civilians died from cholera and other diseases related to dirty 

                water." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Thousands 

                of Americans have responded to the challenge to ensure sufficient 

                food, clean water, temporary housing and medical supplies are 

                available," added Offenheiser. "This unprecedented outpouring 

                of support via the Internet will go far in aiding the innocents 

                caught in this conflict." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Oxfam has been 

                hard at work to prepare camps for possible refugee flows along 

                the border of Iraq. Camp Ruweishid, in Jordan, is already up and 

                running with full water and sanitation capabilities for 10,000 

                people. Working under the auspices of the UN at all times, Oxfam 

                is also equipping camps in Iran and Syria. Oxfam engineers are 

                also busy training other UN staff. Oxfam is poised to enter Iraq 

                as soon as it is safe. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"We have just 

                scratched the surface in the depth of relief needed while the 

                war wages on. When the war ends, it will take a monumental effort 

                just to begin repairing and rebuilding the lives of millions of 

                children, families and senior citizens in Iraq," Offenheiser concluded. 

                "We now know the Internet can be a major tool to raise funds for 

                the major humanitarian work to come."
