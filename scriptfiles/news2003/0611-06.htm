- June 11 - Human rights and environmental groups today asked Toby Keith, (country music superstar, Dixie Chicks nemesis, and 'angry American') to drop his lucrative Ford sponsorship and cancel his appearance at Ford&sup1;s 100th Anniversary Celebration, June 15. The groups have also launched a web site, <a href="http://www.StopTobyKeith.com" target="_new">StopTobyKeith.com</a>, to gather thousands of signatures from Keith fans from around the country for their petition.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In an open letter to the Oklahoma-based country music superstar the groups wrote, &quot;Unfortunately, your association with Ford Motor Company threatens to undermine your reputation as a patriotic American. By working for Ford you are sending the message that you care more about your lucrative sponsorship than you do about American workers.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ford executives hired Toby Keith to sing at its five-day centennial blow-out in Dearborn, Michigan, June 12&shy;16. Rainforest Action Network, Global Exchange and Blue Water Network sent the letter on June 10, 2003 to Toby Keith, care of Dream Works Records in Nashville, TN.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Bill Ford Jr. is on the wrong side of an issue that defines our times,&quot; said Mike Brune. &quot;Our addiction to oil threatens our safety and our environment. Toby Keith should listen to what Americans are saying and cancel his association with Ford.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The groups argue that Ford has tried to position itself as an environmental leader while repeatedly breaking its commitments to produce cleaner and more efficient cars. The National Academy of Sciences concluded that current off-the-shelf technology could significantly boost fuel efficiency. Other studies have found that a jump to 40mpg is easily achievable, and that a jump to 60 mpg is can be made with full hybrid engines.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Toby Keith is at the height of his career,&quot; said Jason Mark of Global Exchange. &quot;He should think long and hard about whether he wants to be associated with a company that fuels America&sup1;s addiction to oil.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Russell Long, Executive Director of Bluewater Network, said, &quot;Bill Ford broke his promise to the nation to increase SUV fuel mileage, leading to more pollution and greater harm to people's health. That's un-American. Mr. Keith should send Mr. Ford a message by boycotting this celebration.&quot;</font></p>
