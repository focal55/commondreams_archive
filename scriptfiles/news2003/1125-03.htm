Colin Powell on November 12, responding to statements of the Mexican ambassador to the UN who had said the U.S. regards Mexico as a second-class country, remarked: 'We never, ever, in any way would treat Mexico as some backyard or as a second-class nation. We have too much of a history that we have gone through together.' That history includes invading Mexico, 1846-48, and taking half of its territory, bombarding the Mexican coast in 1914, killing several hundred Mexicans, and a long history of subordinating Mexican interests to our own.'&quot; The Mexican ambassador who made the remarks, Adolfo Aguilar Zinser, has been compelled to resign.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><BR>ZOLTAN GROSSMAN, grossmzc@uwec.edu, <A HREF="../views03/www.uwec.edu/grossmzc/interventions.html" TARGET="_new">www.uwec.edu/grossmzc/interventions.html</A><BR>Grossman is assistant professor of geography at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire and author of the article &quot;From Wounded Knee to Iraq: A Century of U.S. Military Interventions.&quot;</FONT></P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p></font><!-- #EndEditable --></td></tr>
