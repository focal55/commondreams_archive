- November 12 - The following statement by Alliance for Justice President Nan Aron on the Senate 30-hour Talk-A-Thon was released today:
    </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I am delighted that the Senate will finally be shining a light on the federal judiciary. The administration has chosen to pack the courts by nominating conservative individuals who do not represent mainstream America. This administration has been engaged in a relentless campaign to nominate individuals hostile to civil rights, women's rights, workers' rights and environmental protections.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Fair-minded senators have acted appropriately and in the interest of the American people by preventing those who are not qualified to serve on the bench. In fact, the Senate has confirmed 98 percent of Bush's nominees with 168 nominees confirmed and only four nominees filibustered. More judges have been confirmed now than during Reagan's first term when he had a Republican-controlled Senate.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Republican Senators are eager to implement Bush's court-packing strategy and rubberstamp his nominees. Republicans are insisting on this talk-a-thon as a means to energize the right-wing base while admitting it will have no effect on the upcoming Senate votes.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We commend the Senate Democrats for their commitment to fight for a fair and independent judiciary and to resist the Bush administration's efforts to push through these highly controversial nominations.</font></p>
