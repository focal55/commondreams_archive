                FE, N.M. - February 27 - Following is a statement by Rev. Simeon 

                Nartoomid on his proposed alternative to war with Iraq: </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I propose that 

                the U.S.A. offer to the people of Iraq an aid package in the amount 

                of the estimated cost of the proposed war (said to be 100 billion 

                USD). The aid package would be to rebuild the country from its 

                state of deterioration. I will not detail all that encompasses 

                as most people are aware of what is needed there. The stipulation 

                associated with this aid package would be that Saddam Hussein 

                must step down from power and go into exile for the remainder 

                of his life. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I believe it 

                is highly likely that some of the following would occur as a result 

                of such a sincere (and it must be sincere and followed through 

                with) proposal on the part of the U.S.A.: 1) Saddam Hussein would 

                lose what support he has from his own people in the Arab world; 

                2) if he did not step down from power he would likely be removed 

                by some means by people in his country or neighboring countries; 

                3) the U.S.A. would likely have much greater support from its 

                allies in such an action, and our allies would also likely help 

                pay the bill of such an aid package wherein they are reluctant 

                to do so for the war action; 4) the amount of money involved could 

                be paid out over a period of time, say 5-10 years, therefore reducing 

                the immediate financial burden on the economies of those nations 

                contributing, not the least of which would be the U.S.A.; 5) the 

                U.S.A. would set an example for the world, truly transforming 

                its Super Power status into one of being a Super Helping Brother/Sister 

                status, therefore changing our world image in the process; 6) 

                the purposes of the oil industry would still be served as they 

                could establish cooperation with a new regime for the benefit 

                of both Iraq and the other nations of the world, which still need 

                the use of crude oil coming from that region; 7) the U.S.A. and 

                its allies could cooperate in the effort to establish a new regime 

                such as occurred for Afghanistan, and rebuild the country of Iraq, 

                therefore further establishing a sense of global community and 

                goodwill; 8) the tensions and conflicts between Israel and Palestine 

                would be more easily dealt with because the U.S.A. would have 

                demonstrated, in action not just words, the way to properly deal 

                with potential conflict and, therefore, would gain further respect 

                from both the Israelis and Palestinians in their counsel on such 

                affairs; 9) the de-polarization which would take place between 

                the U.S.A. and its allies and Iraq would ripple throughout the 

                world, and, in particular, in the conflict-torn Middle East having 

                a positive overall effect for the entire world; 10) the Bush administration 

                would have found a viable alternative and "out" for its previous 

                stance without losing face. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I believe there 

                is much more than this that would come about as a result of implementing 

                such a proposal, but these possibilities are of themselves enough. 

                If only one or two of these potentials were real possibilities, 

                that alone should justify a serious consideration for implementation.
