- December 23 - Tripling allowable levels of mercury pollution, shifting the burden of toxic clean up from polluters to taxpayers, and undoing rules for cleaning up America's dirtiest power plants topped a laundry list of Bush administration exploits to weaken decades environmental progress in 2003.</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The Bush administration is systematically turning back 30 years of environmental progress,&quot; said Carl Pope, Sierra Club executive director. &quot;You really have to go back to the McKinley administration in the late 19th century to find so many gratuitous giveaways to special interests looking to exploit our air, water, and natural areas. Americans want a 21st century administration that can deliver forward-thinking environmental solutions.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Sierra Club surveyed subscribers of RAW, the organization's twice-weekly electronic newsletter tracking the Bush administration's environmental record, to determine the worst-of-the-worst decisions affecting public health and the environment.  Mercury pollution, toxic cleanup, and soot and smog registered as the greatest concerns, from a list that also included oil drilling on sensitive lands, a secret amnesty deal for giant factory farms, and lax environmental enforcement, among others.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The survey also found that the public is largely unaware of the broad scope of the Bush administration's assaults on the nation's air, water and lands, Pope said. Many respondents expressed surprise that they haven't heard more about the administration's environmental record from mainstream media.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Trying to limit my vote to three big ones is beyond difficult,&quot; wrote one RAW reader in a typical response. &quot;This administration is doing more damage than the Reagan &amp; Bush Sr. ones did. And I didn't think that was even possible! Thank you for making the effort to educate Americans about what this administration is really doing to this country!&quot;</FONT></P><P></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The full list of 2003 Bush administration actions, ranked according to the survey response, appears below.
