                - March 19 - U.S. Rep. Gregory W. Meeks (D-N.Y.) a member of the 

                International Relations Committee released today his written remarks 

                from last night on the House Floor regarding Iraq: </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Mr. MEEKS 

                of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of the Congressional 

                Black Caucus for his leadership in bringing us to the House floor 

                to speak to the American people tonight about the Bush administration's 

                decision to choose war as the best way to make the American people 

                safe. It is a choice which I believe is wrong. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"First and 

                foremost, in opposing President Bush's decision, let me say unequivocally 

                I support in every way the men and women of our armed services 

                and the sacrifices they and their families are being asked to 

                make. May God bless each and every one of them in this time of 

                crisis and bring them home safely. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Mr. Speaker, 

                I believe in a strong America. We have more instruments of power 

                than any nation on Earth. However, our greatest source of power 

                is our moral clarity and purpose in how we use our strength. Unfortunately, 

                the Bush administration has failed to understand this. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"As our President 

                prepares to unilaterally and preemptively use military force against 

                a nation which is not an imminent threat to us, we may be on the 

                verge of threatening the very international laws and norms which 

                are the foundation of global stability. Many of the consequences 

                of such actions have already become known. America is more isolated 

                than ever and anti-American sentiment is rising globally. However, 

                it is the unknown consequences of this administration's choice 

                for war which will likely be even more dangerous. My single greatest 

                fear is that this war will jeopardize the help we receive from 

                moderate Muslim nations in successfully bringing to justice those 

                who directly attacked us on 9-11 and prevent attacks against Americans 

                at home and abroad against known imminent terrorist threats. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Contrary to 

                the President's force dichotomy that our choice was either war 

                or doing nothing, I believe we do have alternatives to this war. 

                If Iraq was such a threat, we can continue to use robust inspections, 

                sanctions, and a military containment box. There are others that 

                I think are on the list that are much more of an imminent danger 

                to us here in America, but it is clear to the world that this 

                war is not really about Iraq's threats to America. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The world 

                believes that this war is about changing a regime we once supported 

                and a test case for the Bush administration's doctrine of preemption, 

                a doctrine that was not just created after 9-11, but a doctrine 

                that was espoused back in 1991 by many of the same individuals 

                in the Bush II administration during the Bush I administration. 

                So it is not a new doctrine that we have to go by because of 9-11; 

                it is a doctrine that was preached and talked about prior to 9-11 

                by many members of this administration. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I believe 

                it is a disservice for the strongest Nation in the world to adopt 

                such a doctrine, because it represents a policy of fear and weakness. 

                More importantly, it signals a dangerous devaluation of diplomacy 

                as an instrument of statecraft to the entire world. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Mr. Speaker, 

                there is not a question in my mind that our military will defeat 

                Iraq, but the real question for America and the world is what 

                will come next and what damage to the region and international 

                order will this cause? What will happen in the Arab and Muslim 

                worlds when the U.S. military occupies Iraq in the name of stability? 

                In the end, the question is: Will this make America safer? I believe 

                not. I think we are making a mistake; but may God bless all of 

                the men and women again that are there, that they may return home 

                to their families safely.&quot;
