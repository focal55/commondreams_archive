- August 4 - Revelations that the Bush Administration knowingly and intentionally lied to the American people in order to justify and gain support for a war on Iraq in March 2003 come as no surprise to the United States Section of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom. The particular lies are public knowledge and were used to fabricate a case for the alleged level of threat posed by Saddam Hussein and his government. This is a matter of serious consequence and requires a full Congressional investigation.</font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The real problem we are facing, however, is not a 16-word phrase in the State of the Union address or other statements promulgated as truth by the governments of the United States and Britain.  The war has created a major crisis in Iraq.  Reportedly, the war has killed over 6,000 Iraqi civilians, and it has left the country in a state of chaos.  After years of sanctions and an intensive ground war, the infrastructure of Iraq is in shambles, there is no long-range plan for rebuilding, and the U.S. government has appointed a ruling council with no legitimacy among the Iraqi people.</font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Bush Administration's reconstruction plan appears to have been developed before the war started.  With a &quot;no-bid&quot; process providing huge contracts to favored corporations using Iraqi oil money but affording few jobs for the people of Iraq, there is strong resentment toward the United States. Notwithstanding President Bush's assertion in May that the war was over, as of mid-July the current situation has been named a &quot;guerilla war.&quot;  The daily encounters between U.S. soldiers and Iraqis have resulted in hundreds of deaths on both sides.</font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As the late Phil Berrigan said, &quot;lying and war are always associated. Pay attention to war-makers when they try to defend their current war.. If they move their lips they're lying.&quot;  Despite the assertions of the Bush administration, Saddam Hussein did not pose an imminent threat to the United States.  No caches of nuclear or biological weapons have been found.  Iraq was not responsible for the September 11th attacks: there is no evidence of links with the hijackers of the planes, nor has there been any evidence that Saddam Hussein conspired with Osama bin Laden.</font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition to calling for a full Congressional investigation into these lies, WILPF-US calls for an end to the occupation of Iraq.  We support the involvement of the United Nations in helping establish democracy. We agree with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s statement, &quot;Wars are poor chisels for carving out peaceful tomorrows.&quot;</font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is time for the U.S. to move on from destructive policies of war making and militarism to peacemaking and justice</font>.</p>
