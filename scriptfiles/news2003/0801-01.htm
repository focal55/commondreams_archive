- July 31 - In a last minute deal, the Senate resurrected its failed

energy bill from last Congress--a bill that gives billions of dollars in

subsidies to dirty coal and oil, and dangerous nuclear power; increases

America's oil dependence; includes virtually no progress on renewable

energy; and eliminates safeguards that protect consumers from Enron-like

manipulations.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Passage of this bill sets the stage for a conference with the House-passedbill, which is even more environmentally damaging and polluting, and callsfor drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. With this maneuver, the Senate has cut short needed debate on America's energy future and

failed to provide a responsible energy policy for the nation. The Senate

neglected to adequately debate and vote on important issues such as

reducing global warming pollution; closing the light truck fuel economy

loophole; requiring increased use of clean, renewable energy sources; andproviding consumer protections against energy market manipulation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By passing this polluting energy bill today the Senate bowed to special

interests and failed to adopt solutions that would reduce America's oil

dependence, save consumers money and protect the environment.  The Senate

entrusted the nation's energy policy to a conference committee where

special interests are likely to rule.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Senate failed to give Americans a responsible energy plan that reduces

our dependence on oil,&quot; said Carl Pope, Executive Director of the Sierra

Club.  &quot;Instead, the Senate is offering Americans a bill that will threaten

their health, their wallets, and their children's future.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Every American deserves a safe, clean, and affordable energy future. Butthe Bush Administration and Congress are taking the country down the wrong

path with a destructive, expensive, and polluting energy bill.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Next stop for this bill is a conference with a House energy bill that

shares the shortcomings of the Senate bill and compounds them by opening

the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling. &quot;Americans deserve

better from their elected representatives, and this bill will only get

worse in conference committee.  Americans should demand that Congress

reject this wrong-headed energy bill,&quot; added Pope.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;There's a better way for America.  We can reduce our dependence on foreign

oil with more efficient automobiles.  We can cut pollution by producing

more of our electricity with clean, renewable energy like wind and solar

power.  At the same time, we can protect our special places and ensure that

corporations do their part to protect our health and safety.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This bill is a failure because it doesn't significantly reduce oil

dependence or pollution,&quot; said Pope. &quot;Congress must create a balanced plan

which protects our energy future, while protecting our land, air and water

at the same time.&quot;</font></p>
