<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NEW YORK- August 11 - The most recent data released by the National Center for State Courts (NCSC) finds that &#147;the 1992 to 2001 trend in medical malpractice filings per 100,000 population has only fluctuated minimally, with an overall 1 percent decrease in per capita filings.&#148;  (emphasis added).  Moreover, in its analysis of 5 years of data for 17 states, NCSC found that in 7, the filing decrease was even more severe, yet only one of the seven has a cap on damages for injured victims. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What&#146;s more, despite decreasing medical malpractice claims, 5 of those states have been described by the American Medical Association (AMA) as &#147;in full blown crisis.&#148;  The AMA has used this arbitrary classification to push for caps on damages in those states, even though court filings are down. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The data is contained in the recently-released 2003 study, Examining the Work of State Courts, 2002: A National Perspective from the Court Statistics Project, a joint project of the Conference of State Court Administrators, the Bureau of Justice Statistics and the National Center for State Courts&#146; Court Statistics projects.  It contains the country&#146;s most accurate and comprehensive overview of state court litigation statistics. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to CJ&amp;D Executive Director Joanne Doroshow, &#147;One of the most contentious issues in the debate over medical malpractice is whether the system is being overrun with increasing numbers of claims by patients.  Now, the most reputable, independent source of litigation statistics in the country has definitively answered this question, finding that not only are medical malpractice cases not growing, they are decreasing per capita.  The American Medical Association should immediately stop providing misleading information to lawmakers in states that it has classified as &#145;in crisis,&#146; when the facts say the opposite.  The legal system is working just fine without industry-sponsored laws that make it even more difficult for sick and injured patients to have their day in court.&#148; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The seven states (out of 17 examined by the NCSC), where overall medical malpractice filings had decreased, are as follows (so-called AMA &#147;crisis&#148; states are designated with an asterisk (*)): </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*Missouri: 2% decrease in medical malpractice filings between 1997 and 2001; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

*New York: 3% decrease in medical malpractice filings between 1997 and 2001; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

*Connecticut: 4% decrease in medical malpractice filings between 1997 and 2001; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

*New Jersey: 9% decrease in medical malpractice filings between 1997 and 2001; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

New Hampshire: 15% decrease in medical malpractice filings between 1997 and 2001; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

*Oregon 37% decrease in medical malpractice filings between 1997 and 2001; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Minnesota: 44% decrease in medical malpractice filings between 1997 and 2001.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Only one of those states - Missouri - currently has a cap on damages, although the health care industry is not satisfied with the severity of this cap and is pushing to make it even worse for patients killed or injured by medial malpractice. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NCSC also found that in 30 states examined by NCSC, overall tort filings were down 9 percent between 1992 and 2001.  Population-adjusted tort filings declined in 22 of 30 states examined and that &#147;the largest declines occurred in Texas and Massachusetts, where tort filings fell by 41 percent.&#148; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Moreover, while medical malpractice cases are the subject of intense legislative and media focus, they comprise only 5 percent of total tort case dispositions in the country.  Further, contract cases, usually involving businesses litigating against other businesses which are never affected by so-called &#147;tort reform&#148; laws, continue to &#147;outpace tort filings.&#148;</font> </p>
