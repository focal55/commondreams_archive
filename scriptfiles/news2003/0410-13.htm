- April 10 - A whaling fleet of six 

Japanese ships are expected to leave port by the end of this week, 

as part of the first phase of their plan to hunt 260 whales, the 

Japanese Fisheries Agency has announced. The news comes just days 

after the return of whaling ships that killed 440 whale, and 

despite worldwide criticism from governments and conservation 

groups including the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW - 

      <a href="http://www.ifaw.org/" target="_new">      www.ifaw.org</a>). </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Japan's current whale hunting plan calls for today's departing 

      fleet to kill 50 minke whales along the country's northeast coast, 

      in a hunt that is scheduled to last 40 days. In May, the fleet will 

      depart again, this time for a three-month hunt in the eastern North 

  Pacific, where it will kill 100 minke, 50 Bryde's, 50 sei, and 10 

      sperm whales. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since an IWC moratorium on commercial whaling came into effect 

      in 1986, Japan has continued whaling under the pretext of &quot;

      scientific research,&quot; despite the fact that the whale meat ends up 

      on dinner plates in high-end Tokyo restaurants, little scientific 

  data has been shared by the government with the international 

      community. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Last year, Japan announced it would expand its annual hunt to 

  include endangered sei whales and increase numbers of minke whales 

      to be killed, outraging conservationists worldwide. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Despite international condemnation for its whaling programs, 

      Japan continues to lobby strongly, but not successfully, for 

      legalized international commercial whaling. In May 2002, Japan 

  failed to secure the support of the International Whaling 

      Commission (IWC) at its Shimonoseki, Japan meeting. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Japanese government then sought to end-run the IWC by 

      submitting proposals to downlist the protected status of minke and 

      Bryde's whale species under the U.N. Convention on International 

      Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), which met in Santiago, Chile 

  in November 2002. Japan's proposals all failed to be passed or to 

      even garner a simple majority vote. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Japan is undermining decades of environmental conservation 

      efforts. It's just outrageous and unacceptable that they continue 

      to hunt whales,&quot; said Fred O'Regan, IFAW President. &quot;What we need 

      now is for the international community to send a strong message of 

      opposition to Japan - trade agreements should be questioned, effort 

      should be put into building the country's growing whale watching 

  industry not its subsidized whale hunts, and Japan's political role 

      in the international community should be reevaluated.&quot; </font></p>
