                WASHINGTON 

                    - April 15 - At a luncheon at the National Press Club today, Actor/Director 

                    Tim Robbins and Win Without War National Director, former Congressman 

                    Tom Andrews, called on media to act as a check and balance to 

                    the Bush administration and its pursuit of the &#147;First-Strike&#148; doctrine.</font> 

                </p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The 

                  war was sold to the American public as something that it wasn&#146;t,&#148; 

                  said Tom Andrews. &#147;Why is it that Americans continue to 

                  believe that Saddam Hussein is connected to events of 9/11 and 

                  that the Iraqi people have a relationship with Al-Qaeda? Not 

                  only is this patently false, but it seems that the rest of the 

                  world knows this administration is misleading the American public. 

                  Why don&#146;t we?&#148;</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Andrews 

                  explained that the &#147;Doctrine of Pre-emption&#148; was launched 

                  in 1997, but it took the attack of September 11th to move the 

                  agenda. As Bush now eyes Syria, it has become clear that the 

                  war with Iraq has opened the door for future invasions.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Given 

                  that the Congress has abdicated responsibility and the U.N. 

                  has been cast aside, unless the media is able and willing to 

                  challenge the 

                  administration&#146;s manipulation of facts, Americans may find 

                  themselves at war again. We are talking about future wars that 

                  are avoidable, that fuel terrorism, that isolate us from historic 

                  allies whose cooperation we need to fight terrorism effectively, 

                  that undermine the rule of law, that heap enormous costs on 

                  the American people alone, that serve as partial justification 

                  for the suspension of civil liberties, and that make all 

              Americans less secure,&#148; said Andrews.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Actor/Director 

                  Tim Robbins, who has been an outspoken critic of the war said: 

                  &#147;We are living in a crucial moment. As we eye Syria and 

                  begin the chatter that leads to war there, it is imperative 

                  for those who oppose the notion of the United States as unchecked 

                  Empire to speak out strongly against a foreign policy of military 

                  intimidation. We are, as a nation, so much nobler than that.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Recent 

                  intimidations to free speech by certain talk radio hosts, by 

                  Clear Channel Broadcasting, and by the National Baseball Hall 

                  of Fame have to be met head on. Any instance of intimidation 

                  to free speech should be battled against. Any acquiescence to 

                  intimidation at this point will only lead to more intimidation,&#148; 

                  said Robbins.</font></p>
