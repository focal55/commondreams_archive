                HANOVER, NJ - April 22 - At Kraft Foods annual shareholders&#146; 

                meeting, Infact activists representing a Kraft shareholder were 

                refused timely entry into the meeting, preventing the corporate 

                accountability group from addressing shareholders and executives. 

                Last year Infact representatives were the only people to speak 

                directly to Kraft&#146;s tobacco connection at the annual meeting. 

                This year, Infact representatives were held at the door with questionable 

                claims of concerns about their paperwork until the meeting was 

                nearly over. The corporate accountability organization Infact 

                has involved millions of consumers in challenging Philip Morris/Altria 

                to stop addicting new young customers with promotional campaigns 

                like the Marlboro Man, and to stop interfering in public health 

                policy around the world. A major strategy in this campaign is 

                Infact&#146;s growing Boycott of Kraft, the tobacco giant&#146;s 

                food business.</font> 

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Kraft&#146;s 

                  decision to effectively bar Infact from its annual meeting today 

                  was clearly meant to silence criticism about the food corporation&#146;s 

                  role in Philip Morris/Altria&#146;s deadly business. With mounting 

                  concerns from investors and shareholders about the liability 

                  of tobacco, Kraft executives are obviously feeling enormous 

                  pressure. Attempts to censor criticism, however, will only backfire. 

                  This behavior is completely inconsistent with the &#145;commitment 

                  to responsibility&#146; and efforts to &#145;meet or exceed 

                  evolving societal expectations&#146; touted in Philip Morris/Altria&#146;s 

                  corporate PR touting its recent name change,&#148; says Infact 

                  Executive Director Kathryn Mulvey who will be attending the 

                  Philip Morris/Altria annual meeting on Thursday of this week.

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The recent 

                  $10.1 billion verdict in an Illinois class action, followed 

                  by legal wrangling over whether Philip Morris USA would be required 

                  to post a $12 billion court-ordered bond drove Kraft stock down. 

                  According to an article in the Wall Street Journal last week, 

                  &#147;Wall Street was worried that Altria would need to tap 

                  Kraft to pay the money.&#148; Kraft stock has fallen 25% so 

                  far this year while the Dow Jones food-products index is down 

                  only 7%.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The full 

                  statement that Infact would have delivered at the Kraft annual 

                  meeting today is as follows: &#147;Good morning. My name is 

                  Mark Longhurst and I&#146;m an organizer with the corporate 

                  accountability organization Infact. During my time with Infact, 

                  I have attended a few annual meetings, and I have been struck 

                  by the pageantry of these events. However, Kraft Foods gives 

                  new meaning to the term &#145;corporate performance.&#146;</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Everyone 

                  in this auditorium is behaving as if Kraft is an independent 

                  food company. Yet this corporation is 84% owned by another corporation, 

                  known until January 2003 as Philip Morris. Your corporate parent 

                  has changed its name to Altria, but remains the world&#146;s 

                  largest and most profitable tobacco corporation.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;A 

                  recent series of Altria ads poses and answers the question, 

                  &#147;What is the role of a parent company? To provide strength 

                  and guidance for its family.&#148; Philip Morris/Altria has 

                  much guidance to offer-in dubious areas of expertise. A study 

                  in this month&#146;s American Journal of Public Health titled 

                  &#145;Altria Means Tobacco: Philip Morris&#146;s Identity Crisis,&#146; 

                  finds that the name change is the height of a long-term effort 

                  to manipulate consumers and policymakers. By making Philip Morris 

                  refer only to the tobacco operating companies, the parent is 

                  attempting to mask the negatives associated with tobacco-especially 

                  for Kraft Foods.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Those 

                  negatives are serious, and growing: </font></p>

                  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Promotional 

                    campaigns like the Marlboro Man have inspired millions of 

                    consumers to join with Infact in pressuring Philip Morris/Altria 

                    to stop addicting new customers and stop interfering in public 

                    policy. A major strategy in this campaign is a Boycott targeting 

                    Kraft.</font></li>

                    legacy of addiction, disease and death is creating massive 

                    legal troubles for the parent corporation-including a $10.1 

                    billion verdict in an Illinois class action and a federal 

                    lawsuit seeking $289 billion in damages. As investors worry 

                    about liability, Kraft&#146;s stock has fallen 25% so far 

                    this year while the Dow Jones food-products index is down

                    groundbreaking global treaty, the first to deal solely with 

                    a public health issue, will change the way Philip Morris/Altria 

                    can operate globally. The final text includes a ban on tobacco 

                    advertising, promotion and sponsorship (allowing exceptions 

                    only for constitutional reasons) and measures to protect public 

                    health policy from interference by tobacco corporations, their
