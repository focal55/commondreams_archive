- June 26 - At a spirited protest outside the Natural Gas Summit in Washington, DC today, U.S PIRG called on Congress and the Bush Administration to look to energy efficiency and clean renewable energy sources like solar and wind power in response to the perceived natural gas crisis.  The public interest group also expressed opposition to any energy policy that would roll back environmental safeguards or allow oil and gas development in sensitive areas that are currently protected.  Finally, the group urged Congress and the Bush Administration to carefully investigate the causes of the current price spikes, in light of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's finding of &quot;epidemic&quot; false price reporting.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Energy efficiency is the quickest, cheapest, cleanest way to save energy and reduce dependence on unstable fuel supplies,&quot; said U.S. PIRG Clean Energy Advocate Katherine Morrison.  &quot;Unfortunately the Bush Administration has rolled back air conditioner efficiency standards and postponed home heating standards that could have saved consumers money and natural gas.&quot; Home heating and cooling accounts for an enormous portion of America's energy use with air conditioning responsible for as much as 70 percent of electricity used during hot summer days.  Just two proposed heating and cooling efficiency standards could save consumers the equivalent of more than 3 months natural gas consumption.

.	The Department of Energy (DOE) under the Clinton Administration

set a

standard calling for a 30 percent increase in efficiency for central air

conditioners and heat pumps.   In May 2002, however, the DOE finalized

its

rule that rolled back the standard to a 20 percent improvement.  Under the original proposal, using existing technology to make air conditioners use less energy could have saved consumers $1 billion annually and reduced natural gas use by 1.3 trillion cubic feet over the next 20 years.

.	Just this month, the Bush administration announced it would

effectively

postpone efficiency standards for furnaces and boilers.  If enacted, the home heating standards could save 5 trillion cubic feet of natural gas over the next twenty years.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;As summer temperatures soar, so do electric bills and power plant emissions,&quot; said Morrison. &quot;By increasing efficiency and diversifying the electricity mix to include renewable energy, consumers would no longer be held captive to the volatility of the fossil fuel market.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Increasing the percentage of electricity generated by renewable energy has many benefits to consumers. Increased use of clean renewables could save consumers money in the long run by reducing the demand for natural gas, and therefore the price.  In fact, a study done by the Energy Information Agency

(EIA) found that a national renewable energy standard of 10% by 2020 could reduce natural gas prices below business as usual by 2.3% in 2020. In addition, renewable energy producers are not subject to price spikes. By using renewable energy to meet 10% of our electricity needs in 2020, consumers could save $13.2 billion dollars on their combined gas and electric bills by 2020.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Government response to the perceived natural gas crisis should not be like Christmas in June for energy producers,&quot; said Morrison. &quot;Industry and their supporters are taking advantage of fears of a natural gas shortage to get items from their wish list like exemptions from Clean Air Act standards and invasive exploration in protected waters.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Even as the DC area suffers under a &quot;code red ozone alert,&quot; industrial energy consumers have asked President Bush to exercise emergency powers and suspend Clean Air Act requirements for summer smog pollutants.  And on the eve of a national holiday that sends millions of Americans to beaches currently protected by a moratorium on offshore oil and gas exploration and drilling, the industry and some in Congress recommend removing these protections.  Considering that according to U.S. Departments of Interior inventories, 80% of our undeveloped domestic offshore natural gas supply is in areas that are freely available for development now, lifting the moratorium will not solve our energy problems.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Given all the benefits of pursuing a clean energy path, there is no reason to drill in our last wild places, and cover our beaches with oil by continuing to rely on outmoded energy thinking,&quot; continued Morrison.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">American Electric Power Co, Duke Energy, El Paso, and Williams Energy are all part of the National Petroleum Council, which is sponsoring today's Natural Gas Summit.  While investigating the California electricity crisis, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) found these companies engaged in false reporting of natural gas prices. According to the California Public Utility Commission, several energy companies, including two members of the sponsoring organization -- Duke Energy Corp. and

Williams-- deliberately withheld output during California's energy crisis last year.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We should not trust our energy future to companies that have admitted to gaming the system,&quot; concluded Morrison.  &quot;Instead, the Bush Administration and Congress should ask serious questions about why we have been inundated with wildly fluctuating gas prices and why companies are not planning far enough ahead to avoid shortages.&quot;</font></p>
