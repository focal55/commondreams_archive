<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">DEERFIELD, MA - The US Navy knew in 1984 that, &quot;... should a DU penetrator oxidize resulting from a penetrator's involvement in an accident such as a fire, then the intake of DU aerosol, or ash via inhalation, ingestion, or absorption presents an internal radiation hazard.&quot;</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Documents obtained by Glen Milner of the Ground Zero Center for Nonviolent Action, Poulsbo, WA. through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) were shared with Sunny Miller, Executive Director of Traprock Peace Center in Deerfield as she prepared another speaking tour by Gulf War veteran Doug Rokke. Rokke visits Seattle, on Monday, October 6, Port Townsend, WA on October 7, Portland, OR on October 8, Arcata, CA on Oct. 9, then leaves for Illinois and Germany.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Milner, Miller, Rokke and many others are working to inform the public about the health hazards of uranium-waste munitions during an eight-state speaking tour that includes Texas, Missouri, South Dakota and Indiana, with inquiries from other states. Rokke and representatives of Traprock Peace Center will bring obscure public documents to public view through the World Uranium Weapons Conference in Hamburg, Germany, October 16-19. A child's rights attorney, Charles Jenks, President of Traprock Peace Center, has posted the relevant FOIA document at <a href="http://www.traprockpeace.org" target="_new">http://www.traprockpeace.org</a></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The document is available for download in both reduced and full resolution formats. The Traprock site has extensive original resources and links regarding uranium waste munitions (&#140;depleted&sup1; uranium).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) was released from the Department of the Navy, Naval Surface Warfare Center in Crane, Indiana, on 22 May 03 in response to a 2 April 03 Freedom of Information Act request by Glen Milner. The MSDS, dated 14 May 1984, shows the Navy has been aware of many of the problems associated with depleted uranium since that time.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Glen Milner is an electrician who has devoted time to extensive research using the Freedom of Information Act, since 1987. A request for information on navigation hazards for Trident submarines revealed that the submarines were advised to stay out of an area where a surface ship was firing 20-mm bullets containing the heavy metal, radioactive waste, U238. Through this finding, Milner became a key figure in breaking the story in January 2003 that the Navy was firing radioactive-waste munitions into prime fishing areas off the Washington coast.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Milner has worked on Trident nuclear submarine issues with the Ground Zero group in Poulsbo, WA since the early 1980's. Currently the Ground Zero Center has filed an environmental lawsuit against the Navy's Trident II

(D-5) missile upgrade at the Bangor submarine base.  The lawsuit is based almost entirely upon information released through the Freedom of Information Act.</font></p>
