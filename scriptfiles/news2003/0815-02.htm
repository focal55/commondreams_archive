- August 15 - Singer/songwriter Ani DiFranco, the latest artist to support Dennis 

Kucinich for President, will join Willie Nelson in a concert to benefit 

the campaign. Ani is a successful, staunchly independent performer -- a 

poet and feminist who launched her own record company, Righteous Babe Records, at the age of 19.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This will be the first time Ani and Willie have appeared together.  The 

concert is set for Cleveland, the hometown of Congressman Kucinich, on Saturday, Sept 6 at the State Theater.  Ani will perform solo; Willie 

with his full band.   </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Congressman Kucinich commented: &quot;Ani DiFranco and Willie Nelson are both 

socially-engaged artists and it's an honor to have their help in this 

campaign.&quot;  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Willie/Ani concert is one of a series of campaign benefits that 

begin with Willie Nelson's performance on Labor Day in Des Moines: Monday, Sept. 1 at the Polk County Convention Complex.  Details on a third September concert have not been finalized.  Tickets can be 

purchased through the Kucinich for President website: http://www.kucinich.us</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ani and her record company proudly hail from Buffalo, New York, a rust belt city on the Great Lakes.  Kucinich is former mayor of Cleveland who co-chairs the Congressional Progressive Caucus and advocates for 

workers, the environment and civil rights.  Of the presidential 

candidates, he was the first and most vocal opponent of the Iraq War.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Other musical artists are supporting the campaign.  Michelle Shocked 

performed recently at a Southern California rally with Kucinich. The 

David Zollo Band will join Willie on the bill in Des Moines.</font></p>
