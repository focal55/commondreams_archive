                - March 3 - As part of the ongoing commitment to peace and justice, 

                a diverse group of organizations has united for a National Moratorium 

                to Stop The War to take place this Wednesday, March 5. Bringing 

                together students, labor groups and communities of faith, the 

                Moratorium will draw attention to a “war that will last a generation” 

                by stopping business as usual. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Moratorium 

                will build upon the momentum of the massive worldwide protests 

                of February 15th by creating a series of local events throughout 

                the country, which together express a unified statement against 

                the imminent war with Iraq. Massive walkouts across the nation 

                as a display of solidarity will illustrate the broad spectrum 

                of those opposed to war. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The New York 

                Labor Against War coalition has stated, “War will inevitably harm 

                countless innocent civilians, strengthen our alliances with brutal 

                dictatorships and deepen global poverty.” </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Walkouts are 

                expected to take place in hundreds of schools nationwide including 

                over 30 in Los Angeles alone. In addition, several events and 

                marches will take place across the country. In Los Angeles, the 

                Interfaith Communities for Justice and Peace will gather at the 

                Federal Building. In the Bay Area, banners and signs will designate 

                “no war zones” along commuting routes. In Chicago, workers will 

                join hands to form a chain of resistance on city sidewalks. Outside 

                Cleveland, a high school will hold open debates in an all-day 

                assembly in lieu of classes. In New York, a teach-in at Hunter 

                College, a draw-in at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and a candlelight 

                march for peace will take place as well as a performance event 

                sponsored by Not In Our Name (NION). </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Laura, a NION 

                youth and student organizer, said the Moratorium is “a means for 

                youth to communicate our opposition to this war in a very determined 

                and planned way.” She added, “We are taking action because we 

                have to ask ourselves what kind of world we want our children 

                to grow up in.” </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NION, who called 

                for the Moratorium, is a national network resisting the international 

                aggression, attacks on civil liberties, and profiling, roundups, 

                and detentions of immigrants that have taken place since September 

                11. The NION Pledge of Resistance states, “Not in our name will 

                you invade countries, bomb civilians, kill more children, letting 

                history take its course over the graves of the nameless.” (Full

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pax Christi 

                USA, part of the international Catholic peace movement, stated, 

                “In concert with many other peace and justice groups, PCUSA invites 

                Christians everywhere to ‘strike’ for peace – no work, no cars, 

                no television, no shopping, and no classes.” </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Moratorium 

                organizers said, “The joining of students, labor, and faith groups 

                on this day reflects a new cooperation around the cause of stopping 

                the war on Iraq.”
