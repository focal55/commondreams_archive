- December 11 - MGJ Activists Disrupt CAFTA Negotiations Press Conference Rename Treaty 'Corporate America Free Theft Agreement' (Washington, D.C. 12/11/03)- Five activists with Mobilization for Global Justice (MGJ) were forcibly expelled Thursday from a press conference during negotiations to finalize the Central America Free Trade Agreement at the Mayflower Hotel. The protesters carried banners renaming CAFTA the &quot;Corporate America Free Theft Agreement.&quot;  They chanted &quot;CAFTA means hunger, CAFTA means violence, we know the truth and we won't be silenced&quot; and &quot;EEUU fuera de CentroAmerica&quot; (U.S. Out of Central America). Miguel Lacayo, Minister of Economics of El Salvador, was forced to postpone his remarks until the activists were removed. &quot;CAFTA would extend to Central America the same gross violations of human and labor rights resulting from NAFTA, as FTAA would to all of South America,&quot; said Rachael Moshman, one of those expelled. &quot;These so-called 'free trade' treaties constitute a hemispheric race to the bottom, with corporate lobbyists writing the rules and civil society completely cut out.&quot;</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">MGJ identifies these problems as:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">* Secrecy Instead of Transparency: No formal public input or oversight in the negotiations.  No draft text of the CAFTA has been made available.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">* Corporate Domination Over Democracy: At the expense of democracy and people's right to self-rule, CAFTA would give corporations power to object to barriers to free trade, including laws people enact for their own protection. For example, NAFTA established the right for companies to sue governments over public-interest laws that may limit their profits. This right has been employed 27 times by companies since 1994.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">* Increased Inequality: A minority of rich companies and wealthy stockholders will benefit from reduced costs. The poor will get poorer and more people will move into poverty: workers will get lower pay and lose their jobs while shouldering higher costs of living as more services are privatized.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">* Disappearing Public Services: Resources such as education, health care, energy, and water utilities owned by everyone in a community will more likely be taken over by corporations. This would prevent many people from receiving these vital public services. For example, when Cochabamba, Bolivia privatized its water utility, water rates increased 200 percent, leading to riots that resulted in six deaths and forced the withdrawal of US-based Bechtel.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">* Reduced Labor Rights: Labor laws such as those that protect worker's safety can also be challenged and the &quot;race to the bottom&quot; for pay will hurt workers in all countries involved in CAFTA.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">* Devastation in the Agricultural Sector: Increased corporate domination of farms and mass desertion of family farms in the US and Central America, as NAFTA has devastated family farms in Mexico.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">* Environmental Destruction: CAFTA, like NAFTA, would gut environmental laws and decrease costs to companies but increase costs to local communities, which suffer more health problems as a result of pollution.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Since the signing ten years ago of NAFTA, over 1 million U.S. jobs have relocated to Mexico and 8 million Mexicans have fallen out of the middle class into poverty, with one million more Mexicans now earning less than the minimum wage of $3.40 per day,&quot; said Chris Doran, who was also expelled. &quot;The U.S. alone has suffered a net loss of nearly 800,000 jobs due to NAFTA. As a result, 44 tons of hazardous waste is dumped every day along the US-Mexico border.&quot; CAFTA is a trade agreement being negotiated by government representatives from the United States, Costa Rica, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua.  President Bush supports CAFTA and hopes to have an agreement sealed as quickly as possible, and to move the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) negotiations forward faster.</FONT></P><P></P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p></font><!-- #EndEditable --></td></tr>
