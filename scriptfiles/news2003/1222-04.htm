- December 19 - Yesterday, the Los Angeles Times exposed a long list of financial benefits that Senator Ted Stevens (R_AK) and his family members have received as a result of his policymaking decisions as the Chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee.  &#147;This story is the most blatant example in recent history of a government official profiting from his power in public office,&#148; stated Danielle Brian, POGO&#146;s Executive Director.  &#147;We do not have confidence in any formal congressional proceedings, given Senator Stevens&#146; particularly powerful position.  POGO therefore calls on Senator Stevens to take the honorable step and resign from office in an attempt to restore the integrity of the Senate.&#148;</FONT><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In September, Defense Week revealed a striking correlation between political contributions to Sen. Stevens from Boeing and his nearly immediate efforts to write legislation to mandate the since-disgraced Boeing tanker lease deal. According to Defense Week, &#147;The provision was unusual in that it named the company and its product.&#148; (John Donnelly, September 2, 2003, Volume 24, Number 34).</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;To some, public service has become the equivalent of winning the lottery,&#148; stated Brian.  Darleen A. Druyun, a former top Air Force official and recently fired Boeing employee, is alleged to have entered into employment discussions with Boeing while she was supervising Boeing contracts.  &#147;It is time for the Congress to recognize that the proper arms-length relationship between the government and its contractors has been lost and that it must be restored,&#148; Brian says.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In early 2004, POGO will release the &#147;Politics of Contracting,&#148; a report on the incestuous relationship between the government and its contractors.
