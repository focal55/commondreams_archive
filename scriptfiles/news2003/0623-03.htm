<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BOSTON - June 23 - With great momentum building toward the implementation of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), the corporate accountability organization Infact is lifting its 9-year Boycott of Philip Morris/Altria&#146;s Kraft Foods. Through its Tobacco Industry Campaign and Boycott, Infact has involved millions of people worldwide in pressuring Philip Morris/Altria to stop promoting tobacco to youth with tactics like the Marlboro Man, and to stop interfering in public health policy. The Kraft Boycott has played a key role in exposing the truth behind the tobacco giant&#146;s public relations and reducing its political and economic clout.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The FCTC bans tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship, such as the notorious Marlboro Man image. The treaty will also protect public health policy from interference by tobacco corporations, and give governments the right to prioritize the health of their citizens over trade and commercial interests.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The adoption of the FCTC is a milestone for global public health and corporate accountability. This treaty will save millions of lives and inspire further worldwide action to prevent transnational corporations from endangering our health, our environment and human rights! In recognition of this major victory of people over corporate giants like Philip Morris/Altria, Infact is lifting the Kraft Boycott today,&#148; says Infact Executive Director Kathryn Mulvey.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After spending hundreds of millions of dollars to improve its image with consumers and policymakers, earlier this year the tobacco giant changed its name to Altria Group, Inc. Despite a 1712% increase in spending on corporate image advertising between 1998 and 2000&#151;Philip Morris&#146;s attempts to polish its public image not only failed, but may have fueled Infact&#146;s Kraft Boycott. According to a 2001 Harris Interactive poll, 16% of respondents familiar with Philip Morris had boycotted its products over the past year. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A case study on tobacco industry surveillance of public health groups released in the June 2002 American Journal of Public Health demonstrates that Philip Morris had been covertly tracking, and trying to undermine, Infact&#146;s Tobacco Industry Campaign and Boycott since 1993. The study exposes that while a tactic employed by the tobacco giant was to &#147;publicly minimize the effect of boycotts,&#148; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">high-level Philip Morris/Altria executives were closely tracking the growth of the Kraft Boycott from the moment it was launched. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a letter delivered today, Infact&#146;s Mulvey told Altria Chair and CEO Louis Camilleri that the decision to lift the Boycott &#147;is by no means an endorsement of Philip Morris/Altria.&#148; Forty countries signed the FCTC in the first week it was open for signature. &#147;The world is moving forward in spite of resistance by the tobacco giants. As Infact rallies support for the treaty ratification process, we will continue to expose and challenge interference by tobacco corporations in public health policy at the national and international levels,&#148; says Mulvey.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Kraft Boycott endorsements from more than 200 institutions&#151;including the General Board of Church and Society of the United Methodist Church, the American Medical Student Association, and Catholic women&#146;s communities across the US&#151;multiplied its impact tremendously. The United Methodist Church is the second-largest Protestant denomination in the US, with a membership of 10 million people worldwide. The American Medical Student Association consists of nearly 35,000 members, including medical students, residents, physicians and premeds. The organization has over 150 chapters representing almost every medical school in the US.   </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Active involvement of people of faith, including United Methodists around the world, in Infact&#146;s Kraft Boycott has brought about real change in the way Philip Morris/Altria is able to operate globally. Once again we are reminded that people organized together can overcome tremendous odds in pursuit of a more just world. As we celebrate our successes, we commit ourselves to continued efforts to protect the health and lives of people everywhere from Big Tobacco&#146;s deadly expansion,&#148; says Jim Winkler, General Secretary of the United Methodist General Board of Church and Society.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since acquiring Kraft in the late 1980&#146;s, Philip Morris/Altria has used its food division to buy credibility with policymakers, the business community and consumers. In June 2001, Philip Morris issued an Initial Public Offering (IPO) of Kraft stock. This move is seen as an initial step toward an eventual separation of Kraft from the tobacco giant. Since the IPO, Kraft has suffered from its association with tobacco. This year at the time of its annual meeting, Kraft stock had fallen 25% while the Dow Jones food products index was down only 7% in 2003.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Over the past 10 years while building the Boycott, Infact also organized retailers to remove Marlboro Man and Joe Camel ads; produced and distributed numerous expos&eacute;s including the award-winning documentary film Making a Killing: Philip Morris, Kraft and Global Tobacco Addiction; confronted corporate decision makers at annual meetings and other public events; raised awareness of tobacco transnationals&#146; global abuses; educated political leaders from every region; and generated worldwide media exposure. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since 1993, the public climate around the tobacco industry has shifted dramatically. In the US, Big Tobacco has been forced to admit its products are addictive and deadly, pay some of the enormous costs of caring for people who are sick and dying from tobacco, and give up some its most effective promotional tactics. Implementation of the FCTC will go a long way toward reversing the tobacco epidemic globally. The FCTC also sets precedents for international regulation of industries as diverse as pharmaceuticals, food and agribusiness, weapons, finance, retail, garments, oil and chemicals.</font></p>
