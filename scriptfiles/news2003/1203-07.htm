- December 3 - As the U.S. marks the 70th anniversary of the repeal of Alcohol Prohibition -- America's disastrous attempt to ban the sale and manufacture of alcoholic beverages -- the Marijuana Policy Project is urging Americans to consider how current marijuana policies are repeating past failures.</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">   On December 5, 1933, the 21st Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was ratified, ending the federal government's policy of Alcohol Prohibition. &quot;Prohibition was repealed not because Americans wanted to encourage drinking, but because the attempt to ban liquor clearly caused more harm than it prevented,&quot; said Rob Kampia, executive director of MPP, an advocacy group based in Washington, D.C. &quot;Prohibition did not stop people from drinking. It simply handed the liquor market over to gangsters.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">   While alcohol consumption did diminish when Prohibition took effect in 1920, it began to rebound soon thereafter, while crime and violence exploded around the illicit liquor trade. The homicide rate shot up 78 percent between 1920 and 1925 -- and it did not seriously decline until Prohibition was repealed in 1933.</FONT></P><P>   <FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Under Prohibition, America lost the ability to regulate alcoholic beverages,&quot; Kampia said. &quot;Not only did crime and violence increase, but so did deaths from tainted booze. Communities lost the ability to keep drinking establishments away from schools or other places where children gathered, and bootleggers had no reason not to sell to kids.</FONT></P><P>   <FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Now, 70 years later, the same harms caused by Alcohol Prohibition are being repeated with marijuana prohibition,&quot; Kampia continued. &quot;Just as with Alcohol Prohibition, marijuana prohibition has put the marketplace under the control of criminals. The violence that accompanies the illegal marijuana trade mirrors what happened around bootleg liquor in the 1920s. We've lost our ability to keep marijuana away from kids, because illegal drug dealers have no incentive to check IDs. It's not an accident that in the Netherlands -- where the possession and purchase of small amounts of marijuana by adults are allowed under a regulated system -- use of marijuana by teens is dramatically lower than in the U.S. Prohibition is as much a failure today as it was 70 years ago.&quot;</FONT></P><P></P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p></font><!-- #EndEditable --></td></tr>
