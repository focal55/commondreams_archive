- August 14 - Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore must not be allowed to defy a federal court order requiring the removal of a Ten Commandments monument from the state Judicial Building, says Americans United for Separation of Church and State.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Americans United and allied organizations filed the lawsuit that resulted in a federal court order mandating removal of the 5,280-pound granite monument by Aug. 20.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At a press conference today, Moore promised to ignore the court ruling.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Rev. Barry W. Lynn, Americans United executive director, urged appropriate government officials to make sure he complies.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Moore clearly wants to create a media circus, with his Ten Commandments monument starring in the center ring,&#148; said Lynn. &#147;It&#146;s time to shut down the performance.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;If Judge Moore can&#146;t in good conscience comply with a lawful federal court order, he ought to resign,&#148; said Lynn. &#147;We will take whatever steps are necessary to see that the federal court order is enforced.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Moore seems better suited to be an evangelist than a judge,&#148; continued Lynn. &#147;He is not only defying the rule of law himself, he&#146;s urging others to join his misguided religious crusade.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;In some countries, judges enforce religious law,&#148; Lynn continued, &#147;but in the U.S., judges follow the Constitution. This is America, not Iran. In his official role, Judge Moore must apply the U.S. Constitution, not his personal interpretation of the Bible.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lynn called on Alabama Attorney General William Pryor, Gov. Bob Riley and other state officials to see to it that the court order is obeyed. If they are unwilling to do so, he said, U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft should intervene.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;During his confirmation hearings, Ashcroft promised to enforce laws even if he personally disagreed with them,&#148; Lynn noted. &#147;This situation provides a perfect test of that claim.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Moore&#146;s defiance, Lynn said, strongly parallels actions by segregationist Southern governors who in the 1960s tried to block racial integration of public universities and schools. Like Moore, those governors tried to ignore federal court rulings requiring racial equality, but the U.S. Justice Department saw to it that the rulings were obeyed.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;It&#146;s unfortunate that some people are treating Moore like a folk hero,&#148; said Lynn. &#147;In fact, Moore is a George Wallace-style demagogue in a judicial robe. His behavior is cause for shame, not celebration.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On Aug. 12, the Montgomery Advertiser recommended that the state Judicial Inquiry Commission and the Court of the Judiciary begin proceedings against Moore if he refuses to comply.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Americans United cosponsored the legal case challenging Moore&#146;s display with the Southern Poverty Law Center and the ACLU of Alabama. </font></p>
