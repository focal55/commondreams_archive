- June 27 - Members of both chambers of Congress have urged Secretary 

of State Colin Powell to act to ensure justice for the many serious crimes committed in East Timor during Indonesia's illegal occupation. The Senate and House letters were sent yesterday as the Indonesian ad hoc Human Rights 

Court for East Timor prepares to issue its final verdict for crimes against 

humanity committed in East Timor in 1999, expected July 1.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thirteen Senators wrote, &quot;.the international community has a responsibility to ensure justice&quot; for East Timor. The letter stated that the United States &quot;should not abrogate international responsibility to the just-born East 

Timorese government, with its limited political, economic, and human resources... [and] should clearly communicate to East Timor's government and the UN Secretary-General that it supports justice and opposes immunity in these cases&quot; dating back to 1975. They urged &quot;the administration to work 

towards the establishment of an international tribunal, pursue it in the international arena, and use the influence of the United States to compel the government of Indonesia to cooperate.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Both letters called for the U.S. to support the UN-established Serious Crimes Unit (SCU) and the Special Panel courts, which are investigating, prosecuting, and hearing cases about serious crimes committed in East Timor 

in 1999. &quot;Without an extension of the SCU and Special Panels mandate, cases will be left unfinished and justice denied,&quot; 46 Representatives wrote Secretary Powell.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The letters also urged the administration to cooperate with a request from East Timor's Commission for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation (CAVR) for 

information to assist their work in clarifying &quot;the circumstances of the</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">death, displacement and suffering of hundreds of thousands of East Timorese&quot; during Indonesia's invasion and occupation of the territory. In a letter to President Bush, the Chair of the CAVR called the release of U.S. government documents &quot;vital to the process of national reconciliation and the establishment of a genuine and lasting peace.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Senator Jack Reed (D-RI) and Representative Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) initiated 

the <a href="http://etan.org/news/2003a/06letters.htm" target="_new">Senate and House letters</a>, respectively.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Also on June 26, 46 Representatives and 17 Senators sent letters to the Bush administration expressing concern about the many<a href="http://www.etan.org/action/action2/06acehltr.htm" target="_new"> human rights violations </a>taking place in Aceh since Indonesia declared martial law there last month. Members of Congress raised the use of U.S.-supplied equipment 

in the military offensive and urged a return to negotiations..</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Background</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Indonesia's widely-criticized ad hoc Human Rights Court for East Timor has so far acquitted 12 of the 18defendants prosecuted. All but one of those convicted have received sentences below the legal minimum.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The final verdict is expected on July 1. The prosecution has asked the 

court to acquit General Adam Damiri, the highest-ranking official tried.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Damiri has missed a number of court appearances due to his leadership in the military assault on Aceh.</font></p>
