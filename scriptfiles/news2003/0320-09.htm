                - March 20 - The International Rescue Committee said today that 

                U.S. government regulations are throwing roadblocks in the path 

                of American aid organizations trying to provide humanitarian assistance 

                inside the borders of Iraq. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We are effectively 

                being shut out of central and southern Iraq, and the rules are 

                still restrictive for Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq," said 

                George Rupp, president of the International Rescue Committee. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Even in the 

                middle of a looming humanitarian crisis," he said, "aid organizations 

                are subject to rules that rival the IRS Code in complexity and 

                that require licenses and permissions from separate government 

                agencies that take days or even weeks to obtain. The amount of 

                red tape is completely counterproductive." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The rules 

                continue in force, and the U.S. government has given no indication 

                that they will promptly lifted, Rupp said. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The government 

                has partially lifted the restrictions as they apply to privately 

                funded aid for northern Iraq, but the remaining rules are complicated 

                and difficult to navigate. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">UN agencies 

                say there may be massive refugee flows toward or into Iran, and 

                U.S. sanctions bar humanitarian operations there as well. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"President 

                Bush can resolve the problem with the stroke of a pen," Rupp said. 

                "We urge him to do so immediately. The lives and well-being of 

                innocent civilians are at stake." </font>
