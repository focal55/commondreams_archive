                25 - Amnesty International called today on all sides of the conflict 

                to treat prisoners of war (POWs) in full conformity with the Third 

                Geneva Convention. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"They should 

                be treated humanely and not be subjected to any form of torture 

                or ill-treatment and should be given immediate access to the International 

                Committee of the Red Cross," Amnesty International said. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We demand 

                that the governments of Iraq, US and the UK respect the laws of 

                war and to treat all detainees in conformity with the Geneva Convention," 

                the organization emphasized. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On 23 March, 

                following the exposure of the US soldiers -- captured by Iraqi 

                forces during the US-led attack on Iraq -- on Iraqi television 

                being interrogated, President George Bush as well as prime minister 

                Tony Blair accused Iraq of breaching the Geneva Convention by 

                showing the captured on TV and demanded fair treatment for the 

                POWs. The same principle applies to Iraqi prisoners of war. Iraqi 

                officials stated that they will respect the Geneva Convention.

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On the same 

                day, however, about 30 more detainees were flown from Afghanistan 

                to the US Naval Base in Guantánamo Bay in Cuba. This brought to 

                about 660 the number of foreign nationals from approximately 40 

                countries held in the base. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Despite many 

                requests, we are still denied access to Bagram and Guantánamo 

                Bay prisons and once again we call upon US government to address 

                Amnesty International's concerns about the detainees", the organization 

                added. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">" In addition, 

                we call for a full, impartial inquiry into allegations of torture 

                and ill-treatment by US personnel against alleged al-Qa'ida and 

                Taleban detainees held in US Air Base in Bagram, Afghanistan".

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Amnesty International 

                also called on all media to ensure in its use of images that the 

                dignity of all prisoners of war, whether Iraqi or US or other, 

                is respected. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>According 

                to the Third Geneva Convention, prisoners of war "are entitled 

                in all circumstances to respect for their persons and their honour" 

                (Article 14) and "must at all times be protected, particularly 

                against acts of violence or intimidation and against insults and 

                public curiosity" (Article 13). Torture or inhuman treatment of 

                prisoners of war is a grave breach of the Convention (Article 

                130). Each party to the Convention has an obligation to search 

                for those suspected of having committed such breaches and bring 

                them to justice before its own courts or hand them over for trial 

                to another party (Article 129). </i></font>

                <i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When the 

                first of the detainees arrived in Guantánamo in January 2002, 

                the Pentagon released a photograph of the detainees in orange 

                jumpsuits, kneeling before US soldiers, shackled, handcuffed, 

                and wearing blacked-out goggles over their eyes and masks over 

                their mouths and noses. The photograph shocked world opinion and 

                led Secretary Rumsfeld to acknowledge that it was "probably unfortunate" 

                that the picture had been released, at least without better captioning. 

                He added: "My recollection is that there's something in the Geneva 

                Conventions about press people being around prisoners; that -- 

                and not taking pictures and not saying who they are and not exposing 

                them to ridicule" (Department of Defence News Briefing - Secretary 

                Rumsfeld and Gen. Pace, 22 January 2002) </font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
