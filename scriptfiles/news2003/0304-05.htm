                - March 4 - In a speech today before the AMA, President Bush outlined 

                his proposed framework for new Medicare and prescription drug 

                coverage legislation. The following is the statement of Ron Pollack, 

                executive director of Families USA, concerning the President's 

                proposal: </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"President 

                Bush's latest Medicare and prescription drug proposal is the same 

                old tune and is way off key for America's seniors. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The proposal 

                would still coerce seniors away from the traditional Medicare 

                program and into a privatized system. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Under the 

                initial proposal, seniors in traditional Medicare would not have 

                been provided with any drug coverage. Under the new plan, seniors 

                in traditional Medicare would receive coverage only after they 

                spend thousands, and perhaps many of thousands of dollars, out 

                of their own pockets on drugs - a cost that the vast majority 

                of seniors cannot afford. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"As a practical 

                matter, therefore, the new plan, just like the first one, will 

                leave seniors without drug coverage unless they drop traditional 

                Medicare for a private plan. In the process, they may lose the 

                doctors that have served them well. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Seven out 

                of eight seniors are in the traditional Medicare program today. 

                Coercing them into a privatized system to get the medicines they 

                need is shortsighted. Private plans have refused to serve seniors 

                in most rural areas; have abandoned 2.4 million seniors in 'unprofitable' 

                communities; and, in the private plans that do exist, seniors 

                are experiencing fast-rising premiums and shrinking benefits. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Make no mistake, 

                this proposal is a clear effort to privatize the Medicare program. 

                Seniors in this new privatized Medicare will no longer have a 

                guarantee of specific benefits and defined coverage. Once again, 

                the President's proposal fails to offer seniors a meaningful drug 

                benefit in the Medicare program."
