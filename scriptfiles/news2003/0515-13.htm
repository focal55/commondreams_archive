- May 15 - &quot;Instead of the traditional second anniversary gift of cotton, the Bush

Administration is giving billions of dollars to polluting industries and

Americans get energy market manipulation, more pollution for our land, air

and water, and increased dependence on oil,&quot; said Debbie Boger, Sierra

Club's Washington Representative for Global Warming and Energy.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Every American deserves a safe, clean, and affordable energy future.

Fortunately, the technology exists to get us there.  But the Bush

Administration and Congressional leadership are taking us down the wrong

path with a destructive, expensive, and polluting energy bill.  Much of the

bill stems from the Bush Administration's Energy Task Force plan, announced

two years ago and developed in secret with the help of energy industry

officials.  Below is an update on the Sierra Club lawsuit to make public

information about those closed-door meetings.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Cheney Energy Task Force: On January 29, 2001 President Bush

established the National Energy Policy Development Group, better known as

the &quot;Cheney Energy Task Force.&quot;  Formally, the Energy Task Force included

the Vice President and the Secretaries of Energy, Commerce, Interior,

Transportation, Agriculture, Treasury, and the EPA Administrator. According

to media accounts, energy industry leaders extensively participated in the

Task Force.  As a result, the Energy Policy heavily favors these

industries; indeed, some parts of the Policy expressly mimic industry

proposals.  On May 16, 2001 the Task Force issued its recommendations for a

&quot;National Energy Policy&quot; and Congress is now considering an Energy Bill

based on these proposals.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Latest Appeal in Sierra Club suit heard on April 17, Decision Expected in

the Next Few Weeks: Sierra Club is suing Vice President Cheney and the

Energy Task Force under the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA).  The

group seeks an accounting of energy industry participation in crafting the

Bush Administration's destructive energy policy, which relies on subsidies

to polluting and outdated fossil fuel industries.  Last year, the District

Court ordered the Bush Administration to provide information about

participation from these industries, which the Bush Administration refused

to do, claiming Constitutional immunity from such inquiries.  The District

Court rejected that contention, pointing out that the Administration was

attempting to &quot;cloak what is tantamount to an aggrandizement of Executive

power with the legitimacy of precedent where none exists.&quot;  The

Administration appealed and is now asking the D.C. Circuit to make new law

that would effectively shield it from any legal scrutiny.   At a hearing

for the D.C. Circuit court, the panel of judges chastised the Bush

Administration's defense.  Judge Harry T. Edwards told the Administration's

lawyers, &quot;You pretend there's no law on the books,&quot; and &quot;You have no case.&quot;

A decision for the court is expected within a few weeks.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA): Congress enacted FACA to

regulate precisely this sort of special interest influence over government

policy.  FACA requires advisory committees to open their meetings and

records to the public.  If Sierra Club prevails, the Administration will

have to disclose extensive information about Task Force membership, actions

and records.   With Court approval, Sierra Club has asked for information

about energy industry participation in the Task Force.  The Bush

Administration point-blank refused to respond, arguing instead that the

Constitution categorically prohibits such inquiries.  When the District

Court rejected this argument, the Administration brought this appeal.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Other Requests For Information: Sierra Club's case has been consolidated

with a FACA case brought by Judicial Watch.  In addition, the General

Accounting Office (GAO) also sued (under a different law), seeking similar

information. (GAO's case was dismissed in December, 2002, and GAO did not

appeal.)  Finally, the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) used the

Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) to seek information from various agencies

about the Task Force.  When these agencies did not comply with FOIA, NRDC

sued, and its case is currently pending in federal district court.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">          <b>Energy Bill Takes Us Backward -- America Can Do Better</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Energy Policy Act of 2003 threatens the environment and takes us

backwards by entrenching our dependence on polluting sources of energy.

From opening up our coasts and special places to oil development, to

removing key consumer protections in electricity markets, to funneling

billions of dollars to polluting industries, this bill fails on all counts.

Instead of an energy bill that takes us backwards, the country needs an

energy policy that cuts our dependence on oil, increases our use of clean,

renewable energy sources like wind and solar power and protects our special

places from drilling.  The current bill is even worse than last year's

energy bill and should not be passed.  The Sierra Club calls on the Senate

to reject this irresponsible and environmentally destructive legislation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*    Threatens our coasts and other public lands.  The bill allows new oil

exploration all along the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) using invasive

technologies that will damage sea life and ocean habitat in environmentally

sensitive areas.  In addition, the bill would open our public lands to

further destructive drilling and mining operations.  These provisions

threaten some of our nation's most unique wilderness areas and critical

fish and wildlife habitats that provide the headwaters for most of the

drinking water in the West.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*    Puts consumers at risk from electricity market manipulation.  The bill

repeals the nation's oldest law that protects electricity consumers -- the

Public Utilities Holding Company Act (PUHCA).  This would allow power

companies to set up multiple subsidiaries and blur their financial reports,

opening the door to the type of market manipulation that was seen during

the California energy crisis.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*    Funnels billions of dollars to polluting industries.  The bill

provides close to 10.7 billion dollars in tax breaks to polluters,

including a first-ever tax break for burning coal.  In addition, the bill

provides tens of billions of dollars in loan guarantees to build new

nuclear plants and indefinitely exempts the nuclear industry from

liability.  The bill also allows the oil and gas industry to stop or reduce

royalty payments to the government and states at a time when they are in a

fiscal crisis.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*    Undermines the property rights of farmers and ranchers by providing

incentives for destructive coalbed methane drilling that ignores the rights of surface property owners.  This practice threatens thousands of acres ofsensitive lands in the West and its scarce water resources.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*    Removes environmental protections for Native American lands.  The billremoves the protections of the nation's hallmark environmental law, the

Nation Environmental Protection Act, from Native American lands, opening them up to destructive mining and drilling projects.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*    Does nothing to cut the nation's dangerous dependence on oil. The

country's dependence on oil threatens our national security and our

environment.  There are many opportunities to cut our oil consumption

economy wide, particularly from the biggest consumers -- our cars and

trucks. Making new cars and trucks go further on a gallon of gas is the

biggest single step we can take to curbing our dependence on oil.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*    Does nothing to increase our use of clean, renewable energy.  The bill

fails to include a Renewable Energy Standard (RES) that would ensure that

more of our electricity comes from clean, renewable energy sources likewind and solar power.  Encouraging the use of clean, renewable energy would

reduce air pollution and global warming emissions that threaten public

health.</font></p>
