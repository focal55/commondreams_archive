- June 19 - 

Today, Rep. Lynn Woolsey (D-CA) announced her endorsement of Dennis 

Kucinich for President.  A leader in the U.S. House on issues ranging 

from children, families and women's rights to peace, nuclear 

non-proliferation and economic justice, Woolsey represents a Northern 

California district in which Kucinich has campaigned often since joining the race several months ago.  Woolsey and Kucinich have worked closely on many issues as leaders of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The issues Dennis Kucinich fights for are the issues I fight for,&quot; said Rep. Woolsey. &quot;He supports peace, civil rights and the fight for working families that are important to me and the people of Marin and Sonoma 

Counties.  If my district were the whole country, Dennis Kucinich could 

certainly be our next president.  He offers the sharpest contrast to 

George W. Bush of any candidate running, and we appreciate that 

distinction.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Woolsey continued: &quot;I have worked with Rep. Kucinich over the past seven years and helped him evolve regarding reproductive choice. He has always supported women -- now, he supports their reproductive rights as well.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Candidate Kucinich welcomed the endorsement, saying: &quot;It is an honor to be supported by Lynn Woolsey, a strong advocate for social justice and 

equal rights.  Her endorsement reinforces my view that California, with 

its progressive leadership and voters, will be a springboard for me to 

the Democratic nomination.&quot;</font></p>
