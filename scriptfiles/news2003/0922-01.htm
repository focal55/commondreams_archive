<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- September 19 - As World Bank representatives gather in Dubai Sept 18-24 for the 2003 World Bank/IMF Annual Meetings, three key environmental organisations today released a report in response to the World Bank's new &quot;high risk/high reward&quot; strategy in the water, forestry, and extractive industries sectors. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

The report, &acute;Gambling With People's Lives&acute;, analyzes the World Bank's ability to manage social and environmental risks in high-risk projects and to learn from its past mistakes. The report was produced jointly by environmental Defense, Friends of the Earth, and International Rivers Network and is available at <a href="http://www.irn.org" target="_new">www.irn.org</a></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The World Bank is playing a reckless, high-stakes game of roulette, where the poor - and not the Bank - stand to lose big,&quot; said Environmental Defense policy analyst Shannon Lawrence. &quot;While the Bank and private 

investors are shielded from project risk, the communities affected by its 

projects have no such guarantees.&quot; </font>

</p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One of the Bank's most important environmental reforms of the 1990s was its 

more cautious approach to high-risk infrastructure and forestry projects. 

This policy is now being reversed. The World Bank recently announced that 

it would re-engage in contentious water projects such as large dams in what 

it refers to as a &quot;high risk/high reward&quot; strategy. In 2002, the Bank 

dismissed its &quot;risk-averse&quot; approach to the forest sector when it approved 

a new forest policy. The World Bank is also considering support for new 

oil, mining, and gas projects in unstable and poorly governed countri es, 

against the recommendations of its own evaluation unit. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Big is beautiful again, and in spite of their abysmal track record, 

megaprojects are back in style at the World Bank,&quot; says Peter Bosshard, 

policy director at International Rivers Network. &quot;The Bank's new high-risk 

strategy will prolong the deadlock in important sectors such as water and 

electricity, and will block the development of sustainable alternatives.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Large dam, forestry, and extractive industries projects funded by the 

World Bank have displaced millions of people and devastated the 

environment,&quot; said Carol Welch, international program director at Friends 

of the Earth. &quot;The Bank's spotty implementation of its inadequate safeguard 

policies means that communities and the environment will continue to face 

the greatest risks in World Bank projects.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report recommends, among other things, that the World Bank repair the 

damage caused by its pre vious high-risk projects, stay away from new 

high-risk projects, and address the human rights dimensions of its work.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report will be presented on Monday, September 22 at the Dubai Convention Center, Room G-01 from 11:00 am-12:00 pm. </font></p>
