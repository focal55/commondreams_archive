                - April 2 - The U.S. power sector can cut carbon dioxide emissions 

                that contribute to global warming nearly 60 percent by 2020 and 

                reduce its dependency on dirty fossil fuels by using available 

                energy technologies and supporting innovative polices, according 

                to a new peer-reviewed analysis released today by World Wildlife 

                Fund. Based upon the new research findings, WWF is launching PowerSwitch!, 

                an initiative that challenges electric utilities to make specific 

                policy and performance commitments that begin the transition to 

                a CO2-free power sector. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"U.S. electricity 

                companies have the power to play a major role in solving the global 

                warming problem, if they choose to take responsible steps to meet 

                this risk," said Katherine Silverthorne, director of WWF's Climate 

                Change Program. "To ensure that power companies take action while 

                we still have time to avoid dangerous levels of global warming, 

                WWF is challenging them to commit now to a clean energy future."

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Electricity 

                production is responsible for about 40 percent of U.S. CO2 emissions. 

                These emissions, caused by the burning of dirty fossil fuels like 

                coal, oil, and gas, build up in the atmosphere, blanket the Earth 

                and trap in heat, causing global warming. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to 

                WWF's new analysis, the U.S. electricity sector has a tremendous 

                opportunity to cost-effectively cut its CO2 emissions by increasing 

                energy efficiency and using renewable energy. Specifically, the 

                report finds that -- by dramatically increasing energy efficiency 

                and using a diversified energy generation portfolio that reduces 

                reliance on coal and gas and increase use of renewable energy, 

                power companies can reduce electric sector CO2 emissions by 59 

                percent between now and 2020; -- under the same scenario, the 

                savings in the electricity bills of consumers and businesses would 

                exceed costs by more than $80 billion per year in 2020; and -- 

                adoption of complementary national policies that support the transition 

                to clean energy will increase cost effectiveness and encourage 

                appropriate decisions in regard to capital investment. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Building on 

                these findings, WWF is launching PowerSwitch!, an initiative that 

                will work to identify leaders in the electricity sector that will 

                help achieve this clean energy future. To identify these leading 

                companies, WWF is challenging U.S. electric utilities to -- support 

                binding limits on national/power sector CO2 emissions; and -- 

                commit to one of the following changes in their own business: 

                a. 20 percent of electricity sold will be from new renewables 

                by 2020; or b. energy efficiency will be increased by 15 percent 

                by 2020; or c. least efficient half of coal generation retired 

                by 2020. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WWF will propose 

                this challenge to specific power sector companies that can trigger 

                a switch for the entire electricity sector. This will require 

                the participation of numerous types of utilities including major, 

                multi-state companies, municipal utilities, and rural utilities 

                in a variety of geographic regions. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The WWF analysis 

                is based on the widely accepted National Energy Modeling System 

                of the U.S. Department of Energy, Energy Information Administration. 

                The authors refined the NEMS model with advice from EIA, based 

                on ongoing model improvements and drawing on expert advice from 

                colleagues at the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, 

                Union of Concerned Scientists, and National Laboratories among 

                others. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Who says we 

                can't have the energy services we want without the pollution that 

                causes global warming?" said Silverthorne. "It's time to harness 

                the ingenuity and gumption that led America to put a man on the 

                moon, eradicate polio, and revolutionize information technology 

                to ensure that we surmount the greatest environmental threat of 

                our time-global warming." </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The results 

                of WWF's analysis are in line with the results of a study that 

                appeared in the March 28 issue of the journal Science. According 

                to the Science article, major reductions in carbon emissions from 

                the energy sector are needed to control global warming now, no 

                matter what the climate uncertainty is. The researchers found 

                that within the predicted ranges of climate sensitivity, stabilization 

                of warming at safe levels would require that global power production 

                be 75 percent to 100 percent CO2-free by the end of the century.
