<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - June 23 -  The House committee responsible for funding medical care programs for women and children with HIV/AIDS proposed millions of dollars in cuts Thursday.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Labor, Health and Human Services, Education Appropriations Subcommittee passed an appropriations bill Thursday that cut $2.6 million out of Title IV of the Ryan White CARE Act. This significant decrease comes just two months after the Centers for Disease Control announced a broad new initiative to get more people with HIV diagnosed and into care. It also comes at a time when programs providing health care for people with AIDS are already overburdened and stretching funds to meet basic needs.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Title IV programs are already stretched beyond capacity,&quot; said David C. Harvey, executive director of AIDS Alliance. &quot;For each of the past three years they have been asked to do more with less. If enacted, these cuts will rip down the care system we have struggled so hard to build. The House proposal gives the largest cut to the smallest program. Its unconscionable.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Title IV is the smallest program under the umbrella of the Ryan White CARE Act. But it is the only program that focuses solely on the needs of women, children, youth and families. Young people comprise half of all new HIV infections, and women account for a continually increasing percentage of new infections. With 40,000 new infections every year, cutting funding will be detrimental to the short- and long-term health of people eligible to receive Title IV services.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;These programs provide services to more than 50,000 women, adolescents and children living with HIV/AIDS each year,&quot; said Ivy Turnbull, president of AIDS Alliance. &quot;Funding cuts will have life and death consequences for our families. Title IV provides services for our most vulnerable families-these are very low-income women and kids without adequate health insurance. Title IV is their lifeline.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Title IV of the Ryan White CARE Act provides family-centered care and support services to women, children, youth and families affected by HIV/AIDS.</font></p>
