                - March 19 - As the world readies itself for imminent military 

                action by the United States, Britain, Spain and some other allies 

                to remove Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein from power, an international 

                poll of adults in the G-7 countries plus Russia and Spain released 

                today indicates that the United States very much stands alone. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The survey 

                was conducted between February 28 and March 8, 2003 among 1,000 

                respondents in each of the United States, France, Japan, Spain, 

                Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy and Russia. The sample 

                for each country is considered accurate within +/-3.1%, nineteen 

                times out of twenty. All countries were polled using random telephone 

                methodology, with the exception of Russia where interviews were 

                conducted on a face-to-face basis. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With United 

                States President George Bush having given the Iraqi leader an 

                ultimatum of 48 hours to leave the country or face swift military 

                conflict, President Bush may be reflecting the views of a majority 

                of Americans (61%) -- that Saddam Hussein should be removed from 

                power as soon as possible, by force if necessary -- but not of 

                those traditional allied populations in Canada, France or the 

                United Kingdom. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When adults 

                in four of the countries - Canada, France, U.K. and the U.S. - 

                are given a choice between removing Saddam Hussein from power 

                as soon as possible, by force if necessary, or extending the U.N. 

                inspections process by at least four months and perhaps much longer, 

                majorities in Canada (53%), the United Kingdom (55%) and France 

                (66%) choose the United Nations inspections route over immediate 

                removal by force. This is in contrast with a third (32%) of Americans 

                who favor extended inspections. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As for removing 

                the Iraqi leader from power as soon as possible, by force if necessary, 

                those in France offer the least support (28%) followed then by 

                the United Kingdom (39%) and Canada (41%). All interviews were 

                completed before President Bush issued his 48-hour ultimatum to 

                Saddam Hussein and his sons. Adults in each of the nine countries 

                were also asked whether the foreign policies of the government 

                in their country should aim to draw closer to U.S. policies or 

                seek more distance from the U.S. (In the U.S., respondents were 

                asked whether the policies of other countries should seek more 

                distance or draw closer to U.S. policies.) </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While a full 

                majority of Americans (76%) believe that the foreign policies 

                of other governments in the coming years should be closer to those 

                of the United States as opposed to those which distance themselves 

                more from U.S. policy (15%), it's clear that the United States 

                stands alone in this wish, as well. Of the other eight major countries 

                surveyed, citizens in a majority of five of the countries want 

                their own governments to distance themselves more from the United 

                States, while three other countries essentially split or tilt 

                towards distancing themselves from the U.S. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This trend 

                is most evident in France (67% distance more from the U.S. versus 

                22% get closer to the U.S.), followed then by Japan (63% distance 

                versus 28% closer), Spain (60% distance versus 13% closer), Canada 

                (54% distance versus 38% closer) and the United Kingdom (52% distance 

                versus 36% closer). </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Germany is 

                split with 46% urging their government policies to get closer 

                to the U.S. versus 44% who want to distance themselves. Italy 

                (40% distance versus 37% closer) and Russia (37% distance versus 

                25% closer) split but tilt towards distance. (The numbers above 

                do not add up to 100% because of the don't know category and a 

                volunteered depends category). </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In its foreign 

                policy approach in the coming years, should the government in

                get closer to the U.S. or distance itself more from the U.S.?

                findings of an Ipsos poll conducted between February 28th and 

                March 8, 2003. The poll is based on a randomly selected sample 

                of 1,000 respondents in each of the United States, France, Japan, 

                Spain, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy and Russia. 

                With a sample of this size, the results are considered accurate 

                in each country to within +/-3.1 percentage points, 19 times out
