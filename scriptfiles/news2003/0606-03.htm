- June 6 - The Selma community, as many as 200 volunteers from across the U.S., and a leader from the National League of Cities will help kickoff a community-wide effort to improve homes for low-income, senior, and disabled residents of Selma June 8-14.

</font>

<p></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An estimated 30 local residents will benefit from the work of the adult and teen volunteers at the Deep South Workcamp. The location of the workcamp is Ward 8, the Weed and Seed Target Area. The workcamp will provide free home repairs through the Group Workcamp program, sponsored locally by the Jonathan Daniels Community Development Corporation, the City of Selma Weed and Seed, and Selma High School. Repairs offered through the workcamp include limited roofing, porch and wheelchair ramp construction, interior and exterior painting, weatherization, and other work.

<p></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The citizens of Selma are privileged to have Deep South Workcamp volunteers in Selma," said James Perkins, mayor of Selma. "Through this volunteer home repair program, our citizens are receiving direct benefits from our relationship. From the city to all participants and stakeholders, thank you. And to the families who will benefit, congratulations."

</font>

<p></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"This represents about 6,400 hours of volunteer labor - worth at least $40,000 - to the community," said Joyce M. Kendrick, executive director of the Jonathan Daniels Community Development Corporation.

</font>

<p></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A kickoff at Selma High School (2180 Broad St.) will be held on June 9 at 8 a.m. featuring Mayor James Perkins, representatives from the Jonathan Daniels Community Development Corporation, the City of Selma, the Group Workcamps Foundation, and the National League of Cities.

</font>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">James Hunt, city councilmember for Clarksburg, West Virginia, and representing the National League of Cities, will attend the kickoff on Monday. Hunt chairs NLC's Advisory Council and he is manager of the West Virginia Housing Development Fund's Clarksburg Office. The National League of Cities has provided technical assistance to nearly 30 cities around the country since 1998 in its Strengthening Partnerships for Housing Opportunities Program.
