- May 13 - During a House Armed Services Committee markup session on Tuesday, Representative Curt Weldon is expected to offer an amendment to the 2004 Defense Authorization Bill cutting the F/A-22 jet’s budget by $161 million. POGO’s Executive Director Danielle Brian sent a letter commending Senate and House Armed Services Committees, stating: “We are encouraged now more than ever that Congress will restore accountability to a weapons system that is overpriced, under tested and unneeded to fight the wars of the present and future.” Full text of the letter is below.

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Representative Weldon told Aerospace Daily last week that he also wants language in the bill that would require the Air Force to solve reliability problems with the aircraft’s avionics before it purchases the last of 22 aircraft during FY 2004. The Senate Armed Services Committee has reportedly passed language slashing the F/A-22 2004 budget by $217 million and reduces the number of aircraft purchased next fiscal year from 22 to 20, according to the Dallas Morning News.

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">POGO has published several reports on its investigations into the troubled F/A-22 program that can be viewed at: <a href="http://www.pogo.org/p/defense/defsubmain.html#f22" target="_new">http://www.pogo.org/p/defense/defsubmain.html#f22</a>. One report predicted that because of skyrocketing costs, the Air Force would only be able to purchase 100 to 175 F/A-22s to replace the fleet of 1,600 F-16s.

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dear Senators Warner and Levin and Representatives Hunter and Skelton:



 

</font>

<p></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Project On Government Oversight commends your efforts in the Armed Services Committees to cut funding and bring greater accountability to the overpriced and under tested F/A-22 fighter aircraft program.



 

</font>

<p></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Not only is the F/A-22 experiencing mammoth technological problems, but its costs continue to increase while the number of aircraft planned for purchase has significantly declined. According to Pentagon figures released last month, program costs increased by more than $2 billion during the last quarter of 2002 even as the number of aircraft to be purchased declined by 63. As you know, the per aircraft cost of the F/A-22 has now reached $258 million and is a recognized poster child of sorts for bad acquisition practices, according to U.S. Comptroller General David Walker.

</font>

<p></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We understand that Under Secretary of Defense E.C. “Pete” Aldridge was only a half-step from recommending cancellation of the F/A-22 program but was unable to muster adequate support within the Department of Defense. It appears that now Congress is on the brink of taking a number of measures to ensure the taxpayers and the nation’s fighting men and women get the product they were promised.



 

</font>

<p></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The DoD hasn’t been able to bring the F/A-22 program into line. We are encouraged now more than ever that Congress will restore accountability to a weapons system that is overpriced, under tested and unneeded to fight the wars of the present and future.



 

</font>

<p></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sincerely, 



 



 



Danielle Brian,



Executive Director
