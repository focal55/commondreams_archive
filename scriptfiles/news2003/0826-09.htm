- August 26 - Greens called the recent

publication of two articles in major medical journals

on the need for single-payer national health insurance

an enormous advance in the movement for universal

health care.  The articles appeared in the New England

Journal of Medicine (NEJM) and the Journal of the

American Medical Association (JAMA) in August.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Since the mid 90s, 40 to 45 million Americans have

lacked health coverage, and millions more have

suffered inadequate coverage,&quot; said John Battista,

M.D., of the Green Party of Connecticut, president of

the Connecticut Coalition For Universal Health Care. &quot;The U.S. ranks only 37th in the world in quality of

health care.  Republicans and most Democrats have

offered minimal reform schemes that leave HMOs,

insurance firms, the pharmaceutical industry, and

other corporate lobbies in control of our medical

treatment, prescriptions, referrals, etc.  HMOs and

insurance firms impose extra expenses in the form of administrative overhead to guarantee their profits. 

They make money by excluding high-risk people from

coverage and by limiting the care received by those

with coverage.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;National health insurance -- also called

single-payer, Medicare for All, and Just Health Care

-- eliminates this inefficient and wasteful middle

entity, and transfers ownership of health coverage to

the public,&quot; Dr. Battista added. &quot;That's why Greens

support it, while Democrats and Republicans have been compromised by their allegiance to HMO and insurance lobbies.  National health insurance would save most Americans, especially middle and low income people, a lot of money, and would save the U.S. up to $200 billion.  It would ensure care for all, regardless of ability to pay, age, or prior medical condition, and would cover long term care and prescriptions.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greens in numerous states, from Maine to California,

have worked to pass statewide plans based on a

single-payer model similar to the Canada's national

health care system.  The platform of the Green Party

of the United States endorses single-payer coverage. 

Many Greens are urging passage of a House bill for

single-payer introduced by Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.)

on February 4, titled &quot;The United States National

Health Insurance Act&quot; (HR 676).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The articles in NEJM and JAMA add professional muscle

to the popular movement for genuine universal health

care,&quot; said Jason Crane, Green candidate for the City

Council of Rochester, New York.  &quot;After the

endorsement of national health insurance by 8,000

physicians, including two former surgeon generals, the corporate lobbies and apologists can no longer argue that doctors don't support it.  What we need now are people in Congress and in state legislatures who are willing to stand up to the lobbyists -- Greens and others who refuse corporate contributions, and perhaps get into public office with the help of 'clean elections' funding that's available in some states.&quot;</font></p>
