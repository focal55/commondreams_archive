                - March 31 - The record of Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Carolyn 

                Kuhl, nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit 

                by President Bush, demonstrates that her confirmation would pose 

                a grave threat to the rights and interests of ordinary Americans. 

                Kuhl’s record throughout her career as a lawyer and a judge reflects 

                hostility to women’s rights and reproductive freedom, other civil 

                rights and access to justice.</font> 

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“Carolyn 

                  Kuhl exemplifies the dangers of allowing President Bush to pack 

                  the courts with judges who would have a devastating effect on 

                  the rights of ordinary Americans,” said People For the American 

                  Way President Ralph G. Neas. “As a Reagan administration official, 

                  a private attorney and a judge, Carolyn Kuhl has followed a 

                  legal philosophy harmful to the rights of individuals seeking 

                  justice. Her nomination should be rejected.”</font>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PFAW today 

                  released a <a href="http://www.pfaw.org/pfaw/general/default.aspx?oid=9591" target="_new">report</a> 

                  providing detailed analysis of Kuhl’s record as an attorney 

                  and a judge for the last 22 years. The report examines Kuhl’s 

                  record in her current position as a Los Angeles County Superior 

                  Court judge, as well as during her time as a Reagan administration 

                  Justice Department official and a private attorney representing 

                  defense contractors and other corporate interests. “From the 

                  bench, from the bar and at the Department of Justice, Kuhl has 

                  been an obstacle for individuals seeking justice,” said Neas.

                  from the report: </font>

                <p>

                <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At the 

                  Reagan Justice Department, Kuhl helped orchestrate the Reagan 

                  administration’s reversal of a long-standing IRS policy that 

                  denied tax exempt status to private schools that practice race 

                  discrimination, including Bob Jones University. Her position 

                  was soundly repudiated by the Supreme Court in an 8-1 ruling.</font> 

                  <p>

                <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Kuhl urged 

                  the filing of and then co-authored a brief in a U.S. Supreme 

                  Court case calling for “outright reversal” of Roe v. Wade. The 

                  Court rejected Kuhl’s attack on the landmark ruling. </font> 

                  <p>

                <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Kuhl co-authored 

                  an amicus curiae brief in the Supreme Court advocating a position 

                  that would have made it harder for women to prove sexual harassment 

                  in the workplace. The Court unanimously rejected Kuhl’s position.</font> 

                  <p>

                <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a move 

                  that would have undermined the ability of citizens to vindicate 

                  their legal rights, Kuhl on behalf of the Department of Justice 

                  urged the Supreme Court to reverse well-settled law allowing 

                  associations to file lawsuits on behalf of their members. Kuhl’s 

                  attack on this critical doctrine was met with opposition from 

                  groups as ideologically diverse as the AMA, the NAACP, the Chamber 

                  of Commerce, the Chemical Manufacturers Association and the 

                  Sierra Club. The Supreme Court rejected Kuhl’s argument without 

                  dissent. </font> 

                  <p>

                <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Kuhl also 

                  testified as a DOJ official against legislation that would have 

                  given veterans the right to go to court when denied benefits. 

                  In her testimony, Kuhl stated that the federal courts, which 

                  often represent a citizens’ last best chance for justice, “are 

                  not the enchanted land where all wrongs will be made right.”</font> 

                  <p>

                <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As a private 

                  attorney, Kuhl filed an amicus curiae brief in the Supreme Court 

                  supporting efforts by the Virginia Military Institute, an all-male 

                  public institution, to continue to exclude women. The Court 

                  later ruled that VMI’s denial of admission to women violated 

                  the Equal Protection Clause. Kuhl also filed a brief supporting 

                  the “gag rule” prohibiting family clinics that receive federal 

                  funds from discussing abortion with patients.</font> 

                  <p>

                <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As a judge, 

                  Kuhl dismissed a breast cancer patient’s claim that her privacy 

                  had been violated when her physician permitted a male drug company 

                  salesperson to watch as he had the woman disrobe from the waist 

                  up and examined her breasts and abdomen. Kuhl ruled that “it 

                  cannot be said that there was a reasonable expectation of privacy” 

                  in this case. The California Court of Appeal unanimously overturned 

                  Kuhl’s ruling, making it clear that Kuhl had no legal basis 

                  for not allowing the women to present her case to a jury. </font> 

                  <p>

                <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Judge Kuhl 

                  was also unanimously reversed by the California Court of Appeal 

                  in a case involving a state law protecting whistleblowers and 

                  others who exercise their legal right to speak out in defense 

                  of the public good. In an opinion strongly critical of Kuhl’s 

                  decision, the Court of Appeal sternly stated that Kuhl’s ruling 

                  “constitutes a nullification of an important part” of the state 

                  statute. In another case, Kuhl reduced by more than $4 million 

                  the punitive damages awarded by a jury to a whistleblower who 

                  had been illegally fired. </font> 

                  <p>

                <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In another 

                  unanimous ruling by the California Court of Appeal reversing 

                  Judge Kuhl, the court overturned an order that would have harmed 

                  the ability of an injured railroad worker to pursue a damage 

                  claim against the railroad by prohibiting him from using a written 

                  statement obtained from a key witness in the case. </font> 

                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“Kuhl 

                    is a textbook example of the Bush administration campaign 

                    to pack the federal courts of appeal with right-wing judges 

                    whose legal philosophies are out of the mainstream,” said 

                    Neas. “Kuhl’s long record demonstrates she has already tried 

                    to turn back the clock on civil rights, women’s rights and 

                    access to justice. Giving her a lifetime position on the federal 

                    appellate bench would place her in an even more powerful position 

                    to jeopardize Americans’ rights for decades to come. Kuhl’s 

                    confirmation should be rejected.”</font></p>
