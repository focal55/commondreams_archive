                - March 4 - Responding to Attorney General John Ashcroft’s appearance 

                at a Senate hearing this morning, the American Civil Liberties 

                Union today reiterated its call on Congress to resist passage 

                of the proposed government surveillance bill known as PATRIOT 

                II. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Our nation 

                is poised on the brink of a dangerous new anti-civil liberties 

                era, and these escalating bids for expanded government power demand 

                close scrutiny," said Anthony Romero, Executive Director of the 

                ACLU, who traveled from the group’s headquarters in New York to 

                sit in on today’s hearing. "As the people’s representative, Congress 

                must ask Mr. Ashcroft the tough questions about his actions and 

                policies that undermine the fundamental values of our democracy." 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Senate 

                Judiciary Committee, chaired by Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT), convened 

                the hearing. While no groups or individuals were asked to testify, 

                the ACLU’s Romero attended in order to hear first-hand the Administration’s 

                justifications for its programs to spy on Americans. He cited 

                PATRIOT II and the CAPPS II program, the traveler surveillance 

                system that became the subject of debate last week after Delta 

                Airlines announced it would begin testing the system. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The uproar 

                about the new airline passenger blacklist known as CAPPS II highlights 

                the distaste Americans have for government spying," Romero said. 

                "CAPPS II threatens our liberty, but its security benefits are 

                far from clear. Like the hastily enacted USA PATRIOT Act, this 

                program fails to increase safety as it limits our core freedoms." 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PATRIOT II, 

                Romero said, is indicative of the prevailing disregard for fundamental 

                civil liberties and privacy rights both at the Department of Justice 

                and in the Bush Administration. The larger implications of the 

                bill, the ACLU said, include a severe diminishment of basic checks 

                and balances on the power of the executive branch and a continuing 

                love affair with untested and likely ineffective security measures 

                that infringe on basic liberties -- especially personal privacy 

                and the freedoms of speech, association and religion. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Both PATRIOT 

                II and CAPPS II are so unpopular that they have drawn the ire 

                of many right-leaning advocates and media personalities. Last 

                month, "card-carrying conservative" columnist William Safire called 

                the PATRIOT II proposal an "abomination," and warned, "Justice's 

                aim is to avoid judicial or Congressional control." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Congress must 

                not accept new legislation that threatens our constitutional rights 

                in the name of security against terrorism," Romero said. "In fact, 

                Congress should not only reject any new legislation, but it should 

                instead insist that the Bush Administration stop stonewalling 

                and outline how the new powers already given under the first USA 

                PATRIOT Act have been used." </font>
