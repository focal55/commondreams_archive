- November 24 - House members who helped to pass sweeping Medicare legislation in an early morning vote Saturday have been among the biggest beneficiaries of contributions from health insurers, HMOs and pharmaceutical manufacturers, three industries that stand to benefit financially if the bill becomes law.</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The bill, which the Senate may vote on as early as today, would restructure Medicare and create a long-awaited prescription drug benefit within the program. In doing so, the legislation would generate huge windfalls for the health care and pharmaceutical industries, which for months have been lobbying congressional leaders to shape the measure in ways palatable to them.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">After months of behind-the-scenes discussions among House and Senate negotiators, the House passed the bill by a vote of 220-215. An analysis of the votes and campaign contributions shows that lawmakers who voted to approve the legislation have raised an average of roughly twice as much since 1999 from individuals and PACs associated with health insurers, HMOs and pharmaceutical manufacturers as those who voted against the bill.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">When the recipients are broken down by party, different giving patterns emerge among the industries studied. Pharmaceutical manufacturers, for example, have averaged $28,504 to the 204 Republicans who supported the bill, but just $8,112 to the 25 Republicans who opposed it.  Pharmaceutical contributions to Democrats on both sides of the debate are less varied. The 16 Democrats who voted &quot;yes&quot; on the bill have raised an average of $16,296 from pharmaceutical manufacturers, while the 189 Democrats who voted &quot;no&quot; have raised an average of $11,791.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">If pharmaceutical manufacturers have been less consistent in their giving to Republicans than to Democrats, the opposite is true for health insurers. Their giving reflects a greater disparity among Democrats than among Republicans. Democrats who supported the bill have raised far more, on average, from health insurers ($22,376) than have Democrats who opposed the measure ($9,692). Republicans who supported the industry position have raised an average of $19,286 from health insurers, while Republicans who voted against the industry have raised an average of $13,828.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">HMOs have given roughly the same amount, on average, to Democrats who supported the bill ($11,654) and Republicans who voted for it ($11,576). Democrats who opposed the bill have raised an average of $6,840, as compared to the average $5,286 raised by Republicans who voted against it.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Overall, Rep. Mike Ferguson (R-N.J.) is the House's biggest recipient of money from pharmaceutical manufacturers since 1999, with $255,817 in individual and PAC contributions. Rep. Nancy Johnson (R-Conn.) has raised the most from HMOs, with $274,911. She is also the biggest recipient of contributions from health insurers, with $219,066. Ferguson and Johnson both voted for the bill.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In the Senate, Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) has raised more than any of his colleagues from pharmaceutical manufacturers ($307,524) since 1999. Connecticut senator and presidential candidate Joe Lieberman (D-Conn.) tops the recipients list of contributions from HMOs with $86,899. Sen. Max Baucus (Mont.), one of only two Democrats who were involved in House-Senate negotiations over the Medicare bill, leads the pack in contributions from health insurers with $116,399.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">(This report, including charts showing the campaign giving of pharmaceutical manufacturer, health insurance and HMO contributions to Congress, is available online at <A HREF="http://capitaleye.org/inside.asp?ID=113" TARGET="_new">http://capitaleye.org/inside.asp?ID=113</A>)</FONT></P><P></P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p></font><!-- #EndEditable --></td></tr>
