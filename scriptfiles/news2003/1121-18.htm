- November 21 - The Congressional &quot;compromise&quot; on Medicare is the latest attempt by the Republicans and the Bush Administration to sell the ailing American people a phony cure. Key Republican financial supporters are, once again, given a boost and seniors are left with a rancid turkey just in time for Thanksgiving.</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In a press conference held today, several Democratic Members of Congress stood together to reject this proposal. They seek broad input into a plan for Medicare revision that is stable and more easily implemented so that all participants will be helped. The beauty of Medicare, as it is currently constituted, is that everyone is guaranteed health coverage regardless of income level or health status. Forcing seniors into a private, experimental system would abandon the best of the current program. Representatives Bob Filner (D-CA), Jim McDermott (D-WA), Lynn Woolsey (D-CA), Dian Watson (D-CA), and Jan Schakowsky (D-IL) spoke.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The lasting effects of this complicated proposal will be higher costs for patients pushed out of traditional Medicare in favor of the ravenous private healthcare system as well as likely confusion and instability in coverage. Worse yet, desperate seniors are being told they will get significant relief from soaring prescription drug costs. Instead, they could still be forced to pay thousands of dollars for desperately-needed medication - a cruel hoax being played on those who need help the most.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">While gathered to highlight the problems with recently released Medicare legislation, Members of Congress also presented Thanksgiving turkeys to area seniors in as part of the event. &quot;The turkeys we are giving out today do far more good than the putrid diet the Republicans are cooking up for seniors. The only people feasting on this legislation are the pharmaceutical and private healthcare companies&quot;</FONT></P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p></font><!-- #EndEditable --></td></tr>
