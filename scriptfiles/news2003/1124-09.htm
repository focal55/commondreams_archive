Gerard, USWA international president, in a letter to Congressional leaders.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;It is condemnable enough that a massive police state was created to prevent American citizens from directly petitioning FTAA negotiators for redress of their grievances,&quot; Gerard said in the letter. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;It is doubly condemnable,&quot; he added, &quot;that $9 million of federal funds designated for the reconstruction of Iraq were used toward this despicable purpose. How can we hope to build democracy in Iraq while using massive force to dismantle it here at home?&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Citing &quot;countless instances of humiliating repression in which the Miami police force disgraced itself,&quot; Gerard said that Miami police chief John Timoney should be fired, all charges against peaceful demonstrators should be dropped, and a Congressional investigation into the Miami police department's systematic repression should immediately be launched.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;To do less would be to endorse homeland repression in the guise of homeland security,&quot; Gerard&#146;s letter concluded.</FONT></P><P></P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p></font><!-- #EndEditable --></td></tr>
