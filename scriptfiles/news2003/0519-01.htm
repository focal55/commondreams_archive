- May 19 - In an astonishing departure from positions taken by the US through four years of negotiations on the first global public health treaty, US Secretary of Health and Human Services Tommy Thompson yesterday pledged his support for the adoption of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC). The treaty's adoption is a centerpiece of the World Health Assembly (WHA), a meeting of member nations of the World Health Organization (WHO) that opens today and is scheduled to run through Wednesday, 28 May. The WHA is also slated to elect a new Director-General, Dr. Jong-Wook Lee, at a time of increasing prominence for the UN agency as it responds to the outbreak of SARS.

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The final draft of the FCTC, agreed in March by more than 170 countries, includes a comprehensive ban on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship and measures to protect public health policy from interference by tobacco giants like Philip Morris/Altria. Through diplomatic channels, the US recently sought to re-open negotiations and allow each country to pick and choose which obligations would apply to them-a move that the tobacco industry trade journal Tobacco International welcomed for its potential to “unravel the whole process.” Last week, 67 corporate accountability, public health, environmental, medical, consumer and faith-based organizations sent a letter to President George W. Bush protesting this tactic.

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“The rejection of US pressure to re-open the FCTC text is testimony to the commitment of developing countries who led the way to a treaty that will change the way tobacco transnationals Philip Morris/Altria, British American Tobacco (BAT) and Japan Tobacco International operate around the world,” said Akinbode Oluwafemi of Environmental Rights Action (Nigeria), a member of the Network for Accountability of Tobacco Transnationals (NATT). “Despite the powerful influence of Big Tobacco, the countries of Africa, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and the Pacific and Caribbean Islands stood firm for an FCTC that will protect current and future generations from a preventable epidemic.”

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Bush Administration has close ties to the tobacco industry. Secretary Thompson, who leads the US delegation to the WHA, maintained an open-door policy to Philip Morris/Altria and its Kraft subsidiary while serving as Wisconsin governor. “The world will be watching to ensure that the US follows through on this pledge to support the FCTC, and does not put the interests of the tobacco industry ahead of public health by obstructing the ratification and entry into force of this groundbreaking treaty,” says Kathryn Mulvey, Executive Director of Infact, a US-based member of NATT.

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The FCTC sets a new standard for global regulation of industries whose products or practices are harmful to public health. As transnational corporations like Philip Morris/Altria and BAT seek to create favorable public images, the WHO and other UN agencies face increasing scrutiny over their interactions with commercial enterprises. 

</font>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“A key issue facing the new Director-General will be the development and implementation of guidelines to ensure that public health remains paramount in WHO, and is insulated from conflicts of interest. The WHO under Dr. Brundtland directly challenged the tobacco industry's abusive practices and influence over public health policy. As Dr. Lee moves into this role, we will be calling on him to apply the precedents in the FCTC aggressively and innovately in advancing effective solutions to public health problems,” concludes Mulvey.
