- May 21 - Despite the 

vital importance of education to Americans, critical investments in 

U.S. public schools remain stagnant, according to a state-by-state 

report released today by the National Education Association (NEA). 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report, titled "Rankings & Estimates: Rankings of the States 

2002 and Estimates of School Statistics 2003," paints a difficult 

funding picture for public education nationwide. Despite rising 

enrollments and a growing need for qualified teachers in many areas 

of the country, the average expenditure per student 

(<a href="http://www.nea.org/newsreleases/2003/nr030521.html#t5" target="_new">http://www.nea.org/newsreleases/2003/nr030521.html#t5</a>) and 

average salary of a public school teacher 

(<a href="http://www.nea.org/newsreleases/2003/nr030521.html#t1" target="_new">http://www.nea.org/newsreleases/2003/nr030521.html#t1</a>) 

for the 2001-2002 school year increased only slightly over the 

previous year. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Over the last 10 years, teacher salaries have remained flat, 

growing just 2.4 percent during that time period, or approximately 

0.2 percent per year when the cost of living is factored in. 

Nineteen states and the District of Columbia saw real declines in 

average teacher salaries over the years 1991-92 to 2001-02, 

adjusted for inflation. Those with average salaries declining 5 

percent or more: Alaska (-13.6 percent), Connecticut (-11 percent), 

Vermont (-9 percent), Wisconsin (-6.4 percent), New York (-6.3 

percent), New Hampshire (-6.1 percent), Nevada (-6 percent), Kansas 

(-5.8 percent), and the District of Columbia (-5.3 percent) (Chart 

C-14). 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The study shows that the federal government's share of the 

public education dollar was 7.5 percent in 2001-2002 -- not enough 

to cover the cost of federally mandated education programs. State 

and local governments will need a larger share from the federal 

government in order to put the federal education mandates in place 

without sacrificing other programs. By failing to fully finance the 

new No Child Left Behind Act, which was enacted in 2002, the 

federal government will be undermining state and local governments' 

ability to find ways to attract qualified teachers into joining and 

staying in the profession, modernize existing schools and build new 

ones, and provide students with the programs, materials and books 

they need to meet the high standards envisioned by the new law. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Reg Weaver, president of the 2.7 million-member National 

Education Association, said that, even in the face of adversity, 

there is good news in our nation's public schools. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Even as the funding crunch gets worse, teachers and school 

staff around the country are performing daily miracles to help 

their students learn. Just to cite one positive result, almost 

half of last year's high school graduates took the SAT -- the 

highest percentage ever," noted Weaver. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"But to ensure that every child has what he or she needs to 

succeed - high-quality teachers, small class sizes, and safe and 

modern facilities - policymakers must step up now and provide the 

resources," he added.

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Highlights of the annual report include: 

-- Average per-pupil spending

the 2001-02 school year rose 3.5 percent to $7,548 - with 29 states 

below the average. The highest-ranking states were the District of 

Columbia, New York, and New Jersey. The lowest were North Dakota, 

Utah, and Arizona.

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- The average salary of a U.S. public school teacher for the 

2001-02 school year

3.0 percent since the previous year to $44,683 - with 37 states 

below the average. The highest-ranking states in teacher pay were 

California, Connecticut, and New Jersey. The lowest were South 

Dakota, North Dakota, and Mississippi. Over the previous entire 

decade, average salaries for teachers increased only 2.4 percent, 

in constant dollars.
