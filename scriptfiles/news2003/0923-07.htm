in supermarket milk at levels exceeding the federal government's

currently recommended safe dose for drinking water, according to a

peer-reviewed scientific study published today.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A team of five researchers from the Institute of Environmental and Human

Health at Texas Tech University report in the journal Environmental

Science and Technology that perchlorate was &quot;unambiguously detected&quot; in

seven of seven cow's milk samples from Lubbock grocery stores.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Perchlorate levels in the milk ranged from 1.7 to 6.4 parts per billion

- all higher than the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's most recent

proposed safety standard of 1 ppb. Enforceable federal standards are not

expected for at least five years, but the State of California has set 4

ppb of perchlorate as the &quot;action level&quot; at which a public water supply

should be shut down.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Perchlorate, the explosive main ingredient of solid rocket and missile

fuel, can disrupt the thyroid gland's ability to make essential

hormones. For fetuses, infants and children, disruptions in thyroid

hormone levels can cause lowered IQ, mental retardation, loss of hearing

and speech, and motor skill deficits.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Perchlorate, most of it leaking from military bases or defense plants,

contaminates more than 500 drinking water supplies in at least 20

states, serving well over 20 million people. Among major

perchlorate-polluted sources is the Colorado River, which is used to

irrigate 1.4 million acres of cropland in California and Arizona.

Earlier this year, a study for the Environmental Working Group,

conducted by the same team from Texas Tech, reported that about 1 in 5

samples tested of winter lettuce irrigated by the Colorado had

perchlorate levels averaging four times the EPA's draft safety standard. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;These troubling results are the first indication that perchlorate is

not only contaminating drinking water and irrigation water, but that

livestock can pass it on to humans,&quot; said EWG Senior Analyst Renee

Sharp. &quot;How much more evidence do we need before the government takes

action to protect our water, our food and our selves from this toxic chemical?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The milk samples represented six different brands, four packaged locally

at the same plant and two at separate plants outside Texas. Researchers

also found perchlorate in one sample of evaporated cow's milk (1 ppb)

and one sample of human breast milk (about 4 ppb), but none was found in

a sample of reconstituted powdered milk.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Levels of perchlorate in Lubbock-area drinking water range from below

the limit of detection to 4 ppb, with the average about 2.5 ppb.

Previous research by the Texas Tech scientists has shown that feed crops

such as alfalfa can take up and concentrate perchlorate to high levels.

The researchers have also documented perchlorate contamination of

field-grown wheat, blackberries, chinaberries, mulberries and in

lab-grown lettuce, soybeans, strawberries and cucumbers.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The significant occurrence of perchlorate in all milk samples analyzed

at levels that are comparable or even greater than the current

California action level for the concentration of perchlorate in drinking

water came as a considerable surprise to us,&quot; wrote the authors. &quot;Based

on this limited study, it is not clear how widespread perchlorate

contamination of milk may be, but clearly such a study is warranted.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">EWG renews its call for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and

Department of Agriculture to fast-track a definitive study of

perchlorate contamination in the U.S. food supply, and make all results

public. All future drinking water standards, such as those currently

under consideration by California, must adequately reflect the potential

for exposure through food. Farmers and ranchers must be fully

compensated for lost profits and property values.</font></p>
