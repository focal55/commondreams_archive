- May 1 - Today the National Marine 

Fisheries Service (NMFS) announced new rules aimed at, but falling 

short of, stopping the import of illegally caught Chilean Sea Bass 

(toothfish) into the United States. By deciding to take action 

with these new regulations that strengthen U.S. law, NMFS has 

acknowledged the seriousness of the problem of illegal toothfish 

entering the United States. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The new regulations ban the import of toothfish from two areas 

in the waters surrounding Antarctica that have long been recognized 

by the international governmental body that regulates the trade of 

Chilean Sea Bass, the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic 

Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), as &quot;laundering points&quot; for pirate 

fishermen who illegally catch fish inside CCAMLR's waters and then 

claim to have caught them in areas where it is scientifically 

unlikely that populations exist to support these claims. The new 

regulations also require that NMFS give pre-approval to all 

shipments of toothfish over 4,400 pounds prior to their landing at 

port. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;While we applaud NMFS's acknowledgement of the problem and 

their effort to stop the import of illegal toothfish into the U.S., it will fall far short of stopping the flood of illegal Chilean Sea 

Bass that winds up on dinner plates all across the country, which 

is why we are still encouraging chefs to stop serving this fish 

until there are safeguards in place to ensure that all the 

toothfish that enters this country has been legally caught,&quot; said 

Andrea Kavanagh, campaign manager for the National Environmental 

Trust's Take a Pass on Chilean Sea Bass campaign. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite estimates that conservatively put illegal catches of 

toothfish of at least 50 percent of the total annual worldwide 

catch, CCAMLR last fall authorized a significant increase in the 

total allowable catch in many areas. This pirate catch also results 

in the hooking and drowning of tens of thousands of seabirds. Over 

the past six years, at least 700,000 seabirds, including 144,000 

albatrosses and 378,000 white-chinned petrels have been killed in 

this manner. These loss rates are entirely unsustainable and 

several of these species are now highly endangered. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Unless the U.S. prohibits the import of catches claimed as 

being caught in unregulated high seas areas, NMFS will still not be 

able to prevent illegal toothfish from entering the U.S. even if it 

is accompanied by a validated catch-document,&quot; said Karen Sack, Fisheries Coordinator with The Antarctica Project. &quot;The pirate fishermen will just start claiming that their fish were caught in 

other high seas areas that are not regulated by the United States, 

like areas 41, 47 and 87.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Take a Pass on Chilean Sea Bass is a campaign organized by 

National Environmental Trust and The Antarctica Project with more 

than 1000 chefs in the United States that have pledged to stop 

serving Chilean Sea Bass until proper regulations are in place to 

ensure the commercial sustainability of the species. The next city of chefs who will announce their intentions to stop serving Chilean 

Sea Bass will be Miami, FL in mid-May. </font></p>
