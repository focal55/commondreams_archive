                RIVER, N.Y. - March 5 - Many of the nation's leading economists 

                today issued a statement opposing a unilateral U.S.-led war against 

                Iraq and warning policy makers and all Americans that long-term 

                U.S. and global economic security is at stake. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Released by 

                Economists Allied for Arms Reduction (ECAAR), a New York-based 

                research and policy organization, the statement is signed by seven 

                Nobel laureates and a large number of other prominent U.S. economists. 

                The Nobel laureates are Kenneth J. Arrow, Lawrence R. Klein, Daniel 

                McFadden, Douglass North, William F. Sharpe, Robert M. Solow and 

                Joseph E. Stiglitz. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The signatories 

                express concern for the "immediate human tragedy and devastation 

                of war" and that this war might "increase the risk of future instability 

                and terrorism." They argue "given the precarious state of our 

                own economy, America requires the attention and focus of leadership 

                and resources to address economic problems at home." The statement 

                also says "the American people cannot afford to tolerate a mismanaged 

                economy or a naive underestimation of America's economic perils."

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The Bush Administration 

                is not playing it straight with the American public as to the 

                potential economic consequences of this war," says Professor James 

                K. Galbraith, LBJ School of Public Affairs at the University of 

                Texas at Austin. "And with its rush to war, the Administration 

                is diverting the public's attention away from dire economic problems 

                that we are not working to solve." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The statement 

                reads, "no administration can credibly promise to solve all problems 

                simultaneously." It also refers to the following "serious problems" 

                that the American economy is experiencing "as a result of our 

                administration's comparative neglect." </font>

                business investment has not yet started to recover in most areas 

                -- resulting in a continuing and growing lack of jobs; focus on 

                military sector will impede recovery of technology sector </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Troubling 

                slowdown in consumer spending -- growing household debts; continuing 

                decline in the U.S. dollar; war could drive up interest rates 

                and energy prices and unleash major consumer retrenchment </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- State and 

                local government budgets continue to suffer -- resulting in severe 

                cuts in services and tax increases, continuing lack of federal 

                support for homeland security funding requirements, inadequate 

                attention to health care, education, unemployment, poverty and

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"On the brink 

                of war, it's time for us to take stock and consider all aspects 

                of what makes us, as a nation, secure," says Columbia University 

                Economics and Finance Professor Joseph E. Stiglitz, the 2001 Nobel 

                laureate in economics. "We cannot make this monumental decision 

                -- to go to war -- without weighing carefully the entire scope 

                of what is at stake, from the potential for tragic human consequences 

                to further erosion of our already tenuous economic situation."
