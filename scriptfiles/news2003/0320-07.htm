                Voluntary Cancellation of Virtually All Residential Uses of CCA-Treated 

                Wood </font> 

                <p></p>

                <p></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On March 

                  17, EPA granted the voluntary cancellation and use termination 

                  requests affecting virtually all residential uses of chromated 

                  copper arsenate (CCA) treated wood. Under this action, affected 

                  CCA products cannot be used after Dec. 30, 2003 to treat lumber 

                  intended for use in most residential settings. This transition 

                  affects virtually all residential uses of wood treated with 

                  CCA, including play structures, decks, picnic tables, landscaping 

                  timbers, residential fencing, patios and walkways/boardwalks. 

                  This action was proposed in February 2002 by the registrants 

                  of CCA-pesticide products used to treat wood. Phase-out of the 

                  residential uses will reduce the potential exposure risks to 

                  arsenic, a known human carcinogen, thereby protecting human 

                  health, especially children's health and the environment. The 

                  current action follows up on the February 2002 publication of 

                  a notice of receipt of voluntary cancellation/use termination 

                  requests, which also provided an opportunity for public comments 

                  to be submitted to EPA. A notice of the cancellation order will 

                  be published shortly in the Federal Register, and that document 

                  will include the Agency's response to comments. Consumers may 

                  continue to buy and use the treated CCA wood for as long as 

                  it is available. The transition to using the new generation 

                  treatment products is well underway. The Agency is deferring 

                  any action on two uses involved in the termination requests, 

                  therefore wood used in permanent wood foundations and fence 

                  posts for agricultural uses may continue to be treated with 

                  CCA at this time. EPA is working with the registrant community 

                  and other stakeholders to ensure that safer, comparable alternatives 

                  will be available. EPA is continuing its work on an ongoing 

                  comprehensive reevaluation of CCA-treated wood that has been 

                  underway as part of the Agency's effort to reevaluate older 

                  pesticides to ensure that they meet current health and safety 

                  standards. More information on CCA treated wood is available

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">EPA is working 

                  with other federal agencies, the states, tribes, water suppliers 

                  and the public to evaluate perchlorate - a component of rocket 

                  fuel - as an environmental contaminant. EPA has been revising 

                  its 2002 draft health risk assessment that contains preliminary 

                  risk estimates that could be used to establish an official reference 

                  dose for perchlorate. (A reference dose is a scientific estimate 

                  of a daily exposure level that is not expected to cause adverse 

                  health effects in humans). However, the 2002 health risk assessment 

                  is not final, and substantial uncertainties remain. EPA has 

                  decided to submit questions regarding perchlorate health science 

                  to the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). EPA will not complete 

                  or disseminate a final risk assessment until the NAS scientific 

                  review is concluded and the NAS comments are addressed. Accordingly, 

                  EPA has reaffirmed that its 1999 guidance on perchlorate should 

                  remain in effect pending the outcome of the NAS study. EPA also 

                  is gathering data to determine whether a drinking water standard 

                  for perchlorate is appropriate. </font></p>

                  up October's announcement of the results of the "eCycling" pilot 

                  project, the nation's first collaboration between multi-state 

                  government agencies and the electronics industry to offer citizens 

                  and small business opportunities to reuse and recycle old computer 

                  equipment, televisions and other electronic products, EPA is 

                  sponsoring an electronics drop-off collection event this Sat., 

                  March 22, in Lindenwold, N.J., (near Camden) from 10 a.m. - 

                  3 p.m. All citizens in the Philadelphia area are invited to 

                  bring in their privately-owned computers and other consumer 

                  electronics for recycling and reuse. The eCycling program helps 

                  prevent toxic chemicals such as lead, mercury, cadmium, and 

                  chromium from possibly endangering public health and the environment, 

                  and it saves precious landfill space. Launched in October 2001 

                  out of EPA's Mid-Atlantic regional office in Philadelphia, eCycling 

                  officials evaluate different methods of collecting end-of-life 

                  electronics, compile data about the costs of collecting, transporting 

                  and processing electronics and help define the roles and responsibilities 

                  of government, consumers, electronics manufacturers, retailers 

                  and recyclers in recycling. Using funds so far totaling at least 

                  half a million dollars from EPA, the Mid-Atlantic states, manufacturers 

                  and members of the Electronic Industries Alliance, eCycling 

                  held 45 drop-off events in 31 counties during the pilot project, 

                  collecting over 2700 tons of used electronics from Mid-Atlantic 

                  residents, and preventing over 22,000 cathode ray tubes (CRTs) 

                  in televisions from entering the region's landfills and incinerators. 

                  (CRTs are a source of the hazardous substance lead.) These collection 

                  events will continue to raise awareness of the need to recycle 

                  and reuse unwanted electronics, and will further enable government 

                  agencies to lead by example. All recyclers in the eCycling program 

                  using federal government money must certify that equipment is 

                  recycled safely and will not be dismantled or managed overseas. 

                  As part of these drop-off events, government and industry share 

                  the cost to collect, transport, and process the equipment, and 

                  electronics manufacturers Panasonic, Sharp and Sony pay to recycle 

                  their respective brands of electronics. The Electronic Industries 

                  Alliance, headquartered in Arlington, Va., is a partnership 

                  of electronic and high-tech associations and companies whose 

                  mission is promoting the market development and competitiveness

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">David I. Kali, 

                former owner of Aseptic Services Inc., in Orem, Utah, was charged 

                with violating state pretreatment standards for allegedly discharging 

                wastes into publically owned sewage treatment systems. Aseptic 

                Services accepted approximately 300 boxes per month of medical 

                wastes from various federal medical facilities in Arizona, Utah 

                and Idaho. The wastes were incinerated and produced "quenching 

                fluid," which is a very caustic waste byproduct and contains chromium, 

                lead and zinc. Aseptic Services allegedly then discharged this 

                wastewater into the Orem City Sewers. The water container higher 

                than permitted levels of chromium, lead and zinc and was extremely 

                acidic, which then caused corrosion of the concrete sewer pipes 

                downstream from the Aseptic Services facility. The charged was 

                filed on March 10 in the Fourth Judicial District Court for Utah 

                County. The case was investigated jointly by EPA's Criminal Investigation 

                Division, the Utah Attorney General's Office and the FBI with 

                the assistance of the Orem Public Works Department; it will be
