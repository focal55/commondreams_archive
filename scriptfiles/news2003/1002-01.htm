<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NEW YORK -  October 2 - Calling for massive nonviolent resistance to the current U.S. government, 

the War Resisters League today urged peace activists to follow more closely 

the tactics and philosophy of Mohandas K. Gandhi.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The government no longer represents the people,&quot; said G. Simon Harak, Anti-Militarism Coordinator of the League. &quot;They represent oil companies 

and arms manufacturers, and scandal-ridden companies like Halliburton and 

Bechtel, but not ordinary people.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The group cites the Declaration of Independence, which proposed that 

governments that do not serve the people be either altered or abolished.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;As we celebrate Gandhi's birthday today, we find it deeply significant 

that we are in a situation similar to his,&quot; says Judith Mahoney Pasternak, 

editor of the League's magazine, The Nonviolent Activist. She notes that the United States is now an empire, extending its military and economic 

control over much of the world just as the British Empire did during 

Gandhi's time. And, just as in Gandhi's time, the ruling government does 

not represent the interests of the people it purports to serve.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Gandhi's response to the situation was a nonviolent revolution aimed to 

alter or abolish the ruling powers. Over the years, he sought to achieve 

massive noncooperation with the government to compel a regime change.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We believe that because of their duplicity, and their non-representative 

nature, our government has forfeited the right to represent us,&quot; explains 

Harak. &quot;Therefore it is our duty to withdraw our consent from them. As 

Gandhi said, 'You assist an evil system most effectively by obeying its 

orders and decrees. An evil system never deserves such allegiance. 

Allegiance to it means partaking of the evil. A good person will resist an 

evil system with his or her whole soul.'&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The complete text of its Gandhi's birthday statement can be found at 

www.warresisters.org/commentary.htm</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Believing war to be a crime against humanity, the War Resisters League, 

founded in 1923, advocates Gandhian nonviolence as the method for creating 

a democratic society free of war, racism, sexism, and human exploitation.</font></p>
