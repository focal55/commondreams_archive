                - April 2 - Bipartisan support for a provision of a pending Energy 

                Policy Act of 2003 that gives nuclear workers state of the art 

                whistleblower protection, passed unanimously by the House Energy 

                and Commerce Committee late Tuesday, was immediately hailed by 

                good government groups. The non-profit public interest organizations 

                said the measure is an important first step in providing federal 

                employees involved in homeland security real help if they raise 

                the alarm against security threats or waste, fraud and abuse of 

                power, or when they disclose health, safety or environmental violations. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The measure, 

                sponsored by Committee chairman Billy Tauzin (R-La.) and Rep. 

                Ed Markey (D.-Mass.), was considered long-overdue by whistleblower 

                advocates, who point out that by protecting the rights of national 

                security whistleblowers, Congress is really protecting the health 

                and safety of all Americans. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Nuclear facilities 

                are the Achille's heel of America's vulnerability to terrorists," 

                said Tom Devine, legal director of the Government Accountability 

                Project (GAP), a Washington, D.C.-based whistleblower advocacy 

                group. "This amendment signals a bipartisan commitment to protect 

                those who warn of holes in our nuclear safety net." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“Whistleblower 

                laws don't get any better than this” Devine added. “It provides 

                no loopholes, and protection for government and corporate workers 

                at nuclear facilities. If harassed, they have the right to a day 

                in court before a jury.” </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Danielle Brian, 

                executive director of the Project on Government Oversight (POGO), 

                another good government advocacy group, noted that just last year 

                both GAP and POGO had cosponsored a “Paul Revere” forum on Capitol 

                Hill. There whistleblowers from both government research laboratories 

                and nuclear power plants told of their harrowing personal dramas 

                resulting from “daring to commit the truth” about these institutions 

                vulnerabilities to terrorist attack.</font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“It is truly 

                fitting that one of those responsible for this important fix in 

                the nation's laws, Mr. Markey, represents Paul Revere’s own Congressional 

                district,” Brian said. “There is no more patriotic act than protecting 

                those who exercise the freedom to warn the public of safety or 

                security concerns. Mr. Tauzin and Mr. Markey should be congratulated 

                for stepping up to the plate.” </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"All too often, 

                legislators are willing to give whistleblowers a rhetorical pat 

                on the back while at the same time leaving them vulnerable to 

                reprisal," Devine added. "Talk is cheap. Mr. Tauzin's leadership 

                in getting this legislation passed in the committee proves his 

                commitment to making sure whistleblowers have a fighting chance, 

                by giving them real, enforceable legal rights." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The groups 

                pointed out that the legislations extends a key provision of the 

                Sarbanes-Oxley corporate accountability law passed last year by 

                Congress--modern legal burdens of proof giving employees a fair 

                chance to win, and access to District Court jury trials if no 

                the Department of Labor makes no ruling in 180 days—to the DOE 

                workers. In doing so, the law's anti-reprisal shield is also extended 

                to privately-held firms that contract for much of expert or highly 

                technical nuclear safety work in the industry. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The bill also 

                ends the practice of reimbursing contractors for attorney fees 

                in the wake of legal decisions that their clients had engaged 

                in illegal retaliation against whistleblowers. Tom Carpenter, 

                head of GAP’s nuclear safety program and a long-time champion 

                of putting an end to such costly taxpayer-subsidies for reprisal 

                against employee free speech rights, said one result of the bill 

                may be a reduction in expensive lawsuits. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“Besides siphoning 

                multi-million dollar taxpayer-funded payments to law firms, this 

                provision for contractor reimbursement seriously discouraged settlements 

                and prolonged reprisal litigation,” Carpenter said. “It meant 

                the guaranteed taxpayer money spigot got turned off whenever a 

                case was resolved. Financially, industry lawyers had everything 

                to gain and nothing to lose by dragging out appeals ad nauseum, 

                sometimes for as long as 12 years.”
