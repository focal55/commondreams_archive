- May 16 - Noting Oklahoma's accelerated pace of executions this year, 

Amnesty International USA (AIUSA) today called on the Oklahoma 

Pardon and Parole Board to recommend clemency for Robert 

Knighton, scheduled to be executed on May 27. The Board will 

consider Knighton's clemency appeal on Tuesday, May 20. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Oklahoma has already witnessed seven executions this year, 

matching its record for all of last year, which earned the state 

the dubious distinction of second highest executioner in the 

nation,&quot; said Sue Gunawardena-Vaughn, Director of AIUSA's Program 

to Abolish the Death Penalty. &quot;Given the increasing awareness of 

the numerous inherent flaws in the death penalty system, Oklahoma 

should reverse its disturbing trend by taking the first step of 

granting clemency to Robert Knighton.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Knighton is accused of murdering Virginia and Richard Denney 

in their home in Noble County in 1990. One of the people 

campaigning against his execution is Sue Norton, Richard Denney's 

adopted daughter. Over the years, Sue Norton and Robert Knighton 

have been in regular contact, and she says that she has forgiven 

him for the violence committed against her family. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The death penalty is often cited as an issue of victims' 

rights, yet a growing number of murder victims' relatives are 

saying that it is time to stop killing in their names,&quot; said 

Karin Lau, AIUSA's Oklahoma Anti-Death Penalty Coordinator. &quot;We 

support Sue Norton, and call on Oklahoma leaders to demonstrate 

that they can offer viable alternatives to victims of violence 

rather than the hollow promise of revenge.&quot; </font></p>

for Reconciliation, and others </font></p>
