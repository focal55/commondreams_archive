- August 6 - Rep. Dennis Kucinich does not accept the media script that portrays 

Democrats as groveling before unions and civil rights groups. Quite the 

contrary, he sees Democrats who too often serve up vague and fuzzy 

rhetoric to loyal constituencies during campaigns and then govern 

against the interests of those voters once in office.  That's why -- at 

the AFL-CIO forum in Chicago -- he tried to encourage fellow Democrats 

toward specificity.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">That's why -- since Gov. Dean says he is committed to a balanced budget 

while keeping Pentagon spending off-limits to cuts -- Rep. Kucinich felt it was important and relevant to a union audience to question Dean's 

public statements about raising the Social Security retirement age.  In 

arguing for his own position of returning the age to 65 at the 

nationally-televised forum, Kucinich noted that &quot;Mr. Dean has said that 

he'd move the retirement age to 68.  One time, he talked about moving it to 70.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A few minutes later, Dean simply offered a broad denial: &quot;I have never 

favored a Social Security retirement age of 70. Nor do I favor one of 68.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This morning, Congressman Kucinich said:  &quot;It's unfortunate that Dr. 

Dean was not forthright with labor leaders and activists concerning his 

statements on Social Security which had been discussed on a recent 'Meet the Press' program.  I was surprised at his denial, which raises many 

questions.  If he wants to clarify his earlier statements, fine.  But 

don't deny them while appealing for union voters.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BACKGROUND</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The way to balance the budget, Dean said, is for Congress to cut Social Security, move the retirement age to 70, cut defense, Medicare and 

veterans pensions, while the states cut almost everything else. 'It 

would be tough but we could do it,' he said.&quot; (Times-Picayune, 3/5/95, &quot;And Politicians Wonder Why They Aren't Trusted,&quot; by Miles Benson, 

Newhouse News Service)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dean was asked about the comment on Meet the Press (6/22/03):

DEAN: ...I don't recall saying that, but I'm sure I did, if you have it 

on your show, because I know your researchers are very good.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RUSSERT: Well, Miles Benson is a very good reporter for the Newhouse News.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DEAN Yes, he is.  No, no, no.  I'm sure I did.  I'm not denying that I 

said that.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A few minutes later on the same &quot;Meet the Press,&quot; Dean said the 

following as he discussed budget balancing and Social Security: &quot;I also 

would entertain taking the retirement age to 68.  It's at 67 now.  I 

would entertain that.</font></p>
