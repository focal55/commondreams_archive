YORK - November 7 - <B>PUBLIC EVENT</B>: Clergy from Christian, Jewish, Buddhist 
and other faith traditions will lead an interfaith service at the United Nations 
to call for action on the religious and moral challenge of global warming. This 
service of &#147;repentance and renewal&#148; will allow participants to say they&#146;re 
sorry for the ways that both American leaders and individuals have contributed 
to the problem and commit themselves to positive change. While the U.S. signed 
the Protocol in 1998, Congress never ratified it and President Bush has since 
repudiated it. Following the service, participants will visit 14 U.N. missions 
and meet with world leaders to discuss ways to strengthen U.S. commitment to action 
on this issue. Hundreds of people are expected to attend including large delegations 
from Massachusetts, Maine and New York. </FONT><P> </P><P><B><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">DATE/TIME/PLACE:</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">
