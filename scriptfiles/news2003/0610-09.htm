- 	Congressman Dennis J. Kucinich (D-OH), the leader of the opposition to the war in Iraq in the House, took to the House floor today to continue his pressure to demand the truth about the Administration's lead-up to the war in Iraq.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">	Kucinich stated today on the House floor:</font></p>

<p>	<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The credibility gap is growing.  First the Administration said the US had to sweep aside the UN inspections and the UN Security Council because Iraq had Weapons of Mass Destruction that were an imminent threat.  No weapons have been found to justify the war.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;So why did we go to war?  Now, Paul Wolfowitz says: 'The truth is that for reasons that have a lot to do with the US government bureaucracy we settled on the one issue that everyone could agree on which was weapons of mass destruction as the core reason.'</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Now their story is changing: Iraq had a weapons program they say.  No longer Weapons of Mass Destruction, but a program.  Is this now the 'core reason'?  Bait and switch won't work here.  Nor will a pretense for war. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;If this Administration can fabricate reasons for war after the fact, where will America be headed for war next?  </font></p>

<p>	<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Congress must demand accountability for the wanton exercise of war power, for the loss of life, the destruction of property, the waste of tax dollars and the damage to America's reputation.  Thirty-three members of the House have now signed the Resolution of Inquiry to demand the White House tell the truth.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">	Last Thursday, Kucinich introduced a Resolution of Inquiry in the House of Representatives to force the Administration to turn over the intelligence to back its yet unproven claims that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The resolution, now signed by 33 Members of Congress, seeks to force the Administration to turn over the intelligence to substantiate claims by the President, Vice President, Secretary of Defense, and the White House Press Secretary that Iraq has chemical and biological weapons and therefore posed a threat to the United States. The resolution is a privileged resolution and must be voted on in Committee within 14 legislative days of being introduced.</font></p>
