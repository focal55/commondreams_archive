<ul>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

The average American family experienced a 53 percent increase in credit card debt. 

</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Credit card debt for very low-income families grew by an astonishing 184 percent. 

</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Middle-class families were also hit hard-their credit card debt rose by 75 percent. 

</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Senior citizens saw their average credit card debt load skyrocket by 149 percent. </font></li>

</ul>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report's findings add more evidence to the emerging picture of an economy in which working families face increasing economic insecurity. Cash is tight and millions have seen their savings disappear. As these families turn to credit cards to meet their basic needs - food, rent, health care - they often get trapped in brutal cycles of debt. &quot;Borrowing to Make Ends Meet&quot; includes case studies that illustrate how this cycle of debt keeps Americans from attaining basic economic security: </font></p>

<ul>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Marika, a 61-year-old secretary in New York who got laid off due to 9/11 and had to max out all her cards just to eat. 

</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Pickett family of Middletown, Ohio, who have nearly $40,000 in credit card debt from feeding and caring for their three kids when their businesses took an economic hit. 

</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Roberto, a civil servant who had to declare bankrutpcy after using his credit cards for groceries, medicine, and even rent after an injury kept him off the job for two months.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Deregulation of the credit card industry has allowed companies to take advantage of tough economic times. As the report documents, credit card interest rates now routinely top 20%, penalty fees are at record highs, and &quot;low, introductory&quot; rates can be jacked up to 29% if a cardholder misses one payment by as little as one hour. Usurious practices encouraged by this &quot;no-holds barred&quot; climate help credit cards remain one of the banking industry's most profitable sectors. </font></li>

</ul>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Too many Americans are drowning in credit card debt,&quot; said Tamara Draut, Director of the Economic Opportunity Program at D&ccedil;mos and co-author of the study, &quot;as a way to deal with the rise in the cost of living as their incomes have stagnated or dropped. It's really been the band-aid holding the family budget together since the 90s.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This study, first in a series of reports about Debt &amp; Assets in America, will be distributed to key members of Congress and will be disseminated to major policy organizations who focus on economic opportunity and consumer protection. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;With the economy in the dumps, consumers need to be protected from exploitative practices by the credit card industry,&quot; said Travis Plunkett, legislative director of the Consumer Federation of America. &quot;Congress should move to rein in the industry's aggressive lending and abusive fee practices.&quot; </font></p>
