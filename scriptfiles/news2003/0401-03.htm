                - April 1 - The Bush administration today announced plans to raise 

                fuel economy standards for light trucks by less than automakers 

                have already promised to do themselves: 1.5 miles per gallon by 

                2007. And because of a loophole in the law, the end result will 

                be a tiny increase of just 0.3 mpg. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The loophole 

                allows auto companies to get 1.2mpg credit toward fuel economy 

                standards if they make vehicles that can run on both gasoline 

                and ethanol. But since less than 200 of the nation's 178,000 gas 

                stations serve ethanol, virtually none of these ethanol-capable 

                or "dual fuel" vehicles ever see a drop of ethanol. According 

                to a Bush administration report issued last year, extending this 

                credit would waste at least 9 billion gallons of gas, since so 

                few of these dual-fueled vehicles will use ethanol. Thus the Administration's 

                real fuel economy increase comes out to a measly 0.3 mpg. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now more than 

                ever, it's wildly irresponsible for the Bush administration to 

                be sentencing Americans to an oil dependent future. Our troops 

                are risking their lives in the middle east for a war that is in 

                part about oil, gas prices are skyrocketing, and global warming 

                pollution is more of a problem than ever - so it's clear we need 

                to reduce our oil consumption. But this cosmetic change will do 

                virtually nothing to cut our oil use, and will be used by automakers 

                as another excuse to avoid making real improvements. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We can do much 

                better. Automakers have the technology to produce vehicles of 

                all sizes that get significantly better gas mileage. By adding 

                components like the integrated starter generator and the variable 

                valve control engine, automakers could produce fleets that average 

                40 mpg, without compromising safety, size, or affordability. That 

                would save 3 million barrels of oil a day - more than we currently 

                import from the Persian Gulf, and could hope to find in the Arctic 

                Refuge, combined. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With the Big 

                3 struggling to keep up with fast-moving foreign competition, 

                the Bush administration's approach isn't even good for U.S. automakers. 

                Rather than spurring them to become leaders in the growing market 

                for fuel-efficient vehicles, it ensures that they'll keep lagging 

                behind Toyota and Honda. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The automakers 

                have shown that they won't improve fuel economy until required 

                to do so by Washington. But last year, the Bush administration 

                sided with the auto industry, opposing an attempt in Congress 

                to increase fuel economy to 36 mpg. Now more than ever, if they're 

                serious about improving our national security, it's time for the 

                Bush administration to support real fuel economy increases. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
