                  Former head of the U.N. oil-for-food program, Halliday said 

                  today: &quot;The people of Iraq are being crushed brutally everyday 

                  as we watch our TV. The U.N. and international law are being 

                  set aside by the U.N. Security Council member states. The Secretary 

                  General provides a weak voice reminding us all of Charter provisions, 

                  but too late and too little....&quot; </font>

                  Fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies, Bennis is author 

                  of the book <i>Before and After: U.S. Foreign Policy and the 

                  September 11th Crisis</i>. She said today: &quot;International 

                  law, specifically the Geneva Conventions, requires the belligerent 

                  occupying power to take responsibility (meaning pay) for the 

                  humanitarian needs of the civilian population under occupation. 

                  Thus, the U.S. and the U.K. are responsible for all costs of 

                  emergency care, including food, medicine, and initial rehabilitation 

                  efforts, at least during the period while hostilities continue. 

                  Oil-for-food funds should not be released and used to pay for 

                  emergency supplies -- those funds belong to Iraq. They should 

                  remain frozen until a functioning independent government is 

                  in power in Baghdad and then turned back over to Iraq. </font>

                  Executive director of the Center for Economic and Social Rights, 

                  Normand said today: &quot;This is a defining moment for the 

                  United Nations. Kofi Annan should immediately condemn the illegal 

                  invasion of Iraq. The U.N. should insist on retaining control 

                  over the oil-for-food funds for the benefit of the Iraqi people. 

                  The U.N. should not allow the U.S.-U.K. to seize billions of 

                  Iraqi oil wealth to pay companies like Halliburton to rebuild 

                  what the U.S.-U.K. has destroyed at U.S. taxpayer expense.&quot;

                  Pittsburgh and a CCR board member. Lobel said today: &quot;We 

                  have been asking for a 'Uniting for Peace' Resolution (337), 

                  which allows the U.N. General Assembly to step in and prevent 

                  aggressive wars and acts when the Security Council is unable 

                  to do so. Seemingly very concerned about the possibility of 

                  this resolution being brought to the U.N. floor and passing, 

                  the U.S. government has sent a high-pressure letter to all nations 

                  of the world demanding that they avoid 'calls for an emergency 

                  session of the General Assembly, [which] will not change the 

                  path that we are on....'&quot; </font>

                  Sacks was fined $10,000 last year by the U.S. government after 

                  he took medicines to Iraq. He said today: &quot;Yesterday, standing 

                  next to President Bush, Prime Minister Tony Blair said that 

                  'Over the past five years, 400,000 Iraqi children under the 

                  age of five died of malnutrition and disease ... because of 

                  the nature of the regime under which they are living. Now, that 

                  is why we're acting.' Well, that's certainly why I was acting. 

                  I took medicine to children in Iraq and I was fined $10,000 

                  for admitting this. The regime that caused the preventable death 

                  of these children is the regime of sanctions pushed by the U.S. 

                  and the U.K.&quot; </font>
