- July 3 - In a June 16 editorial, U.S. News &amp; World Report editor Mort Zuckerman provided anecdotes to make the point that nowadays &quot;anyone...can haul anybody into court for just about anything.&quot;  But Zuckerman's facts turned out to be fiction-- and now U.S. News is refusing to issue a correction.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Zuckerman claimed: &quot;A woman throws a soft drink at her boyfriend at a restaurant, then slips on the floor she wet and breaks her tailbone. She sues. Bingo--a jury says the restaurant owes her $100,000! A woman tries to sneak through a restroom window at a nightclub to avoid paying the $3.50 cover charge. She falls, knocks out two front teeth, and sues. A jury awards her $12,000 for dental expenses.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Zuckerman offered these incidents as proof that society is &quot;rewarding cynical opportunists&quot; and &quot;punishing innocent people, like the owners of the restaurant and the nightclub.&quot;  But in fact, all they prove is that U.S. News needs to be more careful in checking its facts.  As Washington Post media reporter Howard Kurtz pointed out in a June 23 column, the spilled drink lawsuit and the nightclub cheater lawsuit are long-discredited myths.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The myth-debunking website <a href="http://www.Snopes.com" target="_new">Snopes.com</a>, which Kurtz cited, traces the bogus lawsuit anecdotes back to a piece of Internet spam from 2001, which listed six separate supposedly outrageous legal awards.  &quot;All of the entries in the list are fabrications-- a search for news stories about each of these cases failed to turn up anything, as did a search for each law case,&quot; the website reported last year (7/02).  The original list, Snopes said, included a seventh example involving a microwaved poodle, which the site suggested had been dropped because &quot;its inclusion would have immediately called into question the truthfulness of the other six cases for any number of folks familiar with urban legends.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="http://www.Snopes.com" target="_new">Snopes.com</a> also said that the bogus list of lawsuits (sans poodle) had been reprinted in June 2002 by the New York Daily News, which &quot;presented it solely as an e-mail it had received, making no statements as to its likeliness to be real or detailing any attempts that publication might have made to verify any of the entries.&quot; (The Daily News is owned by Mort

Zuckerman.)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It's customary for a news outlet to offer a correction when it has offered fictional material as fact.  But that was not U.S. News &amp; World Report's response to the discovery that its corporate chair and editor-in-chief had cited Internet hoaxes as key evidence in his editorial.  Instead, the magazine ran a letter to the editor (7/30/03) from Mary Alexander, president of the Association of Trial Lawyers, calling the anecdotes &quot;urban myths&quot;-- leaving readers to decide whether to believe the magazine's editor or the head of an interested lobbying group about the stories' veracity.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A spokesperson for Zuckerman, Ken Frydman, gave the Washington Post two rationales for why the magazine would not run a retraction: First, &quot;These cases were reported in a variety of other reputable publications, such as the Fort Worth Star-Telegram and the London Telegraph.&quot;  And: &quot;Few Americans would disagree with the proposition that there are far too many frivolous lawsuits filed.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So if a falsehood has been reported elsewhere, and you still believe your argument is true, then corrections aren't necessary?  That's a novel interpretation of journalistic responsibility.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ACTION: Please ask U.S. News &amp; World Report to issue a correction in line with normal journalistic standards, and to check facts more carefully in the future.</font></p>
