                FRANCISCO - April 3 - A growing coalition of American and British 

                citizens and organizations are calling on President George Bush 

                and Prime Minister Tony Blair to Stop Jay Garner as the highest 

                ranking civilian of the transitional Iraqi government. The coalition 

                has launched a web site <a href="http://www.StopJayGarner.com" target="_new">StopJayGarner.com</a> 

                to mobilize the public to sign a petition to call on the United 

                Nations to oversee Iraq¹s reconstruction. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"It's appalling 

                that President Bush and Prime Minister Blair chose a former weapons 

                maker to lead the transition to democracy in Iraq," said Michael 

                Shellenberger, creator of StopJayGarner.com. "The selection of 

                a weapons maker and former military general for the top civilian 

                job in Iraq tells the people of the Middle East that we intend 

                to dominate them militarily. If we truly want a democratic Iraq, 

                the U.S. and Britain should let the UN to oversee the country's 

                reconstruction." </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The StopJayGarner.com 

                coalition points out that the man in charge of overseeing the 

                transition to democracy in Iraq was chosen in secret, without 

                a confirmation hearing or even a press interview (Garner has said 

                that he's too busy to talk to the press). </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Garner is 

                a weapons maker -not a skilled diplomatic leader or Middle East 

                expert," said Medea Benjamin of Global Exchange, a leading human 

                rights group. "Garner epitomizes the worst excesses of the revolving 

                door between the Pentagon and weapons makers. He made millions 

                for his missile company, SY Technology, that are now being used 

                to bomb Baghdad. How can we trust him to look out for the best 

                interests of the Iraqi people?" </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"[Appointing 

                Garner] is a lovely example of our indifference to the people 

                of Iraq," said David Kirp, Professor at the University of California's 

                Goldman School of Public Policy who focuses on ethics. "It truly 

                bespeaks a lack of serious thinking on the administration's part."

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jack Tyler, 

                SY Technology's vice president for business development, told 

                the San Francisco Chronicle that his company has a wide variety 

                of military contracts, including for missile systems that would 

                see action in a war with Iraq - [including] immediately analyzing 

                data from missile flights to improve guidance and targeting. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jay Garner 

                wrote in Army Magazine that, "While the idea that lasers could 

                be used effectively to conduct lethal engagements was promoted 

                vigorously during the heyday of President Reagan's Star Wars program 

                in the 1980s, the reality of using high-energy lasers in killing 

                systems has finally come of age." </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To which Medea 

                Benjamin adds, "You can't speak with pride about building 'killing 

                systems' and then hope to win the good will of the Iraqi people."
