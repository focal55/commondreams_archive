                - March 12 - Secretary of Interior Gale Norton received a letter 

                today on behalf of conservation organizations and Native American 

                tribes calling for an immediate halt on the killing of Yellowstone 

                Park buffalo by the National Park Service, a branch of the Interior 

                Department. The letter was copied to Yellowstone National Park 

                Superintendent Suzanne Lewis. Regional and national conservation 

                organizations signed to the letter represent over 8 million members, 

                and the Native American Intertribal Bison Cooperative speaks for 

                fifty-one tribes. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Yellowstone 

                National Park is home to the only wild free roaming buffalo herd 

                in the United States. Genetically unique, these few thousand animals 

                are a living link to the millions of buffalo that once thundered 

                in great herds across our western plains. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Last week, 

                231 of these iconic buffalo were rounded up by Park Service personnel, 

                confined in a holding pen, and shipped to slaughter. Most were 

                within the boundary of Yellowstone National Park when they were 

                captured. The Park Service has stated publicly that it's compelled 

                to take this action as part of a management plan. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The March 11 

                letter asserts that the Park Service has greater management discretion 

                and authority relative to Yellowstone buffalo than it's currently 

                exercising. It notes that 13 million taxpayer dollars have been 

                spent toward securing range immediately outside the Park for buffalo. 

                The letter calls for the Park Service to utilize its clear discretion 

                to uphold the highest possible standards of protection for Yellowstone 

                Park buffalo. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"We've taken 

                a close look at the management plan under which the Park Service 

                is operating in Yellowstone," Charles Clusen of the Natural Resource 

                Defense Council reported. "Public assertions that it has no choice 

                but to capture and kill buffalo just don't wash." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According to 

                Tony Jewett of the National Parks Conservation Association, "The 

                Park Service is killing buffalo by choice and not because it has 

                to." He characterized this decision as "a stunning departure for 

                an agency the public counts on to protect America's heritage, 

                not eliminate it." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bette Stallman 

                of The Humane Society of the United States called upon the Park 

                Service "to demonstrate ethically, fiscally, and environmentally 

                responsible management consistent with its mission." She added, 

                "The Department of Interior's Park Service is striking out on 

                all three counts." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Fred DuBray, 

                Executive Director of the Intertribal Bison Cooperative, called 

                the Park Service slaughter "a return to our worst memories of 

                the 19th century." The Cooperative is based in South Dakota and 

                represents 51 tribes. To many Native Americans, Yellowstone buffalo 

                are not only a national treasure but a potential breeding source 

                for future reservation herds as well. "Tribes would give anything 

                for the buffalo the Park Service is killing," DuBray lamented. 

                By current policy, Indians may receive heads and hides of slaughtered 

                buffalo, but not the honored living animal with which they hope 

                to repopulate their lands and revitalize traditional culture.

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Quoting the 

                Congressional act that established the Park Service, Jim Coefield 

                of the Montana-based Ecology Center noted the agency's mission 

                is "to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects 

                and the wildlife within." "That's certainly not what's happening 

                in America's first national park," he observed. "Secretary Norton 

                and Superintendent Lewis have a lot of explaining to do." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Safeguarding 

                Montana livestock from a bacterium called brucellosis is the supposed 

                rationale behind slaughtering Yellowstone buffalo. Brucellosis, 

                common in Yellowstone wildlife, has never been transmitted in 

                the wild from buffalo to cows. Nonetheless, for years the Montana 

                Department of Livestock has singled out Yellowstone buffalo for 

                hazing and killing when winter weather draws wildlife out of the 

                Park to lower elevation range nearby. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Such draconian 

                actions are completely unnecessary and have cost taxpayers millions," 

                said Hope Sieck of the Greater Yellowstone Coalition. "The Park 

                Service should pursue common-sense solutions that protect Yellowstone's 

                buffalo and the integrity of our first national park." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Opponents to 

                the slaughter point out that only a few hundred beef cattle graze 

                anywhere near Yellowstone, mainly in the summer when buffalo have 

                returned to the Park. All agree that simply moving those cows 

                to another location would solve any perceived problems and save 

                money all around. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"We are heartened 

                to see that last week's slaughter by the Park has caught the attention 

                of Congress, specifically Representative Rahall, ranking Democrat 

                on the House Committee on Resources," said Defenders of Wildlife's 

                Caroline Kennedy. "We'll help him investigate the Park's recent 

                actions and how taxpayer dollars are being used to slaughter Yellowstone's 

                cherished buffalo herd." </font>
