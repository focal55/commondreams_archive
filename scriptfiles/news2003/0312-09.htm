                - March 12 - As the House of Representatives moves towards a new 

                comprehensive energy bill, American Rivers today testified before 

                the House Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee the current draft 

                would rollback 80 years of established environmental protections 

                at hydropower dams in the name of regulatory "streamlining." Under 

                the currently proposed language, more than 500 dams on 150 rivers 

                in 38 states would sail through less-stringent licensing procedures 

                in the coming 15 years -- costing the nation a once-in-a-lifetime 

                opportunity to restore thousands of river miles. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The conservation 

                community called on Congress drop the so-called "Title III" altogether 

                and instead allow the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) 

                and other federal agencies to continue their promising initiative 

                to reform the hydropower licensing process with administrative 

                changes. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"As currently 

                written, the bill would not 'streamline' anything. Instead it 

                would let dam owners off the hook from their most basic environmental 

                obligations and strangle everyone that might object in red tape," 

                said Rob Masonis, Northwest Regional Director of American Rivers. 

                "This language is actually worse than anything contained in either 

                the House or Senate energy bills from last year." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Specifically, 

                Title III would allow utilities to avoid installing fish ladders, 

                elevators, or providing other means for fish to pass safely around 

                their dams. Although no panacea for the environmental impacts 

                of hydropower dams, fish passage is a proven tool that has lead 

                to the rebound of many fish stocks on dammed rivers across the 

                country. Under Title III, utilities could avoid these obligations 

                and instead artificially propagate fish, protect offsite habitat, 

                or contribute to environmental trust funds. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Tossing aside 

                such a proven technique for environmental restoration makes about 

                as much sense as putting lead back into gasoline," Masonis said. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Title III would 

                also tie the hands of federal and state natural resource agencies 

                and the public during the hydropower licensing negotiations -- 

                freeing FERC to cut sweetheart deals with the utilities seeking 

                new licenses. The language would hinder the National Forest Service 

                and other agencies seeking operations changes to protect federal 

                lands. The public would be held to different levels of participation 

                than the dam-owning utility -- even though rivers are public resources, 

                not private lands. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Should Title 

                III become law, it would preempt a promising initiative from FERC 

                to administratively overhaul the hydropower licensing process. 

                The Commission has thus far drawn heavily on consensus positions 

                developed by industry moderates, the conservation community, and 

                state representatives during negotiations conducted over the past 

                several years. </font>
