<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - April 30 - The number of Black 

children living in extreme poverty is at its highest level in 23 

years, according to an <a href="http://www.childrensdefense.org/pdf/extreme_poverty.pdf" target="_new">analysis released today</a> by the Children's 

Defense Fund. Despite several years of a booming economy, nearly 

one million Black children in 2001 lived in a family with an annual 

income of less than half the federal poverty level (disposable 

income below $7,064 for a family of three). The Bush 

Administration plans to dismantle Head Start, block grant Medicaid 

and the Children's Health Insurance Program, and slash and freeze 

crucial services designed to help these poorest children. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Recent studies show overall poverty has declined among Black 

children, but fail to show the record-breaking increase in extreme 

poverty among these children. Today's analysis further shows that 

safety nets for the worst-off families are being eroded by Bush 

Administration policies, which cause fewer extremely poor children 

of all races to receive cash and in-kind assistance that could help 

these families. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Children's Defense Fund President Marian Wright Edelman said 

these numbers are clear indicators that, as a country, we must 

invest in children now instead of passing irresponsible tax breaks 

for the rich. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It is shameful that one million Black children are left behind 

in extreme poverty,&quot; said Edelman. &quot;It is hard to be poor. It is 

harder to be an extremely poor Black child in America when our 

president who says we should Leave No Child Behind(r) is proposing 

massive new tax breaks for the richest Americans.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Bush Administration claims its plan to dismantle, eliminate, 

cut and freeze essential services for children to pay for massive 

new tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans will spur the economy. 

The most recent Economic Report of the president, which the 

president's own Council of Economic Advisers issued in February 

2003, explicitly acknowledges that tax cuts are unlikely to pay for 

themselves -- let alone pay for investments in children and working 

families. </font></p>
