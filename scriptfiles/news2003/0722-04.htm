- July 22 - Doug Rokke (rock'-ee) Gulf War veteran and former director of the US Army's Depleted Uranium Project is available to local, national and international press through a conference call  4-5pm EST on Wednesday, July 23. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Doug Rokke has just returned from national speaking tour in Australia sparking debate in the Australian Senate and national media coverage. Rokke has begun a 3-state summer speaking tour, July 21-August 11 organized by Traprock Peace Center in Deerfield, MA with many local hosts. Rokke has just appeared in Buffalo with upcoming stops in Rochester, Syracuse, Orange County, and Chattam, New York; St. Johnsbury ,Vermont; Arlington (metro Boston), Turners Falls (for video production), and Springfield Massachusetts.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Requests for his fall tour are coming in from California, Oregon, Louisiana, Texas, Missouri, Michigan and South Africa.  He plans to participate in the International Conference on Uranium Munitions in Hamburg Germany in mid-October, proposing that the effects of this weapon make its use in warfare and training illegal. Rokke predicts extensive health effects among soldiers, embedded reporters and Iraqi civilians inhaling or ingesting Uranium smoke or dust, saying that the heavy metal toxicity and radioactivity can damage lungs, kidneys, bone, skin, nerves, memory, sexual function and cause both genetic damage and birth abnormalities in children.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For the press conference-call on July 23, Traprock Peace Center's director Sunny Miller will coordinate calls from regional, national and international press, as we did with Scott Ritter on July 9.  (The Ritter press conference continues to have a huge response.) Press can call any time before 9:30 AM EST Wednesday, July 23 to be given the number and access code. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Excerpts follow from a report by Major Doug Rokke, in Rantoul, Illinois</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;... Between 1990 and 1991 the United States military incurred 467 individuals wounded in action, 148 killed in battle, 145 killed in other than battle (i.e. accidents).  Therefore the total number of US Gulf War casualties was 760 at the time of redeployment. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;... As of May, 2002, 206,861 veterans had filed claims for benefits based on service-connected injuries and illnesses caused by Gulf War combat related duties. Department of Veterans Affairs officials have processed 183,249 claims for medical care, compensation, and pension determining that for 159,238 veterans their injuries and illnesses are service connected, caused by Gulf War exposures and injuries during combat. Over 221,000 have veterans engaged in the Gulf War theater have been awarded disabilities. Consequently they have been awarded lifetime medical care, compensation, and pensions based on the extent of their medical problems. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;... Since the cessation of Gulf War hostilities in 1991, an additional 8013 veterans have died from service connected injuries and exposures incurred during Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm.&quot; </font></p>
