- November 7 - With George W. Bush opting out of the presidential public financing 
system and declining to stay within the system's $45 million spending ceiling 
during the primary elections, some of the Democratic candidates are actively considering 
whether also to opt out of the public financing and spending ceiling program. 
Howard Dean is expected to announce tomorrow whether he will opt out of the presidential 
public financing system.</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> 
While we wish that all the presidential candidates were opting into the public 
financing system and running for president on a level playing field, Bush's campaign 
spending - which could amount to four times the spending ceiling for any candidate 
who stays within the primary public financing system - places a Democratic nominee 
who chooses to accept public financing and limit spending at a severe disadvantage.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> 
Since Bush has no opposition in the primary elections, the $200 million he plans 
on spending is expected to target the Democratic &quot;presumptive nominee.&quot; 
Some Democratic candidates are concerned that if they abide by the $45 million 
spending ceiling and become the presumptive nominee they will be unable to respond 
to Bush during the rest of the primary period.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> 
If any of the Democratic candidates decide to opt out of the public financing 
system, we believe those candidates should agree to voluntarily limit their primary 
spending to $45 million until a Democratic nominee becomes apparent. The rationale 
for a Democrat opting out of the system to be able to respond to Bush does not 
apply to running against other Democratic opponents. By agreeing to a voluntary 
$45 million spending limit until the Democratic nominee is known the candidates 
would compete on a level playing field as intended by the presidential public 
financing system.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> 
These circumstances show why it is essential to make reform of the presidential 
public financing system a top priority in time for the 2008 elections.</FONT></P><P></P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p></font><!-- #EndEditable --></td></tr>
