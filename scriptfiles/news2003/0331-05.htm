                YORK - March 31 - In a landmark case being argued tomorrow before 

                the Supreme Court, the American Civil Liberties Union will urge 

                the Justices to uphold the admissions policies of the University 

                of Michigan, which seeks to promote a diverse student body by 

                employing affirmative action programs.</font> 

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Court 

                  will actually hear two cases: one involving the University&#146;s 

                  undergraduate admissions policy (Gratz v. Bollinger, 02-51), 

                  and one involving its law school admissions policy (Grutter 

                  v. Bollinger 02-241). </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This 

                  is one of the most important civil rights disputes to reach 

                  the Court in the last quarter century,&quot; said Vincent Warren, 

                  an ACLU Staff Attorney. &quot;At issue here is not only whether 

                  the University of Michigan can consider race in admissions but 

                  also whether the doors to higher education will remain open 

                  to students of color.&quot;</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In an attempt 

                  to increase diversity within its student body, the University 

                  of Michigan has for several years included race as one factor 

                  among many in admissions. At issue in the undergraduate case 

                  is the University's point system. While the University awards 

                  points to applicants on a range of academic and non-academic 

                  factors, it also considers the applicant's race by awarding 

                  points to African Americans, Latinos and Native Americans in 

                  the admissions process. Conservatives have dismissed this process 

                  as a racial quota, and the Bush Administration has filed a brief 

                  with the Justices opposing the University's consideration of 

                  race in this case and in college admissions in general.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, 

                  the brief filed by the ACLU and its co-counsel in Gratz notes 

                  that the University also awards points if the applicant&#146;s 

                  parents are alumni or if applicants come from the upper peninsula 

                  of the state, which is predominantly white, skewing the admissions 

                  system toward white--and often affluent--applicants. School 

                  officials are right to counterbalance the discriminatory effect 

                  of their other criteria by considering race as a factor in admissions, 

                  the ACLU said.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Supreme 

                  Court will also address the law school&#146;s admissions policy. 

                  The law school admissions process does not work on a point system 

                  but seeks to admit enough minority applicants to serve the interests 

                  of a diverse academic community, a prerequisite to ensuring 

                  that all students, regardless of background, experience an intellectual 

                  and social environment akin to what they will see in American 

                  life. </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Even 

                  in this hotly contested case no one has challenged the basic 

                  proposition that a diverse school is a better school,&quot; 

                  said Steven R. Shapiro, the ACLU's National Legal Director. 

                  &quot;It would be a perverse result if the Constitution were 

                  interpreted to require the University to forego the educational 

                  benefits of a diverse student body that are extensively documented 

                  in the record before the Court.&quot;</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hundreds 

                  of groups and individuals have filed briefs with the Supreme 

                  Court in support of the University of Michigan&#146;s admissions 

                  policies and race-conscious affirmative action programs. Many 

                  are saying that it is crucial that all segments of society receive 

                  the education and training they need to become the leaders of 

                  tomorrow. </font></p>

                  include former military leaders: General Norman Schwarzkopf

                  Chiefs of Staff; business executives from General Motors, 3M, 

                  Pfizer and Northrop Grumman; Democratic senators including Minority

                  the ACLU is co-counsel for a group of minority students with

                  NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund (LDF) and the Mexican 

                  American Legal Defense and Education Fund (MALDEF). In Grutter, 

                  the ACLU has joined a friend-of-the-court brief filed by LDF.</font></p>
