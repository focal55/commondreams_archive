- May 27 - On Thursday, May 29--just four days before the Federal Communications

Commission votes on a proposal to radically deregulate the media--free

speech advocates and media consumers will protest at Clear Channel

Communications radio stations in seven cities to draw attention to the

problems that resulted from the last media deregulation. *If you ever

wondered why it seems like the same seven songs are playing on every radio

station in the United States, you can thank Clear Channel Communications and

its take-over of radio stations after the 1996 media deregulation. We can't

let the same thing happen with television stations and newspapers, and

that's just what could happen if the FCC gives more power to the media

companies on June 2,*said Andrea Buffa, who works with Global Exchange and

Media Alliance, two of the groups organizing the Clear Channel protests.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Clear Channel protests are planned for New York City, Washington, DC,

Los Angeles, San Francisco, Pittsburgh, Portland, and Mt. Pleasant, South

Carolina. They are part of a multi-pronged effort by free speech advocates

and media consumers to stop the FCC from approving a radical deregulation of

the media that will allow huge media corporations to own more television

stations, radio stations, and newspapers, endangering media diversity and

independence. FCC Chairman Michael Powell, Colin Powell's son, is pushing

for June 2 vote on the media deregulation proposal, despite opposition from

an unlikely coalition of liberal and conservative groups that oppose giving

more power to a small number of media companies.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Clear Channel was chosen as the target of street protests because it

exemplifies the problems that can arise from media deregulation. After the

passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Clear Channel gobbled up

hundreds of radio stations throughout the country and now owns more than

1200 stations nationwide. Not only is the company the world's largest radio

broadcaster, it's also the world largest concert promoter and billboard

advertising firm.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Clear Channel's monopolistic practices have accelerated the homogenization

of the airwaves. The company promotes cookie-cutter style radio that has

urban stations throughout the country seemingly playing the same

focus-group-selected songs. It shuts out independent artists who can't

afford to go through high-priced middlemen and is responsible for taking the

practice of voice tracking to new heights. Voice tracking creates brief,

computer-assisted voice segments that attempt to fool the listener into

thinking that a program is locally produced, when in fact the same content

is being broadcast to upwards of 75 stations nationwide from a central site.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Clear Channel also uses its stations to promote its conservative political

agenda. After September 11, the company came to the public's attention when

executives circulated a list of blacklisted songs including John Lennon's

*Imagine*and Cat Stevens' *Peace Train*. This year Clear Channel became one

of the first media companies in recent times to sponsor a political

rally&#139;the company sponsored pro-war rallies in cities around the country

before and during the war on Iraq. Another &quot;Rally for America&quot; was organized

in Huntington, West Virginia for Memorial Day weekend.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*If the FCC passes Michael Powell's proposed new media rules, companies like

Clear Channel will be given even more control over the public airwaves than

they already have. Literally a handful of large corporations already

dominate 80% of what the American public sees and hears. Our democracy can't

afford this constriction of public debate,* said Gael Murphy of CodePink,

Women for Peace, a group that is organizing several of the Clear Channel

protests. Other groups are Global Exchange, Citizen Works, Media Alliance,

United for Peace and Justice NY, Prometheus Radio Project, Free Press, the

Youth Media Council, and Democracy Rising.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The following rules are being considered for modification or elimination by

the FCC:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*Newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership prohibition. Prevents broadcast TV

companies from buying newspapers in communities in which they have TV

stations.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*National TV ownership limit. Limits the number of local broadcast stations

any one broadcast company can own to systems serving 35% of the TV

households in the U.S.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*Local TV multiple ownership. Allows a broadcast company to own two TV

stations in the same market only if at least one of those stations is ranked

below the top four stations and there are at least eight independently

owned-and-operating, full-power TV stations in that market.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*Radio/TV Cross-Ownership restriction. Prevents one company from owning both

a radio station and a television station in the same market.</font></p>
