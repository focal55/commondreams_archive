                PA - April 10 - A broad coalition of consumers and health care 

                practitioners today filed a lawsuit in Federal District Court 

                to restore the long-held right to privacy and patient consent 

                for use of personal health information. The legal challenge is 

                part of a wide-scale campaign to challenge the Health Insurance 

                Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, (HIPAA), which mandates 

                the way medical records will be handled by doctors, hospitals, 

                pharmacies and other health care providers. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The lawsuit 

                contends that HIPAA's little-known provisions actually grant unprecedented, 

                unconstitutional access to files without the consent of patients. 

                The federal rule may allow insurance companies, employers, law 

                enforcement and even bankers to review a patient's cradle-to-grave 

                medical history. It is in fact a "health information disclosure 

                rule," says Jim Turner, president of Citizens for Health, one 

                of the consumer groups filing today's suit. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We agree with 

                the federal government's initial findings in 2001 that 'privacy 

                is a fundamental right' of all Americans," says Turner. But, he 

                adds, "the federal government abandoned this principle by quietly 

                reversing its position in August 2002 and authorizing thousands 

                of corporations and their "business associates" to use and disclose 

                personal health information without regard to the individuals' 

                wishes." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dr. Deborah 

                Peel, an Austin, Texas, psychiatrist agreed that "the federal 

                government was right in 2001 in initially finding that medical 

                privacy is essential for quality health care." In fact, numerous 

                surveys show that citizens avoid seeking needed health care and 

                refuse to confide in their physicians if they fear confidentiality 

                will be breeched. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dr. Newell 

                Fischer, president of the American Psychoanalytic Association, 

                another plaintiff in the suit, lamented the loss of privacy. "It 

                is regrettable that we and other citizens must resort to courts 

                to preserve rights that the reason and experience of the country 

                demonstrate are necessary for quality health care." He noted that 

                the United States Supreme Court has found that the privacy of 

                therapist-patient communications are essential for effective psychotherapy. 

                Doctors who practice other specialties have raised similar concerns, 

                particularly on behalf of patients who are HIV-positive or who 

                may have had abortions, both of which can lead to discrimination 

                in the workplace and elsewhere. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The suit was 

                filed in Philadelphia, according to Jim Pyles, attorney for the 

                plaintiffs, because "The fundamental rights at stake in this suit 

                were initially adopted here."
