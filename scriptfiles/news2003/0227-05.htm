                - February 27 - A bipartisan group of former United States Senators 

                today announced its opposition to the Bush Administration's plans 

                to invade Iraq. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a statement 

                released by the former lawmakers, the group said that, among other 

                problems a war will cause, the already struggling American economy 

                will fall into a recession. The statement continues: </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We are concerned 

                with the expenditure of American lives in a war that need not 

                be undertaken at this time. Not only will our sons and daughters 

                be put in harm's way, but this is a war that will dramatically 

                increase the terrorist threat to Americans both at home, as well 

                as the more than one million Americans who live abroad." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We favor multiplying 

                U.N. inspectors in Iraq -- if necessary accompanied by U.N. forces 

                -- to complete the U.N.'s task more quickly and effectively. This 

                will be eminently less expensive in lives and treasure than all-out 

                war." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The nation's 

                almost-forgotten 'war on terrorism' has been seriously neglected 

                because of the Administration's preoccupation with Iraq and Saddam 

                Hussein." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We are all 

                concerned that serious damage that can be done to the United States 

                by terrorism triggered by an attack on a sovereign Arab nation." 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"As well, all 

                Americans should be concerned that an invasion when carried to 

                Iraq's cities will result in the needless killing of innocent 

                Iraqi civilians, especially women and children, who have no voice 

                in their government's policies." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"A first strike 

                is not authorized under international law, because Iraq poses 

                no imminent or unavoidable threat to the United States. And there 

                has been no confirmable evidence of any connection between Iraq 

                and Al Qaeda." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We believe 

                that the principles of the United Nations' Charter will be violated 

                if we attack another nation when we are not threatened. Such an 

                attack will seriously undermine our ability to represent a moral 

                standard to the world. We will be prevented from objecting should 

                India or Pakistan decide to attack the other, or if China should 

                decide to invade Taiwan. Instead of undermining United Nations' 

                principles, we should be supporting them." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We successfully 

                contained the Soviet Union for nearly 50 years by avoiding an 

                attack on that country which was a real threat the U.S. Iraq has 

                no current ability to threaten the United States as does North 

                Korea, for example." </font>
