- October 30 - On November 1, 2003 an international coalition, led by the Coalition in Solidarity with the Women of Juarez and Women in Black, will hold a silent vigil in solidarity with the 300 women who have been raped, killed and disappeared in Juarez and Chihuahua, Mexico.  The candlelight vigil, which is scheduled to take place on the Day of the Dead, is one of many that will take place simultaneously across the world in solidarity with Justicia para Nuestras Hijas and Bring Our Daughters Home (grassroots organizations started by the families of the women who have been murdered.)  The vigil is co-sponsored by MADRE, an international women&#146;s human rights organization.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since 1993, over 300 women who live in conditions of poverty in Juarez and Chihuahua have been abducted, raped and murdered.  The Mexican authorities have failed to effectively investigate the cases, ignoring repeated requests by the families to bring the perpetrators to justice. The indifference of the Mexican authorities to these crimes represents complicity in the violence against women and a lack of accountability in prosecuting crimes against the poor.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From October 31 to November 3, 2003, street protests, film screenings, vigils, cultural events and religious services to commemorate the dead will take place in Juarez, Chihuahua, New York, Washington DC, Phoenix, El Paso, Santa Fe, Portland, San Francisco, Seattle, Tokyo, Valencia, Seville and Madrid. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The New York procession will begin at the Mexican Consulate (27 East 39th Street) on Saturday, November 1 at 11:00 am and proceed silently to the Ralph Bunche Park across the street from the UN.  The vigil is co-sponsored by MADRE, Amnesty International, Women in Black &#150; New York, Grupo de Trabajadoras por la Paz, Vamos a la Pe&ntilde;a del Bronx, Red Solidaridad con Venezuela, Centro Mujeres Dominicanas and Mujeres Radicales, as well as independent artists including Coco Fusco.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="http://www.womeninblack.net/%20" target="_new">Women in Black</a> is an international peace network operating in Italy, Mexico, Spain, Germany, England, Azerbaijan, Colombia, and in the Former Yugoslavia. Women in Black stands in silent vigil to protest war, rape as a tool of war, ethnic cleansing and human rights abuses all over the world. </font></p>
