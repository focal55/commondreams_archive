<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - April 29 - The National Day of Prayer inappropriately entangles religion and government and undercuts authentic expressions of faith, says Americans United for Separation of Church and State.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The National Day of Prayer is to authentic religion what &#145;Mr. Personality&#146; is to romance: a sham and a poor imitation of the real thing,&#148; said the Rev. Barry W. Lynn, Americans United executive director. &#147;I don&#146;t look to government officials to tell me when and how to pray, and I don&#146;t think most other Americans do either.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The Constitution gives Congress and the president no authority whatsoever over religion, and they ought to stick to governmental concerns,&#148; said Lynn, who is an ordained minister in the United Church of Christ.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Congress approved a federal law in 1952 setting aside an annual National Day of Prayer. In 1988, Congress set the date as the first Thursday in May. Each year, the president issues a proclamation urging Americans to participate in the observance.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AU charges that the event has been co-opted by Religious Right groups in recent years and is increasingly being used to send the message that the United States is an officially &#147;Christian nation.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Most NDP events are coordinated by the National Day of Prayer Task Force, a group headed by Shirley Dobson, wife of controversial Religious Right radio broadcaster James Dobson. The Task Force, which limits its events to &#147;Judeo-Christian&#148; worship, operates from Dobson&#146;s Colorado Springs, Colo.-based Focus on the Family.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although a private group, the Task Force has achieved quasi-official status. The Dobsons and their Religious Right allies have visited the Bush White House for the past two years to observe the prayer day.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Religious Right, AU&#146;s Lynn asserts, has taken over the event to promote the fundamentalist Christian political agenda, including strident opposition to church-state separation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In materials promoting this year&#146;s event, Mrs. Dobson criticized court rulings against government display of the Ten Commandments and use of the phrase &#147;one nation under God&#148; in the Pledge of Allegiance.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;We are in desperate need of the Lord&#133;. It is imperative to understand that our survival and well-being as a nation rests solely on our willingness to live according to His purpose,&#148; Dobson said in press statement.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Speaking April 28 on Fox News Network&#146;s &#147;Hannity &amp; Colmes,&#148; Dobson suggested that God allowed the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The Bible says that the shields of the earth belong to the Lord and whether we recognize it or not, I believe that He lifted that shield on 9/11 and let us look evil right in the face,&#148; she said.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AU&#146;s Lynn said these activities demonstrate that James Madison was right about officially proclaimed days of prayer. Madison, widely acknowledged as the Father of the Constitution, said such observances &#147;nourish the erroneous idea of a national religion.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Wrote Madison in his &#147;Detached Memoranda,&#148; &#147;The members of a government as such can in no sense be regarded as possessing an advisory trust from their constituents in their religious capacities&#133;. The practice if not strictly guarded naturally terminates in a conformity to the creed of the majority.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Americans United is a religious liberty watchdog group based in Washington, D.C. Founded in 1947, the organization educates Americans about the importance of church-state separation in safeguarding religious freedom.</i></font></p>
