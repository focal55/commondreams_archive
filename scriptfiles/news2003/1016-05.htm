- October 16 - Lynch, the financial services giant, tops the list of contributors to President Bush's re-election campaign through September of this year, with $364,000 in donations from employees and their immediate family members, according to a preliminary study of third-quarter campaign finance filings by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Merrill Lynch, whose CEO, Stan O'Neal, is listed by the Bush campaign as a &quot;Ranger&quot; who has raised at least $200,000, also topped the list of Bush contributors after the second quarter of this year. The company's total as of June 30 was more than $282,000, which already exceeded that of Bush's top contributor for the entire 2000 election cycle. Credit card giant MBNA led all organizations with $240,675 in individual and PAC contributions for Bush's first presidential bid.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">UBS Americas, the securities holding company, is second among Bush's top contributors with $261,000 in individual and PAC contributions through Sept. 30. PricewaterhouseCoopers, the world's largest accounting firm, is third among Bush's top givers with $210,000 in contributions. Credit Suisse First Boston ranks fourth with $203,000. (Co-CEO John Mack is a Bush &quot;Pioneer&quot; who has raised more than $100,000 for the campaign.) Fifth is Goldman Sachs, with $197,000 in contributions.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bush has raised more from lawyers and law firms ($5.4 million) than from any other industry so far this year. The real estate industry is his next most generous giver, with $4.9 million in individual and PAC contributions. Securities and investment firms follow with $3.8 million. Also among his top 20 industries are doctors and other health professionals ($2.0 million), insurance companies ($1.4 million) and the oil and gas industry ($953,000).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bush has raised a total of more than $84 million for next year's election, and had more than $70 million in the bank as of Sept. 30. He has collected more money in his home state of Texas ($9.6 million) than from anywhere else. California ($8.3 million) is his second most generous state, followed by Florida ($7.3 million) and New York ($4.6 million).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The ZIP code where Bush has raised the most money is 10021 in New York City ($712,500), which was the biggest source of money overall outside Washington, D.C. in the 2002 and 2000 election cycles. His next highest ZIP code is 45243 in Cincinnati ($542,000). The Cincinnati area is home to a handful of loyal Bush donors: Mercer Reynolds, Bush's chief fundraiser; William DeWitt Jr., a Bush &quot;Ranger&quot; who, with Reynolds, helped Bush get started in the oil business; John Kern, a business partner of Reynolds and DeWitt who is a Bush &quot;Ranger&quot;; and Carl Lindner, a Bush &quot;Ranger&quot; and chairman of American Financial Group.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Democratic Field</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Retired General Wesley Clark, who announced his candidacy just a few weeks before the close of the third quarter, raised nearly $3.5 million and has close to $3.4 million in the bank. Like several other candidates, Clark collected more money from the legal profession than from any other industry. He took in $278,000 from lawyers and law firms; $124,000 from teachers, professors, and others in the education field; and $101,000 from the entertainment industry.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">His top contributor is Sullivan &amp; Cromwell, the New York law firm, whose employees contributed $9,500 to his campaign. Clark raised more money in New York City ($407,000) than in any other metro area. Los Angeles ($319,000) was his second most generous region, followed by Washington, D.C. ($164,000), his hometown of Little Rock, Ark. ($132,000) and Chicago ($67,000).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean has raised $25.6 million so far, and has $12.4 million on hand. Among his top contributors are Time Warner ($61,000), Microsoft ($30,000) and IBM ($25,000). Dean's own campaign staffers have contributed nearly $21,000 to their boss' campaign, making the group of them his sixth biggest donor.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Two of Dean's top five donors -- and 10 of his top 20 -- are groups of university employees. University of California employees attained the highest ranking of any organization, with more than $63,000 in contributions to Dean. Dean has raised money from the professors and staff of at least 450 colleges and universities. Those in the education field have contributed a total of $852,000 to Dean's campaign, behind only the legal profession ($966,000).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One-fourth, or $3.1 million, of Dean's itemized contributions has come from California. Fourteen percent, or $1.8 million, was raised in New York state. Dean has collected nearly $930,000 from Massachusetts and $693,000 from his home state of Vermont.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sen. John Kerry (Mass.) has raised just over $23 million for his presidential run, and has nearly $7.8 million in the bank. He has raised nearly three times as much from lawyers and law firms as from any other industry. His top contributor is the law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom, whose employees gave Kerry nearly $97,500 through Sept. 30. Citigroup is second on Kerry's list of top contributors with $68,000, and Piper Rudnick, the Baltimore law firm, is third with $67,000.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Kerry has raised $2.6 million in the Boston area, making it the most generous metropolitan region to his campaign so far. New York City ranks second with $1.8 million, and Los Angeles is third with $1.3 million.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sen. John Edwards has raised $14.4 million for the year and has $4.8 million left in the bank, down from $8.1 million on hand as of June 30. Edwards, a former trial lawyer, has collected 20 times the amount from lawyers and law firms than from any other industry. The metro areas where Edwards has raised the most money are Los Angeles ($1.1 million), New York City ($892,000) and Raleigh ($534,000).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rep. Dick Gephardt (Mo.) has raised $13.6 million for the year, including transfers from his congressional account. He had $5.9 million in the bank as of Sept. 30. He has raised slightly more money in California ($1.86 million) than he has in his home state of Missouri ($1.85 million). The Teamsters union is his No. 1 contributor, with $126,000 in individual and PAC contributions. Bryan Cave, the St. Louis-based law firm, is Gephardt's No. 2 contributor for the year so far. Employees of the firm have given him $71,000. His third highest contributor is the Operating Engineers Union ($48,000), followed by Anheuser-Busch ($44,000) at No. 4 and Torchmark Corp. ($29,000) at No. 5.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sen. Joe Lieberman (Conn.) has taken in $11.7 million this year and had $4.1 million on hand at the end of the reporting period. He has raised nearly twice as much money in New York City this year ($1.6 million) than he has anywhere else. Los Angeles is his next highest metro area ($796,000), followed by Washington, D.C. ($788,000).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Los Angeles law firm of Irell &amp; Manella, whose employees have contributed $77,000 to Lieberman this year, is the senator's top contributor. Lehman Brothers ranks second with $43,000.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rep. Dennis Kucinich (Ohio) has collected $3.4 million and has $785,000 in the bank, former ambassador Carol Moseley Braun has raised more than $342,000 and has $29,000 on hand, and Al Sharpton has raised $273,000 and has $24,000 in the bank. Lyndon Larouche has raised $5.4 million, with $39,000 on hand.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Center studied contributions in reports filed yesterday with the Federal Election Commission by Bush and his Democratic challengers for the White House. The reports covered fundraising and spending activity from July 1 to Sept. 30. The Center's analysis is based on a preliminary review of the reports. As the Center further processes the data, the numbers may change.
