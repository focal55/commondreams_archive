-  

June 13 - An international treaty that seeks to protect the 

environment from the potential risks of Genetically Modified (GM) organisms will 

officially become law in 90 days from today. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The United Nations treaty, known as 'Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety', or Biosafety 

Protocol, had to be ratified by fifty countries before entering into force. [1]</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 50th ratification, by the Pacific Island State of Palau, was announced today. The 

Protocol will enter into force in 90 days, on September 11, 2003. First discussed in 

1992, it took more than ten years for the Protocol to become law. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Friends of the Earth International welcomed the start of the countdown to the entry into 

force of the Protocol. It is the first treaty that officially seeks to protect biological 

diversity from the potential risks posed by genetically modified organisms.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It constitutes the first global environmental agreement of the  new millenium.  It is also 

the first international agreement which clearly says that Genetically Modified 

Organisms (GMOs) &quot;are different and therefore require a different treatment&quot;.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Protocol will require all exporters of GMOs to be released into the environment to 

take measures to prevent contamination of GM seed products by implementing an 

identity preservation system.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But many issues are still pending. One key issue is liability. Friends of the Earth 

International today repeated its call for the immediate establishment of an effective 

environment, for instance  through contamination by GM crops, pay for the pollution 

they create.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At the same time the international notification system under the Protocol does not 

replace national biosafety legislation, so Friends of the Earth  warned that enacting 

stricter national legislation on biosafety is still needed.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Biosafety Protocol backs the approach of  the European Union, asserting that 

GMOs need different treatment from  non-GMOs. Therefore the  Protocol stands in 

contradiction to policies held by some countries, such as the  U.S., which affirm that 

GMOs are not different from the conventional plants and animals they derive from.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The times of uncontrolled trade of GMOs are over. The Biosafety Protocol sets a new era for global regulation of GMOs. Exporters from all over the world should take 

adequate measures to prevent contamination of GM seed products,&quot; said Ricardo 

Navarro, Salvadorean Chairman of Friends of the Earth International.</font></p>
