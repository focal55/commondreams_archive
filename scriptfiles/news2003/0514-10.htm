- May 14 - The Epilepsy Foundation 

today filed an amicus brief in the 9th Circuit Court based in San 

Francisco, California in support of the employment discrimination 

case of Fred Mancini, a man with epilepsy who works as an assistant 

signalman for Union Pacific Railroad. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mancini sued for discrimination under the Americans With 

Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Idaho Human Rights Act. He says he 

was forced to take a medical leave for his seizure disorder and was 

told by his employer there was no way to accommodate his medical 

condition. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At the trial level, his case was dismissed in part because the 

court concluded he was not actually disabled by his epilepsy. It 

held that because he took medication to control the seizures he was 

not eligible to be protected by the Act. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Today's brief is about whether epilepsy is a disability under 

the ADA," says Alexandra Finucane, vice president for legal and 

government affairs at the Epilepsy Foundation. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We introduce data to show that in general and in Mancini's 

particular case, epilepsy is an actual disability for purposes of 

the ADA and that his employer regarded him as being disabled," she 

says. "This includes data about epilepsy's impact on reproduction, 

ability to interact with others, ability to drive, work, care for 

oneself and more fundamentally, to breathe. This latter argument 

introduces data about sudden unexplained death in epilepsy and the 

heightened mortality rate in general for people with epilepsy." 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Congress passed the ADA on July 26, 1990, to ensure for people 

with disabilities the same civil rights and protection against 

discrimination enjoyed by others in America. The law promotes 

equality of opportunity, full participation in society, and 

economic self-sufficiency for people with disabilities like 

epilepsy. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Americans with epilepsy have greatly benefited from the ADA and 

similar laws," says Finucane, " but people need to continue to work 

vigorously to pursue their rights." 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The ADA provides many tangible benefits to people with epilepsy, 

according to the Foundation. These include the right not to 

disclose epilepsy prior to a job offer, or not to disclose at all 

if not relevant to the job; and the right to admission to public 

places despite having seizures. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"However, there has been a problem recently as a result of 

Supreme Court rulings in recent years that have narrowed the ADA's 

scope in employment cases. People with epilepsy have been told they 

aren't covered by the ADA," says Finucane. "The Epilepsy Foundation 

will fight such narrow interpretations of the law, which have 

unnecessarily restricted the law's reach," she says. "We need to do 

a better job of educating the judiciary, and work harder to ensure 

that the law is properly applied to include all people with 

disabilities. If you've lost a job or cannot get a job because of 

your medical condition, even when you're qualified to do the work, 

you should be covered by the law's mandate. That's what the 

Congress and the framers of the ADA intended," she says. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The national Foundation was also joined in the friend of the 

court brief by several local Foundations from states covered by the 

9th Circuit court and by the Arizona-Disability Law Center. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Epilepsy Foundation is a network of community-based 

affiliated organizations that work to ensure that people with 

epilepsy are able to participate in all life experiences. The 

organization's goals are to prevent, control and cure epilepsy 

through research, education, advocacy and services.
