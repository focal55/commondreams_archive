                - April 22 - According to U.S. News and World Report, Senators 

                are pressing the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to delay 

                strengthening power plant security. The letters were written by 

                Senators Chuck Hagel (R-NE), Jeff Sessions (R-AL), and Lindsey 

                Graham (R-NC) and can be viewed at: <a href="http://www.pogo.org/m/ep/ep-NRCLetters.pdf" target="_new">http://www.pogo.org/m/ep/ep-NRCLetters.pdf</a></font>

                  Senators have power plants that had recent security lapses, 

                  and all three received nuclear industry campaign contributions.

                  At the nation's nuclear plants, problems persist, but some push 

                  for more time to fix them </b></font></p>

                  Pasternak </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite 

                  promises from the White House on down to beef up security after 

                  the terrorist attacks on New York and the Pentagon, some of 

                  the nation's 104 civilian nuclear power plants continue to operate 

                  with major security flaws, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission 

                  has yet to issue a formal assessment of potential terrorist 

                  threats that would require permanent upgrades at the facilities. 

                  Meanwhile, three Republican senators have been quietly lobbying 

                  the NRC to take even more time implementing tighter procedures, 

                  suggesting that security is already good enough.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a letter 

                  to the NRC last month, Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama argued 

                  that security personnel at nuclear plants &quot;are providing 

                  the maximum level of protection that is practical for civilian 

                  security forces.&quot; In a separate letter, Sen. Chuck Hagel 

                  of Nebraska worried that new safety measures might prove too 

                  costly. The government, he said, should not undermine the industry's 

                  &quot;ability to provide low-cost power for [its] customers.&quot; 

                  A South Carolina senator, Lindsey Graham, also weighed in.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The lobbying 

                  campaign comes as the NRC is preparing to issue a new Design 

                  Basis Threat, or assessment of what new security measures are 

                  needed to protect the sites. Before the 9/11 attacks, plant 

                  owners were required to provide personnel capable of repulsing 

                  an attack by no more than three armed intruders. After the attacks, 

                  the NRC issued interim measures requiring additional security 

                  posts and increased armed patrols. </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Security 

                  remains a major concern. Last September, the Project on Government 

                  Oversight, a Washington, D.C.-based watchdog group, issued a 

                  report based on interviews with more than 20 security guards 

                  at 13 plants. The inquiry found that many security forces were 

                  overworked and underpaid, and lacked sufficient training. Danielle 

                  Brian, the group's executive director, says the industry wants 

                  to delay security upgrades.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Oversights. 

                  The industry disputes those charges. The Nuclear Energy Institute 

                  says the industry already has spent $370 million on staffing 

                  and capital improvements since 9/11. Steve Kerekes, a spokesman, 

                  says the institute has consulted with the NRC and Congress on 

                  the new threat assessment. Senators Hagel, Sessions, and Graham 

                  have all received campaign contributions from the institute.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the past 

                  year, nuclear plants in the senators' states have experienced 

                  serious security lapses. At a plant in Nebraska, 150 rounds 

                  of ammunition passed through an X-ray machine undetected; in 

                  Alabama, a guard failed to check vital access doors and then 

                  lied about it. </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The new 

                  threat assessment is certain to require tougher regulations 

                  for defending against terrorist attacks. Some worry, however, 

                  that they won't be tough enough. &quot;If one of our nuclear 

                  plants is attacked tomorrow,&quot; says David Lochbaum, a nuclear 

                  safety engineer at the Union of Concerned Scientists, &quot;our 

                  government ought to be able to say we did everything we could 

                  have done to prevent this.&quot;</font></p>
