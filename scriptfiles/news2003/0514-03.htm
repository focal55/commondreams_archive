-  

May 14 - The Organic Consumers Association (OCA), a national

grassroots network of over 500,000 people, condemns today's declaration

of a US WTO challenge against the EU for their policy on Genetically

Modified Organisms (GMOs). On Tuesday US Trade Representative Robert

Zoellick announced that a complaint had been filed with the WTO in

Geneva. If the US and EU don't reach an agreement within 60 days, the

issue will be resolved by an unelected panel of WTO trade bureaucrats.

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In response to pressure from millions of concerned consumers, the EU has

enacted strict labeling requirements for genetically modified (GM) foods

and since 1998 has placed a moratorium on approving new GM varieties for

planting or import.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The OCA believes that consumers in Europe and developing countries

should have the right to refuse being used as guinea pigs. The current

regulatory system in the US, which requires no long-term safety testing

on GM foods, is one of corporate junk science. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Independent studies have shown that Genetically Modified crops pollute

the environment and neighboring farms, increase pesticide use, and may

lead to unforeseen health risks such as allergies and antibiotic

resistance.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Consumers worldwide are concerned about GM foods precisely because

science has not shown them to be safe," stated Ronnie Cummins, OCA's

National Director, "Even the British Medical Association has called for

a moratorium on these foods until they can be adequately tested for

their health impacts."

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Polls in both the US and Europe consistently show that over 90% of the

public want modified foods to be labeled so they can choose to avoid

them. After the EU enacted labeling laws in 1999, most food companies

chose to buy non-GM corn and soy rather than label their foods as

containing modified ingredients. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This WTO action is going to backfire on the biotech industry," added

Cummins "Bullying Europe and the rest of the world on the GMO issue is

going to speed up the collapse of agricultural biotechnology and

eventually the WTO itself. "
