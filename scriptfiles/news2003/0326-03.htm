                - March 26 - Green Party members are warning that the brutal and 

                humiliating treatment of al-Qaeda prisoners has put American soldiers 

                captured by Saddam Hussein's army in grave peril. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The whole 

                world has seen video footage of shackled and shaved men transported 

                in plastic containers and confined to cages in Guantanamo," said 

                Anita Rios, co-chair of the Green Party of the United States. 

                "The world knows that the Pentagon has sent some captive al-Qaeda 

                members to other nations to be interrogated under torture. In 

                November, 2002, six al-Qaeda members were executed by a missile 

                launched by a CIA drone in Yemen. It's possible that Saddam, a 

                murderous dictator, will use this as a license to visit similar 

                treatment on American soldiers taken captive. President Bush, 

                Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld, and Attorney General Ashcroft must 

                order an end to this kind of treatment immediately." </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greens insist 

                that torture under any circumstances is immoral, barbaric, and 

                illegal according to the U.S. Constitution, Geneva Conventions, 

                and Convention Against Torture. International law forbids torture 

                of both combatants and civilians, which renders irrelevant Secretary 

                of State Rumsfeld's change of designation for the prisoners in 

                Guantanamo Bay from 'prisoners of war' to 'detainees' and 'unlawful 

                combatants.' Groups like Human Rights Watch note that torture 

                is notoriously unreliable in extracting useful information. </font>

                our American troops -- we want them sent home, safe and sound, 

                not delivered on stretchers or in body bags," said Ben Manski, 

                Wisconsin </font>

                of the national party. "The only way to support our troops is 

                to end this illegal war, to stop the waste of human life -- the 

                lives of U.S., British, and Iraqi soldiers and Iraqi civilians. 

                That's why we continue to protest the invasion of Iraq. Conquest 

                and control of Middle Eastern oil resources are not worth the 

                sacrifice of our young men and women."
