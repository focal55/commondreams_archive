- June 25 - <a href="http://www.JoinTheBushwhackers.com" target="_new">Bushwhack PAC</a>, a new clearinghouse for fresh facts and evidence about how the Bush presidency is steering America off course, launched today, releasing its first issue brief criticizing the Administration's risky foreign policy.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Led by two political consultants who played key roles in upending the last George Bush, Bushwhack PAC intends to take the President to task on national security, the economy and his failed leadership on issues that matter to America's future.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Like any good effort to annoy and pester those incredibly arrogant Bush folks, this one will rely on a little hope and humor to counter their fear-mongering and lies,&quot; said Dan Carol, chief spokesman for Join The Bushwhackers. &quot;America has completely lost its way -- not to mention 2.5 million jobs - under this presidency. It's time to make clear that enough is enough.&quot; Carol, the former chief of opposition research for the Democratic National Committee from 1989-1993, ran a similar independent effort against would-be Senator Ollie North in 1994.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Added Carol's partner Stuart Trevelyan, a 1992 Clinton war room veteran: &quot;The only good Bush presidency is a one-term presidency. They both seem to mistake 'It's the economy, stupid' for 'Be stupid with the economy', and must genetically lack the 'vision-thing'. We're here as a voice for the people who, regardless of who they support in the primaries, want to know what they can do to evict Bush from the White House.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Besides featuring fresh facts and fodder every week, the group's new JoinTheBushwhackers.com website will mix humor in with the heat, including a contest for re-dubbing &quot;Dubya&quot; with a new nickname, a &quot;Thanks George&quot; database of Americans victimized by Bush's policies, and cool new &quot;YOU ARE NOT ALONE&quot; &quot;Bushwhacker&quot; t-shirts. Carol's last anti-Bush t-shirt, The Anywhere But America Tour shirt which mocked Bush 41's foreign travel at a time the economy was sinking, sold 10,000 shirts for the DNC in 1991.</font></p>
