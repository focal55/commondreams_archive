<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">STRASBOURG -  July 2 -  The European Parliament's vote in favour of 

allowing member states to take action to prevent contamination from 

genetically modified (GM) crops has been warmly welcomed by Friends of the 

Earth Europe.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The European Parliament Members (MEPs) also voted for tougher labelling 

of GM food and traceability of crops. 

GM animal feed will now have to be labelled for the first time.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The vote on preventing contamination now gives countries the power to 

impose strict restrictions on GM crops in order to protect organic and 

conventional crops. EU research has consistently stated that contamination 

will be widespread if commercial growing of GMO crops increased. But until 

now member states have been virtually powerless to take preventative action.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although the new legislation is an important step in the right direction</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Friends of the Earth is nevertheless concerned that:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* The threshold for GMO contamination is too high. MEPs compromised withMinisters and agreed on 0.9%. Current testing techniques can reliably 

detect GM s low as 0.1%;

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* The contamination of food and crops by unlicensed GM material will be 

allowed for 3 years;

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Member states &quot;may&quot;, rather than &quot;shall&quot;, take action to prevent 

contamination of neighbouring farms.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Friends of the Earth is also calling for strict liability to make biotech 

companies liable for any contamination or environmental problems.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The new rules will now go to the Council of EU Agricultural Ministers, 

probably in July. If the Council agrees (which is almost certain), the new 

proposals will be operational in the autumn of 2003.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Geert Ritsema, GMO Campaign Coordinator of Friends of the Earth Europe said : &quot;This new legislation is a welcome step in the right direction and will 

allow countries to take action to protect our food and farming from genetic 

pollution. It will also give consumers and farmers more information so that 

they can choose whether or not to take part in the biotech industry's 

massive GM experiment.  But there are still gaping holes in the 

legislation, particularly over liability. The EU must make biotech 

companies fully liable for their actions before any GM food or crop is 

approved.&quot;</font></p>
