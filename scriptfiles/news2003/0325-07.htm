                - March 25 - A study included in a just-released book debunks 

                the claim by leading pro-gun researcher John Lott that allowing 

                Americans to carry concealed handguns leads to less crime. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The book "Evaluating 

                Gun Policy," published by the Brookings Institution Press, includes 

                research by Professor John Donohue Ph.D., J.D., Stanford University 

                Law School, and Professor Ian Ayres Ph.D., J.D., Yale Law School, 

                that concludes Carry Concealed Weapons (CCW) laws do not decrease 

                crime; they may, in fact, have just the opposite effect. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">John Lott wrote 

                the 1998 book "More Guns, Less Crime," which is championed by 

                the gun lobby as a major research work that proves CCW laws reduce 

                crime. Lott's scholarship -- including "More Guns, Less Crime" 

                -- and actions, however, have recently come under attack on a 

                variety of fronts. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For instance, 

                John Lott, who is currently a fellow at the American Enterprise 

                Institute, has come under fire for pretending to be a woman over 

                the Internet (using the name "Mary Rosh") to defend himself against 

                his critics. "Mary Rosh" claimed to be a student of John Lott's 

                and praised his research. In addition, several academicians are 

                seeking answers from John Lott about questions involving a telephone 

                survey Lott claims to have done for "More Guns, Less Crime." Lott 

                can't produce evidence the phone survey took place, claiming that 

                his computer crashed. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">John Donohue 

                called Lott's conclusions -- that citizens carrying loaded handguns 

                in public helps to reduce crime -- "deeply flawed" and "misguided." 

                Donahue states in the Brookings Institution Press book that data 

                suggests that, in fact, crime may increase when CCW laws are implemented. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lott's study 

                has been widely cited by gun advocates as justification for passing 

                CCW laws that require states to issue handgun-carrying permits 

                to citizens who meet minimum requirements (shall-issue laws). 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lott claimed 

                that the 10 states that enacted shall-issue laws between 1985 

                and 1991 experienced declines in murder and other violent crimes 

                relative to the crime trends observed in other states that did 

                not pass shall-issue laws. In contrast, Donohue contends that 

                the 13 states that enacted shall-issue laws after 1992 experienced 

                relative increases in crime. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The evidence 

                is stronger that passing shall-issue concealed weapons laws are 

                increasing crime, rather than decreasing crime, " said John Donohue 

                Ph.D., J.D. "I don't see any strong data that shall-issue laws 

                are decreasing crime." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The challenge 

                to Lott's scholarship is similar to that faced by former Emory 

                University Professor Michael Bellesiles. His book, "Arming America: 

                The Origins of a National Gun-Culture in 2000, was almost immediately 

                attacked when it was published. Eventually, Emory University formally 

                investigated the issue and found that Bellesiles had misled critics 

                and falsified data. Michael Bellesiles resigned during the investigation. 

                Thus far, the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think 

                tank, has not yet commented on the accusations made against Lott.
