- July 15 - The Sierra Club today announced it is joining forces with America's other largest grassroots groups to register, educate and mobilize the public for the 2004 elections.  The groups are linking arms under the umbrella of America Votes, a non-partisan political organization that will capitalize on the groups' strong strategic abilities and large membership bases to break new ground in electoral politics.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;In 2004, the Sierra Club, America's largest grassroots environmental organization, plans to reach more voters than ever before,&quot; said Sierra Club Executive Director Carl Pope.  &quot;In the mail, on the phone, and at the door, we will talk to voters and the public about how polluters are being allowed to jeopardize the air they breathe, the water they drink, and the lands they love -- and what people can do to keep their families safe.  We are honored to be a founding member of America Votes.  Through our collective strength, this historic effort will reach an unprecedented number of voters to educate them about critical issues this election cycle.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">America Votes will combine resources, research, and strategy to develop highly targeted, state-of-the-art methods to reach out to voters on issues that they care deeply about to encourage greater voter participation.  This historic partnership joins together the most reputable organizations in the country, including ACORN, AFL-CIO, American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), EMILY's List, League of Conservation Voters, MoveOn.org, Moving America Forward, NAACP National Voter Fund, NARAL Pro-Choice America, Partnership for America's Families, People For the American Way, Planned Parenthood Action Fund, Service Employees International Union (SEIU), and the Sierra Club.</font></p>
