                - April 22 - Following is a text of Earth Day remarks by LCV President 

                Deb Callahan as prepared for delivery: </font> 

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The next 

                  559 days - from Earth Day 2003 to Election Day 2004 - could 

                  be the most important year and a half in American environmental 

                  history. The next 559 days may spell the difference between 

                  whether Earth Day in the future is an event to celebrate or 

                  a day of disappointment. </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Americans 

                  have watched the Bush administration dismantle environmental 

                  laws that have improved the health and security of families 

                  for decades. Americans have watched President Bush consistently 

                  place the desires of powerful corporate interests ahead of the 

                  needs of regular people. And Americans are not happy. Even with 

                  the media focused intently on the war, public approval of Bush's 

                  environmental policies is at its lowest point ever. </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">President 

                  Bush and his advisors are well aware of Bush's political vulnerability 

                  on the environment, so they never miss an opportunity to say 

                  the right things. This president proposed to allow big power 

                  plants to put more toxic pollution in the air we breathe and 

                  called it &quot;Clear Skies.&quot; President Bush wants to turn 

                  the management of our natural heritage over to the timber industry 

                  and call it &quot;Healthy Forests.&quot; And he covers up a 

                  plan that fails to reduce our dependence on foreign oil through 

                  a stronger emphasis on cleaner, renewable energy sources and 

                  fuel efficiency by calling it - and its billions of dollars 

                  in tax breaks to the oil and gas industry - &quot;energy security.&quot; 

                  But President Bush should have learned a lesson taught by Teddy 

                  Roosevelt: &quot;rhetoric is a poor substitute for action.&quot; 

                  </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For the 

                  next 559 days, LCV and our partners will do all we can to make 

                  sure American voters know which candidates want to do the right 

                  things to protect our environment, and which ones just want 

                  to talk their way through it. Because in 2004, Election Day 

                  might just be the most important earth day ever. </font></p>
