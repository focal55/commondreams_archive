- November 7 - Pennsylvania Greens increased their number of local elected officials 
from nine to 25, leading an advance of Greens in several local races around the 
U.S. on November 4. Pennsylvania, California, Connecticut, Maine, Washington Greens 
celebrated several local victories, with California Greens especially buoyed by 
San Francisco mayoral candidate Matt Gonzalez's second place showing, which allows 
him to compete in a December 9 runoff election. (A list of Pennsylvania victories 
is appended below.) Altogether, 56 Green candidates were elected in 2003.</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Even 
though we gain the most public attention from presidential, gubernatorial, and 
congressional campaigns, Greens advance most dramatically in city, county, and 
school board races,&quot; said Juscha Robinson, co-chair of the Coordinated Campaign 
Committee of the Green Party of the United States. &quot;That's how we're building 
our grassroots base, ensuring that the Green Party will continue to grow as a 
permanent progressive ecological political party.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Greens 
noted that Democratic and Republican candidates overwhelmingly outspent them throughout 
the U.S. Green candidate Tom Hutt, who lost his bid for Philadelphia City Council, 
was outspent 160 to 1 by his Democratic and Republican opponents.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In 
California, Bill Meyers won his reelection for school board in Point Arena. Green 
Fairfax Councilmember and former Mayor Lew Tremaine finished first in the two 
seat race for Fairfax City Council and fellow Green Party Menber Larry Bragman 
finished second. Tremaine and Bragmanbeat a pro-development slate backed by theFairfaxCivic 
League, a conservative group attempting towrest Fairfax Council away from its 
progressive majority.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Unofficial 
results from Maine give Stephen Spring a 54.71% win in his Portland School Committee,District 
2 campaign. In another Maine Green victory, Erek Gaines won his campaign for WaterDistrict 
seat. Gaines, at 20, is the youngest Green winner in 2003; he served as a student 
intern for Maine state legislator John Eder, also a Green.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Corrections 
and updates: (1) Greg Allen, elected Soil &amp; Water Conservation Director in 
Virginia Beach, is not the first Green ever elected inVirginia, as stated in a 
Green Party press release issued November 5. Previous Greenvictories for local 
office in Virginia occurred in 1997, 2000, and 2001. (2) David Juarez, who with 
Don Cooney won their races for Kalamazoo,Michigan, city commission, was not an 
incumbent candidate and has never been registered Democrat;this is his first term 
and Green is his first party affiliation. (Juarez is also the first Latino ever 
elected to the Kalamazoo CityCommission.)</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Pennsylvania
