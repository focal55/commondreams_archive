- July 30 - A broad coalition of Jewish peace groups 

today called upon President Bush to withdraw his controversial nomination of 

Daniel Pipes to the Board of Directors of the United States Institute of Peace.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Jewish peace groups also lauded the decision of the Senate Health, 

Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee last week to table a scheduled vote 

on Pipes' nomination to the U.S. Institute of Peace.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pipes is director of the Middle East Forum, a rightwing think tank based in 

Philadelphia, and a prolific author of articles depicting Islam as a danger 

to Western civilization and to Jews in particular. Pipes has referred to</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Muslim immigrants as &quot;brown-skinned peoples cooking strange foods and not 

exactly maintaining Germanic standards of hygiene.&quot; In another article, he 

wrote that &quot;all immigrants bring exotic customs and attitudes, but Muslim 

customs are more troublesome than most.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Bush Administration's nomination of Pipes to the USIP board in April brought a firestorm of complaints from Muslim and Arab American civil rights 

organizations, echoed by peace, civil liberties, and immigrants' rights 

groups.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Pipes has repeatedly demonstrated hostility towards Arabs and towards Islam 

as a religion,&quot; said Mitchell Plitnick, co-director of Jewish Voice for 

Peace, a San Francisco Area Middle East peace group. &quot;Of equal concern is 

that Pipes has often espoused the view that force is the most appropriate 

solution to the problems in the Middle East and the Muslim world. Pipes's 

entire history shows him to be an individual who merits no place in any 

Institute of Peace. As Jews, we have a special stake in Middle East peace 

and it is intolerable that a man who espouses such racist and militaristic 

views as Pipes even be considered for such a position.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pipes has also been roundly criticized for launching Campus Watch, a website 

sponsored by the Middle East Forum that monitors professors of Middle Eastern studies and maintains online &quot;dossiers&quot; on those whose views it 

considers unacceptable. Critics have charged that the website underminesacademic freedom by urging students to report professors whose sympathies 

are suspect.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;In his own writings as well as the activities of his think tank,&quot; stated 

Rachael Kamel of the Philadelphia Jewish Peace Network, &quot;Pipes has 

repeatedly portrayed Islam as incompatible with Western values. In fact, it 

is Pipes himself who goes against the values of pluralism, religious 

tolerance, civil liberties, and freedom of thought - all of which are 

indispensable for building a peaceful future.&quot;</font></p>
