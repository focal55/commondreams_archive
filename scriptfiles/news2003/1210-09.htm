- December 10 - Larry Noble, executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics, issued the following statement in reaction to today&#146;s Supreme Court decision on the McCain-Feingold campaign finance law. Prior to joining the Center, Noble served for 13 years as general counsel of the Federal Election Commission.  </FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">For a brief summary of the decision and its impact, visit the Web site of the Center&#146;s FEC Watch project. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;Today&#146;s Supreme Court decision amounts to a sweeping victory for backers of the McCain-Feingold law and all who have long contended that unlimited &#145;soft money&#146; contributions can have a corrupting influence on lawmakers and political party officials. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;By upholding the McCain-Feingold law&#146;s ban on soft money fundraising and spending by the national political parties, a majority of five justices confirmed what many political actors and observers have known for years: that large political contributions buy access to elected officials and raise the potential for corruption within the political system. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;The Court also upheld restrictions on so-called &#145;issue&#146; ad spending by independent advocacy groups in the weeks leading up to an election. Just as significant is the Court&#146;s rejection of the &#145;express advocacy&#146; standard, which it adopted in 1976 to distinguish between campaign and issue ads, as &#145;functionally meaningless.&#146; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;The Court acknowledged that the express advocacy standard, which required the use of so-called magic words including &#145;vote for,&#146; &#145;vote against,&#146; &#145;elect&#146; or &#145;defeat,&#146; covered only a tiny minority of political communications designed to influence the outcome of an election. The standard was largely responsible for many of the soft money abuses that plagued previous elections. In its place, the Court approved a congressionally adopted standard that will prove to be far more meaningful in the real world of politics. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;In its analysis, the Court took a surprisingly strong look at the reality, not just the theory, of money in politics. The decision will have several profound effects on the 2004 elections. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">--&#147;The national political parties will have to bolster their efforts to raise limited, regulated &#145;hard money&#146; contributions. The Republican Party now enjoys a significant advantage over the Democratic Party in this area, and Democrats can be expected to ramp up their small donor fundraising efforts. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">--&#147;Independent advocacy groups incorporated under sections 527 and 501(c)(4) of the federal tax code will continue to raise the unlimited soft money contributions that the national political parties are prevented from collecting. However, these groups face new restrictions on their ability to spend soft money on issue ads that mention a candidate just before an election. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">--&#147;State party committees are likely to raise more money than before as a result of the law&#146;s soft money ban, but they, too, are subject to new strict limits on how they can spend that money during the course of a federal election campaign. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;The bottom line is that this decision leaves the campaign finance law much stronger than it was prior to the enactment of McCain-Feingold. An era in which political parties solicited six- and seven-figure contributions from corporations, unions and wealthy individuals is over. Now, all eyes will turn to the Federal Election Commission, which has the responsibility to effectively enforce the law.&#148; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Center for Responsive Politics is a non-partisan, non-profit research group based in Washington, D.C. that tracks money in politics and its effect on elections and public policy. The Center conducts computer-based research on campaign finance issues for the news media, academics, activists and the public at large. The Center's work is aimed at creating a more educated voter, an involved citizenry and a more responsive government. </FONT></P><P></P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p></font><!-- #EndEditable --></td></tr>
