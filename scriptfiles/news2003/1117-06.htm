- November 17 - Conservation groups blasted a &quot;new&quot; Army Corps of Engineers 
biological assessment on the Missouri River released today as a failed effort 
and warned the document would lead to continued legal wrangling over the Missouri 
River's future.</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
Corps sent the biological assessment to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, as 
the document will serve as the basis for consultation between the two agencies 
over endangered and threatened species concerns on the nation's longest river.</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;This 
biological assessment is old news and is dead on arrival,&quot; said Chad Smith, 
Director of American Rivers' Nebraska Field Office. &quot;It contradicts basic 
river science, fails to include the biological steps necessary to improve the 
river's health, and is simply a 'business as usual' poke in the eye from the Corps.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">According 
to the assessment, the Corps does not believe restoration of more natural flows 
on the Missouri will benefit the river's ecology or specific endangered and threatened 
species on the river. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Flow 
restoration, namely modestly higher flows once every third spring and lower flows 
every summer, have been recommended by the Fish and Wildlife Service as a key 
step necessary to prevent species extinction on the Missouri.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The 
recommended flow changes are supported strongly by the National Academy of Science 
and all of the state fish and wildlife management agencies from the Missouri River 
basin states. Last summer, a federal judge ordered the Corps to implement lower 
summer flows to comply with the Fish and Wildlife Service's recommendations contained 
in their 2000 Biological Opinion.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The 
assessment will be reviewed by the Fish and Wildlife Service, which will then 
develop a new biological opinion on Missouri River dam operations. Last week, 
the Department of Interior announced members of a team that will write the new 
biological opinion by December 15.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The 
Corps is trying to pretend that the patient can recover even though her heart 
has stopped beating,&quot; said Smith. &quot;The science is clear: this river 
needs CPR.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Caalition
