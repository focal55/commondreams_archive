                - April 8 - "The Pentagon's invasion strategy is resulting in 

                numerous and unconscionable casualties among Iraqi civilians," 

                said Ben Manski, Wisconsin Green and co-chair of the Green Party 

                of the United States. "These deaths reveal that the real goal 

                of the U.S. and U.K. is the invasion and occupation of Iraq, not 

                liberation." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On Saturday, 

                American forces in tanks barreled through a residential section 

                of Baghdad, mowing down and shooting at anyone in the way. According 

                to The New York Times, soldiers described it as a "blistering 

                gauntlet of death and destruction that... engulfed civilians as 

                well as Iraqi fighters." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"It is reprehensible 

                to kill and maim civilians as part of a military operation," said 

                Beth Moore Haines, spokesperson for the Green Party of California. 

                "We hold President Bush directly responsible and morally accountable 

                for these deaths." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After the Al 

                Sha'ab market bombing on March 26, Pentagon spokesperson Torie 

                Clarke claimed that the civilian deaths were "a direct result 

                of Saddam Hussein's policies." The Pentagon has refused to confirm 

                or deny whether U.S. forces were responsible. In subsequent briefings, 

                including one after the An Najaf checkpoint shooting of 11 people 

                by U.S. forces, Clarke continued to blame "the climate established 

                by the Iraqi regime" for killings of civilians by U.S. forces. 

                The Pentagon has refused to keep a tally of civilian dead. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Major U.S. 

                news media outlets have deemphasized Iraqi casualties. The Iraq 

                Body Count Project, tabulating deaths from various reputable sources, 

                has verified over 898 civilians, including 22 killed last weekend 

                in Baghdad, killed in the conflict in comparison with 106 U.S. 

                and British soldiers reported killed as of Saturday, April 5. 

                Tens of thousands of Iraqi soldiers have probably died. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Unlike volunteer 

                soldiers, adults who choose their profession with the knowledge 

                they may someday be sent to fight and die, civilians can be cut 

                down at any moment -- walking to the market, sleeping in their 

                home, or fleeing the city," said Starlene Rankin, national delegate 

                for the Lavender Green Caucus. "It is our special task in wartime 

                to protect innocent people. The Pentagon is responsible for every 

                death caused by its bullets and bombs."
