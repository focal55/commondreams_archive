<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AUGUSTA - June 26 - Today Maine became the first state in the nation to enact a law setting goals for the reduction of global warming emissions, as

Governor John Baldacci signed An Act to Provide Leadership in Addressing the Threat of Climate Change.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;I am proud that Maine leads the nation in setting responsible

 climate change goals,&quot;  said Governor John Baldacci.  &quot; Maine' s law paves the way for others to join us in a responsible approach to address the risks of global warming.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

 The legislation requires Maine to develop a climate change action plan to reduce CO2 to 1990 levels by 2010, 10% below 1990 levels by 2020, and by as much as 75-80% over the long term, as agreed to by the New England Governors and Eastern Canadian Premiers.  With this law, Maine has joined a growing number of Northeast states that have, as a group, taken action on climate change into their own hands. Carbon dioxide (CO2), formed when people burn oil and coal, creates a heat-trapping blanket around the Earth that is raising temperatures and causing problems all over the world.

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;At a time when the federal government has deleted climate change information from EPA reports, Maine is not risking our future - we'

re taking action,&quot; said Sue Jones of the Natural Resources Council of Maine, the group that spearheaded the campaign to pass this law.  &quot; The law will help Maine do its part to help reduce the threat of climate change through energy efficiency, clean renewable energy and other actions that save money and protect the environment.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;There are already energy efficient lights, appliances and building techniques that can reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and our

emissions of CO2,&quot; said Paul Paydos, Vice President Technical Services of Guilford of Maine.&quot; There are also clean, renewable energy sources that are ready to go on line.  Our company is ready for the challenge.  We believe that Yankee ingenuity and  ' can-do ' attitude will lead the way to reducing our harmful impact on the planet.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot; There is widespread agreement within the international scientific

 community about three things,&quot;  said Dr. Robert Kates, of Trenton,

Maine; Professor Emeritus at Brown University, who served as a review editor for the United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.  First, serious global warming is taking place; second, the potential impacts of global warming bode ill for the world and for the state of Maine; and, third, global warming is primarily driven by human activity.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot; My legislative colleagues recognize the impact climate change will

 have on Maine's economy, environment, and quality of life,&quot;  said

Rep. Ted Koffman of Bar Harbor, lead sponsor of Maine's climate change bill. &quot; The challenges posed by global warming will be especially felt by future generations. The breakthrough legislation signed today will bring together private and public interests to collaboratively develop a cost-effective plan to reduce global warming while saving energy in the process.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot; Environmental Defense applauds Maine's decision to stand up as a leader on the issue of climate change and we expect other states to

continue to move forward with their own plans, including New York, New Jersey and Connecticut,&quot;  said Jim Marston, director of state climate initiatives with Environmental Defense.  &quot; All of these actions at the state level underscore the urgent need for strong, consistent federal action to control dangerous greenhouse gas pollution.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

 The law, 'An Act to Provide Leadership in Addressing the Threat of

Climate Change', requires the state to:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

 *	By July 2004 create a Climate Change Action Plan to reduce CO2

to levels to 1990 levels by 2010, 10% below 1990 levels by 2020, and by as much as 75-80% over the long term.  These goals are consistent with the New England Governors-Eastern Canadian Premiers agreement, signed by Maine Governor Angus King in August 2001.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

*	Show state leadership by inventorying and reducing CO2 emissions

from state-funded programs and facilities; and,</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

*	Spur at least 50 partnerships with businesses and non-profit

organizations to reduce CO2 emissions. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

 Scientists say that in Maine global warming could increase smog and asthma attacks, cause a rise in sea level that would flood coastal areas, bring more droughts and severe storms, and intensify health threats from insects, such as Lyme disease and West Nile virus.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

What is Climate Change?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

A blanket of CO2, produced by our burning of fossil fuels like coal

 and oil, is trapping heat in our atmosphere, increasing global temperatures and affecting our climate. There is broad scientific  consensus that climate change is underway, the impacts are likely to  be dramatic and fossil fuel combustion by humans is the primary cause.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The state of Maine has decided to act responsibly to help address this serious problem that threatens the economic, social and ecological fabric of our state, nation and world.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

 Fortunately, by using practical, existing technologies for energy efficient appliances and buildings we can reduce the amount of CO2 we 

 pump into the air and reduce our dependence on fossil fuels.  In addition, there are clean, renewable energy sources that are ready to  come on line and contribute significant power.  Maine has both the capability and the responsibility to help lead the way.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Maine may already be seeing effects from climate change.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

*	Over the last century, the average temperature in Lewiston,

Maine has increased by up to 3.4*F and it is expected to rise another 6-10*F over the next century.  This is a greater change in climate variation than in the past 10,000 years.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> *	Average rainfall in Maine has decreased by nearly 20% over the

last century.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

 *	Sea level in Maine is rising at the fastest pace in 5,000 years;

sea level rose by 3.9&quot;in Rockland in the last century alone.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">



Climate change could harm Maine.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

 *	Rising sea level could flood Maine coastal beaches, wetlands,

roads, homes and towns, resulting in hundreds of millions of dollars of

damage.   </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

*	Maine people could experience more severe storms, droughts, smog and asthma attacks.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*	Maine lakes and ponds could be choked by more algae blooms and

reduced oxygen levels that would harm fish and the wildlife that depend on them.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

*	Maine ' s ski season and beautiful fall foliage could

gradually diminish, undermining our tourism industry and economy.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*	Maine could see more health threats from insects, such as Lyme

disease and West Nile virus.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

What Northeast States Are Doing to Address Climate Change.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

*	In 2003, Maine became the first state in the nation to enact a

law that sets goals for the reduction of global warming emissions.  The legislation requires Maine to develop a climate change action plan to reduce CO2 to 1990 levels by 2010, 10% below 1990 levels by 2020, and by as much as 75-80% over the long term.  These goals are consistent with the New England Governors-Eastern Canadian Premiers agreement, signed by Maine Governor Angus King in August 2001.  Maine&gt; ' s law also commits the state to show leadership by inventorying and reducing CO2 emissions from state-funded programs and facilities, and to spur at least 50 partnerships with businesses and non-profit organizations to reduce CO2 emissions.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

 *	In 1999, New Jersey, under the leadership of then-Governor

Christie Todd Whitman, established a goal of reducing greenhouse gas

emissions by 3.5% below 1990 levels by the year 2005.   New Jersey

issued an action plan in December 1999 aimed at helping avert the risks of climate change through measures that are &quot; practical, economically viable, and have other positive economic and environmental benefits.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> *	In December 2001, New Hampshire issued a menu of policy options,

which they call a &quot; Climate Action Plan&quot; , aimed at achieving the goals established by the New England Governors/Eastern Canadian Premiers Climate Action Plan.  Despite its first step, it needs to develop a plan with specific reductions from state-level or regional-level policies, and a concrete timeline.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Scientists have confirmed that global surface

temperatures have increased an average of 1* F over the 20th Century. There is now strong scientific consensus that this observed warming is attributable to human activities, predominantly increased fossil fuel combustion and changes in land use ...Scientists predict that climate change will result in a rise in the sea level, an increase in the number of extreme storm events, disruption of fresh water and food supplies, impacts to the vitality and health of forests and other natural areas, and potential impacts to human health and wildlife.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*	Massachusetts  is drafting that state's Climate Action Plan,

designed to &quot;meet or exceed&quot; the regional goals established by the New England Governors and Eastern Canadian Premiers:  Quoting from that

report: &quot;Changes in the world's climate and weather patterns

will present a major challenge to the health of the Massachusetts environment and economy... We have enough reliable scientific evidence in hand on the serious risks of climate change to warrant taking action right now.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

 *	In July 2002, Rhode Island published a Climate Action Plan

designed to meet the greenhouse gas emission targets of the New England Governors/Eastern Canadian Premiers agreement.  Quoting from that

report: &quot;There is growing international consensus

among scientists and 

 policymakers that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are

warming our planet at a rapid rate.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

 *	In August 2002, the Governor of Vermont issued an executive

order establishing a goal of reducing that state's greenhouse gas emissions by more than 25% over the next decade, consistent with the regional goals.  The Governor said: &quot;The overwhelming majority of the world's

climate scientists  have said that the threat of global warming is real. In Vermont,

we have decided to address these issues&quot;.</font></p>
