                - April 10 - The Association of American Physicians and Surgeons 

                is running print and web ads across the country warning patients 

                that after Monday, April 14, they may need to take extreme steps 

                to protect their medical privacy. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The ads are 

                in response to new federal privacy regulations that go into effect 

                on April 14, and feature a doctor gagged with a surgical mask 

                warning patients, "You have the right to remain silent. Anything 

                you say can and will be used against you." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The so-called 

                "privacy" regulations, authorized under the Health Insurance Portability 

                and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), eliminate patient consent 

                for disclosure of their medical records. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"While masquerading 

                as patient protection, the rules would actually eliminate any 

                last shred of confidentiality and risk lives," said Kathryn A. 

                Serkes, AAPS Public Affairs Counsel. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Serkes explained 

                that quality of patient care is dependant on free communication 

                between patient and physician. "Our survey of doctors shows that 

                anticipation of these regulations has chilled patients' willingness 

                to open up." The survey shows that 87 percent have been asked 

                by patients to lie or keep information out of their records. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Further, the 

                regulations allow almost unlimited access to patient records by 

                government employees, law enforcement, insurance employees, and 

                even marketers if they call their activities "health care operations." 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The frontline 

                defense for medical privacy always has been the patient's right 

                to give or withhold consent to how his records are used and who 

                sees them. These rules throw that out the window," said Serkes. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Under the privacy 

                rules, patients must rely on government security rules to protect 

                their records. But there's a catch - the security rules don't 

                take effect for two more years. Even the government databases, 

                such as Medicare, aren't secure yet. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"It's like 

                buying an alarm system for your home, but not turning it on yet," 

                said Serkes. "The privacy regulations should be delayed at least 

                two years until the security protections are in place." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AAPS is circulating 

                a petition to patients through physician offices, asking them 

                to support AAPS efforts to delay the regulations. They also have 

                a lawsuit pending to overturn the privacy regulations.
