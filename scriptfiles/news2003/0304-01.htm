                - March 3 - Following is an open letter to the media from journalism 

                professors, independent editors, journalists and authors, on media 

                coverage of Iraq disarmament and war preparations: </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Warning that 

                "this is no time for relying solely on official sources and their 

                supporters," more than two dozen journalism school deans and professors, 

                independent editors, journalists and authors today sent an open 

                letter to major media editors, publishers, producers and reporters. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Signers of 

                the letter include: retired New York Times columnist Tom Wicker, 

                former New York Times reporter William Serrin, Ben Bagdikian former 

                dean of the Graduate School of Journalism at University of California 

                at Berkeley, author Studs Terkel, independent journalist and filmmaker 

                Barbara Koeppell and author Ralph Nader. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The letter 

                highlights six patterns of poor media coverage which have characterized 

                war-time reporting during Gulf War I and the present run-up to 

                war in Iraq: </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1. The Horserace 

                Syndrome & Highlighting Tactics Over Political Analysis: "Endlessly 

                repeated news features with titles like 'Showdown with Saddam' 

                present a grave matter as though it were a high-stakes sports 

                contest," the letter says. It goes on to highlight major news 

                stories the media has failed to cover adequately as they obsess 

                over military tactics. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2. Failing 

                to Protest Government Control of Information: The government has 

                frozen out the media and carefully controlled their access to 

                information. Newspapers and TV news have underreported this freeze 

                out, and failed to contest it aggressively. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3. Failing 

                to Maintain an Arms-Length Relationship with Government: " State-controlled 

                media comes in many garbs," warns the letter, noting the overreliance 

                of TV news in particular on government-approved retired military 

                and intelligence consultants. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">4. Failing 

                to Question the Official Story: "The media should never confuse 

                patriotism with obeisance and a rubber-stamp mentality," the letter 

                states. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">5. Failing 

                to Present a Diversity of Viewpoints: "There is a duty to seek 

                out and quote the many experts who express skepticism about claims 

                by the state, rather than simply to rely on the same pundits repeatedly," 

                the letter states. It calls as well on "editors, publishers and 

                producers to see that their op-ed pages, letters-to-the-editor 

                sections and talk shows are open to a vigorous diversity of viewpoints."

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">6. Radio: "Years 

                ago, radio actually acknowledged the concept of orderly debates 

                with widely varying viewpoints," the letter states. "It should 

                do so again." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The letter 

                concludes by calling on the major media to "do your duty to our 

                democratic society." </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">War coverage, 

                and coverage of the period preceding war, test the reliability 

                of our news media. Access to truly independent sources of information 

                is essential, given the government's control of knowledge, data, 

                pictures and other information during this period. The media's 

                display of all significant points of view is especially important 

                because of the tendency of our top officials to equate patriotism 

                with uncritical support of official policy. Precisely for this 

                reason, the public expects its media to meet this challenge by 

                maintaining its independence for the good of the country. It is 

                your professional duty and your obligation to our democratic ideals.

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Unfortunately, 

                objectivity and critical questioning of official sources, which 

                is a measure of your separation from officialdom, have not been 

                true in war-time reporting during Gulf War I and during the present 

                proposals for Gulf War II. </font>

                Syndrome: Highlighting Tactics Over Political Analysis </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the period 

                before and during war, newspapers and the electronic media tend 

                to cover the diplomacy and military engagements as if they were 

                covering a horserace. In the questions about a possible war, the 

                media too frequently limit themselves to details of tactics, weapons 

                and military maneuvers, abandoning the critical balance that is 

                journalism at its finest. The government has exploited this tendency, 

                providing graphic material and features that limit reporting to 

                battlefield tactics. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This tendency 

                is already discernible in current media coverage of the crisis 

                over warmaking decisions, particularly among the electronic media. 

                Endlessly repeated news features with titles like "Showdown with 

                Saddam" present a grave matter as though it were a high-stakes 

                sports contest. The result has been to obliterate broader concerns 

                of consequences over security within the United States and globally.

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There are numerous 

                examples of the confrontation with Iraq that the media have underplayed.

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Heightened 

                risk of terrorism due to a war. The October CIA letter to Congress 

                received little more than one-day's coverage in most news outlets. 

                The letter had a startling message: Iraq poses little if any terrorist 

                threat to the United States, but a war would pose a real risk 

                of inciting such terrorist activities. This alone should be the 

                topic of far more reporting and analysis. This is a real threat 

                to the security of the United States -- brought on, not prevented 

                by war. Surely, this demands further inquiry by the Fourth Estate. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Oil and 

                the war. While it is surely an oversimplification to say a war 

                with Iraq would be only about oil, it also be misleading to deny 

                the fundamental importance of oil to the present conflict. It 

                is not credible that there would be such a strong push for war 

                if there were no oil in Iraq. Nonetheless, there has been very 

                little reporting focused on the extent to which obtaining control 

                of oil has motivated the administration or informs their geopolitical 

                strategizing, the posture of the oil industry toward a war, possible 

                discussions between the administration and the oil industry related 

                to Iraq, and scenarios for how Iraqi oil would be controlled in 

                the event of a U.S. invasion and who would benefit. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- U.S. transfer 

                of weapons of mass destruction materials to Iraq. The process 

                by which the U.S. edited the December Iraqi 12,000 page submission 

                to the UN before permitting it to be shared with all of the members 

                of the Security Council -- and edited out references to U.S. corporate 

                transfers of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) materials to Iraq 

                -- received very little attention in the United States. By contrast, 

                the editing and the transfer of WMD materials to Iraq by Western 

                firms was a major story in Europe, and a German newspaper released 

                the names of the U.S. companies that sold these materials. A 1994 

                Senate banking committee report also documented U.S. transfers 

                of biological agents -- including stock for anthrax and E. coli 

                -- to Iraq. Saddam Hussein's use of chemical and biological weapons 

                against Kurds and Iranians was criminal, but surely more present-day 

                references to these acts as justification for a war in the media 

                should be accompanied by reference to the U.S. role in facilitating 

                Iraq's acquisition of such weapons. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We understand, 

                of course, that some outlets have done some digging in these areas. 

                For every issue we highlight in this letter, there are exceptions. 

                But, in general, we believe it is safe to say -- and Lexis searches 

                confirm -- that there has been, relatively, very little reporting 

                and analysis in these areas. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2. Protesting 

                Government Control of Information </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As Pulitzer 

                Prize winner Pat Sloyan has written, the government's information 

                policy during the Gulf War was to freeze out the media both logistically 

                and substantively from what was going on. This pattern was repeated 

                during the military operations in Afghanistan. The media cannot 

                allow this to recur without sustained and high-level protest. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One key issue 

                is the number of Iraqi casualties in event of war, particularly 

                but not only among civilians. The Pentagon resists releasing its 

                estimates of combatant and non-combatant casualties, but journalistic 

                challenges to this practice are rarely heard. One legacy of the 

                media coverage of the Gulf War is that many Americans believe 

                only a very small number of people died in the conflict -- when 

                in fact a small number of U.S. soldiers died, but tens of thousands 

                of Iraqis perished. </font>

                an Arms-Length Relationship with Government </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The media must 

                keep an objective, arms-length relationship with the government. 

                A separation of state and the fourth estate was lost in 1990-91, 

                most notably with the presence of government-approved retired 

                military and intelligence consultants shoulder- to-shoulder with 

                network anchors. State-controlled media comes in many garbs. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">4. Questioning 

                the Official Story </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During the 

                Vietnam war, for example, the finest journalists were the ones 

                who trusted their public to know the truth and who refused to 

                repeat misleading, false, and manipulative allegations transmitted 

                from official sources. The media should never confuse patriotism 

                with obeisance and a rubber-stamp mentality. Patriotism in reporting 

                the news is searching out and conveying what is factual, relevant 

                and true. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the lead-up 

                to the Gulf War, manufactured and widely publicized stories about 

                Iraqis throwing babies out of incubators in Kuwait helped build 

                support for war. Those stories were later shown to be fabrications. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During the 

                Gulf War, the media repeated the U.S. military claims of its high-tech 

                weaponry success -- replaying videotapes showing targets being 

                hit, as part of its high-tech coverage -- though the alleged accuracy 

                of the Patriot and success of other "smart" weapons was later 

                shown to be untrue. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the present 

                run-up to war, there has been as well more than the standard reliance 

                on unnamed "officials," an always undesirable practice that is 

                even more questionable in war or during wartime preparations. 

                Quoting anonymous officials conveys to readers that these sources 

                are trustworthy and authoritative, without equipping the reader 

                with any basis for independent determination, and moves the reporter 

                closer to the role of simply reporting the government's press

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Because any 

                attack on Iraq would be a pre-emptive one rather than our country 

                responding to an attack, there is an increased obligation of the 

                news media to report the variety of dissenters from a wide variety 

                and massive numbers of citizens of our country. The media must 

                not march in lock-step the moment military action begins. Such 

                a dismissal of the public's right to know in a full and timely 

                manner weakens the meaning of the First Amendment and the pride 

                a democracy has in keeping open channels of public response. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Probing coverage 

                is not achieved alone by having the intrepid reporter on the scene. 

                It also requires courageous and independent editors and publishers 

                who conform to the importance that Thomas Jefferson placed on 

                a free and inquiring press in times of strain, crisis or governmental 

                officiousness. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What is required 

                is not just a matter of covering the antiwar movement, or reporting 

                on demonstrations, advertisements and other signs of public opposition 

                to the war. There is a duty to seek out and quote the many experts 

                who express skepticism about claims by the state, rather than 

                simply to rely on the same pundits repeatedly. There are numerous 

                retired diplomats and high-ranking military officers who are expressing 

                deep reservations about the Bush administration arguments, but 

                who are receiving little media attention. Many critical experts, 

                though by no means all, are identified by the Institute of Public 

                Accuracy on their Web site, <a href="http://www.accuracy.org." target="_new">http://www.accuracy.org.</a>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is incumbent 

                on editors, publishers and producers to see that their op-ed pages, 

                letters-to-the-editor sections and talk shows are open to a vigorous 

                diversity of viewpoints. </font>

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Radio, in particular, 

                has sunk into a pronounced pattern of bias and ideological performance. 

                This extends beyond the opinion of the talk show host to the choice 

                and rude treatment of the occasional guest with an opposing viewpoint. 

                "Shout" radio should remember that it is using public property 

                -- the public airwaves -- and that the 1934 Communications Act 

                that guarantees this public ownership is still the law. Years 

                ago, radio actually acknowledged the concept of orderly debates 

                with widely varying viewpoints. It should do so again. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What we are 

                requesting in the final analysis is a journalism that rises to 

                the occasion and satisfies the finest journalistic standards and 

                practices. This requires considerable review and introspection, 

                with due regard to the fine and insightful advice of your own 

                colleagues who know how "better and best" can be defined. This 

                is no time for relying solely on official sources and their supporters. 

                Now is the time to do your duty to our democratic society. Too 

                much depends on which course you pursue. </font>
