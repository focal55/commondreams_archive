- April 29 - As political 

and business leaders gather in Paris for the Organization for 

Economic Cooperation and Development's (OECD) Forum 2003, 

environmental organizations today submitted complaints to the 

British, French, German, Italian, and U.S. governments charging 

that BP and its consortium partners (see note) in the proposed 

Baku-T'bilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) oil pipeline are breaching the OECD's &quot;Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.&quot; U.S. partners are 

Unocal, ConocoPhillips, and Amerada Hess, through a joint venture. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Baku-T'bilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) oil pipeline is a proposed 

pipeline that would span 1,056 miles (1,760 kilometers) from the 

Azerbaijan capital of Baku, through T'bilisi Georgia, ending in the 

Mediterranean city of Ceyhan, Turkey. A gas pipeline also is 

planned to follow the same route. British Petroleum (BP) is the 

lead sponsor; there are nine other participants in the consortium. 

The BTC consortium is seeking the political and financial support 

of their countries' export credit agencies, the European Bank for 

Reconstruction and Development and the International Finance 

Corporation of the World Bank Group. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The OECD Guidelines oblige companies to &quot;contribute to 

sustainable development and to refrain from seeking or accepting 

exemptions from environmental, health, safety, labor, taxation and 

other legislation.&quot; The NGOs charge that the Consortium has 

negotiated agreements that openly flout this obligation. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Guidelines, which were revised in June 2000, cannot be 

legally enforced. But they are increasingly regarded as a key 

yardstick of corporate social responsibility. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In their 9-page Complaint, the NGOs charge the Consortium with 

having: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- exerted undue influence on the regulatory framework for the 

project - the Consortium's legal team even boasting that it had &quot;created laws&quot; in Azerbaijan; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- sought or accepted exemptions related to social, labor, tax 

and environmental laws; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- pressured the Georgian environment minister to approve the 

Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) despite the minister's 

protests that the EIA violates Georgian law; and </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- undermined the host governments' ability to mitigate serious 

threats to the environment, human health and safety by, among other 

actions, negotiating agreements that free the pipeline project from 

any environmental, public health or other laws that the three host 

countries might adopt in the future. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Other concerns highlighted in the complaint include failure to 

adequately consult with project-affected communities and failure to 

operate in a manner contributing to goals of sustainable 

development. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;US officials have told us we should be grateful for which 

companies are involved in this pipeline,&quot; said Carol Welch, deputy 

director of international programs at Friends of the Earth. &quot;Yet 

as consortium partners in this pipeline, US companies like Unocal 

and ConocoPhillips are violating agreements that our government has 

endorsed and professes to uphold.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;BP markets itself as a clean and green oil company,&quot; said 

Welch. &quot;This complaint reveals how BP and its partners have sought 

exemptions from public health and environmental laws, and 

circumventing genuine public consultation. This isn't beyond 

petroleum, it's beyond the pale.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Given that the consortium is currently seeking public funding 

for the oil pipeline, the groups are calling on governments to give 

immediate attention to the complaints. The groups are also calling 

for an immediate moratorium of construction activities and for 

financial support to be placed on hold until the consortium has 

remedied the breaches to the OECD Guidelines. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises prescribe &quot;standards of behavior&quot; for companies operating in both OECD and 

non-OECD member countries. OECD governments are obliged to create a &quot;National Contact Point&quot; that will promote the use of the 

guidelines among corporations, monitor their implementation and 

hear complaints of specific instances where it is alleged a company 

has violated the Guidelines. The U.S. &quot;National Contact Point&quot; is 

housed at the State Department. </font></p>
