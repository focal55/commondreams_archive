YORK - November 14 - The Elite Consensus: When Corporations Wield the Constitution, 

by George Draffan, a new book from the Program on Corporations, Law &amp; Democracy 

(POCLAD), goes behind the veil of giant corporations &shy;Enron, Bechtel, Halliburton, 

Monsanto, Pfizer, and others making our daily news &shy; to show how the &quot;system&quot; 

really works.</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><table border=0 align=right hspace=5 cellpadding=6 width="300">

</td></tr> </table></font>Draffan describes how corporations leverage power through 

think tanks and business groups to form an undemocratic system of governance over 

citizens. He outlines the normal, everyday ways these institutions shape the national 

investment and political policies, portraying how a shadow system of corporate 

power effectively governs. </FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The 

corporate agenda is served equally by conservative, liberal, and libertarian philosophies, 

according to Draffan. Corporate power, he writes, descends from the U.S. Constitution 

and Supreme Court grants of "personhood" and Bill of Rights protections to corporations.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Unlike 

muckraking books about scandals in one industry or another, Draffan focuses on 

the mechanisms of power wielded by the entire network of corporate players.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">"Today's 

corporate leaders received a head start from the men of property who wrote the 

Constitution,&quot; Richard Grossman and Ward Morehouse, cofounders of POCLAD 

[www.poclad.org, ] wrote in their foreword that succinctly summarizes the book's 

analysis. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The 

Elite Consensus names names. It reads like a playbill of actors on the stage of 

domestic and foreign policy who "wield the Constitution" to their own ends. It 

gives profiles of those players &shy; think tanks, business groups and nonprofit 

organizations -- whose "experts" are regularly quoted in the media promoting corporate 

agendas with no reference to their corporate backers. A valuable guide for activists, 

citizens, journalists, scholars and students, the book reveals the interconnections 

between these organizations and their revolving-door relationships with government. 

</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Interestingly, 

the book includes the Brookings Institution -- a tax-exempt think tank commonly 

considered liberal or centrist --whose board includes corporate CEOs from AT&amp;T, 

Chase Manhattan, Kissinger Associates and Bank of America, a former director of 

the World Bank Robert McNamara, and directors and trustees of major foundations.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">"Corporate-driven 

think tanks and educators enjoy the prestige of university appointments where 

corporate agendas are developed and disseminated," writes Draffan, Executive Director 

of the Public Information Network, Seattle, WA. "Corporate foundations decide 

which charities and which environmental groups get funded. Investment bankers 

control more money than the World Bank and their unregulated speculation in national 

currencies has plunged Latin America and Asia into financial crises. Governments 

have become mere salesmen promoting multinational corporations, which are the 

&#140;muscle and brains' of the global economy."</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The 

Elite Consensus traces corporate funding of think tanks and organizations like 

the Business Roundtable, Chamber of Commerce, Council on Foreign Relations, Trilateral 

Commission, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), International Chamber of 

Commerce, Heritage Foundation, Brookings Institution, American Enterprise Institute, 

United Nations, and other nonprofit corporations.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Draffan 

describes how a single corporation - General Motors-- affected the economies of 

both Mexico and the U.S when it laid off 99,000 U.S. workers between 1992 and 

l996. He said General Motors became the largest private employer in Mexico by 

moving its operations south of the border. U.S. union workers were replaced by 

lower-paid contract and temporary workers making Manpower, Inc.--a temporary employment 

agency--the largest employer in the United States.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The 

political cartoon on the book's cover by nationally noted political artist Matt 

Wuerker illustrates the book's theme: the conflict between &quot;We the People&quot; 

and corporate power. His caricature of the Capitol building and Washington Monument 

shows a billboard hiding the buildings of corporate organizations whose power 

rests on the U.S. Constitution, supported by the building blocks of the 1st and 

14th amendments. Constitutional amendments meant for citizens are the "rights" 

corporations use for themselves in the courts, as the book details. Wuerker, whose 

cartoons can be seen on the POCLAD website, can be contacted at www.mwuerker.com. 

</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Anyone who was 

affected by the recent power blackout, lost a pension in a corporation that went 

belly up, or lost a job in a company whose work was sent to a country with cheaper 

labor, will want to read this book. Public indignation at the Enron and other 

corporate scandals indicates the public is hungry to know more about what is going 

on behind the scenes.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><I>About 

the author:<BR>George Draffan is a forest activist, public interest investigator, 

and corporate muckraker. He is the author of The Elite Consensus, A Primer on 

Corporate Power, and co-author of Railroads &amp; Clearcuts and Strangely Like 

War. For the past fifteen years he has provided research services and training 

to citizens and public interest groups that are investigating and challenging 

corporate power. Some of his work can be found at Endgame, a project of the Public 

Information Network (www.endgame.org), which he directs.</I></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><I>About 

POCLAD: <BR>A dozen activists formed POCLAD (www.poclad.org) in 1994, to research 

and write about constitutional, legal, corporate, and people's movement history 

and since then has held over 200 &quot;Rethinking the Corporation, Rethinking 

Democracy&quot; public meetings. POCLAD continues to develop vital research and 

analysis for the years ahead: reading lists, pamphlets on critical issues, a thrice-yearly 

publication By What Authority, an anthology on corporations and democracy [Defying 

Corporations/Defining Democracy] videos, PowerPoint presentations, and workshops 

for activists engaged in struggles with individual corporations. </I></FONT></P><P><I><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">POCLAD's 

&quot;Rethinking the Corporation/Rethinking Democracy&quot; retreats are incubating 

nation-wide citizen efforts to curb the "corporate usurpation of citizen rights". 

POCLAD's work provides a framework and historical analysis of the Constitution 

and the role it has played in the political struggle between &quot;We the People&quot; 

and corporations. The Elite Consensus is the latest addition to the POCLAD body 

of publications.</FONT></I></P><P><I><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">POCLAD 

principal Karen Coulter, an ecological and social justice activist since l980 

who founded Oregon's Blue Mountains Biodiversity Project, conceived of The Elite 

Consensus as a manual for activists and recruited Draffan to write it.<BR> <BR>WHAT

thought-provoking work on the questions of corporate power in a democracy goes

first step in solving a problem is learning more about the problem, and how and
