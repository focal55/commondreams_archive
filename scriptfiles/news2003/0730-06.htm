- Stores in the Midwest of the United States have become the latest store to carry the controversial Operation Hidden Agenda playing cards. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot; I thought only liberal peace activists would be buying the cards, but liberals and conservatives across the nation have entered into the conversation,&quot; says Kathy Eder, the creator of the cards.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;President Bush may have declared the war to be over, but we are losing soldiers daily. And innocent Iraqi civilians continue to be harmed and killed in the fighting. I believe that we all have a patriotic duty to stay informed about what is going on in Iraq. Our taxes are funding this war; we must accept the responsibility of knowing what has happened, what is happening and what will continue to happen with the money we have each paid from our taxes. We owe it to the soldiers and to our US leaders to stay informed and engaged in the conversation, whether we are Democrats or Republicans.&quot; says Eder, a social justice teacher in San Jose, Ca.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now, after receiving national attention from CNN and the O'Reilly Factor, there are many people from across the nation that are showing an interest in the information on the cards. &quot;Pegasus Games in Madison, Wisconsin, Shakespeare &amp; Co. Booksellers in Missoula, Montana, and Prairie Lights Bookstore in Iowa City, Iowa, are all selling the cards. And more stores are contacting us daily.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Between the card's website, <a href="http://www.operationhiddenagenda.com" target="_new">www.operationhiddenagenda.com</a> and the various stores listed at the site, over 10,000 decks of the Operation Hidden Agenda have sold since June 23rd.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The presses at Liberty have slowed down since printing over 400,000 &quot;Iraq's Most Wanted&quot; Cards, but Eder hopes that the presses will be working at full speed once again; her latest order of 10,000 is in high demand across the United States.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We were selling as fast as we could at stores in California, so we&#146;re very happy to welcome stores in the Midwest. Being raised a Catholic, I was taught that it is our responsibility to be a &#147;voice to the voiceless.&#148; With this deck, I hope to be a voice for the Iraqi civilians who continue to suffer from this war, veterans from Desert Storm who are dealing with Gulf War syndrome, peace-makers around the world, and our Hollywood celebrities who have used their voices to oppose the war.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Eder says that the playing cards, which contain well-known American leaders and symbols, are being used to promote truth and justice.  And she is not leaving the justice to chance; 50 % of the profits are being donated to US Veterans who are dealing with Desert Storm Syndrome from the first Gulf War as well as peace-making and relationship-building missions to Iraq. The five organizations that are receiving funds can be researched at www.operationhiddenagenda.com. So far, $5722.55 of the profits have made their way to the 5 organizations listed at the www.operationhiddenagenda.com. And more money is on the way.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When asked if the cards are a &quot;hit&quot; list like their &quot;Iraqi Most Wanted&quot; counterparts, Eder replies, &quot;Operation: Hidden Agenda is not a hit list.  I&#146;m hoping that the cards will be used to gather people to discuss the ideas of journalists and words of our leaders that are presented in the various articles referenced on the cards. People want to know what is true. It's time to stop looking the other way.  We must be willing to examine U. S. Policy and its repercussions in our global community.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;I decided to seek out the truth of what was happening in Iraq, and this deck is the result of what I have found.  The cards are intended to raise questions that need to be asked.  I have included many quotations that express the intentions of our leaders as well as the observations of journalists.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Operation: Hidden Agenda has 52 cards representing 52 individuals or institutions that need to be examined in order to understand the precursors to and after-effects of the current military action in Iraq. Additionally, there are 2 jokers with quotations from peacemakers who offer what Eder suggests what might be &quot;Operation: True Agenda.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

The cards contain images as well as quotations from articles that attempt to inform people about the possible hidden agendas of various US leaders, organizations, and corporations. </font> </p>
