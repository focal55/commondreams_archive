- October 6 - Statement by Ralph Nader and League of Fans on the Announcement that the 

President of the D.C. Sports and Entertainment Commission is Stepping Down</font>.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Last Thursday, Robert Goldwater, President and Executive Director of the 

D.C. Sports and Entertainment Commission announced that he would not 

seek a renewal of his contract when it expires on Nov. 5. The agency has 

been mired in fiscal irresponsibility, secrecy and failed corporate 

welfare projects since Goldwater took over. Today, Ralph Nader and the 

sports industry watchdog League of Fans released a statement regarding 

this announcement and how the efforts of the DCSEC can be refocused on 

activities and programs designed to spread benefits broadly and enhance the well-being of the District. The statement follows.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">October 6, 2003</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mayor Williams' mandate for the President of the D.C. Sports and 

Entertainment Commission (DCSEC) has collapsed under its own folly. The 

DCSEC had become a secretive and wasteful organization with a free pass 

for its leadership to do anything to attract Major League Baseball at 

the public's expense. Mayor Williams should learn an important lesson -- 

to think things through before giving up the public store, and to 

respect the heartfelt community dissent of citizens of the District of 

Columbia when attempting to turn their neighborhoods into entertainment 

complexes.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The announcement that DCSEC President Robert Goldwater is stepping down 

following a succession of controversies and embarrassments associated 

with the commission should conclude Mayor Williams' failed experiment 

with the agency. This is the perfect time for the Mayor and D.C. Council 

to take principal roles in redefining the leadership, goals and 

accountability of the DCSEC.   </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition to running and maintaining RFK Stadium and the Armory, the 

major goal of a redefined DCSEC should require a dramatic effort to 

rebuild and maintain D.C.'s decrepit neighborhood and youth sports, 

recreation and entertainment facilities. Mayoral and Council support of 

a revised mission for the DCSEC that focuses not on satisfying the 

avarice of wealthy developers and sports moguls, but on meeting the 

recreational needs of D.C. residents, would spread benefits broadly and 

enhance the well-being of the entire city instead of making D.C. a 

playground for corporate welfarists to easily extract public funds away 

from real life and displaced neighborhoods.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Along with this change in mission, new mechanisms of accountability must 

be imposed on the DCSEC. The commission should no longer operate so 

independently from the city government. Instead, the DCSEC should become 

the sports and entertainment branch of the D.C. Department of Parks and 

Recreation, using its considerable resources to complement the 

department, making better the public assets of the city's facilities and 

operating as a fully accountable government organization.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The time, money and resources already spent on the out-of-control bid to &quot;attract&quot; Major League Baseball, along with numerous other boondoggles 

for which the DCSEC is responsible, could have been used to 

significantly improve the recreational needs of the District's 

residents. Such investments may not appear in personal financial 

portfolios, but we should not doubt the profound effect they have on the 

lives of the people and children of the District.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The days of the DCSEC's fiscal mismanagement, questionable activities, 

secrecy and refusal to seek community input on projects should be over. 

So too should attracting &quot;world-class&quot; sporting events by dumping public funds into the laps of private businesses in the dubious name of 

economic development. Broadly-based economic development for the 

District rests on putting the city back together so it can be a better 

place for everyone to live, work and recreate, and the DCSEC should 

reflect that goal.</font></p>
