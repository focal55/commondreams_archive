- May 19 - EPA today announced ten 

new innovative projects from around the country to test creative 

approaches to waste minimization, energy recovery, recycling and 

land revitalization that may be replicated across various 

industries, communities and regions. Examples of projects include: 

"product placement" of environmentally beneficial behavior on tv 

shows; testing a market-based approach for reducing chemical use 

and waste at universities; and exploring an innovative approach to 

processing food waste and its potential renewable energy 

applications. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today's announcement is the second round of grants for $352,000 

of Innovation Pilots; EPA spent $525,000 on the first round in July 

2002. The goal of this initiative is to test innovative ideas to 

make EPA's waste programs more efficient and effective, measure and 

analyze the results, and then get the word out around the country 

so others can learn from the experiments. These projects build 

upon the efforts of the Resource Conservation Challenge (RCC), the 

Land Revitalization and One Cleanup Agendas. The RCC calls on 

Americans to increase the national recycling rate from 30 to 35 

percent and reduce the generation of 30 priority chemicals, both by 

2005. The Land Revitalization Agenda outlines over 60 specific 

ways to help integrate land reuse and economic revitalization into 

EPA's cleanup programs. The goal of the One Cleanup Program is to 

improve the speed, effectiveness, and consistency of cleanups at 

all contaminated sites, and ensure that EPA's activities and 

results are effectively communicated to the public.

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A Brief Description of the Ten Projects: 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Environmental Behavior Placement on TV 

Amount: $30,000 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The U.S. EPA Region 9 office in San Francisco and Headquarters 

Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response in Washington, D.C. 

will develop a public information campaign and guide modeled on the 

private sector concept of "product placement" to place 

environmentally beneficial behavior (EBB) in TV shows. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Small Scale Anaerobic Digester 

Amount: $65,000 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The U.S. EPA Region 2 office in New York City, in partnership 

with the Council on the Environment New York, Columbia University, 

EcoCorp, and Earth Pledge will develop, test and replicate an 

innovative, small-scale anaerobic digestion facility for on-site 

installation at urban food waste neighborhood centers. The pilot 

will explore renewable energy applications (such as fuel cell 

technology) for methane captured from food waste decay. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Greening Industrial Design 

Amount: $50,000 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">EPA Headquarters Office of Solid Waste, in partnership with the 

Industrial Design Society of America, will conduct workshops and 

develop a web site to improve awareness among engineers and 

designers of the highly credible and easy-to-use methods for 

reducing the environmental impacts of products. The pilot will 

look at the entire product lifecycle, including choice of raw 

materials and manufacturing processes. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Developing & Testing a Unified Phase Assessment for Site 

Assessments 

Amount: $40,000 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The U.S. EPA Region 3 office in Philadelphia will develop and 

test a single, draft environmental site assessment tool that can be 

used by all programs within EPA, and will be easy for the public to 

understand and use. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Testing Chemical Management Services in Universities: A 

Market-Based Approach to Reducing Chemical Use and Waste 

Amount: $45,000 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The U.S. EPA Region 9 office, in partnership with the Chemical 

Strategies Partnership, will test a new approach to the way 

chemical providers do business, by making it financially feasible 

for colleges to purchase chemicals by need rather than volume, 

thereby reducing chemical use. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Testing Reuse of Phosphate Sludge 

Amount: $43,000 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The U.S. EPA Region 5 office in Chicago, in partnership with 

Mo-Sci Corp., University of Illinois, Illinois Waste Management 

Resource Center, Illinois EPA and Missouri Department of Natural 

Resources, will investigate the feasability of using non-hazardous 

industrial phosphate sludge waste as a raw material for iron 

phosphate glass. Research shows that iron phosphate glass offers 

great potential as a low-energy alternative to commercial 

silica-based glass fibers. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Agricultural & Municipal Cooperation in Composting Green and 

Animal Wastes 

Amount: $29,000 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The U.S. EPA Region 9 office, in partnership with Sustainable 

Conservation, will test an innovative model for composting dairy 

manure and green waste (waste with contaminants removed) that 

benefits both the agricultural and municipal sectors. The end 

product is a high-use compost that can be used in bulk or bag (such 

as landscaping, gardening and topsoil). A key premise of this 

approach is to realized environmental and economic benefits when 

municipal and agricultural sectors collaborate. Municipalities can 

enhance the economic value and marketability of their compost, 

reduce the amount of landfill material and help the agricultural 

community. The agricultural sector can reduce costs and 

environmental impacts in its water quality and waste stream 

operations.

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Innovative Training for Retail Purchasing Agents on Recycled 

Content Products 

Amount: $20,000 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The U.S. EPA Region 5 office, in partnership with the Recycling 

Association of Minnesota, Ecosource, Illinois Recycling Association 

and Waste Cap, will link vendors of recycled-content products with 

buyers from major retailers to promote the use of such products. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Brockton Brightfields 

Amount: $10,000 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The U.S. EPA Region 1 office in Boston, in partnership with the 

City of Brockton, Mass., Massachusetts Renewable Energy Trust, Bay 

State Gas Co., and Brockton 21st Century Corporation, will examine 

the development and financing of long-term, renewable energy 

projects on Brownfields properties. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Testing the Environmental Results Program for Underground 

Storage Tanks 

Amount: $20,000 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The U.S. EPA Region 1 office, in partnership with the Rhode 

Island Department of Environmental Management, will test the 

Environmental Results Program model on Underground Storage Tank 

Systems to determine whether it can be used to enhance 

environmental performance and compliance. The Environmental 

Results Program replaces case-by-case permits with stringent 

industry-wide environmental performance standards requiring 

companies to submit annual certifications that the standards are 

being met.
