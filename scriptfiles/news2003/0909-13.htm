<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">CANCUN, MEXICO - September 9 - Cancun, Mexico: At the World Trade Organization (WTO) ministerial meeting in Cancun, Mexico, the environmental group Sierra Club is voicing the concern of its more than 700,000 members that the interests of corporations are being put above the interests of working families and environmental protections.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Bush Administration is putting the health and safety of our communities at risk by negotiating new international trade rules that make it much harder to protect our clean air, clean water, and public land,&quot; said Daniel Seligman, Sierra Club's Senior Trade Fellow. &quot;There's a better way. We can make trade safe, clean and fair if our negotiators uphold environmental safeguards and agree to cut the subsidies for global agribusiness.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">New &quot;investor&quot; and &quot;services&quot; rules under negotiation under the WTO threaten the ability of local, state and federal governments to protect the environment. Under Bush administration proposals, these services agreements could slash environmental safeguards for such risky industries as mining, logging, and factory farming. Under proposed new investor rules, the home countries of foreign companies in the United States would gain new powers to sue taxpayers for cash damages if environmental laws or other safeguards affect their profits.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Community Environmental Protections at Risk</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot; Under the services rules on &quot;market access,&quot; US trading partners could challenge the right of a local government to restrict the size or location of a new residential or commercial development. States could be penalized for limiting the number of fishing licenses granted in coastal waters, the amount of waste dumped into a landfill, the amount of timber that can be logged from public lands, or the amount of water extracted from an aquifer. Even limits on energy production in wilderness areas could be challenged as illegal restrictions on &quot;market access.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Clean Water at Risk</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot; New investor rules on &quot;expropriation&quot; could prevent governments from setting standards that protect the public if doing so harms a foreign company's profits. For instance, the Methanex Corporation of Canada used NAFTA's investor provisions to sue U.S. taxpayers for $1 billion after California phased out a hazardous gasoline additive, which the company helps to manufacture. Should Methanex prevail, the federal government would have to force California to reverse its ban or pay damages. Similar lawsuits are expected to grow if investor provisions are included in the WTO.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot; Under the services rules on &quot;domestic regulation,&quot; our laws cannot be &quot;more burdensome than necessary&quot; to a foreign service supplier. This sweeping provision could unravel a wide range of protective laws and programs. For example, foreign water companies such as France's Vivendi/Veolia are already moving into U.S. markets to operate water systems. If local authorities then decide to improve water quality, cutting into profits, the foreign company could than ask its home government to challenge the new standards before the WTO.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Clean Air at Risk</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot; The service rules would enforce a broad version of &quot;non-discrimination&quot; that could threaten a wide range of environmental safeguards. For example, California recently passed a law that requires automakers to reduce global warming pollution from cars. Germany could challenge the law as discriminatory on behalf of Daimler-Chrysler arguing it would suffer greater impact because it would have to spend more than other automakers to meet the new standards.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Instead of services and investor rules now under negotiations, the public needs trade rules that protect the environment, uphold the authority of federal, state and local governments, and strengthen communities while promoting commerce around the world. New rules shouldn't give greater rights to foreign investors than US. Citizens have under U.S. law. Additionally, cuts in production subsidies for global agribusiness would reduce the crop surpluses that harm family farmers the world over and allow government to redirect funds toward sustainable agriculture, rural development, and conservation.</font></p>
