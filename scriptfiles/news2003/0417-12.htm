                - April 17 - On May 1-4, at George Washington University, Marvin 

                Center, Washington, D. C., over 300 persons are expected to attend 

                "Movement Beyond Borders" a historic conference to followup on 

                the work started during the World Conference against Racism, Xenophobia, 

                and Related Intolerance (WCAR) held in Durban, South Africa in 

                September, 2001. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The conference 

                sponsors are a coalition of organizations and individuals. The 

                coalition is organizing a gathering of indigenous peoples, immigrant 

                and refugee communities, African Americans and others of African 

                descent, Latinos, Asians, Pacific Islanders, Arab, Middle Eastern, 

                and South Asian communities, low income and working people, and 

                their allies from all over the United States to come together 

                to continue the work of the Durban conference. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This effort 

                is more critical than ever because the issues of racism and injustice 

                highlighted in Durban have not disappeared but have been heightened 

                by the recent assaults on and curtailments of civil liberties 

                during this post 9/11 era of government sponsored terrorism," 

                stated Patricia Clark, National Coordinator of the Fellowship 

                of Reconciliation, one of the planning organizations. </font>

                Conference against Racism, Xenophobia, and Related Intolerance 

                (WCAR) brought activists together from all over the world to develop 

                a shared vision and political agenda to combat racism, xenophobia, 

                and intolerance," said Shweta Parmar, organizer of the upcoming 

                May conference, "But we realized that the work had just begun. 

                Now, instead of a world of justice, we see a world where the US 

                Government continues to use the tragedy of 9-11 as a justification 

                for permanent war against anyone who does not support US hegemony. 

                Under the guise of national consensus and preserving freedom," 

                she continued, "human rights are threatened and international 

                law violated by policies of pre-emptive military strikes. It is 

                a sad fact that racism is alive and well in the 21st century and 

                xenophobia, defined as a fear of or hatred of strangers, is rampant. 

                It is imperative that all those who believe in justice and peace 

                unite and move ahead as a global force for racial and social justice".
