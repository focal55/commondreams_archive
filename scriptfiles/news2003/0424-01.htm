<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON- April 24 - The death penalty in 

the United States remains an act of racial injustice as well as 

an inherently cruel and degrading punishment, Amnesty 

International said today as it issued a new report on the 

continuing role of race in capital cases in the U.S. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;President Bush has promised that the US will always stand 

firm for equal justice,&quot; said William F. Schulz, Executive 

Director of Amnesty International USA (AIUSA). &quot;If that's true, 

he must call for an immediate halt to federal executions and 

encourage states to follow suit in the face of studies 

consistently indicating that the justice system places a higher 

value on white life than on black life.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Eighty percent of people executed since judicial killing 

resumed in 1977 were put to death for murders involving white 

victims, although blacks and whites are murder victims in almost 

equal numbers in the U.S., according to the report. Since 1977, 

200 African Americans have been executed for the death of white 

victims, which is 15 times as many the number of whites put to 

death for killing blacks during that period. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition, African Americans account for only 12 percent of 

the U.S. population, but represent more than 40 percent of those 

on death row and one in three of those executed. The US will 

soon execute its 300th African American inmate since 1977. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;At least one in five of the African Americans executed since 

1977, and a quarter of the blacks put to death for killing 

whites, were tried in front of all-white juries,&quot; Schulz 

continued. &quot;What are the odds that this happened for entirely 

non-discriminatory reasons?&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The cases highlighted in the report show a pattern of 

prosecutors dismissing minority jurors during jury selection. 

Prospective jurors may only be excluded for &quot;race neutral&quot; 

reasons in U.S. capital trials, but this protection only catches 

the most overtly racist prosecutorial tactics. Even in the 

absence of questionable dismissals, however, defendants have 

faced jury pools in which minorities are under-represented in the 

first place. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;U.S. capital juries do not represent the community because 

death penalty opponents are kept off them,&quot; said Sue 

Gunawardena-Vaughn, AIUSA's Program to Abolish the Death Penalty 

Director. &quot;This is compounded where, for whatever reason, members 

of minority communities are under-represented in the pools from 

which jurors are selected.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Recent research by the Capital Jury Project into the attitudes 

of capital jurors indicates that racial stereotyping can taint 

juror deliberations and that the racial mix of juries can play a 

role in the outcome of capital trials. Two black prisoners were 

executed last month despite allegations that the solitary African 

American on each of their juries was singled out for pressure by 

white jurors to change their vote from life to death. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The U.S. ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All 

Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD) more than eight years ago, 

thereby committing itself to work against racism and its effects, 

including in the justice system,&quot; Gunawardena-Vaughn noted. &quot;As 

far as capital justice goes, there has been a manifest failure of 

human rights leadership. For example, the Bush Administration 

allowed federal executions to resume in 2001 and to continue this 

year despite having failed to explain racial disparities in 

federal capital sentencing.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A 1987 U.S. Supreme Court ruling, McCleskey v Kemp, remains a 

huge obstacle for legal challenges to death sentences on the 

grounds of racial bias in capital sentencing. The ruling places 

the burden of proof of racial discrimination during sentencing on 

the defense and calls for &quot;exceptionally clear proof&quot; of 

discriminatory intent. In 2001, for example, a federal court 

referred to the racial disparities on Ohio's death row as &quot;extremely troubling,&quot; but felt unable to offer any remedy 

because of the McCleskey precedent. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One of the hallmarks of the U.S. capital justice system is the 

number of errors, at both the conviction and sentencing stages of 

death penalty trials, discovered on appeal. A landmark study 

released last year by Columbia University concluded that race is 

one of the factors that feeds the high error rate in capital 

cases. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We don't believe the courts catch all inequities, including 

those caused by conscious or unconscious racism among the 

decision-makers in capital cases,&quot; the report notes. &quot;What is 

more, the tough-on-crime politics of the death penalty means that 

executive clemency is not the fail-safe it is supposed to be. The 

only appropriate response to human fallibility is abolition of 

this irrevocable punishment.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The U.S.' continuing resort to judicial killing gives the lie 

to its self-proclaimed status as global human rights champion,&quot; 

Amnesty International continued. &quot;The fact that the condemned 

are selected for death under a system tainted by discrimination 

and error compounds the country's shame and lends weight to 

accusations of hypocrisy leveled at its leadership.&quot; </font></p>
