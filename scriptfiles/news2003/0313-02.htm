                - March 13 - Four people were arrested this morning on the west 

                steps of the Capitol Building in Washington, DC in an act of non-violent 

                direct action against the possible war in Iraq. Calling on Congress 

                to re-open the debate and vote against war, the four were arrested 

                after being denied entry into the Capitol Building. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nancy Lessin, 

                co-founder of Military Families Speak Out, a national organization 

                of individuals and families with relatives or loved ones in the 

                military, Kelly Campbell, who helped found September 11th Families 

                for Peaceful Tomorrows after losing a relative in the Pentagon 

                Building, Bob Wing of United for Peace and Justice, and Molly 

                McGrath of the National Youth and Student Peace Coalition flashed 

                peace signs to supporters as they were taken away by police. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The four were 

                among a number of speakers at a press conference today announcing 

                the kick off a massive campaign of non-violent civil disobedience 

                in Washington DC and across the nation, calling for peace and 

                protesting war in Iraq. The "Emergency Campaign to Reclaim Democracy 

                and Stop the War Now" was initiated by United for Peace and Justice 

                and the National Youth and Student Peace Coalition, both coalitions 

                comprised of hundreds of organizations. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These groups, 

                along with the Iraq Pledge of Resistance have put out a call for 

                peaceful direct actions starting immediately, in hopes of stopping 

                the war BEFORE it starts. Non-violent direct actions are set to 

                begin Monday March 17th and continue throughout the week in DC. 

                Actions are also planned for the Pacific Stock Exchange in San 

                Francisco tomorrow, and will take place at Congressional offices 

                and other locations throughout the country in the coming days.

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All of those 

                arrested today see non-violent direct action as their civic duty, 

                and as a last resort in the efforts to prevent war and encourage 

                Congressional leaders to carry out the will of their constituents.

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Now is the 

                time to take action, we believe we CAN still stop the war, and 

                we ask people of conscious to come to Washington DC to join us 

                in non-violent civil disobedience on March 17th. Don't wait until 

                the bombs start falling to do everything you can for peace," said 

                Nancy Lessin, founder of Military Families Speak Out, who carried 

                a body bag to the Capitol action as a reminder of what war would 

                mean for many families in her group. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Kelly Campbell 

                of September 11 Families for Peaceful Tomorrows commented, "A 

                majority of the American people and a huge majority of the world's 

                people continue to oppose a unilateral U.S. war on Iraq, and yet 

                Congress refuses to do their duty. If they won't uphold the Constitution 

                and represent the people, we will." </font>
