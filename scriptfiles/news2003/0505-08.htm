- May 5 - The Disabled American 

Veterans (DAV) will donate 59 new Ford Econoline and 152 Windstar 

vans, valued at nearly $4.9 million, to the U.S. Department of 

Veterans Affairs (VA) following a "Drive Away" ceremony at Ford 

Motor Company World Headquarters in Dearborn, Mich., May 6. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The event will celebrate Ford's 100th anniversary and send DAV 

volunteer drivers on their way to deliver the new vans to VA 

medical centers in 42 states. The vans join a nationwide fleet 

previously donated by the DAV and already at work transporting sick 

and disabled veterans to and from VA medical facilities for 

much-needed treatment. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Ford Motor Company and its many employees are honored to be 

part of a continuing partnership with the DAV and their many 

outstanding volunteers," said John M. Rintamaki, Vice President, 

Ford Motor Company. "We take great pride in knowing our 

craftsmanship is at work when the DAV puts this fleet of 

specialized Ford vans on the road to help sick and disabled 

veterans." 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ford Motor Company's partnership with DAV began in 1922 when 

Henry Ford organized a cross-country caravan of 50 Model T Fords to 

transport DAV members to the organization's second national 

convention in San Francisco. Since 1996 Ford Motor Company has 

donated 79 vans to the DAV. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The 211 Ford vans we launch on May 6 join the DAV 

Transportation Network, which is a shining example of a charitable 

institution stepping in to meet a substantial community need," said 

Edward R. Heath Sr., National Commander of DAV. "The respect and 

appreciation I have for our DAV and Auxiliary members who give so 

freely of themselves caring for veterans and their families in 

communities across the country is unmatched." 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DAV chapters and state departments are actively involved in 

volunteer transportation programs designed to provide rides for 

veterans who have no way to get to VA hospitals and clinics for 

necessary medical attention. VA travel benefits were severely 

curtailed in 1987, and have not yet been fully restored. The DAV 

Transportation Network is essential to veterans nationwide. Under 

the Transportation Network, Hospital Service Coordinators have been 

placed in 172 VA medical facilities to run programs locally. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The DAV has donated 1,405 vans, worth more than $29 million to 

VA medical centers nationwide since the program began in 1987. Last 

year, DAV volunteers drove more than 27 million miles, providing 

more than 750,000 rides for veterans. In the past 16 years DAV 

drivers have logged more than 282 million miles providing over 7.4 

million rides to veterans.
