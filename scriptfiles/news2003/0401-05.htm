                FRANCISCO - April 1 - Conservation groups filed a lawsuit in the 

                United States District Court today challenging the delay of Endangered 

                Species Act protection for the Sierra Nevada population of the 

                mountain yellow-legged frog (Rana muscosa), an extremely imperiled 

                amphibian inhabiting high elevation lakes, ponds, and streams 

                in the Sierra Nevada. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The environmental 

                law firm Earthjustice filed suit against the U. S. Fish and Wildlife 

                Service on behalf of the Center for Biological Diversity and Pacific 

                Rivers Council, organizations that petitioned to list the species 

                under the ESA in February 2000. In January 2003, the service published 

                a "warranted but precluded" decision, agreeing that the mountain 

                yellow-legged frog warrants listing as an endangered species, 

                but claiming listing is precluded by "expeditious progress" being 

                made on listing of other species. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Center for 

                Biological Diversity spokesperson Jeff Miller called the service's 

                decision, "An obviously political and callous delaying tactic 

                that is a recipe for extinction of the frog. Considering their 

                terrible track record on Endangered Species Act enforcement-not 

                a single species listed that wasn't a result of environmental 

                lawsuits or petitions-the Bush administration can hardly point 

                to 'expeditious progress' in protecting endangered species." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Noting the 

                frog survives in as little as 10 percent of its original range 

                in the Sierra Nevada, Deanna Spooner of the Pacific Rivers Council 

                wondered, "How much more endangered does a species have to become 

                before the Fish and Wildlife Service will take action? The intent 

                of the Endangered Species Act is being subverted through administrative 

                delay, sentencing the mountain yellow-legged frog and other species 

                in need of immediate protection to extinction through inaction." 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Miller characterized 

                the warranted-but-precluded designation as a "regulatory purgatory" 

                for endangered species, noting the average length of time a species 

                remains on the list before receiving ESA protection is about 17 

                years. Species placed on the "warranted but precluded" list receive 

                no legal protection, nor is there any limit on how long they may 

                be left on the list. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The service 

                has attempted to blame litigation and court orders to designate 

                critical habitat as an excuse for delaying listing of vanishing 

                species. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The service's 

                own scientists admit that the frog will soon be gone forever unless 

                it receives protection, but the political appointees say the agency 

                too busy with other priorities to do anything," said Greg Loarie 

                an attorney with Earthjustice who is representing conservation 

                groups. "It's pretty clear that the appointees don't consider 

                protecting imperiled species to be much of a priority at all, 

                because citizen lawsuits are the only way they'll do anything 

                these days." </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BACKGROUND 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The mountain 

                yellow-legged frog was historically the most abundant frog in 

                the Sierra Nevada, ranging from southern Plumas County to southern 

                Tulare County, at elevations mostly above 6,000 feet. In 1959, 

                Dr. David Wake, a herpetologist with the U.C. Berkeley Museum 

                of Vertebrate Zoology, reported so many of the frogs near Tioga 

                Pass that, "It was difficult to walk without stepping on them." 

                Surveys 30 years later revealed that the frogs were gone. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The service 

                acknowledges that the frog has disappeared from the vast majority 

                of known historical locations in the Sierra Nevada and that many 

                of the largest populations have completely crashed in recent years; 

                one of the largest remaining populations containing more than 

                2000 adult frogs in 1996 had been reduced to only two frogs by1999. 

                Particularly disturbing are recent frog surveys in relatively 

                pristine areas of the Sierra Nevada in the John Muir Wilderness 

                and Kings Canyon National Park that revealed an alarming decline 

                of more than 40 percent in the last five to seven years alone. 

                At this rate of decline, scientists are predicting that the frog 

                will become completely extinct in the Sierra within decades. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The species 

                is thought to be declining primarily due to predation by non-native 

                trout, stocked in many high-elevation Sierra lakes by the California 

                Department of Fish and Game, which prey upon tadpoles and juvenile 

                frogs. Other causes include habitat degradation due to livestock 

                grazing and the impacts of drought and environmental changes caused 

                by global warming. Disease has ravaged many frog populations recently 

                - factors such as pesticides, acid precipitation, and increased 

                ultraviolet radiation as a result of ozone depletion likely render 

                frogs much more susceptible to disease. Recent research has linked 

                pesticides that drift from agricultural areas in the Central Valley 

                and other airborne chemical pollutants to adverse impacts to native 

                amphibians in the Sierra Nevada; pollutants can directly kill 

                amphibians, interrupt breeding and feeding activity and larval 

                development, and also act as environmental stressors, which render 

                amphibians more susceptible to disease. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Center 

                for Biological Diversity and Pacific Rivers Council submitted 

                a formal petition to list the mountain yellow-legged frog in February 

                2000 and subsequently filed suit in May 2001 to compel the service 

                to respond to the listing petition. In December 2001 the FWS was 

                ordered by the Northern District Court to make a final listing 

                determination for the species. </font>
