                - March 13 - HHS Secretary Tommy G. Thompson today announced two 

                proposed rules from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that 

                will improve patient safety by reducing medication errors and 

                by more quickly identifying potential errors that may occur. The 

                new rules, part of FDA's strategic initiative to reduce adverse 

                events involving the products it regulates, will require bar coding 

                on medications and will improve reporting requirements for safety 

                problems involving medicines. "These proposals are key steps in 

                reducing medication problems through using state-of-the-art technology," 

                Secretary Thompson said. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Today's actions 

                are the start of a comprehensive strategy to build a medical patient 

                protection system for the 21st Century," said FDA Commissioner, 

                Mark B. McClellan, M.D., Ph.D. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One of the 

                major initiatives announced today -- the proposed requirement 

                for bar codes -- adopts a technology that is widely used in other 

                industries to reduce the number of medication errors in hospitals 

                and other health care settings. The required bar code would contain 

                the National Drug Code (NDC) number, unique identifying information 

                about the drug that is to be dispensed to the patient, in a linear 

                bar code as part of the drug label. The proposed design would 

                allow manufacturers to include additional information, and more 

                information could also be added to the bar code standards as information 

                technology progresses. When used with bar code scanners and computerized 

                patient information systems, bar code technology can prevent many 

                medication errors including administering the wrong drug, administering 

                a drug to a patient who is known to be allergic, administering 

                the wrong dose, administering the drug at the wrong time, or using 

                the wrong route of administration (for example, by injection rather 

                than by mouth). </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition 

                to the human suffering they cause, medication errors represent 

                a significant economic cost to the United States. According to 

                the Institute of Medicine and other experts, thousands of deaths 

                and millions of hospitalizations result from medication errors. 

                The expected annual benefit from preventing adverse events due 

                to medication errors is equivalent to $3.9 billion. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The proposed 

                rule would apply to all prescription drug products, including 

                biological products and vaccines (except for physician samples), 

                and OTC drugs that are commonly used in hospitals and dispensed 

                in a hospital pursuant to an order. Standardized bar codes would 

                also be required on prescription drug products used in other settings 

                such as retail pharmacies. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The second 

                action the agency is announcing -- the proposed revamping of safety 

                reporting requirements -- aims to enhance the agency's ability 

                to effectively monitor and improve the safe use of medications 

                including drugs and biologics. The proposed rule would: </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Improve 

                the quality and usefulness of safety reports submitted to the 

                agency as well as facilitating the consistency of safety reporting 

                around the world. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Require 

                the submission of all suspected serious reactions for blood and 

                blood products on the market. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Require 

                reports on important potential medication errors. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These steps 

                would provide FDA with more useful, timely, and extensive information 

                to support quicker, more effective actions by the agency to prevent 

                adverse events. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To expedite 

                the agency's review of and response to medication errors, the 

                proposed amendments would require companies to submit to FDA, 

                within 15 calendar days, all reports they receive of actual and 

                potential (i.e., "near miss") medication errors occurring in the 

                United States. An example of a potential medication error - from 

                the standpoint of the rule - is a situation in which a pharmacist 

                selects the wrong medication because of a similar sounding name 

                but catches the error prior to dispensing the medication. In this 

                case, no patient was the recipient of an actual medication error. 

                However, if the pharmacist reported what happened in an effort 

                to alert the company to this potential problem, then the company 

                would be required to report the "potential" (or "near miss") medication 

                error to FDA. In this manner, FDA could work with the company 

                to make changes to help ensure that actual medication errors because 

                of this problem do not happen. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The proposal 

                would also raise the quality and consistency of safety reports 

                by requiring the use of internationally agreed definitions reporting 

                formats, and other safety reporting standards. If the proposed 

                safety reporting standards are implemented, companies will be 

                able to devote their resources to preparing a single, high-quality 

                report for submission to all major regulatory agencies around 

                the world. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Under this 

                proposal, blood establishments would be required to submit to 

                FDA reports of all suspected serious reactions, not just fatalities, 

                which currently is the case. The proposal refines and clarifies 

                the expectations for the amounts of data needed in various safety 

                reports. The net effect will be to lessen some of industry's reporting 

                burdens - especially for certain non-serious suspected adverse 

                reactions - thus allowing companies to focus their resources on 

                producing quality reports of serious suspected adverse reactions 

                which potentially have a much greater public health impact. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Both proposed

                FDA invites written comments from the public on these proposed 

                rules to the Dockets Management Branch (HFA-305), Food and Drug

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In coordination 

                with today's actions, FDA is using emerging technologies such 

                as automatic reporting systems to promote greater patient safety. 

                By capturing important risk information automatically using modern 

                clinical information systems, FDA can augment the information 

                it will obtain through its mandatory adverse event reporting programs. 

                These automatic programs are designed to expand with the use of 

                sophisticated electronic information systems in health care, and 

                in many cases will be able to provide results and safety guidance 

                in electronic form to participating providers and organizations 

                based on the electronic data provided. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Specifically, 

                FDA is involved in a public-private collaboration called "Connecting 

                for Health," aimed at improving quality and patient safety through 

                the adoption of clinical data standards and compatible health 

                information systems. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Under this 

                program, the FDA will also participate in a national pilot project 

                that will involve several hospitals, such as New York Presbyterian, 

                along with information technology suppliers, such as IBM, that 

                will explore real-time identification of adverse events associated 

                with medical products. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The agency 

                also plans to expand its Internet-based pilot program (MedSun) 

                to work collaboratively with more than 100 health care facilities 

                across the country to help ensure the safe use of medical products, 

                and will expand its collaborative electronic program on medical 

                device safety. In addition, FDA recently developed a partnership 

                with a managed care organization and with the Centers for Medicare 

                & Medicaid Services which will allow FDA to access high-quality 

                data that can be used to analyze safety concerns in large patient 

                populations.
