                VA. - March 5 - The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and 

                Health Administration (MSHA) will re-propose standards to require 

                verification of coal mine operator dust control plans and will 

                re-open its rulemaking record on the method used to determine 

                respirable coal mine dust concentrations. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"With these 

                two actions, we are moving on towards more effective prevention 

                of black lung disease," said Dave D. Lauriski, assistant secretary 

                of labor for mine safety and health. "Our goal is to send every 

                miner home safe and healthy at the end of every working day." 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MSHA is proposing 

                to assume responsibility for all underground compliance dust sampling. 

                Under current rules, mine operators take most of the samples required 

                to determine compliance with the federal standards designed to 

                prevent black lung. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While eliminating 

                the requirement for compliance sampling by underground coal mine 

                operators, the proposal calls for mine operators to collect samples 

                to verify the adequacy of dust control measures specified in their 

                mine ventilation plans. The new proposed rule reflects public 

                comments on an earlier version of the proposal. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At the same 

                time the record is being reopened on a previous proposal to revise 

                the way MSHA determines compliance with respirable coal mine dust 

                standards. MSHA and the Department of Health and Human Services 

                jointly developed a proposed rule stating that the average concentration 

                of respirable dust to which an individual working miner is exposed 

                can be accurately measured over a single shift. The proposed rule 

                would update a 32-year-old "finding" that called for averaging 

                samples taken over multiple shifts. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MSHA is asking 

                for comments and expects to hold public hearings on both issues. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"These rulemaking 

                actions are part of our comprehensive program to improve safety 

                and health performance in the mining industry," Lauriski said. 

                "We are using all the tools provided by law -- enforcement, education 

                and training, and technical assistance -- to reinforce safety 

                and health as values throughout the Nation's mining industry." 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Both rulemaking 

                documents went on open file at the offices of the Federal Register 

                today and will be published March 6 and will be posted on MSHA's 

                website at <a href="http://www.msha.gov" target="_new">http://www.msha.gov</a>.
