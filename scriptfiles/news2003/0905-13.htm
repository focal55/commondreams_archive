- September 5 - On September 4, an international coalition of environmental allies led by Rainforest Action Network (RAN) sent letters to each of the banks that signed on to the Equator Principles (EqP) in June 2003, urging them to keep their commitment and remove the Camisea project from their funding pipelines.  The letter reminds the signatory banks that the EqP includes environmental policies put in place by the International Finance Corporation and that there are several which are relevant to Camisea.  Among those are safeguards that only allow for light, non-extractive projects in critical natural habits and forests of high ecological value like Peru&#146;s Lower Urabamba Valley.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The letters to the EqP banks follow a severe blow dealt by the Export-Import Bank&#146;s (ExIm) decision in August of this year to deny $214 million in loan guarantees for the Camisea project.  ExIm cited potential damage to Peru&#146;s pristine rainforests and uncontacted indigenous people as reasons for its decision. ExIm found that massive erosion has already occurred on the pipeline route and that unique biodiversity faced &#147;significant, long-term and largely irreversible&#148; deterioration.  Due in large part to public pressure, Citigroup, the only American bank to sign on to the Equator Principles, ended its relationship with the Camisea consortium in 2002.  The InterAmerican Development Bank (IDB) will consider loans to the Camisea project at its board meeting on September 10.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The Camisea Consortium, led by Texas-based Hunt Oil , has violated basic social and environmental principles in their desperate scramble to advance construction ahead of required environmental impact assessments.  The Equator Principles would be irreparably undermined if any of the signatory banks were to reward these renegade business practices. Camisea is a litmus test for the Equator Principles.&#148; said Ilyse Hogue, global finance campaign director for Rainforest Action Network.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Letters were sent to EqP signatory banks including ABN AMRO (The Netherlands), Barclays PLC (United Kingdom.), Citigroup (United States.), Credit Lyonnaise (France), Credit Suisse Group (Switzerland), Dresdner Bank (Germany), HVB Group (Germany), ING Group (The Netherlands), MCC (Italy), Rabobank Group (The Netherlands), Royal Bank of Canada (Canada), The Royal Bank of Scotland (United Kingdom), WestLB AG (Germany), Westpac Banking Corporation (Australia) and Westpac Banking Corporation (New Zealand).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Environmental groups signing on to the letter included Rainforest Action Network (United States), Campagna per la Riforma della Banca Mondiale (Italy), The Berne Declaration (Switzerland), Greenpeace (United States), Friends of the Earth (United States), International Rivers Network (United States), Urgewald e.v. (Germany), Finnish ECA Reform Campaign (Finland), FERN (Belgium), EURONATURA (Portugal) Proyecto Gato (Belgium), Amazon Watch (United States), Global Response (United States), EURONATUR (Germany), Greenpeace (Belgium), Mineral Policy Institute (Australia), World Economy, Ecology &amp; Development (Germany), QUERCUS (Portugal), Both ENDS (The Netherlands), Environmental Defense (United States), Institute for Policy Studies (United States), Friends of the Earth (International), The Corner House (United Kingdom), and The Wilderness Society (Australia).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Camisea project is located in the Lower Urubamba River Valley deep in the Peruvian Amazon, a region widely recognized for its unparalleled biodiversity. Specially protected areas are also home to some of the last indigenous communities living in voluntary isolation from the modern.  In a study commissioned by Shell, the Smithsonian Institute identified the area &#147;to be in nearly pristine condition.&#148;</font></p>
