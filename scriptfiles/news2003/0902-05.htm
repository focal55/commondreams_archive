<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">HAVANA, Cuba - September 1 -  While twenty Heads of State and over 110 Ministers 

gather in Havana, Cuba, for a key <a href="http://www.unccd.int/cop/cop6/menu.php" target="_new">United Nations conference on Desertification</a>, 

Friends of the Earth International alerted them today on the potential impacts of the 

trade negotiations on drylands that are currently taking place within the World Trade 

Organization (WTO).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

 

Desertification and land degradation are global environmental problems that devastate 

the livelihoods of millions of rural people, especially small-scale farmers. It is estimated 

by the Secretariat of the Desertification Convention that the degradation of land is 

costing the world community up to 40 billion USD per year. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Yet, official development 

aid to rural communities, where the majority of the world's poor lives, has been 

declining over the past decade. Meanwhile, droughts and other climatic extremes 

caused by climate change are taking a particularly heavy toll on dryland populations. Agricultural trade liberalization as currently proposed by the US and European Union 

(EU) at the WTO will place an additional burden on dryland populations. Most dryland 

communities consist of small farmers who are unable to compete on a world market. 

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Even the local markets of these small producers are nowadays rapidly being taken 

over by subsidized agricultural products from the EU, the US and other industrialized 

countries. The trade proposals by the EU and US leave their direct and indirect support 

structures for export-oriented agriculture virtually untouched, while they would force 

developing countries to open up their agricultural markets for these subsidized 

products. The results would be devastating for dryland producers and for the lands 

these communities manage.

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Water privatisation triggered by the General Agreement in Trade in Services under the 

WTO will put an additional burden on dryland populations. Water is a very precious 

common good in many arid zones, and few rural farming and pastoralist communities 

are able to pay for privatized water services. Water privatisation schemes have already 

lead to disastrous effects in countries like Niger and Northern Mali, where rural people 

living in deserts and drylands have been faced with water bills that are taking up 

between 12 and 70% of their income. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Friends of the earth international calls upon the Heads of State and Ministers gathered 

in Cuba to ensure that desertification concerns, and the rights and interests of dryland 

communities are put in the frontlight during the upcoming Ministerial meeting of the 

WTO in Cancun.</font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
