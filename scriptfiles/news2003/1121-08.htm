-  
November 21 - Congressman Dennis J. Kucinich (D-OH), joined by five of his colleagues, sent a letter to Interior Secretary Gale Norton requesting that the Interior Department provide all documents, &quot;related to Deputy Secretary Griles' outside financial agreements and the Office of Government Ethic's decisions based on those financial arrangements.&quot;</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">When appointed in August 2001, Deputy Secretary Griles participated in a financial arrangement where he receives $284,000 annually for four years from the lobbying firm where he was formerly employed, National Environmental Strategies (NES). The arrangement, brought to light through a financial disclosure statement filed in April 2001, prompted a review by the Office of Government Ethics. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Today, Kucinich and his colleagues requested that the Department of the Interior provide them with all documentation regarding the initial financial disclosure form, as well as, both the draft and final version of the Government Ethics decision.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In their letter the Members of Congress state: </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;We are seeking this information because questions have been raised related to the independence of the Deputy Secretary and, in response, your Department has requested that he sign a second recusal agreement.  While working for National Environmental Strategies as a lobbyist, he advocated for over 40 coal, oil, gas and electric companies and trade associations.  These same entities are regulated by the Department of the Interior and have active interests before the Department of the Interior.  The specific financial ties of the Interior Deputy Secretary to industries regulated by the Department of the Interior should be made known.  </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Finally, the public has a right to know the reasons of the Office of Government Ethics in allowing this financial arrangement.  Through Freedom of Information Act requests and legal complaints, the public has repeatedly sought access to this information, yet it has been denied.  If the Deputy Secretary's financial arrangements are sound, and do not create a conflict of interest, then Department of Interior and Office of Government Ethics should not continue to stonewall.  Maintaining secrecy over this matter creates the impression that agencies are hiding something from public view.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Joining Kucinich on the letter are Progressive Caucus Co-Chair Barbara Lee (D-CA), and Reps. Raul Grijalva (D-AZ), Grace Napolitano (D-CA), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) and Peter DeFazio (D-OR). </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><I>For a complete copy of the letter please contact Doug Gordon at (202) 225-5871 or via email at doug.gordon@mail.house.gov.</I></FONT></P><P></P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p align="center">###</p></font><!-- #EndEditable --></td></tr>
