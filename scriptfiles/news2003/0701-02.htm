<p> </p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The campaign launch coincides with the start date for the U.N. International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families. The Migrant Rights Convention becomes the seventh United Nations treaty on human rights. It has thus far been ratified by 22 countries, including Mexico, El Salvador, and Guatemala.</font></p>

<p> </p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In contrast to the treatment and policies being meted out to migrants by the U.S. government, signatory countries to the Migrant Rights Convention have pledged to uphold the human rights of migrants and protect their right to life and to freedom from cruel or inhumane treatment.</font></p>

<p> </p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The National Network for Immigrant and Refugee Rights (NNIRR) joins the CDH&#146;s call to end &#147;Operation Triple Strike&#148; and all border militarization. Ms. Catherine Tactaquin, NNIRR Executive Director, declared, &#147;These policies coerce migrants seeking work to risk their lives as they attempt to cross alone or fall prey to smugglers who may extort them for exorbitant sums.&#148;</font></p>

<p> </p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Operation Triple Strike opens the door further to extending border enforcement strategies into communities in the U.S. interior, as immigrants are hunted down in airports, bus depots, highways, worksites, and neighborhoods. There are a growing number of illegal immigration raids taking place in regions as diverse as Alabama, Maine, Kentucky, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Texas, and other states &#150; all under the guise of national security.</font></p>

<p> </p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Department of Homeland Security is now responsible for continuing the devastating border enforcement strategies causing the death and disappearance of countless migrants. The militarization of the U.S.-Mexico border violates our civil liberties and divides neighbors. DHS must make the border safe for everyone by ending these policies.</font></p>

<p> </p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Operation Lethal Failure</font></p>

<p> </p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On Tuesday, June 10, the Department of Homeland Security&#146;s Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (BICE, the new and expanded Migra) began implementing &#147;Operation Triple Strike&#148; in Arizona, purportedly to prevent smuggling and save migrants&#146; lives.</font></p>

<p> </p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Isabel Garc&iacute;a of the CDH warned, &#147;How can Operation Triple Strike stop smugglers or save lives if it is more of the same? It makes migrants more vulnerable to abuse at the hands of smugglers, vigilantes, and immigration enforcement officials and local police. Only by providing safe passage with visas can smugglers be deterred and migrant lives rescued.&#148;</font></p>

<p> </p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BICE&#146;s &#147;triple&#148; strike consists of:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Putting more border agents and increasing surveillance, further closing the border and forcing migrants to cross through an even more isolated and lethal corridor; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Immigration raids against alleged smuggler&#146;s &#147;safehouses,&#148; cracking down on predominantly immigrant neighborhoods in key Arizona cities; and, </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Racial profiling of passengers going through Phoenix&#146;s Sky Harbor airport to detect and detain immigrants.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;By further closing the border, Operation Triple Strike is pushing migrants into even more dangerous terrain, putting their lives in jeopardy. It subjects border communities to illegal and unconstitutional detentive stops, based on racial profiling, and spurs more neighborhood raids shattering families and communities,&#148; explained NNIRR&#146;s Ms. Tactaquin.</font></p>

<p> </p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Operation Triple Strike is a lethal threat to our civil liberties and public safety; it must end now and militarization rolled back,&#148; demanded Ms. Tactaquin.</font></p>

<p> </p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We call on our United States government to:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot;        End these deadly border enforcement strategies; instead protect the human rights and constitutional liberties of all immigrants and communities on the U.S.-Mexico border;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot;        Demilitarize the U.S.-Mexico border and cease all enforcement policies, practices, measures, laws, and strategies that criminalize migrants forcing them into dangerous crossing areas;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot;        Address the backlog and facilitate family reunification by increasing visas, allowing migrants to cross safely and not risk their lives at the hands of smugglers, unscrupulous employers, or immigration officials who act with impunity and jeopardize public safety;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot;        Develop bi-lateral migration policies and practices that uphold the human rights of migrants, accountable to independent, civilian community-based monitoring and oversight; and,</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot;        Implement routine programs of legalization that expand access to visas and provide access to permanent residency including future flows. Systematic legalization programs &#150; recognizing human, labor, environmental, and civil rights &#150; will ensure that migrants have options to unite with their families and avoid mortal danger.</font></p>

<p> </p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Peace, safety, and the dignity of all communities on the U.S.-Mexico border can be guaranteed only by ending the inhumane treatment of migrants.</font></p>
