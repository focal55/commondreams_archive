                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON 

                  - April 4 - Citizen Works today gave Vice President Dick Cheney 

                  the &#147;Daddy Warbucks&#148; Award for corporate war profiteering 

                  in a demonstration outside the D.C. office of Halliburton subsidiary 

                  Kellogg, Brown and Root (KBR), one of the biggest winners so 

                  far in the Iraq contracting bonanza. </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Halliburton 

                  subsidiary&#146;s contract exemplifies the Bush administration&#146;s 

                  troubling policy of awarding billions of dollars for war-related 

                  work to a few politically-connected companies. </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The 

                  Cheney-Halliburton story is the classic military-industrial 

                  revolving door tale,&#148; said Charlie Cray, director of the 

                  Campaign for Corporate Reform at Citizen Works. &#147;The Bush 

                  administration is rife with highly-placed officials with ties 

                  to weapons, construction, and oil companies that are exploiting 

                  this war for profit. And Dick Cheney&#146;s Halliburton stands 

                  out. Since the company has far greater access to Cheney than 

                  citizens, we are asking the company to deliver the award to 

                  him at his undisclosed location.&#148; </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Although 

                  the United States has the obligation to pay for the costs of 

                  reconstructing Iraq,&#148; Cray said, &#147;the United Nations 

                  is the only proper body to provide governance and help rebuild 

                  a new government, civil society, and physical infrastructure 

                  if the current regime is overthrown, not the White House, Pentagon, 

                  and their corporate cronies.&#148;</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The event 

                  was part of Big Business Day, Citizen Works&#146; second annual 

                  national day of action to focus on the dangers of runaway corporate 

                  power. Other activities are planned for Saturday in approximately 

                  100 locations throughout the country, from Boise to Brooklyn, 

                  from San Antonio to St. Louis. All over America, rallies, protests, 

                  teach-ins and other events will highlight the different ways 

                  that unaccountable corporate power is a threat to democracy 

                  and the ways that certain corporations are poised to exploit 

                  the tragedies of war in Iraq.</font></p>

                  Pennsylvania, citizens will hold a protest at a local Clear 

                  Channel station. In Huntington Beach, California, Citizens will 

                  hold a protest outside a Boeing plant and then march to an ExxonMobil 

                  facility. In Akron, Ohio, citizens will focus on oil and big 

                  business at a demonstration in front of the Federal Building.
