                - March 11 - A full-page ad in Sunday's New York Times quotes 

                a Senate floor speech by Sen. Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.), declaring 

                that "pressure appears to be having a good result in Iraq" and

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"To engage 

                in war is always to pick a wild card. And war must always be a 

                last resort, not a first choice. I truly must question the judgment 

                of any President who can say that a massive unprovoked military 

                attack on a nation which is over 50 percent children is 'in the 

                highest moral traditions of our country." This war is not necessary 

                at this time. Pressure appears to be having a good result in Iraq. 

                Our mistake was to put ourselves in a corner so quickly. Our challenge 

                is to now find a graceful way out of a box of our own making. 

                Perhaps there is still a way if we allow more time." </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"...There are 

                huge crack emerging in our time-honored alliances, and U.S. intentions 

                are suddenly subject to damaging worldwide speculation. Anti-Americanism, 

                based on mistrust, misinformation, suspicion, and alarming rhetoric 

                from U.S. leaders is fracturing the once solid alliance against 

                global terrorism which existed after September 11. " </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">..."Frankly, 

                many of the pronouncements made by this Administration are outrageous. 

                There is no other word. Yet, this chamber is hauntingly silent. 

                On what is possibly the eve of horrific infliction of death and 

                destruction on the population of Iraq-a population, I might add, 

                of which over 50 percent is under age 15-this chamber is silent. 

                On what is possibly only days before we send thousands of our 

                own citizens to face unimagined horrors of chemical and biological 

                warfare-this chamber is silent. On the eve of what could possibly 

                be a vicious terrorist attack in retaliation for our attack on 

                Iraq, it is business as usual in the United States Senate." </font>
