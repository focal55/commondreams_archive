- August 7 - Five hundred twenty-two Superfund cleanups across the country could be slowed down or stopped due to a lack of funding for the Superfund program, according to a new report by the U.S. Public Interest Research Group. Cleanup Slowdown: How Under-Funding the Superfund Program Harms Communities Across America shows that the dozens of Superfund sites did not receive funding last year, exposing communities to dangerous toxic waste for even longer periods of time.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Twenty-five years after Love Canal, the toxic waste catastrophe that prompted passage of the Superfund law, the Bush administration is slowing down cleanups and keeping the public in the dark about which Superfund sites will receive cleanup funds this year, charged Lois Gibbs, Executive Director of the Center for Health, Environment and Justice. &quot;It is unclear when sites like Jennison-Wright in Illinois or Tar Creek in Oklahoma will finally get cleaned up.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In total, 522 Superfund toxic waste site cleanups across the country could be affected by a lack of funding for the Superfund program. The Bush administration's funding announcement last month showed that only 10 out of 20 or more new projects will receive funding this year. The administration gave no information about funding for the hundreds of sites around the country with ongoing cleanup work. The ten states with the most Superfund sites potentially affected by a lack of funding are New Jersey (78), New York (49), Pennsylvania (37), California (37), Texas (25), Florida (24), Illinois (17), Michigan (16), Massachusetts (15), and Washington (13).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Bush Administration and Congress have underfunded the nation's pre-eminent program for cleaning up the most dangerous toxic waste sites in the country for too long,&quot; said Julie Wolk, Environmental Health Advocate for the U.S. Public Interest Research Group. &quot;Millions of Americans remain at risk of chemical exposure and disease until we get these sites cleaned up,&quot; she continued.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Last year, the Bush Administration cleaned up only 42 Superfund toxic waste sites and expects to clean up approximately 40 sites this year. This is more than a 50% decrease from the late 1990's when EPA cleaned up an average of 87 sites per year. According to a congressionally requested study completed in 2001, the Bush administration has under-funded the Superfund program by between $1.2 and $1.8 billion from 2001-2004, leaving communities across America at risk of chemical exposure and the diseases caused by toxic chemicals.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Congress allowed Superfund's polluter pays fees to expire in 1995, giving polluters a 4 million dollar a day tax holiday and forcing regular taxpayers to foot more and more of the bill for toxic cleanups. As the trust fund dwindles to zero, regular taxpayers, who paid 18 percent of program costs in 1996, will likely pay at least 79 percent of program costs next year. By the following year, when the trust fund is nearly exhausted, taxpayers will foot virtually the entire bill. Former Presidents Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and Clinton all collected or supported reinstatement of the polluter pays fees, but the Bush administration has expressed its opposition to reinstating the fees.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Not only has the pace of cleanups slowed down dramatically in the past three years, but regular taxpayers are footing more and more of the bill for toxic cleanups,&quot; said Wolk. &quot;Instead of hiding information from the public, Congress and the Bush Administration should reinstate Superfund's polluter pays fees to protect public health and make polluters pay for cleanups,&quot; concluded Wolk.</font></p>
