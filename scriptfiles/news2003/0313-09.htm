                - March 13 - "President Bush's re-nomination of Priscilla Owen 

                to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals is a slap in the face to 

                the Senate Judiciary Committee, and demonstrates the President's 

                determination to pack the federal courts with conservative ideologues. 

                Owen's nomination was and still is a threat to the civil and constitutional 

                rights of women and working families. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Bush says 

                he wants judges who won't legislate from the bench, yet he nominated 

                and then re-nominated one of the most activist judges possible. 

                Priscilla Owen poses a serious threat to freedom of choice and 

                would likely vote to erect barriers between a woman and her constitutional 

                right to choose if confirmed to the Fifth Circuit. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Federal judges 

                have lifetime appointments and will have long lasting consequences 

                for generations to come. We cannot risk allowing activist opponents 

                of reproductive rights to dominate in the federal judiciary. NARAL 

                Pro-Choice America urges Senators to stand firm and continue to 

                vote against nominees who will roll back constitutional rights."

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Background: 

                Priscilla Owen is a dedicated conservative judicial activist who 

                repeatedly rewrote a Texas statute from the bench in an attempt 

                to make it almost impossible for a young woman to get an abortion 

                without notifying potentially abusive parents. Justice Owen is 

                widely recognized as one of the most conservative justices on 

                an already conservative court. (NARAL Pro-Choice America Priscilla

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If Bush's nominees 

                are confirmed — ten of twelve regional federal circuits will have 

                majorities of judges nominated by anti-choice presidents and they 

                may have the opportunity to restrict Roe or set in motion its 

                reversal. (<a href="http://www.independentjudiciary.com/courts/" target="_new">independentjudiciary.com/courts</a>)
