- August 6 - Environmental issues will be the focus of a large portion of the August trips that President Bush takes from his Crawford, Texas ranch. To date, the President has not made protecting the environment a top priority, but his travel schedule for the next three weeks could reflect a growing political concern. As Republican pollster Frank Luntz noted earlier this year: &quot;The environment is probably the single issue on which Republicans in general -- and President Bush in particular -- are most vulnerable.&quot;</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the few times that President Bush has made an environmental address, his speech has been marked by lofty rhetoric and promises. Whether it's &quot;Healthy Forests,&quot; &quot;Clear Skies,&quot; or promising to protect Yellowstone National Park, the Administration has made sweeping promises. Now Americans are calling for the President's actions to match his words.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Unfortunately, the Bush Administration has a consistent record of eroding environmental safeguards, hindering public participation, and handing over large portions of our National Forests to private, commercial interests. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The President's Schedule: As of today, these are the scheduled environmental events.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">August 11: The President will visit Arizona and the area affected by the Aspen wildfire near Tucson. Later that day, the President also will visit Colorado. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

August 15: The President will visit the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area to speak about conservation issues. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

August 21: The President will travel to Portland, OR to discuss forest issues. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

August 22: President Bush will be in Seattle, WA to speak about preserving salmon and their habitat.</font></p>
