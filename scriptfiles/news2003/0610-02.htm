The details of the complicated operation were revealed by some of those involved at a press conference in Johannesburg, South Africa, today.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lawrence Anthony, the Zululand conservationist from Thula Thula Game Reserve who provided urgent relief to the Baghdad Zoo at the height of the recent Iraq war, is making a brief return visit to South Africa.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He has been appointed administrator of the zoo and used his visit home to brief the media on the status of the zoo and the work being carried out by the International Fund for Animal Welfare Emergency Relief Team and the American Zoo &amp; Aquarium Association (AZA), as well as to fund raise for much needed equipment and medical supplies for the zoo.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Anthony was asked to enter Baghdad by the U.S. Military and arrived in the city at the end of April.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;On my first day there I counted over 1,000 gunshots. It is only because the zoo falls into what is known as the &quot;green&quot; zone, an area that contains most of Saddam Hussein's city palaces and government departments, and which is under heavy U.S. security, that we were able to work in any sort of safety at the zoo,&quot; said Anthony.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Even so we had to scare off looters, some of whom were heavily armed and dangerous, and were willing to risk everything in their bid to strip the zoo of everything.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Anthony said that while the immediate crisis at the zoo has been somewhat relieved the situation remains extremely difficult and the work of Thula Thula, IFAW and AZA to put in place a medium to long-term plan to ensure the welfare of the zoo animals is vital.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">IFAW and AZA have been formally appointed by the U.S. Military, Lawrence Anthony, and the Iraqi directors of the zoo to put in place medium and long-term plans to stabilize the situation and to improve conditions.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The teams are working with the Iraqi zoo authorities and the U.S. military to ensure regular, secure food sources and water supplies for the animals and to install sound logistics at the zoo,&quot; said Anthony.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Other groups that have provided assistance with the emergency relief efforts at Baghdad Zoo include Care for the Wild International and WildAid.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He warned that the relief effort would not be finished any time soon. &quot;Unfortunately there can be no quick fixes for the Baghdad Zoo - it was originally designed by the Cairo Zoo based on 19th century concepts of animal husbandry, so enclosures are very small, with cement floors and heavy bars.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The zoo originally had in excess of 400 animals of all varieties - including exotic birds - but their numbers have been reduced to just 50 by looters who stole them either for food or to sell,&quot; said Anthony. The only animals that were not stolen were those that were dangerous.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;One of the most important parts of our relief work at the zoo will be to try and improve the living conditions for the animals by expanding their enclosures, providing some stimulation and generally work to boost their quality of life,&quot; he commented.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We're dealing with the whole issue holistically and staff welfare has been an absolute priority from day one.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On Sunday, the relief team, supported by U.S. military, was able to rescue a bear from another private zoo, known as Luna Park, in central Baghdad. The team obtained permission to close down the zoo because of the horrific conditions. The bear was the last remaining animal locked into a tiny cage.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;A crate was purpose built, the bear was darted and has been successfully relocated to a larger enclosure,&quot; said Sarah Scarth, IFAW's director of Emergency Relief. &quot;Yesterday the team helped the military to rescue a six-year-old female bear that was living in a market. She had a huge abscess on her rear and bleeding ulcers on the pads of her feet. The team used the same crate to move her to an enclosure at the zoo where she is being thoroughly investigated by the veterinary team and given food and water,&quot; said Scarth.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Earlier Anthony moved lions and cheetahs from a private zoo formerly owned by Saddam Hussein's eldest son Uday, to the central zoo.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The IFAW team of five veterinarians, logistics specialists and zoo management specialists, supported by AZA are now assessing what changes and improvements need to be made at the zoo in order to improve the quality of life of animals there. They are also assessing the health and other needs of each of the animals.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Animals at the Baghdad Zoo include 19 lion, tigers, brown bears, wolves, foxes, jackals, camels, ostrich, badgers and some primates. The animals are extremely traumatized as much of the main fighting during the recent strife took place in the immediate vicinity of the zoo.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NOTE: The groups that have provided assistance with the emergency relief efforts at Baghdad Zoo include: American Zoo &amp; Aquarium Association (AZA), the Born Free Foundation, Care for the Wild, Fondation Brigitte Bardot, International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW), Thula Thula Private Game Reserve, WildAid and WSPA.
