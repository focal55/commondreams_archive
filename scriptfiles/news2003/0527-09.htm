- May 27 - Today, the U.S. Supreme 

Court ruled that Nevada and other states can be sued for monetary 

damages when they violate workers' rights under the groundbreaking 

federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). The decision in this 

case, Nevada Department of Human Resources v. Hibbs, written by 

Chief Justice William Rehnquist, breaks with a recent run of cases 

in which the Court's conservative 5-4 majority -- usually including 

Rehnquist and Justice Sandra Day O'Connor -- overruled Congress in 

favor of a &quot;states' rights&quot; judicial philosophy. People For the 

American Way Foundation joined an amicus curiae brief urging the 

Court to rule in favor of the state employee, as it did. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Since 1995, a 5-4 majority has issued a series of states' 

rights rulings that have dramatically limited the ability of the 

federal government to protect citizens' civil rights. Today's 

decision in Nevada v. Hibbs was a welcome break from that march 

backward in American law,&quot; said People For the American Way 

Foundation President Ralph G. Neas. &quot;Not even Chief Justice 

Rehnquist has endorsed such a strict states' rights ideology that 

would effectively deprive millions of workers of the protections 

offered by the Family and Medical Leave Act.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Neas noted that Bush has promised to appoint justices in the 

mold of Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, underscoring how 

important the next one or two Supreme Court appointments will be to 

the rights and protections of all Americans. &quot;The Court's most 

conservative justices want to push states' rights even further, 

with dramatic consequences for Americans' rights and liberties.&quot; 

said Neas. &quot;This fundamental divide on basic constitutional issues 

demonstrates the importance of future Supreme Court nominees.&quot; </font></p>
