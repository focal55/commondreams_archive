- May 1 - </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Who:</b> 		National Lawyers Guild, Law Students and Legal Workers	

</font>

</p>

<p></p>

<b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When/Where:</font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  	Thursday, May 1, Noon- SF Federal Building

		<br>

Thursday, May 15, Noon- Oakland Federal Building



</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The National Lawyers Guild, together with concerned 

lawyers, law students and legal workers from throughout the Bay Area, will 

assemble at San Francisco's Federal Building (450 Golden Gate Avenue) on



May1st and Oakland Federal Building, May 15th, 2003, at noon, to protest



President Bush's unwarranted invasion and occupation of Iraq, and his 

administration*s unprecedented assault on the Bill of Rights and the 

protections afforded by our constitution and laws.

May 1, an international day of labor solidarity, is also celebrated as "Law 

Day" in the United States. As lawyers committed to the rule of law in a 

free and democratic society, we claim this occasion to demand an end to the 

administration's brutal policies of aggression and repression at home and 

abroad.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Contrary to the propaganda disseminated by the Bush administration and 

promoted by a compliant corporate media, the United States had no right to 

wage a preemptive war against Iraq, a nation that had not attacked the 

United States and had no capacity to do so. Under international law, a 

preemptive war under these circumstances is an unjustified war of 

aggression, specifically made illegal by the United Nations Charter. Having unlawfully invaded, at the cost of great suffering among the 

population, a poor country weakened by years of debilitating sanctions, the 

United States clearly has no legal right to occupy that country under 

military rule, while plundering the rich oil reserves that lie beneath its 

soil. We demand that the United States respect the rule of law, end the 

occupation and bring the troops home. Let the United Nations assume its 

historic peacekeeping role.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Here at home, the domestic policies of the Bush administrators have been



equally violent and repressive. In addition to relentless war against poor 

and working people, education, health care and our natural environment, our 

civil liberties- the very bedrock of our civilization- are under attack as 

seldom before in our nation's history. John Ashcroft's Justice Department 

has unleashed what amounts to a domestic war of aggression against the 

basic rights of the people, assaulting their privacy, snooping on their 

constitutionally protected associations and communications, and even 

monitoring the information they access on the internet and the books they 

withdraw from the library.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Constitutional protections against warrantless searches and electronic 

surveillance have been gutted and plans are afoot for a vast new storehouse 

of data filled with personal information on all of us, much of it 

constructed from rumor, gossip and lies, as well as from secret informers 

encouraged by the new security apparatus. People from Arab or predominately 

Muslim countries are being subjected to forced registration, unexplained



detentions, summary deportations and other terror tactics. Emboldened by a largely acquiescent and intimidated judiciary, the 

government has even spirited U.S. citizens away, to confine them in secret 

facilities without access to legal counsel or contact with their families. 

Based on the President's virtually unreviewable designation of these 

citizens as "enemy combatants," the government is holding them 

incommunicado, blatantly violating their constitutional right to counsel, 

while they are "interrogated" by police agents.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As always in repressive times, the State has taken special aim at the 

independence of the criminal defense bar, the right to counsel and the 

confidentiality of Attorney-Client communications. In New York the Justice 

Department has gone so far as to indict Lynne Stewart, a highly respected 

and ethical defense attorney who, under the established facts, did nothing 

more than vigorously and honestly represent her client, accused by the 

government of terrorist activities.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The limits to this encroaching totalitarian expansion of Executive power



have been hard to find. Cowed by often-spurious claims of "National 

Security," the courts have failed shamefully to curb these abuses and 

protect the Constitution. On this first day of May, this Law Day, we call 

on lawyers, law students, legal workers and all persons devoted to the rule 

of law, to demand that the government honor its asserted commitment to 

constitutional democracy under the law by taking these concrete actions:

</font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1. End the illegal occupations -- Abandon this ill-conceived new 

imperialism and leave the Middle East

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2. Bring the troops home now -- Support them by removing them from the 

great hazards of war and occupation

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3. Defend the Constitution

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">4. Repeal the USA Patriot Act

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">5. Defeat Patriot Act II

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">6. Protect the Right to Protest -- The First Amendment has stood the test 

of time and is essential to liberty.

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">7. Preserve the Attorney Client Privilege, and the sanctity of confidential 

communications -- Without these our legal system- arguably the best in the 

world- cannot survive.
