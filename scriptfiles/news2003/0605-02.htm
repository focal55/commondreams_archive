- June 5 - On Saturday, June 7, citizens in communities across the United States and Canada will hold protests at Ford dealerships to demand that the company act immediately to break America’s addiction to oil. Dealership demonstrations will occur in at least 20 cities as environmental and human rights activists pressure Ford to dramatically increase the fuel efficiency of its cars and trucks. Protesters are calling on Ford to increase the average fuel economy of its new cars to 50 mpg by 2010 and to completely eliminate tailpipe emissions by 2020. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Protests are planned for Chicago, New York, Houston, Ft. Lauderdale, Milwaukee, Charlotte, Santa Clara, CA, Los Angeles’ San Fernando Valley, and Washington, DC, among other locations. A full list of protests—complete with specific locations and local contacts—is available upon request.  

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The national day of action at Ford dealerships comes just a week after nearly 100 people protested outside a Ford dealership in San Francisco. The June 7 protests will occur one week before environmentalists and human rights activists are set to stage demonstrations at Ford’s annual shareholder meeting and Centennial Celebration in Dearborn, MI June 14-16.

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ford has tried to portray itself as an environmentally conscious company. Yet the company recently broke promises to produce more fuel efficient SUVs. And Ford’s vehicles account for nearly 10 percent of total U.S. oil consumption. The National Academy of Sciences concluded that current off-the-shelf technology could significantly boost fuel efficiency. Other studies have found that a jump to 40mpg is possible immediately, and that a jump to 60 mpg is achievable with full hybrid engines.

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“We’re fed up with Bill Ford’s broken promises,” said Rainforest Action Network Executive Director Michael Brune. “Time and again Ford says it will do the right thing and then, when the rubber hits the road, it doesn’t perform. In the 1970s and ‘80s we lost market share — and good union jobs — to Japanese automakers because Ford executives refused to innovate. Bill Ford’s broken promises are bad for American workers, bad for the environment, and bad for national security.”

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“Ford says it wants to focus on the future, but most of its vehicles get fewer miles per gallon than its Model-T did 80 years ago,” said Jason Mark, Clean Car Campaigner for Global Exchange. “Rather than looking to the future, Ford is stuck in the past. If America is to have good jobs, a cleaner planet and a safer country, Bill Ford Jr. needs to take bold measures to kick the oil habit.”
