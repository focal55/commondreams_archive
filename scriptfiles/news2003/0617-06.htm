- June 17 -  A group of third party candidates and their parties from across the political spectrum joined together today to file a legal complaint with the Federal Election Commission to block the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) from sponsoring, with corporate backing, the presidential debates in 2004.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The complaint also asks the FEC to require the CPD to return millions of dollars in corporate contributions made to the two major parties in the 2000 elections, arguing that the CPD is subject to the same ban on campaign contributions as other corporations.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The third party candidates allege that new evidence proves that the CPD is partisan, naming in particular a &quot;face-book&quot; of the major third party candidates and parties that was used by the CPD to exclude these candidates from even attending the presidential debate in Boston for the 2000 elections. This evidence, combined with testimony by top CPD officials in another lawsuit, is alleged to prove that the CPD made and acted on the decision to excluded all third party candidates from even attending the Boston and three other national debate events, thus evidencing that it is partisan. Partisan organizations do not qualify to sponsor such debates under federal elections law.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The FEC complaint was filed by the Natural Law Party and its 2000 candidate John Hagelin, the Green Party of the United States and its candidates Ralph Nader and Winona LaDuke, the Constitution Party and its candidate Howard Phillips, and 2000 reform party candidate Patrick Buchanan. All of these candidates were pictured in the CPD's face-book and targeted for exclusion from the debate audiences.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This is not the conduct of a nonpartisan organization,&quot; said John Hagelin. &quot;Not only was the CPD expressly created as a partisan organization, but its Board is made up of leading Democrats and Republicans, with no third party representation,&quot; he said, recounting allegations in the FEC complaint. &quot;The icing on the cake is that the CPD's leadership decided to exclude all third party candidates from even attending its debate, and documented the partisan act by creating a picture book of candidates and parties marked for exclusion from its event,&quot; he said.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The FEC complaint alleges that the CPD's partisan conduct violates election laws requiring that debate-staging organizations be non-partisan, and that CPD's use of corporate funding for these partisan activities violates a federal ban on corporate campaign contributions. The CPD provided the Democratic and Republican Parties and candidates for president and vice-president with valuable campaign and press opportunities to the exclusion of third parties and their candidates. The complaint alleges that the CPD, by its conduct, violated the federal prohibition on aiding or opposing any parties or candidates.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It's time we recognize the debates for what they are, a tremendous corporate gift to the Democratic and Republican candidates,&quot; said Nader. &quot;When the debates become partisan campaign events as they now have, federal laws against such unfair conduct must be enforced. That's what this complaint is intended to accomplish,&quot; he said.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jason Adkins, a Boston-based attorney representing the complainants, said, &quot;the CPD's actions are clear violations of federal election laws. The FEC must take swift action to protect the integrity of the debates before the 2004 elections get fully under way.&quot; Co-counsel Bonita Tenneriello of the National Voting Rights Institute, added, &quot;the CPD's conduct flouts laws that prevent corporations from using their treasuries to influence elections. The FEC must now investigate these complaints and should stop this back-door subversion of democracy.&quot; The Boston-based NVRI is a non-profit law office litigating nationally on campaign finance reform.</font></p>
