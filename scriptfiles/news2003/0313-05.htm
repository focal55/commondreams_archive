                - March 13 - Following is a statement of Defenders of Wildlife 

                President Rodger Schlickeisen: </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Early this 

                morning the House Budget Committee approved a Budget Resolution 

                that, while not explicitly assuming revenues from drilling in 

                the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, opens the door for the House 

                Resources Committee to do just that. It does this by including 

                a $1.1 billion budget reconciliation instruction to the Resources 

                Committee. There are options within the jurisdiction of the Resources 

                Committee for meeting this number through other alternatives, 

                those who care about our environment must hope that the Committee 

                chooses them. But the support for drilling evidenced by yesterday's 

                Resources Committee hearing on the subject - a hearing conducted 

                before the Budget Committee's action - leaves little doubt how 

                the Committee's leadership intends to respond to the reconciliation 

                instruction. In addition, the House leadership has repeatedly 

                pushed efforts to drill in the Arctic Refuge and it is apparent 

                that they are using the budget process in a perverse backdoor 

                effort to assure that Members of the House never have to cast 

                an up or down vote to destroy one of the nation's most important 

                natural treasures. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Last year a 

                bipartisan majority in the Senate strongly rejected Arctic drilling 

                in an up or down vote. This bipartisan consensus reflects the 

                will of the vast majority of the American people. The public clearly 

                recognizes that drilling in one of our nation's greatest wildlife 

                sanctuaries for six months' worth of oil that will not be available 

                for 10 years is simply not worth it. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Defenders is 

                pleased that the House Budget Resolution does not require the 

                Resources Committee to authorize drilling in the Arctic Refuge, 

                but we are dismayed that they have opened the door so widely as 

                to invite that outcome. The House Budget Resolution dramatically 

                increases the chances that the House will enact legislation to 

                allow drilling in the Arctic Refuge without Members of the House 

                ever having to cast an unpopular vote to do so. Drilling in the 

                Arctic Refuge has nothing to do with the federal budget and everything 

                to do with the influence of the oil lobby in Congress. It is time 

                for the American people and their representatives in the House 

                reject the House leadership's plan to create a procedural straightjacket 

                designed to thwart the will of the American people and facilitate 

                the destruction of one of our nation's greatest natural treasures.
