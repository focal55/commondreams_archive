- September 3 - Today, President Bush signed the US-Singapore Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act. Environmentalists called for rigorous new enforcement measures to stop Singapore's huge illegal timber trade from entering the US, as a result of the Agreement.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) warned that strong measures must be taken to prevent a tide of illegal timber imports from entering the US. Illegal timber shipments that originate in Southeast Asian nations are re-exported through Singapore. The lax transhipment laws in Singapore allow these highly illegal shipments to enter the world market and then flow to the US.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a new report, EIA documents how a threatened tree species called Ramin is illegally cut in Indonesia by violent timber barons, laundered by smugglers in Singapore and sold on the US market as pool cues and picture frames.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">US customs authorities at the Department of Agriculture have made more seizures of illegal Ramin shipments in the last year than any other product. EIA has documented that over a period of ten months from 2001 to 2002, 324 shipments of Ramin valued at $11,388,746 entered the US from Singapore alone. Eighty percent of Ramin shipments coming from Singapore were shown to be illegal.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Undercover investigations in Singapore this April by EIA and their Indonesian campaign partner Telapak caught the smugglers on tape describing how they 'launder' Indonesian Ramin in Singapore into the US market. One timber smuggler boasted on hidden camera that, &quot;this smuggling (is) better than drug smuggling.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As part of the FTA, the US and Singapore have signed a Memorandum of Intent on environmental concerns, which currently includes no concrete actions. An 'action plan' has yet to be developed in 'biennial' meetings.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The illegal timber trade from Singapore could skyrocket unless a major crackdown is launched under the terms of a side agreement agreed by the US with Singapore in June.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Alexander von Bismarck, senior investigator with EIA, said, &quot;The Administration must ensure that the 'action plan' for the Memorandum of Intent sets up a bilateral enforcement team with dedicated personnel and funding from both countries to stop illegal timber shipments from moving through Singapore into the US.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Editor's Notes</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- The Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) is a non-profit environmental group based in Washington, DC and London, UK, that investigates environmental crime around the world and proposes practical measures to uphold national and international environmental laws. More information can be found at <a href="http://www.eia-international.org" target="_new">http://www.eia-international.org</a>.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- In 2001, EIA was awarded the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) prestigious award to join its Global 500 Roll of Honor for outstanding achievements in the protection of the environment.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Telapak is one of Indonesia's leading environmental groups. EIA and Telapak work closely to campaign against widespread illegal logging which is devastating Indonesia's forests and biodiversity. EIA and Telapak have been campaigning to stop the illegal logging of Tanjung Puting National Park, Central Kalimantan, since August 1999. More information can be found at <a href="http://www.telapak.org" target="_new">http://www.telapak.org</a>.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- The US-Singapore Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act was passed by Congress at the end of the summer session. It puts the US-Singapore Free Trade Agreement into effect by adjusting US trade policy to fit the new and reduced trade barriers with Singapore.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- EIA's newest report, &quot;Singapore's Illegal Timber Trade and the US-Singapore Free Trade Agreement,&quot; is also available online at <a href="http://www.eia-international.org" target="_new">http://www.eia-international.org</a>.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- The US has led international efforts to promote meaningful measures to eliminate illegal logging by endorsing regional Forest Law Enforcement and Governance initiatives in Asia and Africa.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- President Bush directed Secretary of State Colin Powell to instigate the &quot;President's Initiative Against Illegal Logging&quot; in July 2003.</font></p>
