- July 23 - Book Soup,&quot;Bookseller to the great and infamous,&quot; in Hollywood,California, has become the latest store to carry the controversial Operation Hidden Agenda playing cards. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During the first week of sales of the cards, only Bookshop Santa Cruz and www.operationhiddenagenda.com were carrying the cards.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;I was overwhelmed by the response to the cards, which aim to present an alternative point of view to the &quot;Iraq's Most Wanted&quot; playing cards,&#148; says Kathy Eder, a social justice teacher in San Jose, Ca.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Between the card's <a href="http://www.operationhiddenagenda.com" target="_new">website</a> and the various stores listed at the site, over 7,500 decks of he Operation Hidden Agenda have sold since June 23rd.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Kathy Eder received a small shipment of cards on June 19th. On June 23rd, after receiving the bulk of the first 3000 cards, which were funded on her credit card, Kathy Eder called Liberty Playing Cards to order another 5000 decks.  Just last week, Eder ordered another 10,000. The presses at Liberty have slowed down since printing over 400,000 &quot;Iraq's Most Wanted&quot; Cards, but Eder hopes that the presses will be working at full speed once again. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We were selling as fast as we could at and in stores in Northern California, so we&#146;re very happy to welcome Book Soup in Southern California. Being raised a Catholic and especially while attending Presentation High School in San Jose and Santa Clara University, I was taught that it is our responsibility to be a &#147;voice to the voiceless.&#148; With this deck, I hope to be a voice for the Iraqi civilians who continue to suffer from this war, veterans from Desert Storm who are dealing with Gulf War syndrome, peace-makers around the world, and, now, I am trying to speak up on behalf of our Hollywood celebrities who have used their voices to oppose the war. It&#146;s wrong that many of their voices have been silenced, and Santa Clara University taught me about Catholic Social Teaching, which calls for us to be willing to speak up for all those who are oppressed in any way. I'm hoping that the card's presence at Book Soup will somehow let peace-makers in the entertainment business know that they are appreciated and heard.&#147; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Eder says that the playing cards, which contain well-known American leaders and symbols, are being used to promote truth and justice.  And she is not leaving the justice to chance; 50 % of the profits are being donated to US Veterans who are dealing with Desert Storm Syndrome from the first Gulf War as well as peace-making and relationship-building missions to Iraq. The five organizations that are receiving funds can be researched at www.operationhiddenagenda.com. So far, $4722.55 of the profits have made their way to the 5 organizations listed at the www.operationhiddenagenda.com. And more money is on the way.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When asked if the cards are a &quot;hit&quot; list like their &quot;Iraqi Most Wanted&quot; counterparts, Eder replies, &quot;Operation: Hidden Agenda is not a hit list.  I&#146;m hoping that the cards will be used to gather people to discuss the ideas of journalists and words of our leaders that are presented in the various articles referenced on the cards. People want to know what is true. It's time to stop looking the other way.  We must be willing to examine U. S. Policy and its repercussions in our global community.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;I decided to seek out the truth of what was happening in Iraq, and this deck is the result of what I have found.  The cards are intended to raise questions that need to be asked.  I have included many quotations that express the intentions of our leaders as well as the observations of journalists.&quot; </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Operation: Hidden Agenda has 52 cards representing 52 individuals or institutions that need to be examined in order to understand the precursors to and after-effects of the current military action in Iraq. Additionally, there are 2 jokers with quotations from peacemakers who offer what Eder suggests what might be &quot;Operation: True Agenda.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

The cards contain images as well as quotations from articles that attempt to inform people about the possible hidden agendas of various US leaders, organizations, and corporations.  </font></p>
