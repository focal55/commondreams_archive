    <FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Roger Normand is the Director of the <A HREF="http://www.cesr.org" TARGET="_new">Center for Economic and Social Rights</A> in New York. He is a member of the editorial committee of Middle East Report. Commenting on the Geneva Accord, Normand said today: &quot;Efforts to bring about a negotiated settlement to this conflict should be welcomed, but to succeed on the ground, they need to be grounded in full respect for the human rights of all Palestinians and Israelis. The Geneva Accord does not recognize fundamental aspects of human rights law, particularly refugee rights, which affect a majority of the Palestinian population worldwide. This is a central reason why previous peace efforts have failed.&quot;</FONT><br>

    <li>    <FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">JOEL BEININ</FONT><br>
    <FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Joel Beinin teaches Middle East history at Stanford University. He is a member of the editorial committee of Middle East Report. In 2002, he served as president of the Middle East Studies Association of North America. His research and writing focuses on the history of the modern Middle East, especially Egypt, Israel, Palestine and the Arab-Israeli conflict. His most recent book is &quot;Workers and Peasants in the Modern Middle East&quot; (Cambridge University Press 2001). Beinin said today: &quot;The strongest point about the Geneva Accord is its demonstration that negotiations between the two parties are possible. However, the Accord does not fully address the needs of the Palestinian refugees, and the territorial solution envisioned assumes that Jewish settlements in the Jerusalem area are sacrosanct. Moreover, the Accord lacks a solid political basis. Many people suspect it is a vehicle for Yossi Beilin's attempt to create and lead a new political party. The drafters of the Accord consider that it is 'not a marriage agreement, but rather a writ of divorce' -- meaning separation between Israelis and Palestinians. Separation is unrealistic, given the physical circumstances on the ground, and morally impoverished as a vision for the future.<br>

    <FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Joshua Ruebner is the Grassroots Advocacy Coordinator with the <A HREF="http://www.endtheoccupation.org" TARGET="_new">US Campaign to End the Israeli Occupation</A> and is a former analyst in Middle East affairs with the Congressional Research Service. Commenting on the Geneva Accord, Ruebner said today: &quot;The Geneva Accord includes a number of improvements from previous rounds of negotiations. For example, it includes a 1:1 territorial swap, as opposed to that proposed at Camp David and Taba, which was skewed toward Israel. Also, the Accord makes clear that Palestinians will have sovereignty over the Dome of the Rock and al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem. On the negative side, however, it appears that all East Jerusalem settlements will be annexed to Israel, which raises questions about the economic and territorial viability of East Jerusalem and its links to other areas of the West Bank. Also, there's been actual backtracking on the issue of refugees: at Taba, progress was made on Israel's recognition of the Palestinian right of return and the negotiations focused primarily on the actual numbers of refugees who would return. In the Geneva Accord, Israel does not recognize this right. The refugee issue is left solely to Israel's discretion.&quot;</FONT></li>
