- December 9 - Amnesty International's New York Women's Human Rights Action Team is holding a candlelight vigil on International Human Rights Day, at Mexico's Mission to the United Nations to demand that President Vincente Fox's government take immediate action to stop the hundreds of horrific murders of Mexican women and bring the perpetrators to justice.   </FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Over 370 women have been abducted and murdered in Ciudad Ju&aacute;rez, Mexico, over the last decade.  Many of these girls and women were viciously raped, tortured and mutilated.  A growing worldwide movement is calling on the Mexican Government to stop stalling and act to end the murders, find and convict the guilty, and protect Mexican women's rights defenders from vigilante violence.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">On the evening December 10th, which is International Human Rights Day, from 5 to 7 pm, concerned activists will gather outside the Mexican Mission to the UN to mourn, protest and distribute "Missing" posters with photos of the women who have disappeared in Ciudad Ju&aacute;rez.  </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Speakers will include sisters Elvira &amp; Hortencia Colorado from the American Indian Community Center, New York City Councilmember Margarita Lopez (to be confirmed) and Lissette Leonardo of Amnesty's NYC Women's Human Rights Action Team.  The names of murdered and missing women will be read.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">This event will close "16 Days for the Activism Against Gender Violence," an annual campaign that this year has been dedicated to ending the Ciudad Juarez atrocities.  During the 16 Days, the Amnesty NYC Women's Human Rights Action Team has posted thousands of "Missing" flyers with the images of dead and disappeared women, and picketed the Mexican Consulate in New York, demanding justice.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">There will also be a women's demonstration calling for justice in Chihuahua on December 10th, at 12 noon, at the offices of  the Procuradur&iacute;a General de la Republica of that city.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WHO:    Amnesty International NYC Women's Human Rights Action Team, allied organizations, and concerned women and human rights activists</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WHAT:    Candlelight vigil, with speakers, readings of the names of murdered women, and powerful posters of abducted women</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WHEN:    Wednesday, December 10th, 5pm to 7pm                        </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WHERE:    Mexico's Mission to the United Nations, 2 UN Plaza <BR>(East 44th Street between First and Second Avenues) New York City, NY </FONT></P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p></FONT><!-- #EndEditable --></td></tr>
