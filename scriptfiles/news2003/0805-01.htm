</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Stop the War Profiteers Campaign, initiated by the North Carolina-based <a href="http://www.southernstudies.org%20" target="_new">Institute for Southern Studies</a>, has been endorsed by several leading veteran, faith, labor, peace and other organizations, as well as prominent scholars and activists across the country.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;A handful of Bush-connected corporations are poised to make billions in profits while U.S. troops are killed almost daily, and Iraq plunges deeper into a colonial nightmare,&#148; said Dr. Rania Masri, a campaign coordinator and program director at the Institute.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Halliburton, Bechtel, MCI and other war profiteers are part of a larger invasion by outside corporate interests hoping to control the wealth and resources of Iraq &#150; wealth and resources that belong to the Iraqi people,&#148; Masri added.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Veterans for Peace, New York Labor Against the War, Global Exchange, United for Peace and Justice, Public Citizen&#146;s Critical Mass Energy and Environment Program, and other groups have signed on to the campaign&#146;s founding statement, as well as well-known activist authors Noam Chomsky, Jim Hightower, and Howard Zinn.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The campaign calls on elected leaders to take several steps to stop war profiteering at taxpayer expense and to end the &#147;corporate looting&#148; of Iraq, including:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Holding congressional hearings to investigate war profiteering and the secretive, closed-bid &#147;reconstruction&#148; contracts in Iraq given to a handful of corporations close to the Bush administration. The hearings would be modeled on those held in the 1930s by Sen. Gerald Nye to investigate the role of the &#147;munitions industry&#148; in warping foreign policy. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Reigning in war profiteering by military contractors &#150; such as the $400 million in taxpayer-funded profits promised in Halliburton&#146;s biggest contract &#150; through an &#147;Excess Profits Tax,&#148; similar to those during the Civil War, both World Wars, and the Korean War </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Halting the U.S.-led drive to hand over Iraq&#146;s industries, services and resources to powerful multinational corporations &#150; such as efforts by occupying forces to privatize public services and strip down rules on foreign investment, before Iraq&#146;s indigenous government is allowed to take part in decision-making. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The campaign opens a new front of opposition to the Bush Administration&#146;s war in Iraq, adding to charges at home of manipulation of intelligence to justify the war, and fierce resistance in Iraq to the U.S.-led occupation and delay of self-rule.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The U.S. is rushing to open Iraq to a flood of outside corporate interests, before the country&#146;s own government can take power,&#148; said Chris Kromm, director of the non-profit Institute. &#147;If the Iraq war was really about democracy, why won&#146;t they wait and let the Iraqi people decide what to do with their economy?&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Campaign leaders point to a strong historical precedent for Congress to take action against corporate interests seeking to profit off the suffering of war. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Tara Purohit, an Institute associate working on the campaign, noted that during World War II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt said &#147;I don&#146;t want to see a single war millionaire created in the United States as a result of this disaster,&#148; and then-Senator Harry Truman denounced war profiteering as &#147;treason.&#148; Earlier in the century, Sen. Robert LaFollette called war profiteers &#147;enemies of democracy in the homeland.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Our country has a proud history of leaders who have stood up to the war profiteers,&#148; said Purohit. &#147;Now it&#146;s time for today&#146;s leaders to stand up to the new merchants of misery and corporate war looters.&#148;</font></p>
