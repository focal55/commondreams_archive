<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - April 25 - U.S. claims that cluster munitions have not caused significant damage to civilians in Iraq are highly misleading since the Pentagon is evidently citing only figures on air-dropped cluster bombs, Human Rights Watch said today.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The U.S. Army has used ground-based Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) and other artillery-launched cluster munitions in populated areas of Baghdad and other Iraqi cities, Human Rights Watch said.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Staff Gen. Richard B.

Myers told a press conference today in Washington that coalition forces dropped &quot;nearly 1,500 cluster bombs of varying types&quot; during the war in Iraq, and that only 26 of those fell within 1,500 feet of civilian neighborhoods, causing only &quot;one recorded case of collateral damage.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But Myers did not mention surface-launched cluster

munitions, which are believed to have caused many more

civilian casualties.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;To imply that cluster munitions caused virtually no harm to Iraqi civilians is highly disingenuous,&quot; said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch. &quot;Instead of whitewashing the facts, the Pentagon needs to come clean about the Army's use of cluster munitions, which has been much more fatal to civilians.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Numerous media reports have provided eyewitness accounts of cluster munitions use against populated areas in the southern part of Baghdad. Newsday reported on April 15 that two children were killed, and one seriously injured, when a cluster munition they were playing with exploded.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to media reports, cluster munitions have also

caused injuries to U.S. troops. The Associated Press

reported on April 23 that a U.S. army sergeant was killed in

a cluster bomb explosion, and on April 19 that several U.S. service members were injured when a child handed an M-42 submunition to them and it blew up.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the press conference, Gen. Myers also described cluster munitions as &quot;precision guided.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In fact, the wide dispersal pattern of cluster munitions

makes them difficult to target accurately. Moreover, because

of their high failure rate, cluster munitions leave large numbers of hazardous, explosive duds that may cause injury or death to civilians long after the war is over. &quot;Cluster munitions are not precision weapons,&quot; said Roth. &quot;They are, in fact, indiscriminate weapons - which is why the U.S. military should never use them near populated areas.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Clearing populated areas of unexploded cluster munitions

will require full disclosure of when and where the weapons

were used. Human Rights Watch urged the U.S. military to provide information on surface-launched cluster munitions to assist explosive ordnance disposal teams.</font></p>
