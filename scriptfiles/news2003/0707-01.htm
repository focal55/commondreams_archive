-  

July 7 - Global Service Corps is launching a six-month fellowship program in January 2004. To qualify, participants must have an advanced degree in international health or development, and experience in Africa or other developing country. The fellowship consists of HIV/AIDS prevention and sustainable agriculture training followed by placement with local NGOs. Fellows will assist local staff with the development of community training and education programs. Accommodations and project support will be provided by the local NGO. Fellows are responsible for the costs of training and airfare.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Program Background: Global Service Corps has been working to address the ravages of AIDS and the plight of those infected in the areas hardest hit (i.e., Sub-Saharan Africa) for over nine years. During the past nine years, GSC has worked in three different regions of Kenya, and in 2001 moved to the Arusha area of Tanzania. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">GSC has been addressing the AIDS epidemic by providing international volunteers for prevention education campaigns covering HIV transmission, behavior and attitude issues as well as assistance for people living with AIDS. More recently, GSC&#146;s extensive experience in sustainable agriculture has been incorporated to add skills and practical information in food production, nutrition and income generation. These combined campaigns target farmers, local leaders, schoolteachers and students as well as local health workers. GSC also contributes to the future of international development by developing capacity both locally and internationally. Locally, it works in close partnership with established NGOs to draw on and further develop local capacity as its modis operandi. Globally, GSC uses international volunteers to induct and train new generations of international aid workers at a grassroots level. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">GSC has long partnered with local NGOs at its project sites. A primary goal of GSC is to increase capacity among local populations and agencies. Recently, GSC partnered with a well established and agriculturally based NGO in Tanzania that targets the rural disadvantaged. Recognizing the devastating impact of HIV/AIDS on rural populations, this NGO has prioritized collaborating with agencies experienced in the area of HIV/AIDS prevention and the alleviation of suffering among AIDS victims. GSC&#146;s sustainable (bio-intensive) agriculture training program focuses on organic food production to supplement nutrition and income generation, both of which are critical areas of need. Since GSC has much experience providing training in sustainable agriculture to rural populations, the two organizations found common ground for working together. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This collaborative venture allowed the two organizations to reach ever more remote areas and hence, populations most in need of these services. For example, joint Train the Trainer (TOT) seminars conducted in Arusha in 2002 provided training in both HIV/AIDS prevention and sustainable agriculture/nutrition to 244 of the local NGO&#146;s staff and its partners from all over rural Tanzania. As a result of the seminars, participants showed a remarkable change in attitude about HIV/AIDS - over 83%. The evaluation showed the seminars helped staff &#147;understand the problem [of HIV] more deeply&#133; as[I] didn&#146;t have adequate information on prevention [before].&#148; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There has already been great success in the number of seminar-trained staff. To date, over 15,000 people have been trained. These seminars targeted village farmers (over 12,000). They also targeted HIV&#146;s most vulnerable populations: students, women, widows and people living with AIDS.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Seminars are a key component of AIDS education. As the survey demonstrated, over 99% of field staff said they acquired knowledge about AIDS via seminars - more than through local media or handouts. Some participants have gone so far as to start their own local NGOs. One participant founded the Huruma Orphans Trust Fund to provide resources to AIDS orphans. An evaluation of these seminars has shown not only an overwhelmingly positive response to the seminars, but the need and desire among local staff and partners for more extensive training. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To continue and expand this much-needed work with other partner organizations, GSC is launching the Seeds of Survival Fellowship Program. This fellowship program will provide qualified trainers in rural zones where partner organization staff is established. This Fellowship differs from other GSC volunteer programs in that it will provide more experienced and advanced-degree professionals to rural areas to conduct in-depth seminars for longer periods of time. The program will also expand the existing training curriculum to include new topics. Possible subjects include much-needed HIV screening (where possible), circumcision education and the legal rights of widows. The collective experience of GSC, partners and the Fellows coupled with the longer time availability of fellows will allow for greater community penetration and the development of an ongoing, sustainable program. The training of local counterparts to cultivate experienced and trained community experts to continue this work in the future also ensures both the project&#146;s long-term sustainability.</font></p>
