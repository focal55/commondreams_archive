- August 3 - Operation Hidden Agenda playing cards and their creator received some national attention on FOX News' O'Reilly Factor.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But the creator of the cards is unimpressed with the show, O'Reilly's fans, and the &quot;WMD approach to truth&quot; employed. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;I know that Fox TV's O'Reilly Factor is well-researched. The producers do their homework; they know that the Operation Hidden Agenda playing cards weren't of interest to my own students or students around the United States. Instead, I informed the producers that I have received thousands of emails from adults. The producers are also aware that there are soldiers from this war asking to sell the playing cards, mothers of current soldiers buying the cards and cards being shipped to military bases all over the world. But O&#146;Reilly chose to ignore the factual information present and go for information that matched his own agenda, so he focused on students learning about the playing cards.&quot; says Kathy Eder, who was the guest on O&#146;Reilly last week.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The producers were also informed that Eder is supporting the Desert Storm Soldiers as well as Iraqi peace-making missions with half of her profits, and that Eder considers it unpatriotic to stay uninformed about what is happening in Iraq, while innocent civilians and US soldiers die daily.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And yet, Fox TV's latest wonder child, O'Reilly, and his loyal fans needed to make up a dilemma, launch an attack on the chosen target and then fire away, hoping to take no prisoners. One loyal fan that launched her own private attack on Eder even asked in her last email, &quot;Has your school fired you yet?&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;I have been told I love Sadaam and his actions. I have been told I hate President Bush. I have been told that I hate soldiers.&#148; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;All of these accusations are untrue. I&#146;ve never met one person who says that Sadaam&#146;s actions are good and true and loving. I pray for President Bush and our leadership. I tell everyone I can that we should all continue praying for US soldiers who are doing what our taxes pay them to do. But these truths are ignored.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It's bizarre. Bill O'Reilly and his fans talk about things that are factually untrue, aren't really present, and then they attack based on the truth they've fabricated and the facts they've manipulated. They say, &#145;Imitation is the best highest form of flattery.&#146; Well, FOX TV's O'Reilly and his fans have imitated the United States' attack on Iraq. FOX TV&#146;S O&#146;Reilly Factor makes it clearer to me that decks like the Operation Hidden Agenda playing cards are even more valuable than I thought they were.&quot; says Eder, the creator of the cards.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

<a href="http://www.operationhiddenagenda.com" target="_new">Operation: Hidden Agenda playing cards</a>, which can be found at www.operationhiddenagenda.com, contain 52 cards representing 52 individuals or institutions that need to be examined in order to understand the precursors to and after-effects of the current military action in Iraq. Additionally, there are 2 jokers with quotations from peacemakers who offer what Eder suggests what might be &quot;Operation: True Agenda.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The cards contain images as well as quotations from articles that attempt to inform people about the possible hidden agendas of various US leaders, organizations, and corporations. </font> </p>
