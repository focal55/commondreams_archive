                - April 21 - A controversial presidential nominee to the board 

                of a government-funded think tank today refused to condemn the 

                internment of Japanese-Americans and reaffirmed his call for the 

                destruction of Palestinian villages. </font> 

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During an 

                  interview broadcast on the national &quot;Democracy Now&quot; 

                  radio program, pro-Israel commentator Daniel Pipes outlined 

                  why he advocates the profiling by law enforcement and security 

                  personnel of Muslims and Arab-Americans. When program host Amy 

                  Goodman asked whether Pipes' support for profiling extended 

                  to the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II, 

                  he said: &quot;It's not a subject I know enough about to talk 

                  about.&quot; </font></p>

                  The interview is in the final 20 minutes of the one-hour program.

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">President 

                  Bush recently nominated Pipes, considered by many Muslims to 

                  be the nation's leading Islamophobe, to the board of the taxpayer-funded 

                  United States Institute of Peace (USIP). His nomination must 

                  be confirmed by the Senate. </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In that 

                  same radio interview, Pipes also said razing Palestinian villages 

                  from which anti-Israel attacks are launched is acceptable because 

                  societies under attack may take &quot;preventive steps.&quot; 

                  (In a July 18, 2001, article in Canada's National Post newspaper, 

                  Pipes said Israel needs to take more active steps to protect 

                  its citizens, including razing &quot;villages from which attacks 

                  are launched.&quot;) </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Over the 

                  weekend, both the Washington Post and the Dallas Morning News 

                  published editorials critical of the president's decision to 

                  nominate Pipes to the USIP board. The Post said Congress &quot;should 

                  have the good sense to turn (the nomination) down,&quot; and 

                  the Dallas Morning News called Pipes a &quot;bad choice.&quot; 

                  In the Jewish Forward, Judith Kipper, a senior fellow at the 

                  Center for Strategic and International Studies, said Pipes &quot;has 

                  very extreme views.&quot; </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A number 

                  of Muslim and Arab-American-groups have also come out against 

                  Pipes' nomination saying he has a long history of advocating 

                  the political marginalization of America's Islamic community. 

                  The groups point to an October 21, 2001, speech to the American 

                  Jewish Congress, in which Pipes warned of the &quot;true dangers&quot; 

                  posed by &quot;the presence, and increased stature, and affluence, 

                  and enfranchisement of American Muslims.&quot; </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It 

                  is outrageous that someone with undergraduate and doctoral degrees 

                  from Harvard University, both in history, would fail to condemn 

                  the unjust internment of Japanese-Americans by disingenuously 

                  claiming he is ill-informed. Mr. Pipes obviously knows that 

                  he cannot advocate profiling Muslims and Arabs on one hand, 

                  and then reject the earlier profiling of Japanese-Americans. 

                  This position alone makes Pipes unfit to join the USIP board,&quot; 

                  said Nihad Awad, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic 

                  Relations (CAIR), the group that first opposed Pipes' nomination. 

                  </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Awad added 

                  that Pipes has called for increased surveillance of ordinary 

                  American Muslims, claims 10 to 15 percent of Muslims are &quot;potential 

                  killers,&quot; has decried any positive portrayal of Islamic 

                  history and beliefs in public schools, and termed the PBS documentary 

                  &quot;Muhammad: Legacy of a Prophet&quot; an &quot;outrage.&quot; 

                  Last year, Pipes faced a storm of criticism when he launched 

                  Campus Watch, a web site that included &quot;dossiers&quot; 

                  on professors and academic institutions thought to be too critical 

                  of Israel or too sympathetic to Islam and Muslims. </font></p>
