Bingo reveals the powerful companies acting behind the scenes of the World 

Trade Organization (WTO). This new game, a deck of 54 cards with characters 

ranging from El Vaquero (the cowboy) representing Philip Morris to La 

Jeringa (the Syringe) representing Eli Lilly, is a popular education tool 

for young and old alike about the corporations and their lobby groups who 

rig the global trading system.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LoWTOteria (LOMCeria in Spanish) shows how these corporations are playing a 

game of chance with the lives of people all over the planet. Free trade is 

not free at all, but the management and manipulation of the global economy 

to serve the wealthy at the expense of the poor, says Pratap Chatterjee, 

program director of Corpwatch.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The bilingual game (Spanish and English), launched to coincide with the WTO 

meeting in Cancun, Mexico,from September 10-14, 2003. At this, the 5th 

ministerial, will work to lock in agreements on issues ranging from intellectual property rights, to agriculture, to new horizons such as 

government procurement potentially lucrative area for many multinationals, 

turning a blind eye to those directly impacted by trade policies.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LoWTOria features hand drawn cartoons, based on the popular childrens game, 

by Algerian-American artist Khalil Bendib, that portrays companies that sit 

on WTO lobbying committees. El Mundo (the World) is used to represent 

Bechtel, which uses a globe as its logo, while El Diablito (the Little 

Devil) has been transformed into a parody of Ronald McDonald.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The golden arches of McDonalds fast-food chainin almost every major city in 

the worldmake this company the poster child of globalization. In the United 

States they employ minimum wage workers and use prison labor to make their 

uniforms. The billions and billions of McDonalds hamburgers consumed by 

American kids have contributed to making them the worlds most obese 

children, while also fattening the companys profits, is the accompanying 

text to explain the card.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Along with the cards is a booklet with information about the company 

lobbying efforts. For example this guide explains that United States Vice 

President Dick Cheney used to run a Texas-based construction company called 

Halliburton, whose executives chaired the WTO Energy Services Coalition, 

pushing for the elimination of barriers to private energy services in their 

negotiations and a set of 10 playing boards featuring information on major 

industries, such as resource extraction, agribusiness and pharmaceuticals 

which have a lot to gain from the WTOs pro-corporate agreements.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The game is also played just like the original: each player gets a playing 

board with pictures of 16 cards arranged in a grid. The dealer who is 

running the game has a deck of 54 cards pulls cards from the deck and reads 

out information about the companies presented in the game. Each player 

tries to locate the picture on their board. The first to create the 

previously announced pattern shouts Lotera, Lotera!and wins.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The cards, the playing boards and the information 

from the booklet are available online at <a href="http://www.wtoloteria.com" target="_new">this Website</a>.</font></p>
