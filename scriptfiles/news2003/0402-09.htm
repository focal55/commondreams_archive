                - April 2 - Contrary to the alarmist rhetoric spread by the state's 

                medical and business lobbies, the temporary malpractice insurance 

                spikes experienced by doctors in many states are not on the horizon 

                in Rhode Island, according to a report issued today by Public 

                Citizen, a national consumer advocacy organization. The report 

                concludes that instead, the most significant, long-term medical 

                malpractice "crisis" in Rhode Island is the unreliable quality 

                of care being delivered to state residents by a relatively small 

                proportion of the state's doctors. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The annual 

                amount of medical malpractice insurance premiums that Rhode Island 

                doctors pay has decreased since 1992 when inflation is taken into 

                account, the study found. Also, the amount of malpractice payouts 

                Rhode Island insurers make annually to patients who have suffered 

                from doctor errors has decreased since 1992 when inflation is 

                considered. Moreover, there has been a significant decrease in 

                the number of malpractice payouts made in the state to patients, 

                while the number of physicians in Rhode Island increased by 11 

                percent from 2,623 in 1999 to 2,915 in 2002. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Public Citizen 

                released the report as the issue gains attention nationally and 

                in Rhode Island, where lawmakers are considering legislation that 

                would make it harder for injured patients to seek compensation 

                for their injuries. Nationally, the U.S. Senate may soon consider 

                a measure that would cap awards for pain and suffering damages 

                in medical malpractice cases at $250,000. U.S. Sens. Jack Reed 

                (D) and Lincoln Chafee (R), both representing Rhode Island, will 

                play a key role in determining the fate of that legislation in 

                Congress. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Capping damages 

                will only hurt those who have been most severely injured by health 

                provider negligence," said Public Citizen President Joan Claybrook. 

                "Congress and state legislatures should enact measures to stop 

                insurance company price spikes, not penalize patients who have 

                already suffered from negligence." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Repeat offender 

                doctors are responsible for more than half of malpractice costs 

                in Rhode Island, the study found. Between September 1990 and September 

                2002, 4.8 percent of Rhode Island's doctors were responsible for 

                52.7 percent of all malpractice payments to patients, according 

                to information obtained from the federal government's National 

                Practitioner Data Bank. This small number of doctors made two 

                or more malpractice payments worth a total of $104.7 million. 

                Further, just 1.6 percent of the doctors made three or more payments 

                to patients, representing 26 percent of all payments. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Less than one-third 

                of doctors who made four or more malpractice payments to patients 

                have been disciplined by the state medical board. Rhode Island 

                is one of the nation's less stringent states in disciplining doctors, 

                ranking 35th among all states and the District of Columbia in 

                2002, according to Public Citizen's annual ranking of state medical 

                boards. The state has yet to fully implement a 1997 law mandating 

                public disclosure of profiles of individual physicians. Although 

                some profiles are available online, they omit two crucial categories: 

                malpractice information and criminal convictions. The system is 

                scheduled for an update this summer, but the profiles still will 

                not contain data on doctors' malpractice payouts. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to 

                Public Citizen's report, The Facts About Medical Malpractice in 

                Rhode Island (available at <a href="http://www.citizen.org/congress/civjus/medmal/articles.cfm?ID=9271" target="_new">http://www.citizen.org/congress/civjus/medmal/articles.cfm?ID=9271</a>):

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">- Medical errors 

                cause 164 to 365 preventable deaths in Rhode Island each year. 

                These errors cost residents, families and communities $63 million 

                to $108 million annually in lost wages, lost productivity and 

                increased health care costs. In contrast, medical malpractice 

                insurance costs Rhode Island's doctors less than $22 million annually.

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">- Rhode Island's 

                doctors paid $21.6 million in premiums for malpractice insurance 

                in 2001, compared to $19.5 million in 1996, an increase of 11 

                percent. Adjusting for medical inflation, which was 19.8 percent 

                during the same period, and the growing number of physicians in 

                the state, this represents a significant decline in actual dollars.

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">- According 

                to the National Practitioner Data Bank, the number of medical 

                malpractice payments to patients by Rhode Island doctors declined 

                21 percent, from 73 in 1997 to 58 in 2001. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">- Annual malpractice 

                payments to patients by Rhode Island insurers have decreased when 

                inflation is considered. The amount of malpractice payments made 

                to Rhode Island patients was $22.8 million in 2001, a $1.7 million 

                or 8 percent increase over $21.1 million in 1992, equaling 0.9 

                percent a year. However, during this same period, costs for medical 

                care increased 47 percent nationwide, an average of 5.2 percent 

                a year. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Long-term 

                solutions to reducing malpractice insurance costs lie in reducing 

                medical errors," said Frank Clemente, director of Public Citizen's 

                Congress Watch. "Data show that the legal system is not the problem. 

                There are too many medical errors and too much medical negligence, 

                a lot of which could be prevented with stronger disciplining of 

                the relatively few repeat offender doctors." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition 

                to effective doctor discipline, the study suggests that states 

                require hospitals and other health care providers to institute 

                meaningful risk prevention programs. Hospitals should implement 

                measures to curb errors, such as using computers to order and 

                track prescriptions (these can cut errors by 55 percent), requiring 

                proper hand-washing to reduce infections, addressing the nursing 

                shortage and reducing the long hours of medical residents. Also, 

                insurance risk should be spread, reducing the number of classifications 

                of doctor specialties. Risk pools for some are too small and thus 

                overly influenced by a few losses and the concentration in a few 

                specialties of doctors handling the highest risk patients.
