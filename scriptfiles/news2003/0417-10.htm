                - April 17 - Leaders of the Green Party of the United States urged 

                Americans who oppose the war on Iraq to begin planning for electoral 

                action and new steps to ensure global peace and democracy. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"With the imminent 

                fall of the Saddam regime, we need to turn our attentions towards 

                ensuring peace and democracy in Iraq and throughout the world," 

                said Badili Jones, Georgia Green and co-chair of the national 

                party. "For the Green Party, that means democratizing the U.S. 

                political system, electing Greens to public office, and replacing 

                our military economy with one based on peace, social justice, 

                and ecology." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Green Party 

                supports the International Criminal Court (ICC) with the power 

                to try Saddam Hussein (if captured instead of killed) for atrocities 

                against his own people -- and also the power to investigate the 

                Bush Administration for launching an illegal, unprovoked attack 

                on another nation on fabricated evidence of a threat. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"An effective 

                ICC would be able to scrutinize the Pentagon's use of cluster 

                bombs, depleted uranium, and other weapons that kill and maim 

                civilians and damage the health of U.S. veterans; and investigate 

                the slaughter of civilians and the apparent targeting of independent 

                media, such as al-Jazeera and Reuters," said Mark Dunlea, co-chair 

                of the Green Party of New York State. "Such a court must be fair 

                and impartial, whether it targets murderous dictators like Saddam 

                or acts done in the cause of global empire, as in the case of 

                President Bush." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greens acknowledge 

                that prosecuting the victors would be enormously difficult. "Saddam's 

                defeat won't mean the end of the Pentagon's war schemes," said 

                J. Roy Cannon, Peace Committee chair in the Green Party of Delaware. 

                "The White House intends to topple other governments, beginning 

                with Syria and Iran. In the 90s, the Project for a New American 

                Century drafted the Bush doctrine of preemptive invasion in the 

                cause of global empire. Its participants include Cheney, Rumsfeld, 

                Wolfowitz, and other Bush officials." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Their plan 

                is consistent with the treatment of Iraq as a feeding trough for 

                Halliburton, Bechtel, and other favored corporations, and the 

                postwar installment of American corporate honchos and generals, 

                murderous Iraqi military strongmen, and corrupt stooges like Ahmed 

                Chalabi in Baghdad," Cannon added. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greens assert 

                that it will require serious, sustained political organizing to 

                resist these plans and policies, but warn that the Democratic 

                Party has already capitulated. Most of the major Democratic presidential 

                hopefuls have supported the war; Sen. Bob Graham is urging Bush 

                to consider missile attacks on Syria. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Without the 

                Greens in 2004, the peace movement will find itself marooned with 

                Democrats who favor war and swim in corporate money," said Starlene 

                Rankin, Lavender Green Caucus delegate to the party's national 

                committee. "The Green Party will lead the opposition in this new 

                era of American empire and corporate dominance."
