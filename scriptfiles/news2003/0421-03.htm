                - April 21 - The U.S. Supreme Court Monday announced it will hear 

                a case involving Delma Banks Jr., who sits on Texas' death row 

                despite questions about prosecutorial misconduct, biased jury 

                selection and ineffective legal counsel. </font> 

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Banks was 

                  convicted and sentenced to death in connection with the murder 

                  of Richard Whitehead of Texarkana after prosecutors struck all 

                  black prospective jurors from the jury pool and withheld critical 

                  exculpatory evidence from the defense. </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NCADP Executive 

                  Director Steven W. Hawkins said Banks has never received an 

                  opportunity to present in court evidence that prosecutors failed 

                  to inform defense counsel that one of its key witnesses was 

                  a paid informant and that another key witness received a reduced 

                  sentence after testifying against Banks. </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Supreme 

                  Court Justice Henry Blackmun once wrote that the execution of 

                  a person who can show he is innocent comes perilously close 

                  to simple murder,&quot; Hawkins said. &quot;Delma has never 

                  had the opportunity to demonstrate that he was innocent, not 

                  for a lack of facts but rather for a lack of forum. Simply put, 

                  though there have been years of appeals and many courts that 

                  shuffled the paperwork, no one has ever granted this man the 

                  review that he deserves. </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Delma's 

                  trial was tainted by biased jury selection, prosecutorial misconduct, 

                  perjury and bad lawyering,&quot; Hawkins continued. &quot;So 

                  tainted was his trial that former FBI Director and U.S. District 

                  Judge William Sessions, a pro-death penalty Republican, said 

                  it has broad implications for the nation's criminal justice 

                  system because it directly 'implicates the integrity of the 

                  death penalty in this country.'&quot; </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hawkins 

                  said he hopes that the decision by the U.S. Supreme Court to 

                  grant cert in the case ultimately will mean that Banks' attorneys 

                  will be able to present evidence of prosecutorial misconduct 

                  before an evidentiary hearing. </font></p>
