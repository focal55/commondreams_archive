- July 23 - Pepco Energy Services, Inc., a subsidiary of Pepco Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: POM) and a leader in renewable electricity initiatives in the mid-Atlantic region, today announced the largest single retail sale of wind power in the region. Pepco Energy Services will supply an aggregation of New Jersey state agencies with &quot;Green-E&quot; certified wind-generated electricity from Community Energy, Inc. of Wayne, Pa.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pepco Energy Services, under a 33-month contract, will supply more than 24 megawatts of electricity, 12 megawatts of which will consist of NewWind Energy(tm) purchased from Community Energy and produced by wind farms located in the mid-Atlantic region. More than 90 percent of the wind power will come from Community Energy's new Bear Creek wind farm near Wilkes-Barre, Pa, less than 60 miles from northern New Jersey.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The renewable energy will supply 180 New Jersey accounts beginning this month. These include Rutgers University, New Jersey Highway Administration, New Jersey Transit and the New Jersey Turnpike Authority. The public agencies joined together for the purpose of creating one electricity contract to obtain the lowest cost Green-E certified electricity. In addition, the agencies wanted to meet the 10-percent environmentally friendly green power goal established by New Jersey Gov. James E. McGreevey.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pepco Energy Services' winning bid contains wind energy supplied by Community Energy, as part of a new long-term agreement between the two companies signed in April 2003. Community Energy provides wind-generated electricity within the PJM Interconnection power pool. Wind energy is emissions-free and helps offset greenhouse gas emissions produced from burning fossil fuels in electricity production.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Our partnership with Community Energy enables Pepco Energy Services to provide emissions-free wind power to our customers and furthers the development of additional wind energy facilities in PJM,&quot; said Dr. Ed Mayberry, President and Chief Executive Officer of Pepco Energy Services. &quot;We welcome this opportunity to do business with Community Energy and the State of New Jersey.&quot;</font></p>
