- October 21 - The following is a statement by NARAL Pro-Choice America President Kate Michelman on abortion legislation:</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Today, women's right to privacy is being sacrificed to politics by the United States government. The Senate took its final step toward substituting politicians' judgment for that of a woman, her family, and her doctor. President Bush has vowed to sign this deceptive legislation, which will make him the first President ever to outlaw safe medical procedures, and the first to sign an abortion ban since Roe vs. Wade. No one should be fooled as to the real intentions of this bill's sponsors: they want to take away entirely the right to personal privacy and a woman's right to choose.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Please see the following quote sheet &quot;Partial-Birth Abortions&quot;: Anti-Choice Leaders Reveal True Intentions.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>&quot;Partial-Birth Abortions&quot;: Anti-Choice Leaders Reveal True Intentions</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;(The) partial-birth abortion ban is a political scam but a public relations goldmine...This bill, if it becomes law, may not save one child's life...The major benefit of this bill is the debate that surrounds it.&quot;<br>
-- Randall Terry (Founder, Operation Rescue), News Release, September 15, 2003</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;(Gary Bauer) likes the approach of seeking a ban on all abortions in the ninth month of pregnancy, then the eighth, and so on. You'd probably get down to the fourth month before you had a close vote...(said Bauer). In the end though, Bauer favors a campaign to ban second and third-trimester abortions.&quot;<br>
-- Fred Barnes, &quot;Beyond Partial Birth Abortion,&quot; The Weekly Standard, July 6-13, 1998</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The partial-birth abortion strategy was designed to: a) emphasize the horror of partial-birth abortion to the general public by, b) introducing legislation to outlaw it, thus c) exposing pro-abortion legislators who would oppose the legislation for the brutes that they are, causing them to be unseated. This was a sure win (so we were told), and once partial-birth abortion was outlawed, then we could move on to outlawing other forms of abortion.&quot;<br>
-- Matt Trewhella (Director of Missionaries to the Preborn, Milwaukee), Life Advocate, January/February 1998</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;By going after partial-birth abortions, we're trying to show the extreme radical view of the pro-abortion lobby. But no, that procedure isn't what we care most about. Our goal is to stop the killing of unborn children at any stage of development. &quot;<br>
-- John Jakubczyk (General Counsel, Arizona Right to Life) The Arizona Republic, September 27, 1996</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;They (pro-choice groups) have always been able to demonize us with the hard cases -- the incest and rape cases. We've never been able to do that (until today)...It's a huge victory (the House override of Clinton's veto of H.R. 1833). It's the first time since Roe v. Wade that Congress is poised to outlaw an abortion procedure and the first time the pro-choice side has had to defend the indefensible... If Clinton is re-elected, you have to come up with similar bills that outlaw other procedures....&quot;<br>
-- Ralph Reed (then-Executive Director, Christian Coalition) The Dallas Morning News, September 20, 1996</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;'This week we will make history in the House of Representatives,' Rep. Chris Smith, R-NJ, vowed Tuesday...Now 'we will begin to focus on the methods (of abortion) and declare them to be illegal,' Smith said.&quot;<br>
-- Representative Chris Smith (R-N.J.) USA Today, November 1, 1995</font></p>
