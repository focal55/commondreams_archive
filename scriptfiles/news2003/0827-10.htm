- August 27 - &quot;The revelation that the White

House pressured the EPA into lying about the quality

of air near the 9/11 wreckage deserves the fury and condemnation of every New Yorker -- of every American,&quot; said Leslie Farney, candidate for Supervisor of the Town of Warwick, New York, just north of New York City. &quot;The Bush Administration endangered the lives of thousands of people in lower Manhattan, especially the firefighters, construction workers, and others who heroically combed through the wreckage trying to save lives and recover bodies. This news should cancel any remaining doubt about the

White House's criminal deception and recklessness.&quot;</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greens across the United States called for an

independent investigation and criminal indictments for

White House, National Security Council, and

Environmental Protection Agency officials who

conspired to deceive the people of New York about the

unhealthy state of the air near the World Trade Center

site in the months after the attacks of September 11,

2001. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The EPA has admitted that it gave the public false

information, concealing knowledge of deadly airborne contaminants, under pressure from the NSC.  Many people who worked or lived near the site have complained of health problems, especially respiratory difficulty.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Christine Todd Whitman, who served as EPA chief at the

time, assured New Yorkers that the air around the site

was not dangerous, knowing this to be inaccurate.  In

fact, the air was contaminated with asbestos, fine

particles, lead, PCBs, dioxin, fiberglass, and other

dangerous substances.  The EPA's misinformation saved

insurance firms such as Citigroup (which employed her

husband, John Whitman) hundreds of millions of dollars

from claims filed for respiratory illnesses caused by

the contaminated air.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;An honest government would have said, 'we don't know

what the risk is, but since we know there wereexposures to both particulates and mixed toxics, every

effort will be made to protect the health of the

emergency responders and residents of the affected neighborhoods,'&quot; noted Carol Miller, a Green who taught courses in occupational health at the University of New Mexico for several years.  &quot;They could have required self-contained ventilation apparatus, provided clothing on-site so toxics were not taken home to family washing machines, and testing of workers as they finished shifts.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It's no longer news that the Bush Administration has

deceived the American people over and over, especially

about the reasons to invade Iraq,&quot; said Paul Glover of

Ithaca, New York, who has announced his candidacy for

the national Green Party nomination for president.  &quot;A

few million Americans were vigilant enough to see

through the lies and protested the war, but most

citizens gave Bush the benefit of the doubt.  They

called it their patriotic duty to back the president

during the war.  But the lies are common knowledge

now.  Hundreds of American soldiers have been killed,

along with thousands of Iraqi civilians.  Greens and

other patriotic Americans have stood up and said

'Enough!'  Who will join us?  Where are the outraged

reporters and editors?  Where are the Democrats?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At its 2003 national meeting in Washington, D.C., the

Green Party of the United States called for the

impeachment of President Bush, citing the White

House's numerous violations of constitutional and

international laws and lies justifying the invasion: allegations that Saddam Hussein possessed ready-to-use weapons of mass destruction; that Saddam intended to use them and represented an imminent threat to the U.S.; that evidence existed proving a link between Saddam and al-Qaeda.</font></p>
