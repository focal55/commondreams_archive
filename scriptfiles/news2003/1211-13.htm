- December 11 - Following is a statement on global hunger by Joachim von Braun, director general, of the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI):</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;If current trends continue, world governments will be at least 35 years late in meeting their target of cutting hunger in half by 2015, as set in the United Nations' Millennium Development Goals. These findings appear in the article by IFPRI researchers Mark W. Rosegrant and Sarah A. Cline in this week's issue of Science. The authors emphasize how the impact of climate change and HIV/AIDS on developing countries, as well as water scarcity and declining investment in research and infrastructure, will hamper agricultural development over the next 50 years. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The authors project that the number of malnourished preschool children in sub-Saharan Africa will actually increase between now and 2015. Globally, if current policies and investments continue, the share of malnourished children is projected to fall from 31 percent to 14 percent, but it will take a half-century to accomplish. The world's hungry children cannot wait that long.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Poverty and malnutrition could be significantly reduced through better policies for safety nets and increased investment for:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">-- health, education, and nutrition;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">-- agricultural research;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">-- rural infrastructure; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">-- water resources</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Developing countries need to increase agricultural productivity, and boost income and reduce poverty in the rural areas where most of the poor live.
