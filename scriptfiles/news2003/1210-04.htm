<td valign="top" align="left" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">MANCHESTER, NH - December 10 - Granite Staters for Medical Marijuana (GSMM) announced today that it is giving the Democratic presidential candidates a final deadline. Any candidate who does not unequivocally pledge by January 1, 2004, to stop the Drug Enforcement Administration's (DEA's) raids on medical marijuana patients will receive a failing grade in GSMM's voter guide.</FONT><P>   <FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;We have been extremely patient with these candidates,&quot; said GSMM Campaign Coordinator Aaron Houston. &quot;We've talked to them, educated them, given them reams of information, and adjusted their grades upward when they took even small steps forward, but frankly, it's time to put up or shut up. It's time for them to say clearly whether they will end the Bush administration's war on the sick.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">   So far, five of the nine Democratic presidential candidates have said they would end the DEA's raids on seriously ill patients who use medical marijuana legally under state law: U.S. Sen. John Kerry (D-MA), retired Army Gen. Wesley Clark (D-AR), U.S. Rep. Dennis Kucinich (D-OH), former Ambassador Carol Moseley Braun (D-IL), and Rev. Al Sharpton (D-NY). While only five candidates have explicitly pledged to stop the raids, most of the others have made positive but vague statements about medical marijuana at some point along the campaign trail.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">   President George W. Bush currently has the only &quot;F&quot; in GSMM's voter guide. Ignoring the laws of eight states, his administration has conducted an all-out war on medical marijuana patients and their caregivers. His raids of medical marijuana providers have ensnared seriously ill people who are using marijuana legally to treat the symptoms of cancer, AIDS, multiple sclerosis, and other serious illnesses. Further, these raids have interrupted the flow of potentially lifesaving medicine to thousands of patients.</FONT></P><P>   <FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The Bush administration's heartless raids must stop,&quot; Houston said, noting that raids on medical marijuana dispensaries are as devastating as raids on individual patients. &quot;People battling horrible illnesses need a consistent supply of medicine, and they are left to suffer when the DEA raids providers who are complying with state laws. Candidates who won't explicitly say that they will end these cruel raids are effectively supporting the Bush policy, and as of January 1 their grades will reflect that.&quot;</FONT></P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p></font><!-- #EndEditable --></td></tr>
