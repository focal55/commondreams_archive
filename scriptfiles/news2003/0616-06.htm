<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">GENEVA - June 16 - Countries leading the fight to reverse the global tobacco epidemic gathered today to sign the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), the world&#146;s first public health treaty. Infact and other members of the Network for Accountability of Tobacco Transnationals (NATT) are applauding the commitment of the countries signing the historic treaty on the first day that it opens for signature. The World Health Organization-initiated treaty bans tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship with exceptions only for constitutional reasons, and protects public health policy from tobacco industry interference. The FCTC, which sets precedents for international regulation of other industries that threaten health, the environment and human rights, enters into force and becomes international law after 40 countries ratify it. Today&#146;s ceremony, where twenty-seven countries and the European Community signed the treaty, sets that process in motion.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Even as we celebrate this milestone, we are well aware that giant tobacco corporations are continuing their aggressive efforts to derail the swift implementation of this groundbreaking treaty. As the political battles over the FCTC now move to capitals across the globe, vigilance to Big Tobacco&#146;s dirty tricks becomes more important than ever,&#148; says Kathryn Mulvey, Executive Director of Infact, a US-based corporate accountability organization.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The FCTC is being hailed as a victory for people and public health over the profits of transnational corporations. Countries of Africa, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, the Pacific and Caribbean Islands united to protect the health of their people from the tobacco industry&#146;s deadly expansion. South Africa and Palau are among the countries that led the way toward a strong FCTC and were among the first to sign the treaty. Bangladesh, Botswana, Brazil, Burundi, the Czech Republic, Denmark, the European Community, Finland, France, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Iran, Italy, Kuwait, Luxembourg, Malta, the Marshall Islands, Mongolia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Paraguay, Spain, Sweden and the UK also signed the treaty at its opening. Norway has completed the steps necessary to make it the first country to ratify the FCTC.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The 16th June 2003 opens a new era in international tobacco control.   I am signing the FCTC on behalf of my government, with great hope in my heart, and in the presence of two young South African children. I have brought them to Geneva with me, as witnesses to our commitment, because we are officially celebrating Youth Day in South Africa today, and because it is their lives at stake in our efforts to control the tobacco epidemic in our own country and world-wide,&#148; says South African Health Minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang. Heal&#147;By signing the Convention, we are making a solemn pledge to the children of Africa, and beyond, that we truly value their lives, their health and their well-being.  And ultimately, we look forward to a tobacco-free world for them and for their children.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Throughout the FCTC negotiations, NATT members encouraged, prodded and pressured countries to stand firm in the face of Big Tobacco&#146;s enormous political and economic clout. With International Weeks of Resistance to Tobacco Transnationals, Marlboro Man Awards, and the release of a number of reports, NATT has played a key role in exposing and challenging the attempts of Philip Morris/Altria, BAT and Japan Tobacco International to derail the FCTC. In the push toward ratification, NATT will continue to watchdog the tobacco industry&#146;s interference in the process.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The unity of so many developing countries made the FCTC strong and meaningful, despite consistent obstructionism from a few wealthy countries throughout the negotiations. NATT members look forward to supporting continued coordination and leadership of developing countries as the hard work of translating the FCTC text into action begins in earnest,&#148; says Bejon Misra of Consumer VOICE (India), also a NATT member.</font></p>
