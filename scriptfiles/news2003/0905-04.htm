- September 5 - Military Families Speak Out (MFSO), one of the organizations that launched the Bring Them Home NOW! campaign last month, is bringing its message to Members of Congress this week. Several families whose close relatives are serving, have served or were killed in Iraq will be participating in a Congressional briefing (Tuesday, September 9 at 2 pm in Rayburn House Office Building Room 2318), organized by Congresswoman Maxine Waters, 35th District (CA-35), to discuss how best to end US military involvement in Iraq.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The situation in Iraq is deteriorating. On average, there is at least one U.S. casualty in Iraq each day. More U.S. troops have died in Iraq since President Bush declared major combat to be over on May 1 than died in March and April. U.S. troops are at risk of injury and death from both combat and non-combat-related incidents in Iraq; serious illness from unexplained pneumonia, exposure to depleted uranium, and other causes; and severe psychological trauma. The people of Iraq are also at risk. Military Families will tell Members of Congress that &quot;those joining the armed forces sign up to serve the country and defend the Constitution, not to be used as cannon fodder in reckless military misadventures such as the U.S. invasion of Iraq.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MFSO is an organization of over 800 military families, many of whom opposed the invasion of Iraq and all of whom are now calling for an end to the occupation of Iraq and the return of all U.S. troops to their home duty stations. MFSO participants at the Congressional briefing will raise concerns about the dire lack of planning and support their loved ones and other troops are receiving. They will question the justifications used to send troops to Iraq in the first place, and will state their view that there is no way to address problems in Iraq as long as the U.S. military occupation continues.</font></p>
