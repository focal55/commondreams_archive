- July 16 - The Office of the Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) has selected the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) as the most urgent issue to be monitored by the Court.</font>

<p> </p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Prosecutor said his office &quot;&#133;will use all the powers at its disposal to contribute to the prevention of future crimes and the investigation and punishment of the alleged crimes committed in Ituri. If necessary, the Office of the Prosecutor will seek authorization from a Pre-Trial Chamber to start an investigation.&quot;</font></p>

<p> </p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The war-torn province of Ituri in the northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo has been the heart of a bloody and violent civil war that has taken more lives than any other war since World War II. More than three and a half million people have lost their lives in the war.  Every day men, women, and children live in constant fear of being killed, robbed, raped, kidnapped, forced into military service, or displaced from their homes by rebels.</font></p>

<p> </p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Heather B. Hamilton, Director of Programs of the World Federalist Association said, &quot;The DRC is precisely the kind of situation the Court's architects built it to address. This conflict has been raging for over four years with little response from the international community. Innocents continue to die everyday. The decision of the Prosecutor that this case requires 'urgent attention' to prevent future crimes is a ray of hope in a tragic situation.&quot;</font></p>

<p> </p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As the ICC looks to bring peace, justice, and hope to the DRC, the United States continues to attack the very institution capable of doing so because of its own unjustified fears of the Court. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today's press conference demonstrated the makings of an open, transparent, and credible international organization unwilling to waste its time and resources on insignificant complaints.</font></p>

<p> </p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Maybe when we finally see mass murderers and rapists from northeastern Congo standing in shackles before ICC judges, perhaps then the Court's U.S. opponents will finally realize that the ICC has far more important things to do than bring politicized allegations against Americans,&quot; said Hamilton.</font></p>
