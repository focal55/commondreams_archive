                YORK - April 8 - Iraqis responsible for past crimes should be 

                prosecuted before an international tribunal, not the U.S.-sponsored, 

                Iraqi-led judicial process outlined at the Pentagon today, Human 

                Rights Watch said. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A tribunal 

                composed of Iraqi jurists selected by the United States would 

                not have the capacity to adjudicate the staggering scope of crimes 

                by the Iraqi government, including genocide, crimes against humanity, 

                and war crimes. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Iraq's Revolutionary 

                Courts, State Security Courts, and Special Provisional Courts 

                have been instruments of repression rather than impartial judicial 

                institutions, Human Rights Watch said. The Iraqi state has also 

                interfered with other civil and criminal courts. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Meanwhile, 

                scholars, lawyers, and jurists in the Iraqi exile community should 

                not be expected to shoulder the burden of handling a high volume 

                of politically charged prosecutions, Human Rights Watch said. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"After decades 

                of Ba'ath Party rule, the Iraqi judiciary has been deeply compromised," 

                said Richard Dicker, director of the International Justice Program 

                at Human Rights Watch. "The Iraqis should certainly be involved 

                in this process, but the country's justice system just doesn't 

                have the capacity to handle a series of highly complicated trials. 

                The local solution proposed by the U.S. government would be a 

                mistake." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dicker said 

                the United States should support a tribunal composed of international 

                jurists, or a "mixed" tribunal composed of local and international 

                legal experts. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Human Rights 

                Watch estimates that in the 1988 Anfal campaign, more than 100,000 

                Kurds, mostly men and boys, were trucked to remote sites and executed. 

                Since the late 1970s, as many as 290,000 people were "disappeared" 

                in Iraq. Between 1977 and 1987, some 4,500-5,000 Kurdish villages 

                were systematically destroyed and their inhabitants forced to 

                live in "resettlement camps." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Iraq's ethnic 

                and religious composition may also complicate the establishment 

                of local tribunals. For example, a judicial panel composed of 

                victims of the Ba'ath regime, such as Kurds or Shi'ites, could 

                not be considered impartial. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Reforming the 

                current courts and training judges for an Iraqi-led tribunal would 

                take considerable time, Dicker said. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The U.S. government 

                can't solve this problem by offering some technical assistance 

                to the Iraqi judicial system," said Dicker. "That system needs 

                to be rebuilt from the ground up."
