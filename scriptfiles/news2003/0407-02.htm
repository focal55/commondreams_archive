                7 - Jim Hightower, America's #1 Populist, has joined forces with 

                the i.e. America Radio Network to bring his hard-hitting "Common 

                Sense Commentaries" to the nation's airwaves. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hightower's 

                "Common Sense Commentaries" are America's longest running progressive 

                radio program, having recently celebrated their 10th anniversary. 

                The two-minute "pops of populism" air each weekday on more than 

                100 affiliates worldwide. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On i.e. America, 

                the nation's leading progressive radio network, the programs will 

                air each weekday at 2:33 p.m. EST during The Peter Werbe Show.

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"I'm happier 

                than a flea at a dog show to be on the air with my friends at 

                i.e. America," cracks Hightower in his trademark Texas twang. 

                "It's high time we progressives put our heads together to link 

                up the snuff-dippers with the bean-sprout eaters. It's the only 

                way we'll be able to crack the overwhelming right-wing slant of 

                talk radio today and help salvage what's left of our American 

                democracy." </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hightower's 

                "Common Sense Commentaries" serve up a Texas barbecue second to 

                none, zesty food for thought based on kitchen table topics -- 

                from doctor bills and the deficit to toxic dumps and the recession. 

                Hightower will make you chuckle, get you riled up, then send you 

                on your way to raise hell. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We're proud 

                to air Jim's features on the i.e. America Radio Network," says 

                Suzanne Gougherty, i.e. America General Manager. "His performance 

                and ability to sum up a progressive viewpoint is totally in line 

                with our talk show hosts. We also plan to air the commentaries 

                during the network local breaks and weekends making them more 

                accessible for station usage." </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to 

                Werbe, whose lively, issue-oriented show airs daily from 12-3 

                p.m. EST, Hightower sets the standard for progressive talk hosts. 

                "Hightower's one of the few people in radio who speaks the truth, 

                regardless of the consequences," Werbe says. "I've admired him 

                for over a decade because of his principled stand on the issues, 

                and I'm excited that he's part of our show."
