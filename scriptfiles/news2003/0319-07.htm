                - March 19 - As Americans prepare for imminent war abroad and 

                continue to endure economic uncertainty on the home front, Congress 

                is set to debate highly controversial energy legislation. Today 

                the House Energy & Commerce Subcommittee on Energy & Air Quality 

                is taking up the "Energy Policy Act of 2003" (H.R. 3). The bill 

                is essentially a warmed over version of the anti-environmental, 

                pro-industry legislation that failed to pass in the last Congress. 

                With war looming and energy prices rising, supporters hope the 

                outcome will be different this time around. But this not so new 

                or improved energy bill is the wrong approach, at the wrong time. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Below is a 

                statement by Alys Campiagne, NRDC's legislative director: </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Recycling 

                is normally good for the environment, but not in the case of this 

                energy bill. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This sham 

                bill rips off taxpayers to the tune of billions in subsidies to 

                polluting industries -- and for what? To drill, dig and burn our 

                way to a dirtier and unhealthier environment and leaving us dangerously 

                dependent on foreign oil. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Although the 

                world has changed since 9/11, amazingly, the House is still pushing 

                a bill that would make America less secure, not more. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"What is needed 

                is a forward-looking national energy policy that promotes clean, 

                renewable energy, increased energy efficiency, and better fuel 

                economy. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Several amendments 

                will be offered to improve the energy bill and safeguard all Americans. 

                Rep. Ed Markey is planning to offer an amendment to boost domestic 

                oil savings and another to stem the threat of nuclear proliferation 

                posed by the Bush administration's plan to reprocess plutonium 

                waste. Anyone opposing these amendments will be voting against 

                our national security." </font>
