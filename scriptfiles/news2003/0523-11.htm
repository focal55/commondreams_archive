Commissioner Jonathan S. Adelstein will lead a roundtable 

discussion of 20 of the diverse groups supporting media localism, 

diversity, and competition on Tuesday May 27 at 1:30 p.m. at the 

FCC. Representatives of conservative and liberal groups, creative 

artists and local broadcasters, consumer groups and civil rights 

organizations will all attend this meeting. 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There are only a few days until the FCC's June 2 decision on 

whether to weaken media concentration protections. This roundtable 

will provide an opportunity to hear why these protections are 

important to groups across the entire political spectrum and from 

all parts of the country. The Commissioners will also discuss the 

more than 100,000 comments received last week from the National 

Rifle Association and the more than 100,000 signatures collected by 

Move On, all of which expressed concern with removing media concentration protections. </font></p>
