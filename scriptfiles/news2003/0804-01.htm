- August 4 - State Green Parties across the

U.S. are continuing to push for the repeal of

restrictive ballot access laws, with a victory for

Greens in Maryland and a dramatic law suit in Alaska.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MARYLAND: In a victory for Greens and others seeking

fair ballot access, a Maryland Court of Appeals on

July 29 struck down an election rule that has

obstructed Greens from getting on the ballot, calling

the state's two-step requirement discriminatory

against third parties.  Maryland had one of the most prohibitively difficult state ballot access rules in the U.S., requiring third parties to collect 10,000 signatures to win recognition and then submit nominating petitions with signatures from 1% of voters.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The rule in Maryland was typical of states where

Democrats and Republicans conspire to block

competition from third party candidates and

independents,&quot; said Linda Schade, Green organizer and

2002 candidate for the Maryland House of Delegates.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Maryland Democratic Party spokesman David Paulson,

trying to defend the onerous requirements, argued

against &quot;stacking and loading a ballot that could make

it more confusing for the voter.&quot; (Baltimore Sun, July

30)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Apologists for the two-party system have long argued

that more than two ballot choices confuses voters,&quot;

added Schade.  &quot;We in the Green Party have greater

respect for democracy and the intelligence of American

voters.  The real problem is the lack of competition

-- about one third of Maryland's state Senate races

were uncontested between 1962 and 1998.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ALASKA: The Green Party of Alaska filed a lawsuit in

Anchorage Superior Court on July 29 against a state

law that requires a party to draw 3% of the vote in a

statewide race and in every gubernatorial race to

maintain ballot status.  Green officials, alleging

that the rule violates their constitutional right of

equal protection, sought an injunction to retain their

ballot access.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The law is pretty absurd, especially since two other

Green Party statewide candidates received more than

six percent in the same election,&quot; said Green Party

Co-Chair Jim Sykes.  The Alaska Greens are the only

party, besides Republicans and Democrats, to run

statewide candidates in every general election since

1990.  Most statewide Green candidates have received

far more than 3% of the total vote, even outpolling a

Democrat in the 1996 race.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Recognized political parties are expected to

demonstrate a 'modicum of support.'  The most recent

election and the long history of Green Party

candidates at the ballot box more than demonstrates

statewide political party activity to meet this test,&quot;

added Sykes.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">STATE BALLOT ACCESS FOR GREEN PARTIES: As of August

2003, 23 state Green Parties have ballot status up

through the 2004 election.  Green registration is at

an all time high, with over 281,000 nationwide.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to Richard Winger of Ballot Access News,&quot;States in which people can register Green and the

government keeps a tally are: AK, AZ, CA, CO, CT, DE,

DC, FL, ME, MD, MA, NJ, NV, NM, NY, OR, PA. States in

which people can register Green but the govt won't

tally are: IA, KY, LA, NE, NH, NC, OK, RI, SD, UT, WV,

WY (the state governments of RI and UT don't keep a

tally for any party, not even Dem or Rep). The one

state which has registration into qualified parties,

but which makes it literally impossible for people to

register Green, is KS.&quot; (Posted at '<a href="http://web.greens.org/stats/" target="_new">Green Party Ballot

Status and Voter Registration Totals</a>')</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Greens, like other third parties, face everything

from absurdly difficult and complex rules to panicked

public denunciations when they try to run for office,&quot;

said Jo Chamberlain, California Green and co-chair of

the national party.  &quot;Here in California, Democrats

are trying to browbeat the Greens in an effort to stop

Green candidate Peter Camejo from running in the

recall gubernatorial race.&quot;</font></p>
