<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- August 27 -  The National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty

today called for a commutation for Paul Hill of Florida, who faces

a Sept. 3 execution date.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

Hill, an anti-abortion activist, was convicted and sentenced to death

for the murders of Dr. John Britton and James Barrett outside a women's

center in Pensacola. Hill dropped his appeals and has said he 

believes his execution will encourage more people to kill abortion

providers and therefore save lives in the long run.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Executing Paul Hill will only continue a cycle of violence,&quot; said

Steven W. Hawkins, NCADP executive director. &quot;Hill thinks, and apparently

some of his most ardent supporters agree, that his execution will turn him

into a martyr. His execution would make us less safe and a more appropriate 

alternative would be a sentence of life in prison.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

Abe Bonowitz, executive director of Floridians for Alternatives to the

Death Penalty, also called for a life sentence for Hill. &quot;Governor Bush

has refused to commute Hill's sentence, maintaining that he has a 

duty to carry out the law,&quot; Bonowitz said. &quot;But Governor Bush also has

a duty to protect the innocent citizens of Florida who could be harmed

by violence inspired by the deliberate killing of Paul Hill. The 

fact of the matter is that Governor Bush has an option that would serve

the dual purpose of punishing Mr. Hill and protecting the citizens of

Florida: He can commute the sentence of death to life in prison 

without the possibility of parole.&quot;</font></p>
