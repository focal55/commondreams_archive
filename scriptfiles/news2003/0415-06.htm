                NY - April 15 - AARP, StateWide Senior Action Council, Nursing 

                Home Community Coalition and the Coalition of NYS Alzheimer's 

                Association call upon the Governor, Senate and Assembly to pass 

                an Assisted Living law, which provides state oversight of assisted 

                living facilities. With the release of the "5 Principles for Assisted 

                Living Protection," the senior's advocacy groups specifically 

                outline what must be present in law to protect all residents of 

                assisted living facilities in New York. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Our 2.5 million 

                AARP members in New York want a law this session that protects 

                assisted living residents by requiring Department of Health oversight," 

                said Lois Aronstein, New York State Director for AARP. "In addition, 

                the 5 principles we've outlined assure for some long overdue protections 

                that need to be present in law. The time to legislate is over; 

                we need an assisted living law that protects and we need it now."

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The Coalition 

                of NYS Alzheimer's Association Chapters is pleased to join with 

                our numerous partners committed to passage of critical legislation 

                regarding Assisted Living Facilities operating in our state," 

                said Marvin LeRoy, director, Coalition of NYS Alzheimer's Association. 

                "This emerging residential care option for our more senior members 

                of society -- especially those touched by dementia -- very much 

                requires universal definitions and standards of operation and 

                care to guide their work. With legislation addressing these concerns 

                now on the books in over forty states, the New York State legislature 

                needs to bring this debate to closure and pass legislative language 

                in the current session." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Assisted living 

                is the fastest growing type of senior housing in the country. 

                In 1998 alone, assisted living facilities accounted for over 75 

                percent of all new senior housing, costing older New Yorkers anywhere 

                from $1,500 to $6,500 to reside in these facilities. Currently, 

                many assisted living facilities operate in New York State with 

                no state oversight, are not required to provide consumer information 

                and disclosures, and have no uniform admission and discharge policy. 

                The position of AARP and our coalition partners is that providing 

                no state oversight for assisted living continues to put a vulnerable 

                population at risk. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The growth 

                of assisted living facilities in our state is a welcome alternative 

                for older persons", said Mike Burgess, executive director for 

                the StateWide Senior Action Council. "However, New York State 

                must establish regulations which protect residents and set conditions 

                for operating in the State." </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cynthia Rudder, 

                executive director of the Nursing Home Community Coalition of 

                New York State stated that, "Many assisted living residents are 

                frail and are getting frailer. An NHCC study found that many residents 

                in unlicensed facilities need help with basic life activities 

                -- taking medications, bathing, dressing, etc. Many used assistive 

                devices, were cognitively impaired and received home care. In 

                addition, some of these residences reported what seemed to be 

                inappropriate care. These vulnerable residents need protection. 

                Government has a responsibility to set minimum standards, conduct 

                surprise inspections and apply sanctions when appropriate." </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The "5 Principles 

                for Assisted Living Protection" that need to be incorporated into 

                an assisted living law are: </font>
