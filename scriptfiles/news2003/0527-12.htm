- May 27 - In an open challenge to the United States Trade Representative and the Bush administration's economic policies, a delegation of America's working poor from all walks of life will expose the harsh reality behind free trade at a congressional briefing, sponsored by the Congressional Progressive Caucus, on June 12, 9:00-11:30 a.m., 2168 Rayburn House Building, Washington, DC. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">U.S. Trade Representative, Robert Zoellick, argues that free trade helps American workers, saying, &quot;It is our shared hemispheric vision that free trade and openness benefits everyone and provides opportunity, prosperity and hope to all our peoples.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1994, the United States has lost an estimated three million jobs. Today, those Americans who have found employment in the post-NAFTA economy work longer hours, with less job security and fewer benefits. Overall, real wages have remained stagnant and the low-skill jobs created by free trade agreements on average pay 13 percent less than before. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;One of the great myths perpetuated by the United States government is that free trade helps poor people and communities in America,&quot; said Anuradha Mittal, co-director of Food First/Institute for Food and Development Policy, the organizers of the briefing. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This rhetoric has been spun without asking working Americans what their experience has been. We've had NAFTA for nearly a decade now, and its effects have been tragic for the working poor. This briefing is a unique chance for Congress to hear the truth from representatives of the hundreds of thousands of people who lose from free trade,&quot; Mittal added. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Several members of the Congress, including Barbara Lee, Dennis Kucinich John Conyers, Marcy Kaputer, and Shelia Jackson-Lee, will preside over the briefing. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The spectrum of testimony at the briefing is broad, from workers in U.S. sweatshops, to farmworkers, family farmers and unionized workers,&quot; said Christine Ahn, Coordinator of the hearing. &quot;As the U.S. prepares to seal the WTO Doha round, CAFTA and the FTAA, this hearing could not be more timely. The voices of these Americans deserve to be heard&quot;, said Ahn. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Testifying organizations include AFL-CIO, American Corn Growers Association, Black Farmers &amp; Agriculturalist Association, Charleston 5 International Longshoreman's Association, Chinese Progressive Association, Coalition of Immokalee Workers, Farm Labor Organizing Committee, Fuerza Unida, National Family Farm Coalition, Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen's Association, Public Citizen, Tennessee Industrial Renewal Network, Association of Border Workers, and United Farm Workers of America.</font></p>
