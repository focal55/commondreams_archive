                - March 31 - In an historic step forward for medical marijuana, 

                GW Pharmaceuticals has applied to Great Britain's Medicines Control 

                Agency (equivalent to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) for 

                approval of its Cannabis-Based Medical Extract (CBME). A series 

                of large, controlled trials showed that CBME provided substantial 

                and sometimes dramatic relief for patients suffering from chronic 

                pain and other symptoms resulting from multiple sclerosis or neurological 

                conditions.</font> 

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> GW's medicine 

                  is, for all practical purposes, marijuana in liquid form. An 

                  extract made from plants bred for specific levels of various 

                  active components unique to marijuana, called cannabinoids, 

                  CBME is similar to marijuana-based extracts and tinctures that 

                  were legally available in the United States -- manufactured 

                  by major drug companies and sold through pharmacies -- until 

                  the federal government banned marijuana in 1937.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> CBME, administered 

                  as a spray in the mouth, gave relief above and beyond standard 

                  medications, often helping where standard drugs failed or caused 

                  unacceptable side effects. CBME's side effects were few and 

                  generally mild. Approval by the Medicines Control Agency is 

                  expected before the end of the year.</font></p>

                <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The 

                  research done by GW Pharmaceuticals has demolished virtually 

                  every argument made by opponents of medical marijuana,&quot; 

                  said Robert Kampia, executive director of the Washington, D.C.-based 

                  Marijuana Policy Project. &quot;They have shown, in rigorous, 

                  scientific trials, that marijuana is indeed medicine, and that 

                  it's both effective and remarkably safe.</font></p>

                <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;CBME 

                  is nothing like Marinol, the synthetic THC pill that is available 

                  by prescription in the U.S.,&quot; Kampia added. &quot;This 

                  whole- plant extract truly is liquid marijuana, with the dozens 

                  of naturally occurring components that scientists increasingly 

                  believe contribute to marijuana's medical benefits. GW's work 

                  proves what medical marijuana advocates have long known: Marijuana's 

                  therapeutic benefits go well beyond THC.&quot;</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> GW has 

                  not announced plans to seek approval in the U.S., where federal 

                  rules regulating marijuana research -- which require use of 

                  low-grade, government-grown marijuana -- make virtually impossible 

                  the sort of research GW has done.</font></p>

                <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We 

                  hope this product makes it to the U.S someday,&quot; Kampia 

                  said. &quot;But patients battling MS, cancer, and AIDS need 

                  the relief marijuana can give them today. People who are in 

                  pain now -- and who could get relief from a plant they can grow 

                  in their own backyards -- shouldn't have to wait for a product 

                  that may or may not ever come to this country.&quot;</font></p>
