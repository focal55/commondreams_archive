<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- June 20 - Today, Ben Cohen announced his endorsement of Dennis Kucinich for 

President. Kucinich welcomed the support of the businessperson and 

leading peace and justice activist: &quot;It is an honor to win the support 

of Ben Cohen, an individual who has achieved so much in the business 

world and in the world of advocacy and grassroots mobilization. It sends a signal to progressive activists that our campaign is gaining momentum, and that they should come aboard.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Statement from Ben Cohen:

In this endorsement, I am speaking out as an individual -- and not on 

behalf of any organization, business, government, labor union or armed 

force. Nor does it imply that there will soon be an ice cream flavor 

named Kucinich Kreme.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You know me as a Vermonter, an entrepreneur, a Grateful Dead fan, and a 

longtime advocate for a peace dividend -- for providing money we need to invest in our children, our schools, and our environment by reducing 

Cold War-era Pentagon expenditures. There is one candidate running for 

President who supports the values most important to me, and most 

critical to the country. That candidate is Congressman Dennis Kucinich, 

the co-chair of the Progressive Caucus, and the leader on Capitol Hill 

in challenging Bush Administration foreign policies that make Americans less -- not more -- secure.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While others discuss incremental change, only Dennis Kucinich advocates changing the way our government is run in order to reflect the values of America's people. As Granny D says: &quot;We are the people who believe in a 

world of environmental beauty, of happiness and not exploitation, of 

justice and not oppression and torture. A world safe for children&amp;.We 

believe in international law and cooperative action.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">How we spend our money as a nation reflects our values and beliefs. Look at your personal check book, and it tells you what is important to you. 

Our nation's checkbook tells us that our priorities are all wrong -- and </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Kucinich is the one candidate bold enough to say so. He calls for 

funding human needs such as universal healthcare, education, 

environmental cleanup and expanded programs for the poor, the cities, 

the elderly, and he does it at no additional taxpayer expense by shaving up to 15 percent of the billion dollar a day Pentagon budget.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Because of our skewed national priorities, municipal and state 

governments are in crisis, as are school districts. Other candidates 

offer compassionate rhetoric about leaving &quot;no child behind,&quot; but it's 

just lip service without putting your money where your mouth is, and 

getting rid of tax breaks benefiting the wealthy.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So in this election, voters should say: &quot;Show me the money. What will 

you cut? What programs will you expand?&quot; I like the answers provided by 

Dennis Kucinich.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">My top priority in November 2004 is defeating George W. Bush, and I will try to make that happen even if Dennis Kucinich does not become the 

Democratic nominee. Win or lose the nomination, his grassroots 

presidential campaign is the vehicle for expanding the party, moving it in a progressive direction, bringing in new voters, and reaching out in 

a serious way to bring back disaffected voters. That's another reason I 

endorse Kucinich for President.</font></p>
