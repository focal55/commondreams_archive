                - February 25 - The American Civil Liberties Union today said 

                that it is looking into possible litigation on behalf of Bretton 

                Barber, a junior at Dearborn High School who was told to go home 

                if he did not remove a t-shirt with a picture of President Bush 

                between the words "international terrorist." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"It’s a gutsy 

                thing for a high school student to take on a school administration 

                in this way," said Kary Moss, Executive Director of the ACLU of 

                Michigan. "It’s obvious that Bretton feels very strongly about 

                this issue and we want to make sure that his ability to express 

                his political opinion isn’t hindered in any way." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"I’m hoping 

                that we can resolve this issue without going to court," Moss added. 

                "However, if the school is unwilling to allow students the right 

                to political expression, we’ll have no choice." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The incident 

                arose on February 17, when Barber wore the t-shirt to school to 

                express his concern about the President’s policies on the potential 

                war in Iraq. After wearing the shirt in school for three hours 

                without incident, school administrators asked him to remove the 

                t-shirt, turn it inside out, or go home, saying that the shirt 

                might cause a "disruption." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To justify 

                their actions, a school administrator cited a famous 1969 U.S. 

                Supreme Court decision about student free expression rights. But 

                Barber, who was familiar with the decision as well, pointed out 

                that the official was citing from the dissenting opinion, not 

                the often-quoted majority decision that a student's rights to 

                free speech don't end "at the schoolhouse gate." That decision 

                actually supports his position, Barber told the official. Nonetheless, 

                he was told to remove the shirt. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Barber, who 

                has nearly a 4.0 average and was second in his class last semester, 

                said that he is hoping to go to the University of Michigan in 

                Ann Arbor to pursue a career in constitutional law. He has been 

                a "card-carrying member" of the ACLU since the 10th grade and 

                has contributed whatever he could afford to the organization since 

                middle school. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The shirt 

                was meant to emphasize the message ‘no war,’ and I feel that I’ve 

                been successful in getting that message out," said Barber. Although 

                he has given up wearing his shirt until the issue with the school 

                can be resolved, he said that he hopes to organize a group of 

                students to protest the banning of the t-shirt.
