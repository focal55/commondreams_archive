                - April 15 - Nitrogen pollution is harming forests, streams and 

                coastal waters but can be alleviated, reports a team of 12 leading 

                scientists in a study released today in a special issue of the 

                journal BioScience. The authors of the study pinpoint air pollution 

                and wastewater effluent as the leading causes of nitrogen pollution 

                to forests and estuaries of the Northeastern U.S. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report 

                provides a scientific basis for evaluating clean air proposals 

                currently before Congress including a new bill introduced by Senator 

                Judd Gregg (R-NH) earlier this month and two bills introduced 

                by Senators James Jeffords (I-VT) and James Inhofe (R-OK) in February 

                of this year. "In clear and decisive terms, this report confirms 

                the need for cuts in nitrogen oxides similar to those outlined 

                in my multi-pollutant bill if we want to see healthier people 

                and ecosystems in the next 50 years," said Senator Jeffords), 

                ranking member of the U.S. Senate Environment and Public Works 

                Committee." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The study synthesizes 

                data on the effects of nitrogen pollution and evaluates possible 

                solutions. Impacts on forests and watersheds cited by the authors 

                include diminished forest productivity (up to 14 percent in some 

                areas) due to nitrogen-induced ozone, and nitrogen-driven pulses 

                of acidity that impact approximately 41% of lakes in the Adirondack 

                region of New York and 15 percent in New England. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"In all the 

                watersheds we examined, airborne emissions of nitrogen and nitrogen 

                discharged from wastewater treatment plants were the overwhelming 

                sources of nitrogen pollution to forests and coastal waters in 

                the Northeast," said co-author Dr. David Whitall of the Hubbard 

                Brook Research Foundation, the group that organized the new study. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The authors 

                report that the current Clean Air Act (as amended in 1990) will 

                not reduce nitrogen emissions enough to prevent damage to northeast 

                forests and reverse acid rain impacts to lakes and streams. The 

                analysis shows that additional reductions in total nitrogen emissions 

                of 30 percent or more would be needed to reduce nitrogen runoff 

                to less harmful levels. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Despite the 

                reductions in sulfur emissions that have been achieved by the 

                1990 Clean Air Act, little progress has been made in reducing 

                total emissions of nitrogen. So unfortunately, we weren't surprised 

                that airborne nitrogen pollution continues to be a serious problem 

                for Northeast forests and streams," noted lead author Dr. Charles 

                Driscoll, University Professor and Chair of the Department of 

                Civil and Environmental Engineering at Syracuse University. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The study also 

                assesses nitrogen pollution in estuaries -- the ultimate receiving 

                waters for much of the nitrogen produced in the regions watersheds. 

                The authors confirm that excess nitrogen can lead to over-enrichment 

                of coastal waters that has been shown to deplete oxygen levels 

                and degrade critical sea grass habitat. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The study demonstrates 

                that upgrades to wastewater treatment plants using currently available 

                technology could reduce nitrogen loading to coastal waters, such 

                as Long Island Sound, by as much as 57 percent -- a level that 

                would improve the low oxygen conditions experienced in the Sound 

                annually. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"By quantifying 

                all the sources of nitrogen in the watersheds that drain to 8 

                estuaries in the Northeast, we were able to predict the effects 

                of specific policy options. And the result was clear, improved 

                wastewater treatment is the single most effective means of reducing 

                nitrogen pollution in coastal waters of the Northeast," concluded 

                Dr. Mark Castro, Associate Professor at the University of Maryland.

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This study 

                adds to the growing body of evidence concerning the severity of 

                nitrogen pollution nationwide and the need for policy reform to 

                address the problem. Four additional papers in this special issue 

                of BioScience highlight: the power of nitrogen to create a "nitrogen 

                cascade" (Galloway et al.), the fact that airborne nitrogen pollution 

                has altered Northeast forests (Aber et al.), and the impacts of 

                airborne nitrogen pollution in the Western U.S. (Fenn et al.). 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite the 

                pressing nature of nitrogen pollution, initiatives to address 

                the problem appear to have stalled or been rolled back. The Bush 

                Administration recently weakened the Clean Air Act provision that 

                required electric utilities that expand to improve emissions controls 

                (known as New Source Review) -- causing the Attorneys General 

                of nine Northeast states to sue the federal government. On the 

                water front, the U.S. EPA released a study last year that has 

                gone largely unanswered, highlighting the $30 billion gap in clean 

                water financing needed to address nitrogen and other water quality 

                issues. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Solving the 

                nitrogen problem nationally will require a multi-pronged approach. 

                We now know that in the Northeast, two of these approaches must 

                be reduced air emissions and improved wastewater treatment," said 

                Kathy Fallon Lambert, executive director of the Hubbard Brook 

                Research Foundation. </font>
