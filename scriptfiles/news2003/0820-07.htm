<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">They join British American Tobacco (BAT), Suzuki, Total Oil, construction firm Kajima, Lonely Planet, Austrian Airlines, PriceWaterhouseCoopers, Daewoo, and Orient Express. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The 'Dirty List' exposes companies who are directly or indirectly helping to finance one of the most brutal regimes in the world,&quot; said John Jackson, Director of Burma Campaign UK. &quot;Foreign investment and trade can benefit developing countries, but in Burma it helps finance a regime that uses rape, torture and murder to oppress its own people.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WPP's successful takeover of Cordiant Communications means they now have a subsidiary in Burma - Bates Myanmar. Ernst &amp; Young have a partner in Burma. P&amp;O Cruises have merged with Carnival Corporation, which operates cruises to Burma. Deutsche Post subsidiary DHL has a subsidiary in Burma which is a joint venture with the regime. Superdrug and 3 mobile join the 'Dirty List' as subsidiaries of Hutchison Whampoa, which operates a port in Burma. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Gary Player Design, owned by golf legend Gary Player, Intrepid Travel, PanMacmillan, and Noble Caledonia are other new additions to the list. 

The list mainly targets British companies or companies with a significant presence in Britain. A total of 78 are named and shamed. An updated 'Clean List' of companies who have pulled out or have policies not to trade with Burma is also released today. These include Premier Oil, Kuoni, M&amp;S, Next, Levi's, Texaco and Triumph International. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Most companies will not get involved with Burma because of the ethical issues involved,&quot; says John Jackson. &quot;It is significant that even without investment sanctions only two FTSE 100 companies, BAT and WPP, have any significant involvement in Burma.&quot; In July the British government asked BAT to pull out of Burma. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The travel industry dominates the list, with 26 travel companies operating tours to Burma and 12 companies publishing guides that encourage people to visit the country. There is a tourist boycott of Burma as tourism is an important source of income for the regime, and much tourist infrastructure has been built using slave labour and child labour. The Burma Campaign UK is currently calling for a boycott of Lonely Planet as it publishes a guide to Burma. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The list is intended as a resource for investors and campaigners. Campaign action sheets for each of the companies are available on the Burma Campaign UK website: <a href="http://www.burmacampaign.org.uk" target="_new">www.burmacampaign.org.uk</a>. </font></p>

THE 'DIRTY LIST' FOLLOWS. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">COMPANIES SUPPORTING THE REGIME IN BURMA </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

INTRODUCTION </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Burma is a country ruled by one of the longest running and most brutal military dictatorships in the world; a dictatorship charged by the United Nations with a &quot;crime against humanity&quot; for its systematic abuses of human rights, and condemned internationally for refusing to transfer power to the legally elected Government of the country - the party led by Nobel Peace Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In May 2003 a pro government militia attacked a convoy Aung San Suu Kyi was travelling in. Up to one hundred of her supporters were massacred. Aung San Suu Kyi escaped the attack, but was arrested by the regime. She remains under arrest, her whereabouts unknown. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In response to calls from Burma's democracy movement, the Burma Campaign UK and other campaign groups around the world have been pressuring companies to sever business ties with Burma. Whereas in many developing countries foreign investment and trade can benefit the poor, in Burma it has the opposite effect. Instead it funds a brutal dictatorship, helping it to cling on to power. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The European Parliament, the British government, Burma's democrats, the US government and many other bodies and institutions recognise the role investment plays in strengthening Burma's regime. The British government actively discourages trade and investment in Burma and has called on companies to pull out. In July 2003 it asked British American Tobacco to pull out of Burma. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Concern about the role foreign investment plays in perpetuating the brutal regime is also widespread in the private sector. In December 2001 European investment funds managing over &pound;400bn in assets issued a groundbreaking statement of concern about companies investing in Burma. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Over the last five years a large number of foreign companies have withdrawn from the country. The reasons cited for doing so include: difficulties in working with the regime, consumer boycotts, damage to company reputation and incompatibility with corporate values. These companies now include amongst others: Texaco, Adidas, Kuoni, Premier Oil, Triumph International, Levi Strauss, PepsiCo, Erickson, Heineken, Carlsberg, British Home Stores, Burton, River Island, Apple, Reebok and Compaq. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Companies remaining in Burma often attempt to justify their involvement by claiming that pulling out would harm ordinary Burmese people. Aung San Suu Kyi disputes this. Two days after her release from house arrest in May 2002, Aung San Suu Kyi stated &quot;I don't think we have found evidence that sanctions have harmed the Burmese people, because they have been clearly limited and many of those who have suffered under sanctions have belonged to the business community. Naturally some ordinary employees have been exposed, but we have not yet found proof that large numbers of Burmese have suffered as a result of sanctions. Sanctions have a role to play because they are a strong political message. But also because they are an economic message.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Companies are attracted to Burma by wages as low as 17p a day, a compliant workforce where unions are banned, and limited health and safety laws which in any case are rarely enforced. The minimum working age is 13. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This list of companies supporting the regime in Burma (The Dirty List) mainly consists of British companies or foreign companies with a significant presence in Britain. It lists companies whose involvement in Burma provides financial or other support to the regime. Subsidiaries or parent companies of companies on the dirty list are automatically included on the 'Dirty List'. This 'Dirty List' is not a definitive list of every single company which operates in Burma. The Burma Campaign UK is not calling for a total trade boycott of Burma. We are calling for targeted sanctions which will cut the economic lifeline to the regime. We believe companies on this list are directly or indirectly helping to keep the regime in power. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This list is for use by campaigners, investment funds and individual investors. Many people will not wish to purchase products from companies linked with the regime in Burma. At present the Burma Campaign UK is co-ordinating boycott campaigns targeting Lonely Planet and tourism to Burma. We are not actively co-ordinating boycotts of all the companies on this dirty list, however we welcome people contacting these companies urging them to pull out. Action sheets are available at www.burmacampaign.org.uk. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We have also published a 'Clean List' of companies that have taken principled decisions not to operate in Burma, or that have pulled out in response to campaigns. The Burma Campaign UK welcomes suggestions for additions to the Dirty List that we may have neglected to include. </font></p>
