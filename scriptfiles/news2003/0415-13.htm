                - April 15 - Following the <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/0407-07.htm">anti-war 

                demonstration at Port of Oakland, California</a>, on 7 April, 

                where at least 21 people were injured, Amnesty International called 

                today on the Chief of Police to conduct a full inquiry into allegations 

                of excessive force by police.</font> 

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Police reportedly 

                  fired non-lethal weapons, including bean bags, wooden bullets 

                  and sting ball grenades at demonstrators, causing injuries to 

                  at least twelve protesters, and nine by-standers who were not 

                  involved in the demonstration. Those injured were reportedly 

                  hit in the back, arms, necks and faces.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a letter 

                  to the Chief of Police of Oakland Police Department, Amnesty 

                  International acknowledged the challenges presented to police 

                  officers when policing large demonstrations. &quot;However, 

                  we are concerned at reports that police opened fire within 30 

                  seconds of ordering demonstrators to disperse, and that they 

                  fired projectiles directly at demonstrators at close range, 

                  including wooden bullets.&quot;</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Evidence 

                  has shown that the weapons used can cause serious internal injuries, 

                  break bones, inflict blindness, and are potentially lethal. 

                  A full inquiry is needed to confirm whether any of these weapons 

                  were misused by the Oakland police on 7 April. Steps should 

                  also be taken to ensure that police do not subject further protesters 

                  to such treatment.&quot;</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;If 

                  the allegations are true, the police actions in this case would 

                  clearly be incompatible with international standards requiring 

                  that law enforcement officials should use force only as a last 

                  resort, in proportion to the threat posed, and in a way to minimize 

                  damage or injury,&quot; Amnesty International said.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;These 

                  reports are particularly disturbing, given the potentially harmful 

                  effects of such weapons on small children or the elderly, or 

                  people suffering from weak hearts or other conditions.&quot; 

                  </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In its letter, 

                  Amnesty International asked to see Oakland Police Department's 

                  guidelines for use of non-lethal weapons and to receive information 

                  on police training in place for use of these weapons. </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This 

                  is not the first time we have had to raise concerns with US 

                  law enforcement agencies about the use of non-lethal weapons. 

                  All law enforcement agencies across the USA must introduce strict 

                  guidelines and limitations on use of these weapons with clear 

                  monitoring procedures,&quot; concluded Amnesty International.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Weapons 

                  used on 7 April include:</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bean Bags: 

                  Evidence has shown that bean bags can cause serious internal 

                  injuries as they can penetrate deep into the body. If fired 

                  from too close they can cause broken bones and are particularly 

                  dangerous if aimed at sensitive areas, as they make it difficult 

                  to quantify the level of pain inflicted to some parts of the 

                  body. Although originally considered to be a suitable &quot;less-than-lethal&quot; 

                  force option against potentially dangerous suspects, police 

                  departments in some US states are abandoning the use of bean 

                  bags after finding that they can be dangerously inaccurate and 

                  deadlier than manufacturers claim . </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sting ball 

                  grenades: According to some experts, these weapons are completely 

                  indiscriminate and inaccurate. They should not be fired at close 

                  range because they are potentially lethal. The small pellets 

                  released when the grenades explode may penetrate the skin and 

                  pose serious eye injury risk, including blindness. </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Wooden bullets: 

                  These were deemed to be unacceptable by the British government 

                  in the 1970s in relation to use by British soldiers in Northern 

                  Ireland as they can cause serious head injuries as well as the 

                  possibility of inflicting blindness and may penetrate the skin.
