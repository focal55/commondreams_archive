                - March 28 - May Dept. Stores, the St. Louis-based retail giant 

                and owner of 14 chains including Foley's, Lord & Taylor, Hechts, 

                Strawbridges, Robinsons-May, and David's Bridal, informed the 

                Free Burma Coalition that it will no longer sell products made 

                in the Southeast Asian country of Burma, where the garment industry 

                is tied to a system of modern-day slavery. The company, which 

                had $13.5 billion in sales last year, posted the change in policy 

                on its website yesterday, <a href="http://www2.mayco.com/common/investorSOR.jsp" target="_new">http://www2.mayco.com/common/investorSOR.jsp</a>, 

                making it the 40th U.S. company in 3 years to boycott Burma products. 

                So many companies have banned "Made in Burma" clothing that U.S. 

                imports from Burma have dropped 27% in the past year - a sharp 

                reversal compared to a previous surge in imports. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"May has 'made 

                the right choice'," says Aung Din, Director of Policy for the 

                Free Burma Coalition, referring to the company's slogan. "There 

                are almost no major retailers that want to be associated with 

                Burma's brutal dictatorship and its vicious use of forced and 

                slave labor." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A number of 

                groups, including the American Anti-Slavery Group and the Campaign 

                for Labor Rights as well as the Free Burma Coalition launched 

                a boycott of May Stores after the company refused to respond to 

                complaints over "Made in Burma" products on store shelves. May 

                had been retailing clothing made in Burma by several companies 

                including Rafaella and One Step Up. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">May joins dozens 

                of major retailers in its decision, such as top competitors Federated 

                Department Stores and Saks, as well as Wal-Mart, Costco, Gart 

                Sports, Tommy Hilfiger, Fila, Hanes, The Spiegel Group, and Jones 

                Apparel. Companies are boycotting Burmese products due to the 

                links between the country's garment industry and forced labor, 

                which were described by the U.S. State Department in its most 

                recent human rights report on Burma: "Forced labor, including 

                forced child labor, has contributed materially to the construction 

                of industrial parks subsequently used largely to produce manufactured 

                exports including garments." Burma's regime has also been condemned 

                for using rape as a weapon of war and for having the world's largest 

                number of child soldiers, most of whom Burma's military forcibly 

                conscripts. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Burma's democracy 

                leader and Nobel Peace Prize recipient, Aung San Suu Kyi, has 

                called for foreign businesses to avoid Burma, saying that sanctions 

                "send a strong political and economic message" to its dictatorship. 

                South African Bishop Desmond Tutu has noted the parallels between 

                the "Free Burma" movement and the anti-apartheid struggle, calling 

                Burma the "new South Africa."
