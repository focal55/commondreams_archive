- September 30 - Thirty-two allies and friendly nations today lost vital military assistance for fiscal year 2003, allocated under the President's budget to serve national security interests and promote peace and democracy. The military assistance to be withheld under the same legislation for Fiscal Year 2004 could total an additional $89.28 million.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On July 1st, military assistance was withheld from 32 U.S. friends and allies who refused to bow to the Bush administration's demands to grant all American nationals immunity from prosecution at the International Criminal Court (ICC). These countries fear that such agreements would cause them to violate their legal commitments to an international treaty (the Rome Statute of the ICC). Because today marks the end of Fiscal Year 2003, the 32 countries which have not capitulated to U.S. demands will permanently lose the funds withheld as of July 1st.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These 32 U.S. allies and friends have lost their U.S. military assistance under the American Servicemembers Protection Act (2002) because President Bush has refused to grant them national interest waivers.  Affected countries include Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Slovakia, all of which have sent troops to Iraq, as well as key partners in the war on terrorism and drug trafficking (see below for a complete list).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This is the first sanction in U.S. diplomatic history targeted exclusively at democracies.  The administration's ideological opposition to the International Criminal Court is compromising other vital U.S. foreign policy priorities and putting allies and friendly nations in a difficult position,&quot; said Heather B. Hamilton, Director of Programs at the World Federalist Association. &quot;These nations cannot be expected to put U.S. nationals above the law that their own leaders and citizens abide and live by.&quot; ### Notes to the Editor:</font></p>
