                - March 6 - As currently proposed, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory 

                Commission’s (NRC) plan for testing nuclear waste transportation 

                containers is too little, too late. Limited, one-time tests are 

                planned to study how some – but not all – casks respond to accident 

                conditions (the "Package Performance Study"). These casks may 

                eventually be used to ship nuclear waste to Yucca Mountain in 

                Nevada and a Utah facility owned by the Private Fuel Storage consortium. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Currently, 

                the agency does not conduct physical tests of the casks it licenses. 

                The new proposal makes some progress but is not enough. The agency 

                suggests subjecting just two cask designs to full-scale physical 

                tests, rather than making this a requirement for every cask design. 

                Also, the proposed study ignores important vulnerabilities. For 

                example, puncture, crushing force, submersion and explosive tests 

                are not planned. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Moreover, this 

                study is not scheduled to be completed until 2005. But the NRC 

                is expected to rule this spring on a license application for the 

                Private Fuel Storage facility at Skull Valley, Utah, which would 

                initiate thousands of cross-country nuclear shipments. Is the 

                NRC serious? The agency really wants to start shipments before 

                testing to ensure the casks are safe? </font> 

                <p></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The proposed 

                  Yucca Mountain repository as well as the Private Fuel Storage 

                  facility would involve unprecedented high-level radioactive 

                  waste shipments crisscrossing the country by train, truck and 

                  barge. Public Citizen has grave concerns about the safety of 

                  shipping high-level nuclear waste and about inadequate government 

                  oversight of the shipping. We applaud the NRC’s recognition 

                  of the need for full-scale, physical cask testing. However, 

                  as currently proposed, the testing plan falls far short of addressing 

                  public safety concerns. NRC licensing regulations should be 

                  strengthened to require full-scale physical testing of every 

                  cask design. The NRC also should close the loopholes in the 

                  test protocol and withhold license approval of nuclear waste 

                  transportation projects until the study is complete.</font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
