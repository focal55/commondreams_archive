<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NEW YORK - June 13 -  Bluewater Wind LLC, a leading developer of wind power projects, today publicly announced its bid to build, operate, and maintain an offshore wind park in the waters south of Long Island. The bid was submitted on May 1st, 2003 in response to The Long Island Power Authority's (LIPA's) Request for Proposals. Bluewater Wind also announced the launch of its Web site, <a href="http://www.bluewaterwind.com" target="_new">www.bluewaterwind.com</a>, which answers frequently asked questions about offshore wind's impact on and benefits to the Long Island community. The importance of the wind park was highlighted this week by LIPA's warning that summer heat could lead to electricity shortages on the Island.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Long Island can steer the country in an exciting new direction with its offshore wind, which will be pollution-free, boundless, and blow a gust of clean air into the future of energy production,&quot; said Ashok Gupta, director of the Natural Resources Defense Council's Air and Energy Program.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On Earth Day 2002, LIPA released a study showing that the wind resources off Long Island's southern shore have the potential to generate up to 5,200 megawatts (MW) of electricity - enough to meet more than 75 percent of Long Island's electricity needs. Bluewater Wind proposes to harness a portion of those resources with a wind park that covers less than one-half square mile in total area. The collective output of 140 MW would be enough to supply approximately 42,000 Long Island families with 100 percent of their electricity.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Bluewater Wind Web site provides technically accurate photo simulations of how the wind park will appear from various vantage points and allows users to view a nine-minute video that includes interviews with wind experts and close-up images of the wind turbines. Bluewater Wind's design sets 39 turbines more than six and a half miles off the coast, so that the wind park will only be faintly visible on the clearest of days.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Long Island is positioned to make history by converting the safe, clean power of wind into a renewable energy source,&quot; said Peter Mandelstam, Bluewater Wind's president. &quot;Wind energy can provide a permanent cure for the volatile electricity price fluctuations and supply shortages that have long plagued Long Island residents.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Long Island's wind project has received widespread support, including that of Governor George Pataki, who has called for &quot;at least 25 percent of electricity bought in New York (to) come from renewable resources.&quot; In addition, 34 Long Island-based environmental, civic and faith-based groups have endorsed the project. Wind energy is the world's fastest growing electricity source. In the U.S., wind projects in 26 states produce close to 5,000 MW 3/4 or the equivalent of what is generated by 6 million tons of coal.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Wind energy is clean, abundant, secure and now economically viable,&quot; said Gordian Raacke, executive director of the Citizens Advisory Panel, an independent LIPA watchdog group. &quot;LIPA's commitment promises to deliver a successful project that will help meet Long Island's energy needs for years to come.&quot;</font></p>
