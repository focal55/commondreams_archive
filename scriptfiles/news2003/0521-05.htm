Living with HIV/AIDS by 2005;<br>

- May 21 - In his first speech to the WHO General Assembly, the incoming 

Director General J.W. Lee committed the WHO to reaching the goal it 

first announced at the International AIDS Conference in Barcelona in 

July, 2002 - that 3 million people living with AIDS in developing 

countries receive antiretroviral therapy for the treatment of 

HIV/AIDS by the end of 2005.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AIDS activists applaud this modest yet attainable goal of treating 

half of the six million people in clinical need of antiretroviral 

therapy within 2 _ years.  But they also emphasize that the WHO needs 

a plan to reach this target which must include technical support to 

developing countries to improve health care capacity and to expand 

treatment programs.  "Without a plan for actually scaling up 

treatment both globally and within impacted countries, the promise of 

treatment will be a cruel joke," said Sharonann Lynch of Health GAP. 

"SARS has shown that the WHO is capable of the comprehensive, well 

funded, aggressive response that the AIDS crisis requires. The WHO as 

the world's leading public health institution has to do its homework 

to deliver a plan to treat three million people living with HIV/AIDS 

by 2005."

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The comprehensive plan must also include a commitment to expanding 

the WHO's medicines pre-qualification project, as well as support for 

medicines policies that prioritise access to lowest cost, quality 

medicines for AIDS, TB and malaria, including generic medicines.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In order for large-scale up of treatment, countries must receive 

adequate funding. Activists point to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, 

TB, and Malaria as the best financing mechanism in the fight against 

AIDS, which is virtually out of funds and faces a budget shortfall of 

$1.4 billion for the third round of proposals due in the fall of 

2003.  "The Global Fund needs money now and a regular flow of money 

in the future based on fair share contributions by rich countries," 

said Professor Brook Baker of Health GAP.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To counteract the underfunding of the Global Fund, a new 

Fund-the-Fund Campaign has been launched internationally to pressure 

rich countries to support the Global Fund, which is the only 

mechanism currently supporting HIV/AIDS treatment programs in Africa 

and other poor countries. "People dying of AIDS can't wait for the 

U.S bilateral program which is not even funded let alone 

operational," according to Asia Russell of Health GAP.  "A lack of 

planning and the absence of sustainable and proportionate funding 

will perpetuate a worldwide system of medical apartheid that condemns 

poor Africans to death when all necessary ingredients are available - 

drugs, expertise, and money."

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Three million in treatment by 2005 is feasible," said Dr. Alan 

Berkman of Health GAP, "and an even higher percentage each year 

thereafter, if the WHO works hard to fulfil Dr. Lee's promise and the 

G8 countries contribute the needed resources on a proportionate and 

sustainable basis."

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Without the Global Fund, activists warn that:



* 500,000 people with HIV/AIDS will be denied the promise of 

treatment, as will millions more if future rounds are not funded

* 2 million with infectious tuberculosis will not be treated

* 20 million will not receive combination therapy for drug resistant malaria.
