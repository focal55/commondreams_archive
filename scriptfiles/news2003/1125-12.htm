- November 25 - Open Debates (<A HREF="http://www.opendebates.org" TARGET="_new">www.opendebates.org</A>) commends Rep. Dennis Kucinich (D-OH) for calling for open debates as part of his presidential campaign platform.  &#147;I believe in the power of open debates to restore higher values of democracy and voter education to the American political process,&#148; stated Rep. Kucinich.  </FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;We applaud Rep. Kucinich&#146;s call for open debates,&#148; stated Open Debates&#146; Executive Director George Farah.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) has sponsored the presidential debates since 1988, when it seized control of the debates from the non-partisan League of Women Voters.  The CPD is a private corporation that was established by the chairs of the Republican National Committee and the Democratic National Committee.  </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;CPD sponsored presidential debates have been little more than glorified press conferences, where candidates recite prepackaged sound-bites, and avoid discussing many important issues,&#148; said Farah. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Open Debates is working with other civic groups to establish a non-partisan Citizens' Debate Commission comprised of national civic leaders. The Citizens' Debate Commission will sponsor presidential debates that are rigorous, fair, and inclusive of important issues and popular candidates. &quot;We are committed to establishing presidential debates that encourage authentic debate,&quot; said Open Debates' Organizing Director Chris Shaw. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Open Debates&#146; board of directors consists of diverse civic leaders, including: John B. Anderson, former Republican Congressman; Angela &quot;Bay&quot; Buchanan, president of The American Cause; Randall Robinson, founder of TransAfrica Forum; Larry Noble, Executive Director of the Center for Responsive Politics; Jon Hanson, Harvard Law Professor; Pat Choate, former Reform Party vice-presidential candidate; Paul Weyrich, founder of the Heritage Foundation; and Professor Jamin Raskin, author of Overruling Democracy. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Open Debates&#146; Executive Director George Farah is the author of 'No Debate', a book exposing the flaws of the presidential debate process that will be released this winter by Seven Stories Press. </FONT></P><P></P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p></font><!-- #EndEditable --></td></tr>
