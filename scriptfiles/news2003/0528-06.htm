<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - May 28 -  The Sierra Club today condemned the Bush Administration for seriously jeopardizing the fate of endangered species with an announcement anticipated tomorrow that designation of critical habitat for America's endangered species has no value and should be avoided. The expected announcement from the Administration contradicts the best available science, including the most recent data from the Fish and Wildlife Service, and puts endangered species at risk.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Bush Administration's decision is not based on science and places America's heritage of bountiful wildlife at risk,&quot; said Carl Pope, Executive Director of the Sierra Club. &quot;The evidence shows that critical habitat works to protect at-risk fish and wildlife by conserving the places they need to survive and recover.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Designation of critical habitat is required under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and is defined as areas to be protected to allow for endangered species' survival and recovery.  Critical habitat designations often include areas where a species is currently found and areas necessary to support an increased population that would mark its recovery. By limiting the designation of critical habitat, the Bush Administration will make it easier to obtain federal approval for commercial logging on national forests, commercial developments, livestock ranching operations, pollution discharges and other activities that threaten America's communities and natural heritage.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A 1995 report by the National Academy of Sciences on the ESA concluded that habitat conservation &quot;is absolutely crucial to species survival&quot; and is an &quot;essential component of any program to protect endangered species.&quot; According to the Fish and Wildlife Service's most recent report to Congress, species with critical habitat are 13 percent more likely to have stable populations and 11 percent more likely to be heading towards

recovery, than species with no designated critical habitat.   For

example,

since having their critical habitat designated for the peninsular bighorn sheep, land managers with the U.S. Forest Service and BLM have been able to improve resource management on public lands, causing the bighorn numbers to increase by 49 percent.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This week's announcement continues the Bush Administration's track record of seeking to undermine successful fish and wildlife management efforts, particularly those benefiting threatened and endangered species. The Bush Administration has reduced the size of critical habitat designations by 51 percent over the past 3 years.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;When the Bush Administration fails to follow the laws protecting endangered species, citizens are left with no choice but to take their case to court,&quot; said Pope.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Most recently, the administration has sought to have Congress change the ESA to prevent the designation of critical habitat on 25 million acres of public land administered by the Pentagon. The administration has additionally stopped grizzly bear reintroduction efforts and approved mining operations that could wipe out some grizzly bear populations. While recognizing that orcas in Puget Sound were distinct from other orcas in the Pacific and that the Puget Sound orca is heading towards extinction Bush Administration officials declared that the extinction of the species would not be &quot;significant&quot; and refused to conserve it under the ESA.</font></p>
