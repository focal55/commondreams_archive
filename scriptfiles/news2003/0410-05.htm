                YORK - April 10 - An early look at 2003 trends in benefits and 

                premiums in Medicare+Choice plans reveals that more enrollees 

                are experiencing limits on benefits such as prescription drug 

                coverage and are facing rising average monthly premiums and increased 

                cost-sharing for their health care, according to a new report 

                from The Commonwealth Fund. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Medicare+Choice 

                Plans Continue to Shift More Costs to Enrollees, Lori Achman and 

                Marsha Gold of Mathematica Policy Research, Inc., analyze trends 

                in premiums and benefits from 1999 to 2003. Approximately 4.5 

                million elderly and disabled beneficiaries are currently enrolled 

                in Medicare managed care plans. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Achman and 

                Gold find that monthly premiums for enrollees in Medicare+Choice 

                average $37, up from $32 in 2002, and $23 in 2001. The percent 

                of enrollees with drug coverage is slightly down to 68 percent 

                from 72 percent in 2002. A larger percentage of plans provide 

                coverage for generics only, and have annual caps on drug coverage 

                of $500 or less. A higher percentage of enrollees are also facing 

                inpatient hospital copayments and copayments for physician visits. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Benefits are 

                continuing to erode, although some of the changes are less dramatic 

                and harder to detect than in previous years," said Marsha Gold, 

                senior fellow at Mathematica. "The details of the limits are more 

                complicated, placing greater burden on beneficiaries to research 

                which plan better meets their health care needs, and putting them 

                at risk for high unexpected out-of-pocket costs." </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Key findings 

                include: </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Beneficiary 

                premiums are rising. Monthly premiums increased again in 2003, 

                to an average $37 from $32 in 2002. The percent of enrollees with 

                a zero premium plan is 38 percent in 2003, the first time since 

                Mathematica has tracked premiums that the percent of enrollees 

                in a zero premium plan is smaller that the percent of enrollees 

                in a plan with a premium of $50 or more per month. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Prescription 

                drug coverage is becoming more restrictive. The percent of enrollees 

                with prescription drug coverage dropped slightly, to 69 percent 

                in 2003 from 72 percent in 2002, and more plans are limiting coverage 

                to generics only. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- More plans 

                are charging hospital inpatient copayments. The percent of enrollees 

                in plans with inpatient hospital copayments increased in 2003 

                to 82 percent. This comes on top of a substantial increase in 

                2002. However, the percent of enrollees in plans with cost-sharing 

                for hospital outpatient procedures decreased, from 70 percent 

                in 2002 to 54 percent in 2003. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Copayments 

                for physician visits are increasing. In 2003, 24 percent of enrollees 

                are in plans with a primary care physician copayment greater than 

                $15, compared to 4 percent in 2002. Sixty-three percent of enrollees 

                are in plans with a specialist copayment greater than $15 compared 

                with 41 percent in 2002. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The increasing 

                number of Medicare Plus Choice plans requiring co-payments for 

                hospital care, lab tests, or x-rays, and stricter limits on drug 

                coverage is disturbing, particularly as it is the sicker and more 

                vulnerable enrollees who bear much of the burden of these changes," 

                said Karen Davis, president of The Commonwealth Fund. "These trends 

                only reinforce the importance of reforming Medicare now to cover 

                pharmaceuticals and limit out of pocket cost sharing for all beneficiaries."
