- May 15 - The American 

Counseling Association (ACA) today expressed concern regarding the 

continuing gap in educational opportunities between children and 

youth attending low-income and wealthy school districts. On May 

17th, 1954, the Supreme Court issued a unanimous decision in Brown 

v. Board of Education declaring it a violation of the 14th 

Amendment of the Constitution to separate children in public 

schools for no other reason than race.

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although schools are no longer "separate" in terms of race, they 

remain blatantly and shamefully unequal in terms of support. 

Examples abound. In Pennsylvania, an average of $6,000 is spent on 

each inner-city Philadelphia student - in teacher salaries, 

computers, texts and other supplies - compared to $16,000 for each 

student just a few miles away in Bucks County. At Santa Ana High 

School in Orange County, California, the ratio of students to 

guidance counselors is more than 700 to 1. In 1999, only 19 

percent of the school's graduates fulfilled the requirements to get 

into a four-year state college, compared with 39 percent 

countywide. Just as the gap between higher income and low income 

Americans is widening, so is the gap between the educational 

opportunities available to our children. This gap must be 

addressed if we want our children and youth to reach their 

potential, and if we are to truly create a society in which 

everyone has a chance to succeed.

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On the occasion of the 49th anniversary of Brown v. Board of 

Education, ACA is encouraging Congress and the President to take up 

and pass the "Student Bill of Rights Act", H.R. 236, introduced by 

Rep. Chaka Fattah (D-PA). Representative Fattah's legislation 

would hold states accountable-at the risk of loss of federal 

education dollars-for providing adequate access to elementary and 

secondary students to seven essential elements for learning, 

including access to instruction from highly-qualified teachers in 

small class sizes, and access to the services of professional 

school counselors. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"All students, not just those born to the right parents and 

living in the right school districts, deserve a quality education," 

stated Richard Yep, Executive Director of ACA. "Part of this 

includes having access to a professional school counselor, and we 

commend Representative Fattah for both his leadership in shining a 

light on the disparity between schools within our education system 

and for his recognition of the importance of school counseling 

services." Yep stated that ACA intends to continue working with 

Representative Fattah in an effort to gain passage of H.R. 236 

before the 50th anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education.
