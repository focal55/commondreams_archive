- May 23 - The East Timor Action Network (ETAN) and the Indonesia Human 

Rights Network (IHRN) today praised the Senate Foreign Relations Committee 

for reinstating a ban on military training for Indonesia.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Yesterday, the committee unanimously agreed to an amendment restricting 

International Military Education and Training (IMET) for Indonesia until



President Bush certifies that Indonesia is "taking effective measures" to 

fully investigate and criminally prosecute those responsible for the attack 

on U.S. citizens, including the murder of two, in West Papua, Indonesia, in 

August 2002. Indonesian police and NGO investigations have implicated the 

Indonesian military (TNI) in the attack.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The Senate Foreign Relations Committee has sent the Indonesian government 

and military a strong bipartisan message that the TNI cannot get away with 

murder. Indonesian authorities must understand that this is no longer 

business as usual," said Kurt Biddle of IHRN.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Senator Russell Feingold (D-WI) proposed the amendment to the Foreign 

Assistance Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004 with support from 

committee chair Richard Lugar (R-IN) and ranking member Joseph Biden (D-DE).

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The amendment reflects a growing disgust with the failure of Indonesia to 

meet a wide range of conditions placed on military assistance by Congress 

in recent years," said Karen Orenstein, Washington Coordinator of ETAN. 

"Never before has the Indonesian military displayed such boldness in 

attacking U.S. citizens as it did in 2002. It is not difficult to imagine 

how the TNI treats Indonesian citizens."

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The Bush administration has pushed for resumption of military ties with



Indonesia in the name of fighting the 'War on Terror,'" said Biddle. 

"Currently, it is the Indonesian military terrorizing the people of Aceh."

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The committee action comes as Indonesia continues a massive military 

offensive on Aceh in northern Sumatra. The assault, the TNI's largest 

operation since the invasion of East Timor in 1975, ended an 

internationally-supported ceasefire with the imposition of martial law 

earlier this week. Gross human rights violations, already pervasive in 

Aceh, have increased in recent days, including a major military crackdown 

on civil society.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The TNI is using U.S.-supplied weapons in this offensive, including OV-10 

Bronco counterinsurgency aircraft (to rocket villages) and C-130 Hercules 

transport planes (to drop paratroopers). TNI leadership has ordered troops 

to "exterminate" the rebels within six months. TNI is reportedly using 

civilians as human shields in their search for rebels, which fits into a



pattern of illegal Indonesian military practices in formerly-occupied East 

Timor.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The failure to hold the TNI accountable for its abuses continues. An 

Indonesian court today acquitted General Tono Suratman of crimes against



humanity committed in East Timor in 1999," said Orenstein. Suratman, the



former military commander for East Timor, was the twelfth Indonesian and



highest-ranking military personnel acquitted by the widely-criticized 

Indonesian court.
