- May 22 - Pre-emptive war is a response to ongoing or

imminent attacks. Since Iraq neither attacked the United States nor had the

capabilities to attack the United States, the war with Iraq was not a pre-emptive

attack. The war with Iraq was optional, elective and not in legitimate defense

of our country. As this is the case, it represents a criminal misuse of the

Armed Forces of the United States. The Bush Doctrine of pre-emptive war may be

more clearly thought of as the Bush Doctrine of Preventive War. The United

States by virtue of its superior might claims the right to attack any country that

may be a potential challenge to it. The Bush Administration asserts that the

United States of America may attack any nation or entity that it claims may

someday represent a threat to the United States. Veterans For Peace recognizes

both its moral obligation and legal responsibilities to openly speak out

against such egregious violations of law and to unequivocally oppose the Bush

Doctrine of Preventive War, a doctrine of criminal violence and aggression against

the world community.</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On February 13, 2003 and March 19, 2003, respectively, Veterans For Peace

notified the top 15 generals and admirals in the United States Armed Forces and

the United States House of Representatives and Senate of the illegality of this

war.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We believe the war against Iraq that the United States government is

planning and preparing for is in violation of the Charter of the United Nations and

customary international law. The judgment of the International Military

Tribunal at Nuremberg noted, "Resort to war of aggression is not merely illegal, but

is criminal.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The principle of renunciation of the use or threat of force is now one of

the fundamental principles of international law and, as such, is stated with the

utmost clarity in Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter, which imposes

definite obligations on states participating in international affairs. States

are bound in their international relations to renounce "the threat or use of

force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state,

or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The United States seeks to justify a pre-emptive strike on Iraq on the basis

of self-defense. Article 51 of the United Nations Charter permits the use of

force by a state to repel an armed attack or a substantial and immediate

threat to the national security of the state until the Security Council exercises

jurisdiction. A threat which permits the use of force must be an immediate,

specific threat to United States national security and not a general threat to

the Gulf region or a possible future threat. The legality of pre-emptive

self-defense has been rejected on the basis that use of force to deter future use of

force constitutes punitive rather than defensive action. Because the United

States has failed to gain Security Council approval for war, the United States

is bound by United Nations Article 51 and may not lawfully, unilaterally take

military action.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"It is clear that the current massive attack on Iraq is not based upon

self-defense. Iraq has not attacked the United States nor does Iraq constitute an

immediate and specific threat to United States national security."

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As the Bush Administration clearly chose to violate both Constitutional and

International law, Veterans for Peace, having sworn once to uphold the

Constitution of the United States, hereby calls for the immediate impeachment of

George W. Bush, Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld for their recent commission of high

crimes against peace in Iraq and the violation of the US Constitution.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Therefore be it resolved that:

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In keeping with our Statement of Purpose, "to abolish war as an instrument of

foreign/international policy" and "to restrain our government from

intervening, overtly and covertly, in the internal affairs of other nations", Veterans

For Peace, Inc. has found compelling arguments and evidence to support articles

of Impeachment for President George W. Bush, Vice President Richard B.

Cheney, Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld and Attorney General John David

Ashcroft.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To accomplish these objectives Veterans For Peace National will seek to find

responsible representatives within the United States, who have full legal

standing and the integrity bestowed upon them by both their office and their

personal record of conduct, be fully capable of successfully completing such an

undertaking. The Board will determine when and to whom Veterans For Peace will

lend support to for the impeachment process.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the interim Veterans For Peace is resolved to continue its educational

program to inform and educate the American public and its representatives within

the United States government of the real and criminal violations of this

government. Therefore be it resolved that Veterans For Peace is officially and

fully resolved to work for the restoration and implementation of Constitutional

law and as provided for by constitutional law the impeachment of President

George W. Bush and the named members of his administration.
