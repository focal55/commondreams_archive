                - March 6 - "Greens fully support U.S. troops -- we demand that 

                they be removed from harm's way," said Beth Ingalls, member of 

                the Truckee, California, Town Council. "One of the reasons for 

                our opposition to President Bush's planned invasion of Iraq is 

                the heavy casualty rate expected, not just among Iraqi civilians, 

                but among American soldiers and their families." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greens warn 

                that a ground invasion of Iraq may meet massive resistance, costing 

                the lives of many American service members. American casualties 

                in the invasion will also come from friendly fire and from depleted 

                uranium shell casings that were used in the first Persian Gulf 

                War. The U.S. intends to use depleted uranium again in the coming 

                invasion. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The U.S. dumped 

                320 tons of depleted uranium in spent ammunition on Iraq during 

                the last Gulf War," said T.E. Smith, Vietnam War veteran and member 

                of the D.C. Statehood Green Party. "This is the battlefield into 

                which American soldiers will be sent." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Exposure to 

                radiation from depleted uranium is the likely cause of numerous 

                health problems in thousands of Gulf War veterans and their families, 

                including cancer, leukemia, tumors, and high rates of birth defects 

                because of genetic damage. 221,000 U.S. soldiers who fought in 

                the war or were stationed in war zones after the war have been 

                awarded disability, according to a Veterans Affairs report issued 

                on September 10, 2002. The casualty rate for the first Persian 

                Gulf War veterans is about 30%. </font>

                (CBS) has reported complaints from American service members that 

                safety from exposure to nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons 

                has been inadequate and low-priority. The Independent (U.K.) reports 

                that U.S. itself will use toxic chemical weapons in the invasion 

                of Iraq, in violation of the 1992 Chemical Weapons Convention. 

                "'Calmative' gases, similar to the one that killed 120 hostages 

                in the Moscow theatre siege last year, could also be employed. 

                The convention bans the use of these toxic agents in battle, not 

                least because they risk causing an escalation to full chemical 

                warfare.... Leading experts and Whitehall officials fear that 

                using even pepper spray and CS gas would destroy the credibility 

                of the Chemical Weapons Convention, provoke Iraqi chemical retaliation 

                and set a disastrous legal precedent." (The Independent, March 

                2, 2003) </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The members 

                of the Bush Administration, some 30 of whom have direct financial 

                relations with the defense industry, have so much to gain from 

                the war that they're willing to invade regardless of the danger 

                it poses to American soldiers," said Tom Bolema, Juniper Hills 

                (California) Town Councilperson. "They're about to launch this 

                war regardless of the likely high number of Iraqi civilian casualties, 

                regardless of the condemnation of nations and people around the 

                world and in the U.S., regardless of pleas from the U.N. inspectors 

                to let the inspections continue, regardless of Iraq's destruction 

                of its own missiles." </font>
