                - February 27 - More than 350 student delegates and supporters 

                from 100 different campus antiwar and peace groups gathered at 

                Loyola University in Chicago to hold the first national conference 

                of the Campus Antiwar Network (CAN) on February 21-23. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The conference 

                felt like history in the making as students collaborated in forging 

                a democratic, grassroots, student-led network dedicated to opposing 

                the impending war on Iraq. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">United around 

                opposition to war on Iraq-whether sanctioned by the United Nations 

                or not-the students from elite universities, community colleges 

                and high schools across the country pledged to ignite a firestorm 

                of non violent protest and opposition to U.S. war preparations 

                in the coming weeks. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Plans were 

                laid for a nationwide day of campus protest and-on some campuses-student 

                strikes on March 5, student walk-outs and mass demonstrations 

                if war begins, and a national mobilization of students and all 

                others opposed to war on April 5. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We reject 

                the idea that our peers will be sent to kill and die for an unjust 

                and immoral war on the people of Iraq. We are the real future 

                of this country and the future of empire and unending war that 

                Bush envisions is not what we want," said Chris Roche, a high 

                school senior from Chicago. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While the bulk 

                of the weekend was dedicated to making, discussing and voting 

                on proposals, organizers also wedged in a great opening session 

                with Norman Solomon, media critic and author of the new book "Target

                the News Media Didn't Tell You;" Tomomi Nakamura, a student from 

                Kokugakuin University in Tokyo and a leader of the Japanese student 

                antiwar movement; Jacob Park of the Center for Economic and Social 

                Rights, and Charlie Jenks and Sunny Miller of the Traprock Peace 

                Center. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There were 

                also 11 workshops taking up everything from "The impact of Bush's 

                war on the Middle East" with Middle East expert Rashid Khalidi 

                to "Media strategies for the antiwar movement," "Israel and Palestine," 

                "An Introduction to Non-Violent Civil Disobedience" and "After 

                Iraq, Where is Bush headed next?" </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"I think everyone 

                was very encouraged by our accomplishments this weekend," said 

                Kathleen Brown, a delegate from the University of Vermont, who 

                was elected to CAN's national coordinating committee along with 

                11 other students. "People wanted to work through things constructively 

                and get to the basics of organizing actions. Last year in building 

                the movement against U.S. war in Afghanistan, the movement was 

                much more embattled. But now there's a great upswing coming out 

                of the huge national demonstrations in San Francisco, New York 

                City and around the world." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CAN adopted 

                a unique structure, ensuring that it is student owned and operated. 

                1) CAN will remain independent and is not affiliated with any 

                other organization though it pledges to work with all forces in 

                the antiwar movement : 2) It is democratic so that each member 

                campus can elect delegates through their local anti-war student 

                coalitions and each affiliated campus group has an equal voice 

                within CAN: and 3) CAN accepts affiliation from every campus or 

                school antiwar organization and respects the right of its member 

                committees to organize independent antiwar actions locally. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CAN adopted 

                four points of unity: No war on Iraq, whether backed by the U.S. 

                or the United Nations (UN); End the UN sanctions which have killed 

                more than 1 million Iraqis; Oppose the attacks on civil liberties 

                and racist scapegoating at home; Money for jobs, education, and 

                healthcare-not war. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CAN also decided 

                to call for an April 5 national mobilization in a few major cities 

                following on the heels of the student-labor week of action already 

                being organized from March 31 to April 4. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CAN hopes that 

                this event will mark a major contribution to the national antiwar 

                movement by forging collaboration between existing national antiwar 

                formations such as United for Peace and Justice, International 

                ANSWER, Not in Our Name, and U.S. Labor Against War and all other 

                antiwar and peace organizations. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CAN is launching 

                a website at which students from around the country can post their 

                antiwar actions and connect with other students from around the 

                country, projected to launch later this week. Plans for a newsletter, 

                regional antiwar conferences, international student networking 

                and teleconference meetings with students in Baghdad are also 

                being laid. </font>
