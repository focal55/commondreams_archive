- July 23 -  

As Congress considers legislation that would roll back environmental protections at hydropower dams by adding new procedures unavailable to the public that would add up to three years to the licensing process, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) released new rules that increase public participation, enhance regulatory efficiency, and reduce the time necessary to license projects.  </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">American Rivers and the Hydropower Reform Coalition, representing conservation and recreation groups from 36 states, today offered initial support for the change in FERC rules and called on Senators to amend the energy bill to reduce red tape, allow all stakeholders an equal opportunity, and maintain environmental standards.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;While we have not yet read the new rule in detail, the basic outline is exactly what the licensing process needs - greater public participation, less red tape, and more timely decision-making,&quot; said Andrew Fahlund, Senior Program Director with American Rivers.  &quot;We only hope that the Senate can take a lesson from FERC and stick to these goals.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">FERC issues and oversees operating licenses for approximately 2,500 hydropower dams across the country.  Licenses last 30 to 50 years, and upon expiration a dam owner must apply to FERC for a new license. This licensing process requires consideration of ecological health, water quality, and recreation in order to bring dams up to modern environmental standards.  Since 1993, FERC has licensed more than 200 hydropower dams throughout the nation, denying only one and resulting in an average loss of electricity of only 1.6% per project.  Over the next decade, the licenses for more than 400 dams affecting 130 different rivers will expire, representing only 2% of the natio's energy mix.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">FERC's new rule establishes an 'Integrated Licensing Process' that brings together licensing participants early in the process and establishes means for resolving disputes early.  It strives to gather and analyze information necessary for evaluating the impacts of hydropower dams earlier in the process, resulting in timelier and better-informed decisions.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Senate energy bill focuses strictly on the role of federal agencies that are responsible for setting requirements for fish passage and protection of public lands.  Specifically, the bill creates six new processes making them available only to dam owners.  One such process establishes a 'trial type hearing on the record.'  Based on similar processes at the Department of the Interior, such hearings take 36 months to complete, on average.  The legislation also changes the environmental standard for fish passage requirements to allow dam owners to substitute fish farms or trust funds in lieu of safe and effective fish passage around dams.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Senate should ensure that any changes to the licensing process are applied fairly to all those interested in the management of our public rivers,&quot; added Rebecca Sherman, Coordinator of the Hydropower Reform Coalition.  &quot;FERC's action today stands in sharp contrast to the shameless industry giveaway in the Senate energy bill.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some FERC officials have voiced support for the current Senate energy bill.  &quot;Those FERC officials supporting the current Senate language should stop talking out of both sides of their mouths.  Out of one side they say that they support a faster and more efficient process.  Out of the other they support the Senate energy bill language that would add as many as three years on to the licensing process.  Which is it that they want?&quot; added Fahlund.    </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Environmental groups, sportsmen, Indian tribes, and states have thrown their support behind an amendment being offered by Senators Jeff Bingaman (D-NM) and Daniel Inouye (D-HI).  The amendment would allow any party to a licensing proceeding to offer an alternative environmental condition that cost less but provided no less environmental protection.  The new procedure is designed to fit within the existing timeframes of the licensing process.  The same language last year passed the House in a compromise effort between industry groups and environmentalists however industry groups have since reneged on the deal.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">'Senators Bingaman and Inouye offer a reasonable, consensus based alternative that gives the hydropower industry an important tool without prejudicing other interests of others or diminishing environmental protection,' said Fahlund.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We have an opportunity to leave a legacy of healthy rivers with thriving fish and wildlife for our children and grandchildren,&quot; added Steve Moyer of Trout Unlimited. &quot;But the current energy bill would throw into question our ability to protect and restore salmon and other fish species. When my grandchildren ask where the salmon went, Senators supporting the current Senate language may have to answer.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">More than 25 state attorneys general, fish and wildlife agencies, and governors have written to Senators raising concerns about the current energy bill and voicing support for the Bingaman-Inouye amendment.  American Indian Tribes are appealing to Senators to protect their ability to manage their treaty lands and resources affected by hydropower dams. </font></p>
