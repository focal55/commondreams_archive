                YORK - April 17 - The Bush administration's first formal response 

                to allegations of torture and other mistreatment of detainees 

                in Afghanistan risks legitimizing practices that are legally prohibited, 

                Human Rights Watch said today. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The administration 

                replied in writing last week to a letter from Human Rights Watch 

                calling on President Bush to investigate and condemn allegations 

                of torture and other cruel and inhuman treatment that emerged 

                in press reports last December. According to unnamed U.S. officials 

                quoted in those reports, the United States has subjected detainees 

                at Bagram Air Force base in Afghanistan to sleep deprivation, 

                holding them in awkward, painful positions, and other "stress 

                and duress" techniques of interrogation. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In its response 

                to Human Rights Watch, signed by Department of Defense General 

                Counsel William J. Haynes II, the administration states "United 

                States policy condemns torture." But it does not acknowledge that 

                the United States has a legal obligation to refrain from cruel, 

                inhuman or degrading treatment. The letter also fails to address 

                whether the United States is using the specific "stress and duress" 

                techniques that have been widely reported over the past several 

                months. Earlier statements by White House officials claimed that 

                U.S. interrogators were acting in full compliance with domestic 

                and international law. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The administration's 

                response is totally inadequate," said Kenneth Roth, executive 

                director of Human Rights Watch. "Disavowing torture is welcome. 

                But side-stepping detailed reports of mistreatment invites the 

                conclusion that the reports are true. When combined with its claims 

                that U.S. interrogators are acting lawfully, the Bush administration 

                gives the impression that this kind of mistreatment is legitimate." 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As a party 

                to the UN Convention Against Torture and Other Forms of Cruel, 

                Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the United States 

                has accepted a legal obligation not to engage in torture or other 

                forms of mistreatment. Interrogation techniques do not have to 

                rise to the level of torture to be prohibited if they fall under 

                the category of "cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Methods similar 

                to those the United States is reportedly using have been found 

                to be illegal mistreatment under international law, including 

                in landmark decisions by the Israeli Supreme Court and the European 

                Court of Human Rights. The U.S. Department of State has condemned 

                numerous countries for using similar techniques, such as sleep 

                deprivation and placing prisoners in awkward, painful positions. 

                Its annual human rights reports list these methods as forms of 

                torture or other cruel or inhuman treatment. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The administration 

                is sending a very unfortunate signal to other governments, including 

                potential captors of U.S. soldiers, that such practices are acceptable," 

                Roth added. "The U.S. government needs to unequivocally state 

                that it is not engaging in the same kinds of cruel and inhuman 

                treatment that it rightly condemns abroad." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In ratifying 

                the UN Convention Against Torture, the United States limited its 

                commitment regarding cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment only 

                to conduct that is prohibited by the U.S. Constitution. The Eighth 

                Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which bans cruel and unusual 

                punishment, would clearly prohibit much of what reportedly is 

                being done at Bagram. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The administration's 

                letter does not state whether the U.S. government - either the 

                Department of Defense or the CIA - instructs its officials to 

                refrain from engaging in cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment 

                of detainees. It does not indicate that the specific allegations 

                are being investigated fully, and that anyone found to have engaged 

                in cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment will be prosecuted or 

                otherwise held accountable. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The administration 

                has also inadequately responded to reports that the United States 

                has transferred suspects to the custody of countries that routinely 

                practice torture. Human Rights Watch welcomes Haynes' statement 

                that the U.S. government seeks assurances from foreign governments 

                that they will not torture a detainee before handing him over. 

                But he does not say whether the United States takes any steps 

                to verify that governments are in fact treating rendered suspects 

                humanely, or whether it takes any action if it learns that they 

                are not. In its annual report on human rights practices, the Bush 

                administration documents torture by the countries to which suspects 

                have reportedly been handed over for interrogation, such as Egypt, 

                Morocco, Saudi Arabia and Jordan. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The Bush administration 

                should not just accept assurances from the very same countries 

                whose use of torture the U.S. government itself has documented," 

                said Roth. "It's hardly reassuring to know that the administration 

                is taking Egypt at its word on torture. If the Administration 

                is following up on these cases and taking action to ensure transferred 

                suspects are not tortured, it needs to say so."
