- April 24 - The American Medical Association (AMA) has failed to disclose information 

contradicting its allegation that a "lawsuit crisis" exists in 18 states, 

according to a new study by the Center for Justice &amp; Democracy (CJ&amp;D) 

entitled <I>Where's The Crisis? Has America Been Duped By The AMA?</I> (for a 

full copy, go to <A href="http://centerjd.org" target="_new">http://centerjd.org</A>) 

<P>According to CJ&amp;D Executive Director and study co-author, Joanne 

Doroshow, "When the AMA asserts that a state is in 'crisis,' few raise questions 

even though there may be strong evidence to dispute the notion.&nbsp; In fact, 

the AMA consistently fails to disclose contradictory courtroom and medical data, 

often uncovered by local media outlets, that undermine its PR and lobbying 

campaign for limiting jury awards." 

<P>"Specifically," said Doroshow, "in most AMA 'crisis' states, claims against 

doctors are actually falling or have held steady. Rather than leaving, doctors 

are flooding into many of these states.&nbsp; And in three states - Nevada, 

Mississippi and Ohio - within the past year lawmakers enacted caps on damage 

awards for patients.&nbsp; Yet in each case, doctors are still struggling to 

find affordable insurance.&nbsp; Clearly, if doctors are being price-gouged by 

insurers in any of these 18 states, the cause and solutions lie with the 

insurance industry, not the legal system," said Doroshow. 

<P>According to study co-author Emily Gottlieb, CJ&amp;D Deputy Director, "The 

following states have been identified as 'liability crisis' states by the AMA in 

the group's push for a cap of $250,000 on non-economic damages.&nbsp; Yet a 

simple analysis of local reports, which have examined local courtroom and 

medical data, says differently."&nbsp; CJ&amp;D's study finds the following: 

&nbsp; 

<UL>

  <LI>Arkansas: No evidence damage awards are rising (because no entity compiles 

  these records) 

  <LI>Connecticut: Little change in number of lawsuit filings for a decade; 

  numbers of neurosurgeons and OB/GYNs increasing 

  <LI>Florida: Jury awards have dropped as state has grown; number of claims and 

  payouts steadily falling 

  <LI>Georgia: Number of claims paid is down 25 percent; doctors win 85 percent 

  of time 

  <LI>Illinois: Number of claims steady throughout the 1990s; 76 percent 

  dismissed without payment 

  <LI>Kentucky: Doctors per capita increasing faster than the nation 

  <LI>Mississippi: State gaining doctors; only four states grew faster in 

  physician population; cap passed in 2002 but doctors still can't find 

  affordable insurance 

  <LI>Missouri: Number of claims fell 29 percent since 1987 

  <LI>New Jersey: Lawsuits down 16 percent since 1997; less than 10 percent of 

  doctors experiencing large rate increase 

  <LI>Nevada: Number of doctors increased 41 percent since 1992; cap passed in 

  2002 but insurers haven't reduced premiums 

  <LI>New York: Number one in nation for per capital surgical specialists: 

  number three for OB/GYNs; largest insurer denied rate hike 

  <LI>North Carolina: Number of doctors up 41 percent since 1992 

  <LI>Ohio: Number of case filings equal to 1995; juries ruled for patients less 

  than half as often as in 1995; cap passed in 2003 but insurers haven't reduced 

  premiums 

  <LI>Oregon: Cases against doctors decreased from 2000 to 2001 

  <LI>Pennsylvania: Jury awards are dropping; million-dollar awards down for 

  second straight year 

  <LI>Texas: Claims falling since 1999 

  <LI>Washington: Little change in lawsuits filed; number of million-dollar 

  awards same as in 1999 

  <LI>West Virginia: Claims down since 1993; amount paid to settle claims 

  constant since 1993 </LI></UL>
