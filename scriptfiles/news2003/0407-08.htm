                YORK - April 7 - Domini Social Investments LLC today announced 

                that it has filed an amicus brief with the U.S. Supreme Court 

                that supports San Francisco activist Marc Kasky in his effort 

                to hold Nike accountable for its statements concerning the company's 

                use of sweatshop labor. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kasky argues 

                that Nike's statements should be considered "commercial speech" 

                akin to advertising, and therefore subject to California's consumer 

                protection statutes, while Nike maintains that they are "noncommercial" 

                or "political speech" because they touch on matters of public 

                concern, and therefore benefit from stricter protection under 

                the First Amendment. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In its own 

                brief, however, Nike concedes that "virtually everything a company 

                does is ultimately intended to improve its financial bottom line" 

                (emphasis in original, Nike's brief p. 22). Nike has also conceded 

                that allegations about sweatshop practices contributed to its 

                disappointing financial performance in 1997 and 1998. "Both of 

                these concessions are important, and in our view, demonstrate 

                that these types of statements should rightly be considered commercial 

                speech," said Adam Kanzer, General Counsel and Director of Shareholder 

                Advocacy for Domini Social Investments. "These statements were 

                not made during a debate about political philosophy - they were 

                made by a company defending its reputation and its bottom line." 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Domini believes 

                that Nike v. Kasky is a critical case for all investment firms 

                that practice socially responsible investing (SRI). Domini Social 

                Investments is the manager of the Domini Social Equity Fund (NASDQ: 

                DSEFX), the nation's oldest and largest socially and environmentally 

                screened index fund. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The SRI community 

                depends upon the accurate flow of corporate social and environmental 

                performance data," said Mr. Kanzer. "All investors depend on government 

                regulators to ensure that information from corporations is provided 

                on a timely and accurate basis. If any of this information is 

                deemed to be 'political speech,' it will severely undercut these 

                regulatory efforts. Nike's definition of political speech -- any 

                commercial speech that also touches upon matters of public concern 

                -- is alarmingly broad, potentially affecting nearly every aspect 

                of a corporation's business, from treatment of stock options to 

                compliance with environmental regulations. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It is important 

                to note that this case has no bearing on Nike's actual practices 

                regarding its overseas contractors, or whether its statements 

                were in fact false or misleading," Mr. Kanzer continued. "It addresses 

                only the constitutional question of whether companies like Nike 

                can claim full First Amendment protection for public statements 

                regarding their own business practices that also touch upon matters 

                of public concern." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The principal 

                author of Domini's amicus curiae or "friend of the court" brief 

                is Cynthia A. Williams, Associate Professor of Law at the University 

                of Illinois College of Law. The brief is co-authored by Michael 

                R. Siebecker, Adjunct Assistant Professor at Hunter College. KLD 

                Research & Analytics, Domini's social research provider, and Harrington 

                Investments, a Northern California-based social investment firm, 

                also signed onto the brief. James Pfander, Prentice R. Marshall 

                Professor of Law at the University of Illinois College of Law, 

                was counsel of record. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Domini's involvement 

                in Nike v. Kasky follows its successful campaign for new rules 

                by the Securities and Exchange Commission requiring mutual funds 

                and investment advisers to disclose their proxy voting policies 

                and voting records. This is the first brief Domini has filed with 

                the Supreme Court. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Professor Williams 

                said, "Our brief asks the Court to recognize as a legal principle 

                that we ought to treat companies' statements about social and 

                environmental facts precisely as we treat their statements of 

                financial facts. These factors are critical to investors and consumers, 

                but they are only valuable if they are true. A broad ruling in 

                Nike's favor would seriously undermine the SEC and other regulators' 

                abilities to ensure that these statements are accurate and not 

                misleading." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According to 

                John Harrington, president and CEO of Harrington Investments, 

                "Corporations, certainly including Nike, spend hundreds of millions 

                of dollars on advertising and public relations to sell their products 

                and establish their trade name, logo or brand. A corporation's 

                statements about its own business practices are clearly commercial 

                speech and should never be confused with the freedom of speech 

                guaranteed to individuals by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. 

                Corporations have a duty to speak in a way that is accurate and 

                not misleading, and they should not be given free rein to use 

                the First Amendment to evade that duty." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Domini's Argument 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Domini argues 

                that granting full First Amendment protection to corporate speech 

                would undercut disclosure and reporting requirements imposed by 

                the Securities and Exchange Commission, and would make it easier 

                for companies to sidestep antifraud regulations. Domini's brief 

                maintains that a ruling in favor of Nike could have serious implications 

                "at a time when restoring investor confidence in the markets is 

                crucial." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Domini also 

                argues that Nike's position would threaten investors' ability 

                to obtain information from corporations on issues of public concern, 

                such as information about use of child labor, toxic releases, 

                or expensing stock options. Because the U.S. Supreme Court has 

                struck down laws compelling political speech, corporations could 

                claim that compelled disclosure of noncommercial information is 

                unconstitutional. This may also threaten shareholders' ability 

                to file shareholder resolutions on social, environmental or corporate 

                governance matters (because the SEC might not have the authority 

                to compel corporations to include such "political" speech in their 

                proxy statements). Domini, Harrington, and many other socially 

                responsible investors regularly file such resolutions each year. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Supporters 

                of Nike's position have argued that to regard corporations' statements 

                on their environmental and social performance as commercial speech 

                would have a chilling effect on their willingness to disclose 

                such information. Nike itself has refused to release its most 

                recent report on corporate social responsibility. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Domini, however, 

                maintains that companies like Nike will continue to discuss their 

                practices because it is in their interests to do so. This information 

                is demanded by consumers, federal regulators, nonprofit organizations, 

                some national governments, and by socially responsible investors 

                and research organizations. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Nike has argued 

                that it has a right to defend itself when its labor practices 

                are attacked. In its brief, Domini argued "of course Nike or any 

                other company must be able to respond to criticisms of their labor 

                policies by providing facts about those policies ....Yet that 

                reassurance needs to be based on truthful, accurate and non-misleading 

                information. Nike or any other company should not be able to 'plead 

                the First' so that the truth of the facts they assert about their 

                social and environmental records cannot be tested in litigation 

                -- just as they would not be able to plead the First to preclude 

                an examination of their statements of fact about their financial 

                results of operation or about product quality, price or safety." 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Domini pointed 

                out that Nike's position could have implications for financial 

                statements as well: "Indeed, given recent events, that financial 

                statements are accurate is itself a matter of public concern, 

                suggesting that on Nike's theory even statements of fact about 

                a company's financial results would not be commercial speech."

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Background 

                of the Case </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Nike, along 

                with other corporations, was criticized in the late 1990s for 

                using sweatshop factories in Asia to manufacture its running shoes 

                and other products. In 1998, California consumer Marc Kasky sued 

                Nike under California statutes prohibiting false and misleading 

                advertising. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kasky challenged 

                statements Nike had made to newspaper editors, university professors, 

                and investors, such as that the company paid "on average, double 

                the minimum wage as defined in countries where its products are 

                produced" and that its workers "are protected from physical and 

                sexual abuse." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">California 

                state law allows anyone to sue a company for "false advertising" 

                in statements that are deemed to be "commercial speech." Commercial 

                speech receives a far lower level of protection under the First 

                Amendment than political speech. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">California 

                state and appellate courts agreed with Nike that its statements 

                were protected as noncommercial speech. The California Supreme 

                Court, however, ruled in Kasky's favor, holding that Nike's statements 

                are "commercial speech for the purposes of applying state laws 

                barring false and misleading commercial messages." Nike then appealed 

                the case to the U.S. Supreme Court. The Court is scheduled to 

                hear oral arguments on April 23. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 1997 Nike 

                became the first of two companies to be removed from the Domini 

                400 Social Index(SM) because of concerns over its international 

                labor standards. (Wal-Mart was dropped for the same reason in 

                2001.) The Index is maintained by KLD. The Domini Social Equity 

                Fund is a fully replicating index fund based on the Index.
