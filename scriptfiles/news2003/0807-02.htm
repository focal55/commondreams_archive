<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MANCHESTER, NH - August 7 -  Questioned at a campaign event last night

by members of Granite Staters for Medical Marijuana, Democratic

presidential candidate U.S. Sen. John Kerry (D-MA) retreated from his

previous support of medical marijuana.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During the Manchester forum, broadcast live on C-SPAN, GSMM member

Linda Macia, who suffers from several debilitating illnesses for which

conventional medications have not provided relief, thanked Kerry for

his July 2 statement of support, provoking audience applause. She then

asked Kerry about the Drug Enforcement Administration's raids on

patients using medical marijuana under California law.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;On the day you take office, will you stop the DEA raids?&quot; Macia

asked. Kerry then offered to &quot;clarify&quot; his earlier remarks, saying, &quot;My

personal disposition is open to the issue of medical marijuana. I

believe there is a study underway analyzing what the science is. I

want to get that scientific review,&quot; before making any decisions. He

said he would &quot;put a moratorium on the raids&quot; pending this review but

would not commit to any long-term action to protect patients from

arrest.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is unclear what &quot;review&quot; Kerry meant. An exhaustive review of

medical marijuana data was released by the Institute of Medicine in

1999 and reported that some seriously ill patients might benefit from

marijuana. No similar study is known to be underway at present.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At the conclusion of the forum -- again captured by C-SPAN's

cameras -- GSMM Campaign Coordinator Aaron Houston asked Kerry what

study he was referring to, and Kerry replied, &quot;I am trying to find

out. I don't know.&quot; Despite this, he again refused to pledge a

permanent end to arrests of patients &quot;until that analysis is done.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Macia said she was &quot;disappointed&quot; by the senator's answer. &quot;It's

not what I was expecting.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Houston commented, &quot;Kerry blasted Bush for running a `say one

thing, do another administration,' but now Kerry is running a `say one

thing, say another campaign.' I was embarrassed for the senator last

night. He seemed so afraid to take a clear stand that he hid behind a

study he knows nothing about -- and which may not even exist. We don'tneed another study to know that it's wrong to put cancer and MS

patients in jail for trying to relieve their pain.&quot;</font></p>
