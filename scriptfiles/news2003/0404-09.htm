                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON 

                  - April 4 - Today&#146;s report that the economy lost another 

                  108,000 jobs in March is more dismal evidence that current economic 

                  policies are failing to create good jobs that pay well and support 

                  families. On average, America has lost a stunning 105,000 private 

                  sector jobs every month since the President George W. Bush&#146;s 

                  inauguration. Neither the war in Iraq nor the 9/11 attacks explain 

                  this disastrous record: the loss of 2.6 million private sector 

                  jobs began before these events and has been steady ever since. 

                  Meanwhile, even as workers struggle to keep the jobs they have, 

                  the administration and Congress have started to give employers 

                  more ways to load up workers with unpaid hours by taking apart 

                  the laws that guarantee overtime pay, thus drying up even more 

                  job opportunities. </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The fact 

                  that the unemployment rate stayed at 5.8 percent in March does 

                  not balance out discouraging truths about looking for work in 

                  America. More than 1 million people simply gave up looking for 

                  work last month, a jump of 200,000 over this time last year. 

                  The number of workers unemployed for six months or longer, 1.7 

                  million, is up nearly half a million more than a year ago. And 

                  the manufacturing sector, one of the hardest hit industries 

                  since President Bush took office, lost another 36,000 jobs.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The growing 

                  crisis for workers in the airline industry, which has lost more 

                  than 150,000 jobs since January 2001, offers a sad example of 

                  how the government has neglected working families. Congress 

                  and President Bush deliberately refused to include assistance 

                  to laid-off airline workers when it passed a corporate bailout 

                  bill at the end of 2001 and the president continues to talk 

                  down how much assistance the government will give, despite massive 

                  layoffs.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The unemployed 

                  in all industries are paying for the recession with their jobs, 

                  health care and retirement savings. They need emergency jobless 

                  benefits extended until jobs are available again and this time 

                  Congress and President Bush cannot leave out the one million 

                  laid-off workers who exhausted their benefits and still can&#146;t 

                  find work.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Two years 

                  ago, Congress passed a massive tax cut that President Bush claimed 

                  would create jobs and turn around the economy. Since then, we 

                  have lost jobs and the economic situation has deteriorated. 

                  Yet the president argues we need more of the same medicine &#150; 

                  more unbalanced and unfair tax cuts for the very rich &#150; 

                  to create good American jobs. President Bush is wrong. Congress 

                  can build a stronger, more secure future for all Americans and 

                  for our children by building schools and roads, investing in 

                  hospitals and job training. Unbalanced tax breaks are destroying 

                  opportunities for the future and will only further wreck families&#146; 

                  economic security.</font></p>
