- December 16 - Today in Washington, D.C. a federal judge reaffirmed the government's responsibility to provide the highest protection in America's national parks.</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Judge Emmett Sullivan blocked a decision by the Bush Administration to continue snowmobile use in Yellowstone National Park. In its own study this year, the Administration concluded that even the latest-technology snowmobiles would cause air and noise pollution and health risks for workers, visitors and wildlife. Tuesday's court ruling requires a phase-out of snowmobiles to begin in Yellowstone. The decision drew immediate praise from a variety of citizens and experts:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><I>&quot;Yellowstone is where our country first said, 'This is what our national parks mean to us.' This ruling reaffirms that fundamental purpose. Our duty is to take care of our national parks as fully as possible so that we pass them in good health to our grandchildren. Had we let that principle slip in Yellowstone to benefit the snowmobile industry, it would have set a terrible precedent in all our national parks.&quot;</I></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">- Denis P. Galvin, Deputy Director of the National Park Service under presidents Reagan, Clinton and during the first year of President George W. Bush's administration.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><I>&quot;Today's decision confirms what Yellowstone was meant to be. This struggle was not against Americans who like their snowmobiles, but rather against the notion that anything goes in the national parks. The courts have reminded us that we have a different, higher standard for our national parks. Our history proves that no one loses when beauty wins. We will find room for snowmobiles, but just as important room without them, which is the enduring greatness of the national parks.&quot;</I></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">- Alfred Runte is the author of National Parks: The American Experience. He has been chronicling America's national parks since 1972.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><I>&quot;I'm a professional guide and photographer and have spent 25 years in Yellowstone. I couldn't be happier with this ruling. Yellowstone is still magnificent today because previous generations didn't exploit it. When they recognized their actions were causing damage, they placed the park back on track to keep it healthy for future generations. Today's ruling does this and I'm thrilled. I'm also pleased as a local citizen and business owner because this ruling is good for our economy. Three million people a year come through our gateway communities to visit Yellowstone for one reason: there's no other place like it in the world. This ruling will clean up Yellowstone's air and restore peace and quiet. In the end, what's good for Yellowstone is good for our economy.</I></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">- Tom Murphy, resident of Livingston, Montana and professional guide and photographer.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><I>&quot;As someone who proudly wore a National Park Service uniform for more than 30 years, I'm overjoyed. This ruling says that as a country we're not giving up on what we started in Yellowstone. Protecting Yellowstone to the best of our ability was a great idea in 1872 and the court today has reaffirmed that it's still a great idea in 2003.&quot;</I></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">- Bill Wade served in the National Park Service for more than 30 years, finishing his career as Superintendent of Shenandoah National Park.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><I>&quot;This ruling is already rippling through the National Parks. It will be a huge morale boost for men and women who wear the Park Service uniform. For three years in the first national park, the Bush Administration has been pushing to toss aside what the Park Service conscientiously determined is necessary to protect Yellowstone and the health of employees and visitors. It has been shocking and demoralizing to be told, in effect, 'We know what is best for people's health and the park, but we're not doing that because the snowmobile industry wants something else.' The Administration had placed the fundamental mission of the Park Service in doubt-today, that shadow has been lifted. The court has reaffirmed that our responsibility is to protect the national parks as fully as possible. Now, the employees will be watching to see how the Administration adjusts its management plans to comply with the judge's ruling.&quot;</I></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">- Rick Smith, a 30-year veteran of the National Park Service, served as Acting Superintendent of Yellowstone National Park.</FONT><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font></P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p></font><!-- #EndEditable --></td></tr>
