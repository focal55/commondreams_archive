- July 28 - Sludge researchers, activists, and rural residents exposed to land applied sewage sludges across the nation are boycotting today's summit at the Hilton Alexandria Old Town, in Alexandria, Va., organized by the EPA, the Water Environment Research Foundation (WERF) and the New England Biosolids and Residuals Association (NEBRA).</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We are boycotting this conference because its real purpose is to create an illusion that EPA and the sludge industry are concerned about people getting sick from sludge spreading. Organizers have arranged this conference while continuing to malign and intimidate scientists and citizens who raise concerns about land application,&quot; said Barbara Rubin of Neighbors Against Toxic Sludge.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Freedom of speech and scientific freedom are precious rights in our democracy. Sound science and honest debate are the foundation of environmental regulations. In May, EPA terminated one of its most senior scientists, Dr. David Lewis, who alleges in a current law suit that Synagro Technologies Inc. and the WEF successfully appealed to EPA's Christie Whitman to stop supporting his research on adverse effects of sewage sludge.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We cannot, in good conscience, participate in a summit that is being sponsored and funded by individuals, agencies, and organizations that stifle debate and retaliate against scientists who criticize inadequate EPA regulations,&quot; warned Professor Caroline Snyder of Citizens for Sludge-Free Land.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Evidence is mounting that sludge spreading is linked to serious health problems, including deaths. The Cornell Waste Management Institute, a 2002 National Academy of Sciences report, the Center for Disease Control-all emphasize the need for caution because the current rules may not protect public health. Stakeholders are demanding a moratorium on land application, reinstatement of Dr. Lewis, and independent research.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In January 2002, the Sierra Club urged EPA not to spent tax dollars for &quot;crisis management and aggressive public relations campaigns to change public perception about sludge. In face of so much uncertainty, the EPA should not promote sludge spreading as safe and silence citizens and scientists who question the adequacy of the current regulations.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;So long as the waste industry dominates EPA policy, no amount of new research funds will lead to more protective legislation,&quot; said Chris Rueggeberg, former legislative advocate for the NH Sierra Club.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Boycotting organizations include the National Sludge Alliance, Americans for Scientific Freedom, Citizens for Sludge-Free Land, Neighbors Against Toxic Sludge (VA) Maine Sludge Alliance, Pennsylvania Environmental Network and many other groups across the nation.</font></p>
