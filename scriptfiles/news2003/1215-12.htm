- December 15 -  
A new news and information Web site, BushGreenwatch.org, debuts Monday, Dec. 15 with an expose on the Bush Administration&#146;s scramble to reconcile two conflicting and potentially embarrassing messages on the dangers of mercury. </FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">While the Food &amp; Drug Administration is warning women and children to limit their consumption of canned tuna because of dangerous mercury levels, the Environmental Protection Agency is expected today (Dec. 15) to announce its plans to downgrade mercury as a toxin, a move that would loosen restrictions on power plants that emit mercury. White House officials held a Dec. 5 meeting with EPA and FDA officials to discuss the awkward timing of the two announcements and to &#147;ensure federal communication about mercury risks can be defended,&#148; according to trade publication Inside EPA.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;No one&#146;s saying what happened at the meeting, which was called at the request of the White House,&#148; Mercury Policy Project Director Michael Bender told BushGreenwatch. &quot;What we do know is that President Bush's EPA is slated today to formally announce a dramatic weakening of emission limits for mercury, a potent poison for children and the unborn, from coal burning. It presents the appearance, and perhaps the reality, of allowing children to be poisoned for the sake of campaign contributions.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">BushGreenwatch is devoted to providing accurate and timely information on the Bush Administration's assault on the environment and public health. Every weekday morning, BushGreenwatch will feature a news item that goes beyond the headlines to uncover policies and actions that may have been overlooked. The site will include original investigative pieces on the administration's ties to industry and the impact on the environment, as well as updates on upcoming deadlines on environmental regulations and policies.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">This week, BushGreenwatch will include stories about a secret &#147;sweetheart&#148; deal between the EPA and the agribusiness industry on factory farm pollution, as well as one about a Bush judicial nominee awaiting Senate approval who once argued that environmentalists actually benefit from the U.S. military&#146;s bombing of migratory birds on the grounds that the more rare &#150; and dead &#150; the species, the more birdwatchers would enjoy spotting them.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">BushGreenwatch is a project of Environmental Media Services, a nonprofit communications clearinghouse dedicated to expanding media coverage of critical environmental and public health issues, with support from MoveOn.org, an online organizing group with nearly two million members across the United States.Sign Up For Free &#147;Greenwatch Today&#148; Email Updates &#150; Visit <A HREF="http://www.bushgreenwatch.org" TARGET="_new">www.bushgreenwatch.org</A> </FONT></P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p></font><!-- #EndEditable --></td></tr>
