- May 21   - As EPA administrator 

Christie Whitman announced her resignation, Friends of the Earth 

today criticized her agency for overseeing the weakening of 

critical health and environmental protections. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Christie Whitman played a moderating role at times, but the 

facts are clear: the Bush EPA has made our water more polluted, our 

air dirtier and our communities more at risk from toxic dumps," 

said Brent Blackwelder, president of Friends of the Earth. "As 

unsatisfactory as her leadership was, evidently it was still too 

pro-environment for the Bush administration." 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During her first year in office, Friends of the Earth became the 

first national environmental group to call for Whitman's 

resignation. The group urged her to step down in 2001, saying that 

her credibility had been damaged beyond repair by the 

administration's decision to block tougher standards for arsenic in 

drinking water and to abandon the Kyoto global warming agreement. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Environmental groups have subsequently criticized Whitman's 

agency for dismantling an array of longstanding environmental laws. 

During the past two years, EPA has signed off on a rule allowing 

polluters to dump industrial waste into waterways and proposed a 

Clean Air Act change that would allow the nation's dirtiest power 

plants to expand. The agency has also cut the number of toxic 

cleanups in half and dramatically reduced its enforcement of 

pollution control laws, and is currently considering a Clean Water 

Act change that would remove 60 percent of streams from protection 

under the law. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Friends of the Earth pointed to these regulatory changes as part 

of a larger pattern, where administration officials use 

administrative procedures and budget cuts to surreptitiously weaken 

laws that enjoy broad public support. The group predicted that 

Whitman's replacement would continue using these tactics to pursue 

more environmental rollbacks.
