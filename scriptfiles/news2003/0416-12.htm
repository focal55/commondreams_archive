                - April 16 - Following is a statement 

                by League of Conservation Voters (LCV) political director Betsy 

                

                Loyless on the Labor Environment Alliance:  

                <p>&quot;The Labor Environment Alliance announced today by the 

                  Teamsters and The Council of Republicans for Environmental Advocacy 

                  has little to do with strengthening labor and nothing to do 

                  with protecting the environment. Studies show that more permanent, 

                  high-wage labor jobs would be created by protecting our environment 

                  and conserving our natural resources than by destroying them. 

                  In fact, mainstream labor groups have worked closely with the 

                  environmental community for decades to find commonsense ways 

                  to protect our environment and strengthen our economy at the 

                  same time. The Labor Environment Alliance is merely an attempt 

                  by the Bush administration to scare voters into believing that 

                  harmful environmental policies are necessary to America's economic 

                  security when the exact opposite is true.&quot; </p>

                <p><i>For more information on the success of the existing partnership 

                  between labor and the environmental community, or information 

                  on the economic benefits of protecting the environment, please 

                  contact the LCV Press Office. </i></p>

                <p><i>The nonprofit League of Conservation Voters (LCV) is the 

                  political voice of the national environmental and conservation 

                  community. LCV is the only national organization working full-time 

                  to hold Congress and the president accountable for their environmental 

                  actions. </i></p>
