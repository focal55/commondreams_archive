<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - June 10 - As the Senate Subcommittee on Fisheries, Wildlife, and Water of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee prepares to hold a hearing on the scope of the federal Clean Water Act, American Rivers called on Congress to move swiftly to reverse recent Bush administration actions that have undercut clean water protections.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Recent actions by the administration have opened a leak in clean water protections that Congress should quickly plug,&quot; said Betsy Otto, senior director for watersheds at American Rivers. &quot;Clean water depends on top to bottom protection in our watersheds. We cannot afford to abandon the very protections that have greatly improved the nation's water quality over the past 30 years.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In particular, American Rivers called on the Senate to act swiftly to pass the &quot;Clean Water Authority Restoration Act,&quot; introduced by Sens. Russell Feingold (D-Wis.), Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), and Jim Jeffords (I-Vt.) in February of this year. Representatives James Oberstar (D-8th, Minn.), John Dingell (D-16th, Mich.), Jim Leach (R-1st, Iowa) and Sherwood Boehlert (R-23rd, N.Y.) introduced a companion bill in the House of Representatives. This bill would reaffirm that Congress intended the Clean Water Act to protect all waters of the United States, including all wetlands, headwater streams, natural ponds, and other water bodies.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This law is necessary because the Bush administration has recently seized on a narrow Supreme Court ruling (Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County vs. Army Corps, known as the SWANCC ruling) as a pretext to remove federal protections from certain intra-state, non-navigable waters. The EPA and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers also launched a broader review that could lead to additional curtailment of the law's reach in the near future.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;In plain English, this bill says that Congress wasn't kidding when it passed the Clean Water Act 30 years ago,&quot; said Rebecca R. Wodder, president of American Rivers.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to some news reports, as much as 20 percent of the wetlands in the lower 48 states have lost their federal protections due to the Bush administration's action in January. Anecdotal reports from around the country suggest that losses may be even higher, as many U.S. Army Corps of Engineers field personnel are interpreting the administration's policy as a green light not to assert jurisdiction over waters that were previously subject to permits for filling, dredging and other damaging activities.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Healthy wetlands and headwater streams are among the most important features of the landscape. They store and purify surface waters, reduce floods, release fresh water to and from aquifers, trap and recycle sediments and nutrients, and provide habitat for many wildlife species.</font></p>
