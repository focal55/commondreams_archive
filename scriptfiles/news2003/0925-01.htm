- September 24 - A new report by the General Accounting Office confirms many of the weaknesses in nuclear power plant security identified in a 2002 report issued by the Project On Government Oversight (POGO). POGO&#146;s report, &#147;Nuclear Power Plant Security: Voices from Inside the Fences&#148; can be viewed at <a href="http://www.pogo.org/p/environment/eo-020901-nukepower.html" target="_new">http://www.pogo.org/p/environment/eo-020901-nukepower.html</a> and was based upon interviews with security guards and officers at nuclear power plants across the U.S.</font>

<p> </p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In response to POGO&#146;s report, the federal government&#146;s Nuclear Regulatory Commission issued orders aimed at improving working conditions and training for security officers. However, the GAO report documents that much more needs to be done. </font></p>

<p> </p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The GAO report once again confirms that since September 11th not enough has been done to ensure that the public is protected from a possible terrorist attack. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has abdicated their oversight role and depended on the utilities to set their own security standards,&#148; said POGO&#146;s senior investigator Peter Stockton. POGO&#146;s Peter Stockton is available to comment on the GAO report by calling his cell phone# 202-438-2387. Representative Edward Markey&#146;s office has issued a release which is pasted below.</font></p>
