- December 2  - The statement of a Russian economic advisor against the Kyoto Protocol was nothing more than pre-election bluster, ahead of Moscow's Duma election this Sunday, according to WWF and Greenpeace, participating in the Climate Change Conference in Milan.</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">A Russian economic advisor to President Putin, Andrei Illarionov, had stated today that he believed Russia would not ratify the Kyoto Protocol in its present form, because it placed &quot;significant limitations on the economic growth of Russia&quot;.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Alexey Kokorin, the head of WWF's Climate Change program in Russia, said that Illarionov's statement is of a pre-election political manoeuvering and did not hold any weight as to what Russia would actually do.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Illarionov does not speak for the President or the Russian Government,&quot;said Kokorin. &quot;This is just the latest statement in a long line of predictions by Illarionov which have failed to eventuate. He opposed the Russian energy </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">strategy which was then adopted in May 2003, and he poured cold water on the economic plan for GDP growth, which was also later adopted.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;While Illarionov's opinion will sound like music to the ears of the US administration, it's far too early to be reading the funeral notice of the Kyoto Protocol,&quot; said Steven Guilbeault, Greenpeace International Climate Campaigner.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The person who speaks for Russia is Vladimir Putin and not some bureaucrat. President Putin has made numerous statements in the past few months, reaffirming Russia would ratify.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Elections for the Duma, the Russia Parliament's lower house, will take place on Sunday 7th December. The Russian Presidential elections will take place in March 2004. Russia is expected to ratify after those elections.</FONT></P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p></font><!-- #EndEditable --></td></tr>
