<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NEW YORK - July 8 - Nearly 2 million people have now contacted the Federal Communications Commission about its June 2 revision of media ownership rules, according to FCC Commissioner Jonathan Adelstein.  Almost all of them opposed the Commission's plan to repeal or weaken many of the few remaining checks on the dominance of big media. (See <a href="http://www.fair.org/activism/rollback-fcc.html" target="_new">here</a> )</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today, public interest groups and other critics of the FCC decision are joining forces to send a message to Congress: Roll back the rule changes.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the Senate, S.1046, cosponsored by senators Ernest Hollings (D.-S.C.) and Ted Stevens (R.-Alaska), would return the TV ownership cap to 35 percent.  In the House, H.R. 2052 (the &quot;Preservation of Localism, Program Diversity, and Competition in Television Broadcast Service Act&quot;), would do the same thing by amending the Communications Act of 1934.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition, Rep. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has proposed the &quot;Protect Diversity in Media Act&quot; (H.R. 2462), which would rescind all of the new rules made by the FCC, and prohibit the Commission from conducting any more of the biennial reviews of broadcast media ownership rules that were mandated under the Telecommunications Act of 1996.  And Sen. Byron Dorgan

(D.-N.D.) has said he will invoke a rarely used provision called the Congressional Review Act to try to vacate the new FCC rules.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The next steps in the effort to return the TV ownership cap to 35 percent are for S.1046 to be voted on and passed by the full Senate, and H.R. 2052 to be voted on and passed by the House.  While these bills aren't a cure-all for the undemocratic effects of media consolidation, they're a step in the right direction.  This is a crucial time for Congress to hear from citizens who support media diversity.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ACTION: Please call your representatives and ask them to support and sponsor legislation that rolls back the FCC's recent deregulation of big media.</font></p>
