                - March 19 - The government’s latest plan to question thousands 

                of Iraqi nationals is yet another example of ethnic and religious 

                profiling that may hamper rather than help efforts to apprehend 

                terrorists, the American Civil Liberties Union said today. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In response, 

                ACLU offices across the country have been mobilizing to identify 

                – and in some cases provide special training for – local attorneys 

                to accompany Iraqis to the interviews, which are scheduled to 

                begin this week. The ACLU expressed concern that some FBI officials 

                have told Muslim groups that the presence of an attorney would 

                lead them to immediately suspect that the person might "have something 

                to hide." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"In the same 

                breath that they are asking for assistance from Iraqi nationals 

                in thwarting terrorism, the FBI is alienating people by treating 

                them like suspects and discouraging them from consulting with 

                an attorney, which is their right," said Dalia Hashad, the ACLU’s 

                Arab, Muslim and South Asian Advocate. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"There are 

                many good reasons to have an attorney present during questioning, 

                none of which have anything to do with guilt," Hashad said. "Further, 

                it is unlikely that people with information will come forward 

                when they feel that having an attorney present will render them 

                suspicious to the government and not having an attorney present 

                will expose them to unwarranted detention or worse." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hashad said 

                that the ACLU has been fielding phone calls from frightened Iraqis, 

                many of whom fled Saddam Hussein’s regime and are concerned that 

                the government is targeting them for questioning merely on the 

                basis of their country of origin. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to 

                news reports, the FBI is working from an initial list of about 

                50,000 Iraqi nationals living in the United States, about 11,000 

                of whom have been targeted for interviews in the event of a war. 

                Officials have not said what the basis for the "targeting" is, 

                although a similar interview program known as Special Registration 

                singled out men over the age of 16 from mainly Muslim and Arab 

                nations. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The FBI plans 

                include setting up meetings between the heads of FBI field offices 

                and local Islamic groups across the country to ask for their support 

                in identifying terrorists and to assure them of FBI protection 

                against hate crimes. While in some places, like Pittsburgh, the 

                FBI has also met with local ACLU officials to allay fears and 

                establish cooperation, the message from the FBI has been inconsistent 

                the ACLU said. For example, the FBI told a Muslim group in Philadelphia 

                that they would not be arrested for immigration violations; however 

                an FBI official told the Washington Post on Monday that they would 

                detain anyone found to be in violation of immigration laws. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"It is ironic 

                that the government is promising to protect Iraqis against hate 

                crimes, which are attacks based on a person’s ethnicity, skin 

                color or religion – in other words, the very kind of profiling 

                the government is resorting to," Hashad said.
