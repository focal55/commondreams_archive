- June 23 - Alarmed at Indonesia's bloody war in Aceh, its military campaign in West Papua and the increasing lawlessness and brutality of its armed forces (TNI), 90 human rights organisations, peace groups, and anti-arms trade campaigners around the world are today calling for an international military embargo on Indonesia.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The groups from Europe, America, Asia and Australasia have issued a <a href="http://www.tapol.gn.apc.org/st030623.htm" target="_new">statement</a> urging governments to embargo the supply military, security and police equipment to Indonesia and to suspend all forms of military co-operation with the Indonesian military and police special forces.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">They are also calling for an immediate end to the military operations in Aceh and West Papua.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many of the groups are especially concerned that weaponry from their countries is being used against civilians in Aceh.  They include Hawk jets and Scorpion tanks from the UK, OV-10 Bronco counter-insurgency planes and F-16 fighters from the US, warships from Germany and French and Russian-made armoured vehicles.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The groups point out that the TNI has not needed to defend Indonesia against an external attack for 40 years and that it has 'regularly used weaponry and combat skills obtained in part through foreign training and military assistance programs against civilians, including Indonesians, East Timorese, West Papuans, Acehnese and others'.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">They note that 'the TNI is infamous for its brutality and lack of accountability in areas of conflict' and that the police special forces, known as Brimob, also have an appalling human rights record. Consequently, they say they are convinced that 'the TNI represents a grave threat to the stability and security of Indonesia' and they believe that 'the policy of western countries to strengthen their military ties with Jakarta as part of the &quot;war against terror&quot; is wholly misguided and dangerous'.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">They insist that bilateral military relations cannot continue as normal:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">'Given the backdrop of mounting casualties, wanton killings and human rights abuses attributable to the TNI in Aceh and Papua, we believe it is intolerable for governments to engage with the TNI on a business-as-usual basis.'</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Indonesia launched a military offensive in Aceh, its largest operation since the invasion of East Timor in 1975, on 19 May.  The operation is now proceeding at a level that is causing widespread civilian loss of and the destruction of Aceh's public infrastructure.  Civil society activists are being targeted and the government has imposed severe restrictions on press freedom and foreigners' access to the province. Tens of thousands of people have been internally displaced and the UN is concerned about a humanitarian crisis as food supplies run dangerously low.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In West Papua, the TNI continues to provoke situations designed to strengthen its power and to undermine peace and stability in the territory. In April, Kopassus special forces launched a widespread operation in West Papua's Central Highlands.  Many Papuans have been arbitrarily arrested, detained, beaten and tortured.  'Sweeping' operations through highland villages have led to the killing of civilians and the destruction of homes, schools and crops.</font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
