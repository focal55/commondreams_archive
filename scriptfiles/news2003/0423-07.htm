- April 23 - Following is a statement 

by Katherine Silverthorne, director, U.S. Climate Change Program 

World Wildlife Fund, commenting on today's vote by American 

Electric Power shareholders on CO2 risk: 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This vote is among the first rumblings of shareholder concern 

about the carbon dioxide emissions that result from the power 

sector's over reliance on polluting fossil fuels. Over the past 

year, 29 similar resolutions were filed by shareholders seeking 

disclosure of the financial risks associated with CO2 emissions. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Shareholders are recognizing that CO2 emissions may well be the 

next hidden risk on Wall Street. Smart companies can be part of the 

global warming solution instead of the problem. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"AEP is the nation's largest emitter of CO2 - the primary 

heat-trapping gas associated with global warming. Now, its 

shareholders are looking for the company to take a responsible 

approach to the risk associated with high CO2 emissions and 

consider the benefits of reducing those emissions. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"As the biggest emitters of CO2, the power sector can be a big 

part of the solution to global warming. WWF is challenging power 

companies to take responsible steps towards solving this growing 

environmental problem as part of its PowerSwitch! initiative. It's 

time to switch to clean energy, before it's too late to save 

wildlife and wild spaces from the impacts of global warming." 



</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Note to editors: The American Electric Power (NYSE: AEP) 

resolution was filed by Connecticut Retirement Plans and Trust 

Funds (CRPTF) and Christian Brothers Investment Services (CBIS). 

Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), the largest investment 

advisory service to institutional investors nationwide, issued a 

recommendation that institutional shareholders vote in favor of 

this shareholder resolution despite management recommendations 

against. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The resolution asks that the company prepare a report to 

shareholders on "(a) the economic risks associated with the 

Company's past, present, and future emissions of carbon dioxide, 

sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and mercury emissions, and the 

public stance of the company regarding efforts to reduce these 

emissions and (b) the economic benefits of committing to a 

substantial reduction of those emissions related to its current 

business activities (i.e. potential improvement in competitiveness 

and profitability)." Source: State of Connecticut, Treasurer's 

Office
