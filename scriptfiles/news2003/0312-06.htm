                - March 12 - The following is a statement of William V. Corr, 

                executive vice president, Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids: </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We urge the 

                Maryland House Health and Government Operations Committee to quickly 

                approve Del. Barbara Frush's proposed smoke-free workplace law, 

                HB 771. Eighty percent of Maryland citizens do not smoke, and 

                the Legislature should act decisively to protect their right to 

                breathe clean, smoke-free air. This measure will save lives by 

                reducing the exposure of workers and customers to the poisons 

                in secondhand smoke. As a result, Marylanders will be able to 

                earn a living and enjoy a meal with friends without being exposed 

                to this serious health hazard. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nationwide, 

                there is growing public demand for protection from secondhand 

                smoke. Dallas, New York City and Boston approved smoke-free policies 

                in recent months. In November's election, 71 percent of Florida 

                voters supported a ban on smoking in restaurants and other indoor 

                workplaces. Last May, Delaware became the second state after California 

                to enact comprehensive protections, and numerous cities, towns 

                and counties across the United States have done so as well. States 

                and cities that are currently considering such measures should 

                quickly follow the lead of Dallas, New York and Boston and protect 

                the rights of their citizens to breathe clean air. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There is an 

                overwhelming scientific consensus that exposure to secondhand 

                smoke causes disease, disability and death. Secondhand smoke contains 

                over 4,000 chemicals and 69 known carcinogens including formaldehyde, 

                cyanide, arsenic, carbon monoxide, methane, benzene, and radioactive 

                polonium 210. A recent study by the International Agency for Research 

                on Cancer of the World Health Organization concluded, "Nonsmokers 

                are exposed to the same carcinogens as active smokers. The study 

                found that even the typical levels of passive exposure have been 

                shown to cause lung cancer" among people who have never smoked. 

                In addition to lung cancer, secondhand smoke is proven to cause 

                heart disease, emphysema, and other illnesses and is responsible 

                nationally for thousands of deaths each year. Studies show that 

                kids are especially vulnerable to other people's smoke, suffering 

                more respiratory problems, ear infections, and asthma. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Evidence on 

                the benefits of smoke-free policies was shown last week in a study 

                measuring the effects of Delaware's new smoke-free law, which 

                is similar to HB771. The study, by Repace Associates, measured 

                pollutants in several public venues before and after the state's 

                new law took effect and showed that Delaware's new smoke-free 

                indoor workplace law dramatically reduced exposure to air pollutants 

                known to increase risk of cancer, respiratory disease, heart disease 

                and stroke. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Smoke-free 

                air laws are also good for the economy and business. Despite the 

                tobacco industry's false claims that these measures can hurt business, 

                the facts show that smoke-free laws do no harm, and can even improve 

                business. One comprehensive study of restaurant sales tax data 

                from 81 localities in six states found consistently that ordinances 

                restricting smoking in restaurants had no effect on revenues. 

                In addition, such laws, where enacted, reduce health care costs 

                attributable to treating illnesses caused by secondhand smoke. 

                A 1994 federal study showed, for example, that a ban on smoking 

                in public places would save $72 billion, lower insurance costs, 

                and increase job productivity. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We urge Maryland's 

                leaders to act now to protect the rights of their citizens to 

                breathe clean, smoke-free air. The evidence is clear that such 

                policies improve health and save lives.
