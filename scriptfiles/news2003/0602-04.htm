- June 2 - The Consumer Healthcare 

Products Association (CHPA) today called on Congress to once again 

allow American consumers to deduct nonprescription, 

over-the-counter (OTC) medicines as medical expenses. The 

Association issued this statement in response to a recently 

published Internal Revenue Service (IRS) revenue ruling that 

reiterated that, under the current law, consumers may not deduct 

OTC products, even if the medicines are recommended as a treatment 

by a doctor. OTCs were deductible prior to 1984. </font>

<p></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It is very unfortunate that current IRS rules do not recognize 

the enormous benefits of nonprescription medicines," said CHPA 

President Linda A. Suydam, D.P.A. "OTCs are real medicines that 

provide real treatments and real savings to the healthcare system 

and they should be treated as such." 

</font>

<p></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In order for the actual savings of OTCs as a sensible first-line 

of therapy to be clearly understood, several factors must first be 

considered. One of the most obvious and alarming points is the fact 

that over 40 million Americans currently do not have any form of 

healthcare insurance. Even for those who do have insurance, there 

is still the cost of a doctor's visit, lost time from work, and the 

cost of the prescription medicines to think about. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According to the ruling, the IRS only allows taxpayers to deduct 

the cost of medicines that are available only by prescription and 

insulin. The ruling also permits deductions for other healthcare 

items, such as crutches or even bandages. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Taxpayers who take deductions in the lower income brackets use 

the medical deduction much more frequently than higher income 

earners," explained Suydam. "It just doesn't make any sense that 

consumers can deduct the cost of the bandage that covers the wound, 

but not the OTC therapies that take the pain of the injury away," 

she added. "Consumers should not be penalized for using an 

affordable method of treatment." 

</font>

<p></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Tax deductible medical expenses may become even more of an issue 

for consumers in the future. The cost benefits of OTC medicines are 

expected to increase as OTC options are considered for long-term, 

chronic conditions. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"If Congress allowed the IRS to adjust for the deduction of 

OTCs, it would be a very modest reform for the agency," said 

Suydam. "But it would provide a great deal of relief for those who 

need it most."
