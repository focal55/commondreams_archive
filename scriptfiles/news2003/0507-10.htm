- May 7 - Following is a statement 

of William V. Corr, executive director, Campaign for Tobacco-Free 

Kids: 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We applaud Maine Governor John Baldacci for his farsighted 

leadership in proposing to permanently protect the Fund for a 

Healthy Maine by a constitutional amendment. This visionary plan 

will save lives and reduce health care costs by permanently 

making tobacco prevention and health promotion a priority in the 

state. It will end the shell game of using tobacco settlement 

funds to supplant spending from the general budget on health 

programs. The Governor's plan will help ensure that Maine 

remains a national leader in using tobacco settlement money as 

intended to protect kids from tobacco addiction. We urge the 

Legislature to approve the Governor's plan and send the amendment 

to the voters for approval this November. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"No other state has done what Maine is proposing: ensuring 

that every penny of tobacco settlement money is used for disease 

prevention, health promotion, and access to health care. By 

contrast, most states have squandered their tobacco settlements 

rather than keeping their promise to use the funds for tobacco 

prevention. A report by public health groups released in January 

ranked Maine first among the states in funding programs to 

protect kids from tobacco. Maine was one of only a handful of 

states funding tobacco prevention at the minimum level 

recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 

Maine's decision to properly fund tobacco prevention represents 

both good fiscal policy and good public health policy in light of 

conclusive evidence that these programs work to reduce smoking 

among both kids and adults, save lives and save money. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Maine's tobacco prevention program has been highly 

successful. The state reduced smoking among high school students 

by 36 percent from 1997 to 2001. Maine's program is also 

encouraging young smokers to quit -- between 1997 and 2001, the 

percentage of youth users who have tried to quit increased from 

33 percent to 57 percent. The evidence is clear that if Maine 

stays the course it will save lives and money as well. Studies 

show California, which started the nation's oldest tobacco 

prevention program in 1990, has saved tens of thousands of lives 

by reducing smoking-caused birth complications, heart disease, 

strokes and lung cancer. Studies have also shown states can save 

as much as $3 in health care costs for every dollar spent on 

prevention. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"In Maine, 24.8 percent of high school students currently 

smoke, and 3,800 more kids become regular, daily smokers every 

year, one-third of whom will die prematurely. Smoking-caused 

health care costs Maine and its taxpayers $470 million a year."
