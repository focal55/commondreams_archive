<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BERKELEY, CA - June 10 - California Peace Action (CAPA), the state's largest peace organization, today launched a controversial national advertising campaign in major markets across the country. The first advertisement will appear today in the New York Times, followed by ads in the Los Angeles Times and throughout mass transit systems nationwide.</font>

<p> </p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The ad (which is displayed at the bottom of this page) features a controversial historical photograph, declassified by the National Security Archives, of Donald Rumsfeld shaking hands with Saddam Hussein. The photo was taken when Rumsfeld traveled to Iraq as a special envoy for the Reagan Administration to arrange US support for Hussein in 1983. Prior to this visit, US intelligence had confirmed that Iraq was using chemical weapons &quot;almost daily.&quot; The headline of the ad reads &quot;Who Are We Arming Now?&quot;</font></p>

<p> </p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The ad kicks off a three-part campaign aligned with Peace Action's Campaign for a New American Foreign Policy - the first plank in their three point platform is a call to end US military aid to human rights-abusing governments and dictatorships.</font></p>

<p> </p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The photo and the record both speak for themselves,&quot; said Peter Ferenbach, Executive Director of California Peace Action. &quot;We supported Saddam on the theory that he would be a safeguard against Islamic fundamentalism. We armed Osama bin Laden on the theory that it was worth supporting his radical &quot;jihadis&quot; to disrupt the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Now, we're doing it all again with huge increases in military aid to gross human rights abusers.&quot;</font></p>

<p> </p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In two short weeks, CAPA raised more than $50,000 from supporters, allowing it to place the contentious ad in more markets than originally intended. This response substantially exceeded CAPA's expectations for this pilot project. Over the summer, CAPA plans to place ads that focus on the second two parts of its Campaign for a New American Foreign Policy:  reduction and control of nuclear threat, and the need for international cooperation.</font></p>

<p> </p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The response to the CAPA appeal shows that many Americans believe that we need a new foreign policy. Instead of leading the world in arms sales to dictatorships, we must lead a global effort to stop the arms trade. Instead of leading the world in producing nuclear weapons, let's lead a global campaign to dismantle them. Instead of ushering in a new era of international lawlessness, we need to lead the world community in addressing real and serious transnational issues,&quot; said Ferenbach.</font></p>
