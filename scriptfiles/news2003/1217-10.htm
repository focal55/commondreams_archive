- December 17 - On Tuesday, December 16, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued an injunction barring U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft, the Department of Justice, and the Drug Enforcement Administration from future raids on or persecutions of two California medical marijuana patients and their providers.</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">   The lawsuit seeking the injunction, Raich v. Ashcroft, was funded in part by the Washington, D.C.-based Marijuana Policy Project (MPP). The appeals court held that the &quot;cultivation, possession, and use of marijuana for medicinal purposes and not for exchange or distribution is not properly characterized as commercial or economic activity&quot; -- and is thus not a matter of federal concern. As a result, patients in 9th Circuit states with laws allowing for the medical use of marijuana -- Alaska, California, Hawaii, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington -- may no longer face arrest and imprisonment for taking medicine recommended by their physicians.</FONT></P><P>   <FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;As supporters of limited government, Attorney General Ashcroft and President Bush should applaud this decision,&quot; said Rob Kampia, MPP's executive director. &quot;This ruling wisely leaves the medical marijuana issue to the states, as the Constitution requires. This is a victory for compassion, states' rights, and common sense.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">   The Raich case is the second recent appellate ruling barring federal interference from medical marijuana-related activities. On October 14, the U.S. Supreme Court let stand a 9th Circuit decision prohibiting the federal government from punishing physicians who recommend medical marijuana to patients. The Raich decision is available on-line at <A HREF="http://www.mpp.org/pdf/raich_victory.pdf" TARGET="_new">http://www.mpp.org/pdf/raich_victory.pdf</A> .</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">   With more than 14,000 members nationwide, the Marijuana Policy Project is the largest marijuana policy reform organization in the United States. MPP works to minimize the harm associated with marijuana -- both the consumption of marijuana and the laws that are intended to prohibit such use. MPP believes that the greatest harm associated with marijuana is imprisonment. To this end, MPP focuses on removing criminal penalties for marijuana use, with a particular emphasis on making marijuana medically available to seriously ill people who have the approval of their doctors.
