Overturning The Texas Sodomy Law</div>

- July 2 - The U.S. Supreme Court's June 26

ruling in Lawrence v. Texas, striking down a state

anti-sodomy law, marks a momentous sea change in how

gays and lesbians are treated by the judicial system,

say candidates and officeholders with the Green Party

of the United States.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This decision is a great accomplishment due to its

eliminating sexual acts from criminal statutes that

have been used against gays, lesbians, bisexuals and transgender persons in both civil and criminal matters,&quot; said George DeCarlo, a gay Green Party candidate for the New Jersey State Assembly.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Green Party of the United States celebrates the

6-3 decision as a landmark in civil rights history, a

ruling in the tradition of Griswold v. Connecticut in

1965 (contraception) and Roe v. Wade in 1973

(reproductive rights) in its affirmation of the

individual's right to make personal decisions free

from state interference. The Green Party has long

supported the overturning of the 1986 Bowers v.

Hardwick decision, which let stand Georgia's

anti-sodomy law.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Though these laws have been on the books only in

several states and the military code, their impact has been felt in other states and the culture of the

U.S.,&quot; said Ryan Reyes, who is also a gay Green

running for the New Jersey Assembly.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greens noted the rapid and vicious backlash against

the Lawrence decision, when Sen. Bill Frist (R.-Tenn.) has announced his intention to push for passage of a&quot;Defense of Marriage&quot; amendment that would confer

governmental recognition exclusively to heterosexuals.

 The Green Party of the United States, which calls for

full and equal legal recognition of same-sex civil

unions, strongly opposes any such legislation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">President Bush on July 25 sent to Capitol Hill his

policy statement that faith-based service providers

who receive federal and state funds should not be

prohibited from discriminating on the basis of sexuality.  The Green Party has criticized Bush's

faith-based initiative and opposes any attempt to use

the initiative to legitimize discrimination.  Greens

observed that Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence

Thomas, who dissented in the Lawrence decision and are considered to be the Court's most reactionary voices, were confirmed with the votes of many Democrats in Congress.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The dissenting opinions on this Supreme Court are

coming from the same tyrannical faction that likes to

tell us how to have sex, who to have it with, or what

pleasures are or are not valid,&quot; said Wisconsin Green

Kyle Richmond, a gay Dane County Supervisor. &quot;It's the

same hypocritical group that doesn't quite feel

'comfortable' with us. In other words, they're justnot comfortable with everyone having the rights they

have.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Green Party renewed its call for continued

progress in the struggle for equality under the law

for all citizens.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Ryan Reyes and myself have emphasized that there is

no such thing as second class citizenship and that the franchise of citizenship is denied lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people,&quot; said DeCarlo. &quot;Of course, areas such as joinings of same-sex couples and open participation in the Armed Forces are other aspects of citzenship currently denied our community&quot;</font></p>
