- May 23 -  Leading members of the United States Congress Peter King

(R-NY) and Michael Capuano (D-MA) this week condemned attacks and harassment by Burma's military regime on Nobel Peace Prize recipient Aung San Suu Kyi and her supporters in recent weeks. In the most serious incident, members of the regime's political arm, the Union Solidarity and Development Association  (USDA) stopped Aung San Suu Kyi's motorcade and beat on the doors and windows, wielding machetes and sticks. The attack came as the democracy leader traveled with members of her political party the National League for Democracy (NLD) to open an office in Bhamaw Township, Kachin State.

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This is yet another example of how Than Shwe's regime continues to employ terror and brutality as a means of retaining power over the Burmese people," said Rep. King, a Republican member of the influential International Relations Committee and Chairman of the Financial Services subcommittee that overseas the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"I find it appalling that Than Shwe's soldiers would threaten one of the world's great freedom fighters," added Rep. Capuano, also a member of the Financial Services Committee. "Than Shwe continues to terrorize the population of Burma."

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The statements by leading members of both parties reflect increasing Congressional frustration with Than Shwe's regime. Powerful Republican Senate Majority Whip Mitch McConnell, the Chairman of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee, and Representative Tom Lantos, the top Democrat on the International Relations Committee, both recently stated that they plan to introduce legislation increasing sanctions on Than Shwe's regime. McConnell and Lantos cited ongoing human rights abuses by the regime as well as Than Shwe's refusal to fulfill his promise to participate in talks facilitated by United Nations special envoy to Burma Razali Ismail.

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"It is clear that additional sanctions against the junta in Rangoon are warranted, and I intend to introduce legislation to this effect in the very near future," Senator McConnell told Secretary of State Colin Powell in a Senate Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee hearing April 30th.

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Both King and Capuano emphasized that the harassment of Suu Kyi and her supporters has been ongoing. "This is only one of many recent occasions in which the USDA has harassed and intimidated Aung San Suu Kyi... and her supporters," said Capuano.  According to NLD party spokesperson U Lwin, on May 16th, a similar crowd surrounded the NLD convoy on a bridge outside Myitkyina, also in Kachin State, brandishing swords and catapults and attempting to throw punches through car windows. The regime also prevented the NLD from opening a party office in the town of Shwebo. In Chin, Arakan, and Karenni States, hundreds of USDA members have publicly protested Aung San Suu Kyi's appearances, and soldiers have threatened to arrest villagers attempting to see her speak.
