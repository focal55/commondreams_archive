<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHY:               Recent discoveries of mass graves in Iraq further illustrate the need for a permanent court to deter such atrocities in the future.  Americans are committed to helping victims of the world’s worst crimes, as demonstrated by the tremendous outpouring of citizen support for the Victims Trust Fund Campaign in its first month.  Throughout April, thousands of U.S. citizens across the country have joined the campaign by sending a small check to the Victims Trust Fund to help survivors of future atrocities. By telling their Senators about their donations, they are demonstrating the breadth and depth of Americans’ commitment to U.S. leadership in international justice. 



 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In only one month, more than 20 U.S. civil society groups, from religious organizations to an anti-torture coalition, have joined the campaign. The campaign website, www.victimstrustfund.org, has received more than 20,000 hits, and more than 70 Hollywood celebrities have signed onto an open letter to senators.

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>The Victims Trust Fund is a part of the International Criminal Court, and will provide money directly to the victims of future genocides, war crimes and crimes against humanity. It provides funds for medical and other necessary social goods to help survivors rebuild their lives and communities.
