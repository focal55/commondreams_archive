                - March 17 - With the capture of Al Qaeda leader Khalid Sheikh 

                Mohammed, discussion has intensified around a once academic question: 

                Should the United States use torture to obtain information from 

                suspects about future terrorist attacks? Americans of all ages 

                can now address this question and other pressing issues through 

                an on-line survey conducted as part of the 2003 Illinois Youth 

                Summit. </font>

                highlights questions on the use of torture, increased surveillance 

                powers of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the U.S. Defense 

                Department's Total Information Awareness program. Participants 

                also can compare their answers to the overall results which will 

                be updated daily until mid-April. In addition, the Summit web

                Summit. Following a semester of study, discussion, and activity, 

                nearly 200 student delegates will represent their peers at a culminating 

                Summit on May 1. The event will be held 9-2:15 in Room 2525 of
