The environment, in its broadest sense, is one of the major

social and economic environmental factors that pose health risks in 

the world. Nearly 2,000 healthcare providers, community 

organizers, program managers, policy makers, researchers, and

in which the health community can make use of a better 

understanding of environmental issues in daily practice, and 

directly influence those issues that have the greatest impact on 

health. For more information on the schedule of events at the 

conference, visit the Council's website at www.globalhealth.org.
