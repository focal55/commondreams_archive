                - April 1 - Public Citizen’s Health Research Group has recommended 

                that patients not take teriparatide, a drug approved by the U.S. 

                Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in November 2002 for treatment 

                of osteoporosis. Teriparatide, marketed by Eli Lilly under the 

                name Forteo, has led to bone cancer in laboratory animals, a risk 

                that far outweighs the drug’s benefit. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Public Citizen 

                issued a "Do Not Use!" warning in the April issue of Worst Pills, 

                Best Pills News, an online service and monthly newsletter that 

                contains information on drug safety and effectiveness, dangerous 

                dietary supplements, drug-induced symptoms and drug interactions. 

                In the past, Public Citizen’s Do Not Use! warnings have preceded 

                safety-related withdrawals of drugs such as Baycol, Propulsid 

                and Rezulin by months, sometimes years. The Health Research Group 

                has listed more than 200 drugs as Do Not Use! over the past 15 

                years. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In July 2001, 

                Public Citizen recommended against the FDA approval of teriparatide 

                when it learned of the unusually high incidence of osteosarcoma, 

                or malignant bone tumor, in laboratory animals. Although osteosarcomas 

                are generally rare among laboratory animals, rats given teriparatide 

                developed tumors even at the lowest doses tested, and higher exposures 

                shortened the time before tumors developed and the animals died. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The FDA has 

                already mandated a series of warning labels for the drug because 

                of its known risks. The package insert includes a "black box" 

                warning describing the studies on rats. The government also requires 

                that pharmacists distribute patient information leaflets with 

                new and refill prescriptions, a requirement made by the FDA for 

                only a handful of drugs. Also, Eli Lilly has agreed to restrict 

                its promotion of teriparatide, refraining entirely from direct-to-consumer 

                advertising. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The warnings 

                and restrictions the government has put in place are significant, 

                but the safety hazards are so serious, we do not believe any patients 

                should be taking the risk of ingesting this drug," said Sidney 

                Wolfe, M.D., director of Public Citizen’s Health Research Group. 

                "That’s especially true because there are safer alternatives."

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The FDA approved 

                teriparatide to treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal women who 

                are at high risk for fractures and to increase bone mass in men 

                with osteoporosis. There are no data showing that the drug reduces 

                the risk of fractures in men. In women, there are data showing 

                reduced fracture risk, but the reduction is not large, and alendronate, 

                marketed as Fosamax, appears to offer a similar level of risk 

                reduction. Public Citizen recommends that neither men nor women 

                take teriparatide. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Teriparatide 

                is also extremely expensive and must be injected daily. A 30-day 

                supply of teriparatide costs $515.79 at drugstore.com, while a 

                30-day supply of alendronate costs $65.16. </font>
