                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

                  - April 3 - In the push to pass President Bush's nearly $80 

                  billion request to finance the war in Iraq and homeland security, 

                  Senate Republicans yesterday used a procedural tactic to thwart 

                  an amendment to the funding package offered by Sen. Jon S. Corzine 

                  (D-N.J.), which would have reduced the risk of terrorist attacks 

                  on the nation's 15,000 chemical facilities. An explosion at 

                  more than 100 of these facilities each could endanger the lives 

                  of more than a million people, according to EPA data.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Folks 

                  have been talking about chemical security for months. Everyone 

                  knows that the vulnerability of these plants is a major problem. 

                  But nobody is acting,&quot; lamented Sen. John Edwards (D-N.C.), 

                  a co-sponsor of the proposal. &quot;The time for talk is past. 

                  It is time for us to put the security of the American people 

                  ahead of special interest lobbyists and pass this bill now.&quot;</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Why would 

                  Senate Republicans fight new safeguards for vulnerable chemical 

                  facilities? The most obvious reason is that the chemical industry, 

                  despite the recognized risks from a terrorist attack on chemical 

                  plants, has resisted legislative efforts to require that chemical 

                  plants to take steps to make themselves safer. The industry's 

                  aggressive lobbying blitz prevented Sen. Corzine's &quot;Chemical 

                  Security Act&quot; from being added to homeland security legislation 

                  last year.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For its 

                  part, the Bush administration now says it supports mandatory 

                  standards. The administration has been promising its own legislative 

                  proposal for six months, but still has not delivered. According 

                  to an article yesterday in the Wall Street Journal, the administration 

                  may finally put forward its bill later this month. The few details 

                  that are known about President Bush's plan, however, make it 

                  clear that it is a weak response to the problem.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rather than 

                  requiring chemical companies to adopt available and affordable 

                  safer technologies, as Corzine's bill would do, Bush's bill 

                  is expected to focus exclusively on physical security at plants 

                  (i.e., guards and fences). But improving barriers alone won't 

                  be enough -- even those facilities whose security has been stepped 

                  up since 9/11 remain highly vulnerable. By contrast, a community 

                  surrounding a facility using a safer chemical process can rest 

                  easier because even if terrorists succeed in causing damage 

                  to the plant, the consequences will be far less severe.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Relying 

                  on the chemical industry to police itself runs counter to the 

                  advice of former Republican Senator Warren Rudman, recognized 

                  as one of the nation's experts on homeland security. &quot;The 

                  federal role needs to be to set standards and make sure those 

                  standards are observed just as we do with clean air and clean 

                  water and workplace standards,&quot; Rudman said. &quot;I think 

                  we have to have security standards, and people are going to 

                  have to meet those standards.&quot;</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It's 

                  mind-boggling that the Bush administration and its Republican 

                  allies in Congress keep promising legislation to safeguard Americans 

                  from chemical attacks, but once again worked to kill a Congressional 

                  proposal that could actually make us safer,&quot; said Alys 

                  Campaigne, NRDC's legislative director. &quot;Homeland security 

                  is an empty promise without chemical plant security.&quot;</font></p>
