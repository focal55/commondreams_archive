- July 15 - Greens charge that Democratic

Party leaders are dragging their feet on holding

the Bush Administration accountable for massive

deceptions it made in order to justify the

invasion of Iraq.  </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Except for a brave few, Democrats waited until

the occupation started to become unpopular, with

daily killings of American soldiers and the

realization that we face a prolonged,

multibillion-dollar occupation while the U.S.

economy is failing,&quot; said Nathalie Paravacini,

secretary of the Green Party of the United

States.  &quot;Only now are they standing up to

question both the motives and justifications for

the costly invasion of Iraq, when hundreds of

thousands of their own constituencies have voiced

their concerns from the start.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Greens will make bipartisan complicity in Bush's

deceit a major issue in the 2004 local and

national elections,&quot; Paravacini added.  &quot;It's

possible that the only justice we'll see is if

outraged voters vote out both the liars and the

spineless next year.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sen. John Warner (R-Va.) claims that the Senate

Intelligence Committee will &quot;review&quot; rather than

investigate evidence that numerous administration

officials, including Vice President Cheney, knew

that the documents showing that Saddam had

purchased weapons-grade uranium from Niger were

fake.  Former CIA deputy director Richard Kerr

has revealed that the CIA was pressed by the

White House to doctor intelligence about Iraq's

WMDs, and acknowledged that there was no credible

connection between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;In the ten weeks since Bush declared an end to

the war, no signs of an active WMD program or

storage have been found, despite widespread

searches,&quot; said Mark Dunlea, chair of the Green

Party of New York State.  &quot;This confirms the

initial findings of the U.N. inspection team that

Bush had interrupted in his rush to invade Iraq. 

Saddam's failure to use any such weapons to repel

the U.S. invasion confirms that Iraq posed no

imminent threat to the U.S. or any other nation. 

The war was launched for other reasons,

especially to gain political control over Iraqi

oil resources.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greens note that current administration members

have been drafting blueprints for the invasion

for at least a dozen years, especially under the

auspices of the Project for a New American

Century, which urged President Clinton to invade

Iraq in 1988.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;There was plenty of evidence before the war

began that President Bush, Dick Cheney, Colin

Powell, Donald Rumsfeld, Paul Wolfowitz, and

other officials were deceiving the American

public and the world about their motivations for

invading,&quot; said J. Roy Cannon, chair of the Peace

Committee of the Green Party of Delaware.  &quot;The

Green Party spoke out consistently about the

deception, manipulative propaganda, and insincere

appeals to patriotism and security that informed

President Bush's January 28 State of Union speech

and Powell's testimony before the U.N. in early

February.  Greens joined the worldwide protests,

while many Democrats cheered Bush.&quot;  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;If the Democrats had challenged Bush's deceit, a

lot of war, death, and pillage might have been

avoided,&quot; added Dunlea.  &quot;Instead, the Democratic

mainstream, including many liberals, was so

fearful of being called unpatriotic by Rush

Limbaugh and Bill O'Reilly that they rubberstamped the war from the beginning,

surrendering Congress's constitutional power to

declare war over to the White House.  Democracy

was betrayed by Democrats as much as by

Republicans.&quot;</font></p>
