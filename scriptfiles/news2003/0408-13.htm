                - April 8 - The Bush Administration's air pollution plan, euphemistically 

                called the "Clear Skies Initiative," would shred current Clean 

                Air Act protections, the nonprofit Clean Air Trust noted today. 

                The Administration plan is supported by some of the nation's biggest 

                polluters and environmental outlaws such as American Electric 

                Power. And no wonder: the plan would eliminate numerous tools 

                in current law designed to produce cleaner air and better public 

                health. It would give special deals to big polluters. Environmental 

                experts have noted that it would mean more pollution in the future 

                than would faithful enforcement of current law. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A United States 

                Senate subcommittee has scheduled its first hearing on the plan 

                today. Although the Bush Administration has touted this as a bill 

                that would only affect electric power plants, other smokestack 

                industries would also be permitted to take advantage of huge new 

                loopholes. The Clean Air Trust undertook this analysis to examine 

                some of the key tools in existing law that would be eliminated 

                or modified by the Administration plan. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among other 

                things, the bill: </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Could postpone 

                achievement of public health standards for nearly a quarter of 

                a century. The Administration plan would automatically postpone 

                deadlines for meeting public health standards for smog (ozone) 

                and fine particle soot (PM 2.5) until 2015. (Existing law would 

                require health standards to be met by 2009 or earlier.) It would 

                also create a whole new category of "transitional" areas for 8-hour 

                ozone or PM 2.5 if states claim they will meet the standards by 

                2015. But if a "transitional" area fails to meet the standards 

                by 2016, the deadlines simply get postponed even farther into 

                the future. (The bill says EPA must designate such an area as 

                "nonattainment" in 2017, after which the state would have until 

                2020 to submit a cleanup plan. The actual cleanup wouldn't happen 

                until well into the 2020s.) Because of the "banking and trading" 

                provisions of the Administration proposal, its pollution targets 

                might not be achieved until around the same time frame. As our 

                colleagues at the Environmental Integrity Project have noted, 

                the Administration's alleged "pollution caps" would not be met 

                even by 2026! </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Would exempt 

                affected smokestack plants from new source review requirements, 

                meaning that existing plants could legally increase their pollution. 

                These plants would also avoid the current requirements to use 

                the cleanest possible technology (the "lowest achievable emission 

                rate") and to offset any increased pollution in areas with unhealthful 

                air. In other words, they could cause more public health damage 

                in areas that already have dirty air. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Lets other 

                smokestack industries off the hook. The Administration would allow 

                every major industrial source built or modified in "transitional" 

                areas to make health problems worse by evading current requirements 

                to offset new emissions and use the cleanest possible technology. 

                In other words, the Administration would grant new loopholes to 

                refineries, chemical plants, paper mills, cement plants and other 

                smokestack factories. All would be allowed to belch out more pollution 

                in areas that already have dirty air. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Would help 

                the road-building lobby. The bill would also help the road-building 

                highway lobby (cement, asphalt, etc.) by exempting "transitional" 

                areas from requirements that transportation plans dovetail with 

                state air quality plans. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Throws much-touted 

                future emission reductions in doubt. The Administration plan would 

                require EPA, in "consultation" with the Department of Energy, 

                to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of the "second phase" of emission 

                limits (slated for 2018). In 2009, EPA would report the findings 

                separately for each pollutant to Congress, which could then change 

                the emission limits. (This raises the very real prospect that 

                EPA could declare that emission reductions for nitrogen oxides 

                and mercury don't pass the cost test; certainly industry would 

                make that argument as it has in the past. EPA and the Department 

                of Energy would also examine the impact of controls on "fuel diversity" 

                and "electric reliability" - buzzwords used by industry to block 

                pollution controls.) </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Would permit 

                any industrial plant that emits sulfur dioxide or nitrogen oxides 

                pollution "only through a stack or duct" to take advantage of 

                all the bill's loopholes. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Would eliminate 

                current mercury pollution standards for electric power plants. 

                Under existing law, mercury pollution would be reduced by up to 

                90 percent -- by December 2007 under a prior legal consent agreement. 

                These standards would be repealed under the Administration plan, 

                which would delay any reduction in mercury until 2010. Even in 

                2018 - more than a decade later than the deadline under current 

                law - mercury emissions could be higher than current law would 

                require in 2007. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Would permit 

                "hot spots" of toxic mercury. The Administration plan would permit 

                electric power companies to "trade" emission "credits" for mercury 

                - something that cannot be done under existing law. Indeed, existing 

                law does not permit trading of any toxic air pollutant. Under 

                the Administration plan, some plants could actually increase their 

                mercury emissions. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Would eliminate 

                "residual risk" requirements for mercury. Existing law says EPA 

                must require additional mercury controls if the first phase of 

                controls - which are technology-based - continues to leave people 

                at risk. The Administration bill would kill this requirement.

                power plants until after 2018. Under existing law, standards for 

                other toxic pollutants are to be met by December 2007. </font>

                standard rather than a "best available technology" standard that 

                achieves greater emission reductions over time as technology evolves. 

                Indeed, the Administration plan would ensure that new plants are 

                built with obsolete technology. </font>

                Technology" or BART requirement). It would also eliminate requirements 

                for new electric power plants that could harm national parks. 

                Requirements would be maintained only for sources within 50 kilometers 

                (30 miles) of a national park, even though sources hundreds of

                standards. This, in effect, would repeal the "nondegredation" 

                provisions of existing law that are designed to protect clean-air

                upwind states' interstate cleanup before 2012; afterwards, the
