                - April 14 - People For the American Way Foundation President 

                Ralph G. Neas requested that the Army conduct a formal investigation 

                into a published report that an Army chaplain in Iraq has been 

                requiring soldiers to attend a sermon and accept a Christian baptism 

                before being allowed access to a scarce pool of water for bathing. 

                According to a news report from April 2, 2003, an Army chaplain 

                stated, "It's simple. They want water. I have it, as long as they 

                get baptized." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Obviously, 

                if this press report is accurate, a very serious violation of 

                the soldiers' First Amendment rights is occurring. The Constitution 

                forbids the government from coercing soldiers into being baptized 

                or proselytized to in order to gain access to bathing water or 

                any other resources," Neas said in a letter sent to Army Secretary 

                Thomas White. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to 

                the report, soldiers are first required to attend a one and a 

                half hour sermon in the chaplain's tent, and then spend another 

                hour being baptized, during which Bible quotes are recited. "It 

                is utterly unacceptable, if this report is true, that Americans 

                risking their lives in combat are being asked to relinquish their 

                freedom of religion," the letter continued. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Neas also asked 

                that the Army Secretary "immediately issue a directive making 

                it clear that no members of the American military can lawfully 

                be put in a coercive position in which they are only able to obtain 

                access to water, food, or any other resource by 'voluntarily' 

                submitting to a religious practice." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Read the letter
