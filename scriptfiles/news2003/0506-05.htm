-  

May 6 - With students and professors finishing up final exams and incoming college freshman finalizing their college plans, today the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force (NGLTF) Policy Institute released the largest-ever study of the climate on U.S. college campuses toward gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender (GLBT) students, faculty and staff. Campus Climate for Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender People: A National Perspective, authored by Dr. Susan R. Rankin, found that more than one in three GLBT undergraduate students have experienced anti-gay harassment within the past year. Almost 1700 students, faculty, administrators and staff in 14 colleges and universities throughout the country were surveyed for the report.

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"It is extremely alarming that, in 2003, people on college campuses continue to experience anti-GLBT harassment," said National Gay and Lesbian Task Force Executive Director Lorri L. Jean. "Higher learning institutions should be at the forefront of educating people about the damage of homophobic and transphobic acts. Because most of the fourteen universities surveyed provide visible support through pro-GLBT policies and resources, we can only imagine the extent of homophobia on college campuses across the country." 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Campus Climate reveals that almost a fifth of respondents had feared for their physical safety in the last year because of their sexual orientation or gender identity, and 43 percent considered the climate of their campus to be homophobic. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Other findings include: 





- 41 percent of the respondents stated that their college/university was not addressing issues related to sexual orientation or gender identity;

- 51 percent of the respondents concealed their sexual orientation or gender identity to avoid intimidation; and,

- 71 percent felt that transgender people were likely to suffer harassment, and 61 percent felt that gay men and lesbians were likely to be harassed.

"While there have been significant improvements over the past decade, clearly harassment and bias are still major concerns for GLBT students, faculty and staff," said Dr. Sean Cahill, NGLTF Policy Institute Director. "Almost all of the universities that agreed to participate in the survey have sexual orientation nondiscrimination policies and/or GLBT campus centers. However, most of the United States' more than 5,500 colleges and universities don't have such policies or programs in effect." 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While most universities and colleges publicly commit to creating a welcoming and inclusive environment, their actions and policies often do not support these goals. In March 2003, Virginia Tech's governing board voted to eliminate its affirmative action policy and to remove sexual orientation from its nondiscrimination policy. When Virginia Tech students and staff protested, the university reinstated both policies. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An April 24, 2003 story in the California San Diego Union-Tribune reported that frustrated by a resurgence of racially and sexually motivated incidents, dozens of University of San Diego students and faculty walked out of classes and urged the administration to address anti-gay, racist and anti-Semitic sentiments on campus. Recent incidents cited by the paper included anti-gay graffiti scratched on a student's apartment door. The University of Southern California's Pridefest has been marred by anti-gay vandalism in recent years. And activists at universities across the country complain that signs for GLBT student activities are regularly ripped down and covered with anti-GLBT graffiti. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Many GLBT campus members find that they must hide significant parts of their identity, thereby isolating themselves socially or emotionally," said Dr. Susan R. Rankin, Campus Climate author and lead researcher. "Those who do not hide their sexual orientation or gender identity have a range of experiences including discrimination, verbal or physical harassment, and subtle or outright silencing. While higher education provides a variety of opportunities for students and others, these are greatly limited for those who fear for their safety, feel they must censor themselves, or are denied opportunities because of their sexual orientation or gender identity," said Rankin, a Senior Diversity Planning Analyst at the Pennsylvania State University. "We hope this report will assist educators, activists, student leaders and elected officials in making universities safer and more accepting of GLBT people."

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Campus Climate makes policy recommendations to universities and colleges that are seeking to create a truly inclusive environment that supports and values all, including: 



</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">- Extending employee spousal benefits to domestic partners;

- Including sexual orientation and gender identity or expression in the institution's nondiscrimination clause;

- Integrating GLBT concerns into university documents/publications;

- Providing a clear, safe, visible means of reporting acts of intolerance and responding expeditiously to such acts; and,

- Including sexual orientation and gender identity issues in orientation programs and employee trainings.

The Campus Climate Assessment Survey, which serves as the basis for this report, was a collaborative project involving NGLTF, the National Association of Student Personnel Administrators, and the National Consortium of Directors of LGBT Resources in Higher Education.
