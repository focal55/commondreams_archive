                YORK - March 26 - The Pentagon can be expected to claim that its 

                bombing campaign against Iraq is accurate. But without independent 

                verification, reporters should be skeptical about these claims 

                about &quot;precision&quot; bombing.</font> 

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Recent reports 

                  on NBC News illustrate the opposite tendency. Correspondent 

                  Bob Faw (3/20/03) described a Florida town as &quot;a community 

                  which very much endorses that surgical strike against Saddam 

                  Hussein.&quot; Anchor Katie Couric (3/21/03) also referred to 

                  &quot;a series of surgical strikes focusing on Iraq's key leadership&quot; 

                  during the first two nights of bombing. Anchor Matt Lauer (3/21/03) 

                  agreed: &quot;The people in that city have endured two nights 

                  of surgical air strikes and they've no idea what could come 

                  tonight.&quot;</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pentagon 

                  correspondent Jim Miklaszewski (3/21/03) took it a step further, 

                  reporting that &quot;every weapon is precision guided-- deadly 

                  accuracy designed to kill only the targets, not innocent civilians.&quot; 

                  On the Today show the next morning (3/22/03), Miklaszewski reiterated 

                  his point: &quot;More than a thousand bombs and missiles were 

                  dropped on Baghdad, three times the number from the entire Gulf 

                  War. And this time, they're all precision-guided, deadly accurate, 

                  designed to kill only the targets, not innocent civilians.&quot;</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">That same 

                  day, reporter Chris Jansing sized up &quot;the first daylight 

                  pictures of severe damage from yesterday's massive and incredibly 

                  precise air assault on the Iraqi capital.&quot;</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But on-the-ground 

                  reports from the scene of the bombings would be necessary before 

                  making any definitive claims about &quot;surgical&quot; strikes. 

                  </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When allegations 

                  are made about civilian deaths and destruction from the bombing, 

                  the stories are treated with skepticism, often framed as claims 

                  made by the Iraqis: &quot;The BBC and the Arab network Al-Jazeera 

                  have devoted significant time to what Iraq suggested were innocent 

                  victims targeted in the bombings&quot; (NBC Nightly News, 3/22/03).</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Yet it is 

                  plain that some bombs are going off course. Syrian civilians 

                  in a bus in northern Iraq were killed in one attack, two cruise 

                  missiles have landed in Turkey (Dateline NBC, 3/23/03) and several 

                  missiles have reportedly hit southwestern Iran (Washington Post, 

                  3/24/03).</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some reporters 

                  in Baghdad have been able to document some of the civilian effects 

                  of the bombing; John Daniszewski reported in the Los Angeles 

                  Times (3/25/03) that &quot;the deaths and injuries from misdirected 

                  or errant bombs, or from shrapnel and fragments that spray into 

                  nearby homes even when the munitions find their intended target, 

                  are making more and more people believe that the United States 

                  is heedless of the Iraqi public.&quot; Such information gives 

                  some needed perspective about claims of &quot;precision&quot; 

                  or &quot;surgical&quot; bombardment.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ACTION: 

                  Ask NBC to avoid using terms like &quot;precision&quot; or &quot;surgical&quot; 

                  to describe the bombing of Iraq. Encourage them to exercise 

                  skepticism about the claims coming from both sides regarding 

                  the bombing.</font></p>
