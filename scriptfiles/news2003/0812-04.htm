- August 12 - Today, a reform proposal for single-payer National Health Insurance -- 

endorsed by thousands of physicians, including two former Surgeon 

Generals and hundreds of medical school deans and professors -- is being 

released.  The proposal will appear in the August 13 Journal of the 

American Medical Association.  </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Only one candidate for President, Dennis Kucinich, is cosponsor of a 

National Health Insurance bill in Congress and has made that issue a 

centerpiece of his campaign.  Congressman Kucinich issued this statement 

today:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This is a historic day with thousands of doctors backing healthcare 

reform that addresses the key obstacle to universal coverage: private 

health insurance.  Doctors have seen this obstacle up close.  Private 

insurers add little to healthcare except waste, paperwork, marketing and 

advertising costs, profits, high executive salaries and sales 

commissions.  Insurance firms don't heal or treat the sick, but they 

soak up huge amounts of resources that should go to treatment. Our 

country is already paying for national healthcare; we're just not 

getting it.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Other Democratic presidential candidates propose tinkering with a 

flawed, bureaucratic system dominated by private insurance.  But 

incremental changes haven't gotten our country anywhere close to 

universal coverage.  As thousands of physicians are telling us, National 

Health Insurance is the cost-effective solution.&quot;</font></p>
