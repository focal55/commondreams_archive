Sharoni is professor of peace and conflict studies and

Middle East politics at Evergreen State College and executive director of the

Peace and Justice Studies Association. She is participating in a series of

events with other groups in and around the United Nations this Thursday,

marking the 36th anniversary of the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and

Gaza Strip. These groups will be urging a number of steps for peace, including

the application of U.N. Security Council resolutions that Israel has been

violating. They also advocate placing international observers in the occupied

territories to help defuse the situation. The U.S. government cast the sole

&quot;no&quot; vote on such a proposal at the U.N. Security Council in March

2001, blocking the proposal.

Associate professor of philosophy at Georgetown University,

Lance said today: &quot;The 'roadmap' does not require solutions to any of the

significant obstacles to a just or peaceful settlement: the rights of

Palestinian refugees, the removal of settlements, the return of Arab portions

of Jerusalem, or equitable distribution of water rights. Without these issues

being solved, there is no prospect for a solution that will present

Palestinians with a livable state.... Israel continues to receive massive U.S.

economic and military aid, receives the most sophisticated U.S. weapons,

continues to build its nuclear arsenal without comment, receives U.S.

intelligence and diplomatic cover, and has been given no reason to think that

any of this would be withdrawn.... So long as this unquestioned support from

the world's dominant military power continues, there is not the slightest

chance of any legitimate roadmap being implemented.&quot; Lance noted that

currently the West Bank is broken up into many Palestinian patches, with Israel

having overall control. A map is available at:<BR>
