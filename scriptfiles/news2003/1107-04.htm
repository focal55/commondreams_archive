- November 7 - Egypt should investigate and discipline police and plainclothes 
security officials who beat demonstrators protesting the Iraq war and tortured 
some of those detained, Human Rights Watch said in a report released today.</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In 
the 40-page report, Security Forces Abuse of Anti-War Demonstrators, Human Rights 
Watch documented excessive use of force by security forces to disperse demonstrators 
protesting the U.S.-led war against Iraq in March, violating their right to freedom 
of assembly. After arresting hundreds of protesters, police then beat and mistreated 
many detainees, some to the point of torture, and failed to provide medical care 
to persons seriously injured.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Plainclothes 
officers viciously attacked protestors with pipes and clubs, and arrested demonstrators 
and bystanders without cause. Then the jailers beat those they considered to be 
the ringleaders,&quot; said Joe Stork, acting executive director of the Middle 
East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch. &quot;The government has 
an obligation to carry out an impartial inquiry and hold accountable those responsible 
for this brutal behavior.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">On 
March 21, following a massive but largely peaceful public protest the previous 
day against the Iraq war, Egyptian security forces attacked would-be demonstrators 
and bystanders in and around Cairo's Tahrir Square, beating many with clubs and 
pipes, arresting persons arbitrarily and preventing them from gathering to protest 
U.S. and Egyptian government policies. Later the same day, plainclothes security 
forces attacked a peaceful sit-in at the headquarters of the Egyptian Bar Association, 
where they beat and arrested a number of defense lawyers and two members of parliament.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The 
government should make public the names of these security officials who were responsible 
for ordering, carrying out or condoning these attacks,&quot; Stork said.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Most 
of the some 800 persons arrested that day were released within 24 hours, but 61 
were held for investigation and charged with destruction of property, promoting 
disorder and other offenses. Over the following weeks, other alleged activists 
and demonstration leaders were detained unlawfully, and some were tortured in 
detention. Most were subsequently released, but the charges against them have 
not been dismissed.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Human 
Rights Watch called on the government to dismiss charges against persons detained 
solely for attempting to exercise their right of free assembly.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;If 
the government has any evidence of criminal wrongdoing, it should promptly bring 
those persons to a fair trial,&quot; Stork said.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Ashraf 
Ibrahim, an engineer and antiwar activist, goes to trial on December 16 before 
a Higher Emergency State Security Court on charges of, among other things, &quot;sending 
false information to foreign bodies-foreign human rights organizations-which include, 
contrary to the truth, violations of human rights within the country.&quot; Security 
forces arrested him on April 12 and held him for nearly four months before the 
Higher State Security Prosecution Office indicted him on August 7 under Egypt's 
emergency legislation. Human Rights Watch believes that the charges against Ibrahim 
criminalize most forms of peaceful dissent, and has called on the government to 
drop the charges and release him immediately and unconditionally.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Egypt:
