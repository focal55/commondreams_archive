He wants you to get up at 5 am and find all the early-bird, Not-Buying opportunities you can. Then, at 1pm in front of the Plaza Hotel, join Reverend Billy and The Church of Stop Shopping to celebrate Buy Nothing Day, the largest Not-Buying Day of the Year. This year&#146;s Buy Nothing Day celebration is doubly special, as Reverend Billy travels through the night to preside over Buy Nothing Day UK, which is exactly the same as ours, only celebrants will Not-Buy using the Metric System.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><I>&quot;Children. American Consumerism is funny, because it&#146;s an addiction,<BR>but it&#146;s sad, because it kills people who don&#146;t rush to buy. Now, at the High <BR>Holy Day of the Stop Shopping Church, let us insert into the mono-mind this<BR>idea: SAVE YOUR SOUL! STOP SHOPPING!&quot;</I></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">This year&#146;s Buy Nothing Day festivities will include a State-of-the-Dollar-Buy-Nothing-Everyday sermon and the ecstatic, harmonious shamanism of the Stop Shopping Gospel Choir. Meanwhile, Retail Interventionists and Not-Buying Missionaries will artfully educate those lost souls who have forsaken Not-Buying. Tactical theater and retail mischief will slow down the purchase sins of desperate holiday shoppers who should be home with their families or Not-Buying with the rest of decent folk. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Festivities will culminate in a march to flagship sin pits like Nike, Gap, Disney and Starbucks, where Church members will distribute literature so shoppers may see how their spending habits propagate sweatshop economies and aggressive foreign policy.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Reverend Billy and The Church of Stop Shopping want to escape the destructive consumer cycle and step into the Bright Unclaimed Space beyond sweatshops, logofication and predatory SUV&#146;s. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><I>Reverend Billy is the creation of actor Bill Talen. The New Press will release his book, &quot;What Should I Do If Reverend Billy is in My Store?&quot; on Buy Nothing Day, but don&#146;t buy it then. Seriously. Just wait a couple days. It will still be there.</I><BR></FONT></P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p></font><!-- #EndEditable --></td></tr>
