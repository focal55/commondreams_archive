- April 29 - A PIPA/Knowledge 

Networks poll finds that, while strongly endorsing the war with Iraq, 

the public does not support its momentum carrying over into 

a changed U.S. role in the world. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Majorities reject emphasizing a more unilateral or more militarily 

oriented approach to dealing with world problems in general, as well 

as dealing with the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Seventy-five percent approve of U.S. policy on Iraq and Americans 

show more confidence than at the beginning of the war that the 

consequences of the war will be positive. Majorities said that, 

as a result of the war, Iran (68 percent) and Syria (62 percent) 

would be less rather than more inclined to make weapons or mass 

destruction, though for North Korea the response was divided. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;At the same time, the public's enthusiasm for the Iraq war is 

highly compartmentalized,&quot; explains Steven Kull, director of the 

Program on International Policy Attitudes. &quot;There is no evidence 

of a spill-over into other areas.&quot; Only one in five (21 percent) 

supports the idea of going to war with Syria and two out of three 

(67 percent) want the U.S. to pull its troops out of Saudi Arabia 

once Iraq is stabilized. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Asked what role the U.S. should play in the world, the response 

is the same as before the war: only a small minority (12 percent) 

opted for the U.S. being &quot;the preeminent world leader,&quot; while an 

overwhelming 76 percent said &quot;the U.S. should do its share in 

efforts to solve international problems together with other 

countries.&quot; Sixty-two percent still say, &quot;The US plays the role 

of world policeman more than it should.&quot; Only 38 percent agree 

that &quot;The U.S. has the right and even the responsibility to 

overthrow dictatorships.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Support for working through the U.N. is still strong, despite 

the failure to get Security Council approval for the war against 

Iraq. Asked, &quot;Looking back, do you think that it was the right 

thing to do or a mistake for the U.S. to have tried to get U.N. 

authorization to take military action against Iraq?&quot; an 

overwhelming 88 percent said it was. Sixty-one percent said that 

in the future the U.S. should not feel more free to use military 

force without UN authorization. Majorities favor the U.N. 

rather than the U.S. taking the lead in dealing with Syria (61 

percent), Iran (57 percent) and North Korea (67 percent). </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The public divides on whether the U.N. or the U.S. should manage 

the development of the new Iraq government. However, clear 

majorities favor the U.N. directing humanitarian relief and 

economic reconstruction (57 percent) and continuing to manage the 

oil for food program (70 percent). Only 29 percent said the U.S. 

military should be responsible for relief and reconstruction 

efforts. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Even when it comes to maintaining civil order in Iraq, 54 

percent preferred &quot;a U.N. police force of police officers from 

various countries&quot; rather than the U.S. military. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Beyond this, 73 percent say that it is necessary to get the 

participation of a substantial number of other countries in the 

process of reconstruction, with 66 percent saying that it is 

necessary to get Arab countries involved. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Overall, the public is showing unflagging and overwhelming 

support for an ambitious reconstruction effort in Iraq. 

Eighty-six percent said that the U.S. has &quot;the responsibility to 

remain in Iraq as long as necessary until there is a stable 

government,&quot; with the median estimate that this will take two 

years. Even when presented the argument that &quot;We shouldn't spend 

money on rebuilding Iraq when we have so many problems here at 

home,&quot; 73 percent rejected it in favor of the argument that 

leaving Iraq &quot;would be unwise and immoral.&quot; Expectations for 

what will be achieved are high: 72 percent said the U.S. should 

not leave until a government has been elected and there are laws 

that protect human rights. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite the president's popularity, an overwhelming 77 percent 

rejected the idea that &quot;Congress should give the president full 

control over the way money is spent on Iraq assistance and 

reconstruction,&quot; opting instead for Congress retaining oversight. </font></p>
