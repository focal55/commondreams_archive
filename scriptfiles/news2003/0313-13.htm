                - March 13 -<i>&quot;All Members shall settle their international

disputes by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and

security, and justice, are not endangered. All Members shall refrain in their

international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial

integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner

inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.... The parties to any

dispute, the continuance of which is likely to endanger the maintenance of

international peace and security, shall, first of all, seek a solution by

negotiation, enquiry, mediation, conciliation, arbitration, judicial

settlement, resort to regional agencies or arrangements, or other peaceful

means of their own choice.&quot;</i><BR>

<p><i>&quot;We must make clear to the Germans that the wrong

for which their fallen leaders are on trial is not that they lost the war, but

that they started it. And we must not allow ourselves to be drawn into a trial

of the causes of the war, for our position is that no grievances or policies

will justify resort to aggressive war. It is utterly renounced and condemned as

an instrument of policy.&quot;</i><br>

                  President of the Center for Constitutional Rights, Ratner said 

                  today: &quot;The U.S. government is already violating the U.N. 

                  Charter by its threatened use of force and current bombing of 

                  Iraq. Bush is going the 'last mile' with diplomacy -- the last 

                  mile to coerce other members and get a fig leaf for war.&quot; 

                  Ratner has written about the &quot;Uniting for Peace&quot; resolution 

                  (337) which allows the General Assembly to call an emergency 

                  session when the Security Council is split on how to maintain 

                  international peace and security.

                  Rodriguez said today: &quot;The U.S. government is not continuing
