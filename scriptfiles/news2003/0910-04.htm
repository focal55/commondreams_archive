- September 10 - Americans for Democratic Action (ADA), the nation's oldest independent liberal political organization, applauds the United States Senate for rejecting new Labor Department measures that would have cost workers untold millions of dollars in overtime compensation. Senator Harkin (D-IA) introduced an amendment to the Labor/HHS appropriations bill that would block these new overtime rules. The amendment passed by a vote of 54-45 with six Republicans joining 47 Democrats and 1 Independent in voting to compensate workers for their toil.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The proposed rules would have stripped overtime protections and pay from approximately 8 million workers in the midst of a harsh economic climate. One positive from the Department of Labor proposal is a redefinition of the salary threshold to reflect inflation; however this hardly excuses the overall destructive nature of the measure.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This is just the latest attempt by a decidedly anti-worker Bush Administration,&quot; said Amy Isaacs, ADA National Director, &quot;to undermine workers' rights and benefits. The Senate stood up for America's workers today by blocking this underhanded move.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The debate will be moved into a joint conference and ADA urges conferees to protect a worker's right to overtime pay.  &quot;At a time when the national poverty rate is at its highest levels in recent memory, to do anything less simply would be unconscionable,&quot; said Isaacs.</font></p>
