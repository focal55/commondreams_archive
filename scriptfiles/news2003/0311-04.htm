                - March 11 - "Common Cause is concerned about the precedent of 

                the United States declaring that it can act unilaterally in a 

                pre-emptive war," said Derek Bok, chairman of Common Cause's national 

                governing board. "We fear such an action will weaken international 

                law and make the world less safe as other nations see pre-emptive 

                war as an accepted means of dealing with potential threats to 

                their security." </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Common Cause's 

                national governing board on Saturday approved the following resolution: 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Preemptive 

                war is an extremely hazardous step that should be undertaken only 

                under grave and immediate threat to the United States or its allies 

                or when the use of force is supported by a very broad coalition 

                of nations and every reasonable means of resolving the crisis 

                peacefully has been exhausted. Because these conditions have not 

                been fully met, the National Governing Board of Common Cause is 

                opposed to a decision at this time by the United States to initiate 

                a war against Iraq. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Common Cause 

                first voiced concern about war with Iraq last October. The organization 

                took out two full-page advertisements in the New York Times and 

                aired a series of radio ads urging Congress to more fully debate 

                a resolution giving President Bush the authority to commit U.S. 

                troops in Iraq. Those ads resulted in more than 17,600 citizen 

                calls and faxes to Members of Congress. </font>

                takes seriously its historic role as the "people's lobby." In 

                addition to the response from the ads, Common Cause heard from 

                a number of its state organizations, which requested the national 

                governing board to formally oppose war with Iraq at this time.

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This resolution 

                reflects the views of thousands of our members," Bok said. "We
