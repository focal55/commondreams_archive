WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Green contenders for the

party's national nomination, elected Greens, and

other party activists and candidates will gather

from Thursday, July 18 through Sunday, July 20

for the annual national meeting of the Green

Party of the United States, to be held at the

Mayflower Hotel in Washington, D.C.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Prospective and declared presidential candidates

David Cobb, Carol Miller, and Lorna Salzman

(Green activists from Texas, New Mexico, and New

York, respectively) have confirmed their

participation in a Saturday evening, July 19

press conference and reception.  Cynthia McKinney

has not responded yet; Ralph Nader and New York

Green activist Paul Glover will send statements. 

The press conference begins at 6:30 p.m., the

reception at 7:30 p.m.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A press conference scheduled for Friday, July 18

at noon will feature Green elected officials, party leaders, and Greens from other countries. 

Speakers will talk about local and national plans

for the 2004 election season and the continuing

growth of the party.  Green Party membership

increased over 27% in the two years after the

2000 election, according to Ballot Access News;

all other national parties lost membership.  More

Greens than ever before are expected to run for

office in 2004, and the party looks forwarded to

breaking new ground, including a possible seat or

two in Congress.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The conventional wisdom after 2000 was that the

Greens would wither away,&quot; said national Green

Party co-chair Ben Manski.  &quot;The last several

years have proven the pundits incorrect.  Going

into 2004, the Greens are thriving.  With this

meeting, we are at the cusp of becoming a major

player in American politics.&quot;</font></p>
