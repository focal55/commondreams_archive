- October 22 - The American Medical Student Association (AMSA), the nation's largest, independent medical student organization, condemns legislation that bans &quot;partial-birth&quot; abortion procedures. The measure, which the Senate passed late last night and the House passed earlier this month, states that it is a crime for doctors to deliberately kill &quot;a living fetus&quot; that has been partially removed from a pregnant woman's body-punishable by up to two years in prison.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Senate overwhelmingly approved the legislation (64 to 34), marking the nation's first federal ban on a form of abortion since Roe v. Wade.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AMSA policy officially opposes the prohibition of intact dilation and extraction abortion and believes that all women should be able to obtain a voluntary abortion. The proposed legislation, which will soon be signed by President George W. Bush, inserts politics into the examination room and will prevent physicians from providing the best and safest health care for women.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Abortion should be a decision between a patient and her physician, without the interference of any third party,&quot; says Lauren Oshman, M.D., M.P.H., National President of AMSA. &quot;Congress has created a political entity, the 'partial birth abortion,' that does not exist in medical education or medical textbooks. This ban directly and inappropriately interferes with the practice of medicine and the patient-physician relationship and prevents women from making decisions about their own health. That is not only dangerous, but unconstitutional.&quot; </font></p>
