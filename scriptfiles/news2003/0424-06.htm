- April 24 - Muslim activists from 

across the United States will take to Capitol Hill on Friday to 

lobby against the controversial nomination of Daniel Pipes to the 

board of the taxpayer-funded United States Institute of Peace 

(USIP). </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Those activists, participants in the Council on American-Islamic 

Relations' (CAIR) Annual Leadership Conference, will spend the day 

hearing from Muslim congressional staffers, taking part in a 

lobbying training session and then meeting with elected officials 

or their key staff to discuss Pipes' nomination and civil liberties 

issues of concern to Muslim voters. The three day conference, with 

the theme &quot;A Roadmap for Success: Vision and Action,&quot; includes the 

Friday lobbying, weekend workshops on leadership skills and 

political empowerment and a Saturday night banquet. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pipes, regarded by many Muslims as the nation's leading 

Islamophobe, said this week that President Bush should not have 

called Islam a &quot;religion of peace,&quot; claimed Israel has the right to &quot;raze&quot; Palestinian villages and twice refused to condemn the 

internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II. Bush recently 

nominated Pipes to the USIP board. His nomination must be confirmed 

by the Senate. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Mr. Pipes' nomination runs counter to the president's repeated 

declarations that the war on terrorism is not an attack on Islam. 

His extremist and militant views serve to promote unending 

conflict, not peace,&quot; said CAIR Executive Director Nihad Awad. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Over the weekend, the Washington Post published an editorial 

critical of Pipes' nomination. The Post said the Senate &quot;should 

have the good sense to turn (the nomination) down.&quot; The Dallas 

Morning News called Pipes a &quot;bad choice&quot; for the board. In the 

Jewish Forward, Judith Kipper, a senior fellow at the Center for 

Strategic and International Studies, said Pipes &quot;has very extreme 

views.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A number of Muslim and Arab-American-groups have come out 

against Pipes' nomination saying he has a long history of 

advocating the political marginalization of America's Islamic 

community. The groups point to an October 21, 2001, speech to the 

American Jewish Congress, in which Pipes warned of the &quot;true 

dangers&quot; posed by &quot;the presence, and increased stature, and 

affluence, and enfranchisement of American Muslims.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pipes has also called for increased surveillance of ordinary 

American Muslims, claims 10 percent to 15 percent of Muslims are &quot;potential killers,&quot; has decried any positive portrayal of Islamic 

history and beliefs in public schools, and termed the PBS 

documentary &quot;Muhammad: Legacy of a Prophet&quot; an &quot;outrage.&quot; Last 

year, he faced a storm of criticism when he launched Campus Watch, 

a web site that included &quot;dossiers&quot; on professors and academic 

institutions thought to be too critical of Israel or too 

sympathetic to Islam and Muslims. </font></p>
