(hosted locally by Arise for Social Justice with many co-sponsors).  We have the audio (both MP3 and RealAudio) with Q and A <a href="http://traprockpeace.org" target="_new">here</a>.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This is an important talk. Rokke, one of the world's experts on the dangers

of the US military's use of 'depleted' uranium munitions,   approached by

many veterans and their families during his tour. They told him about the veterans who are coming home sick after service in the current war in Iraq. Over 200,000 veterans from Gulf War I are on permanent disability from war related illnesses and injuries. The US government, long in denial about Gulf War Syndrome and the dramatic increase in cancer rates in parts of Iraq where DU was heavily used, is calling the current sicknesses pneumonia. How credible is the US this time?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

More is coming on DU, as we're updating our resources, and the fall DU tour with Doug is coming up (groups in 10 states are asking for events, as well as the Campus Anti-War Network).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*What's happening in Iraq? The situation is deteriorating, according to Rick McDowell and Mary Trotochaud, Iraq Country Representatives for AFSC (and former Core Group members of Traprock). Rick has been to Iraq over 15 times, and has led trips with Nobel Peace Prize winners and religious leaders. Mary is a dedicated organizer, e.g. School of the Americas actions. They have just returned from 3 months in Baghdad and are heading back after they finish their speaking tour for another 6 months. This event was sponsored by our friends at Western Mass AFSC and hosted by First Churches of Northampton..</font></p>
