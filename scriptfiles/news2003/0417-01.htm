                - April 17 - Kraft Food’s (KFT – NYSE) continued use of genetically 

                engineered foods pose unnecessary financial risk to the company 

                and its investors, according a new report entitled, “Risky Business: 

                Financial Risks that Genetically Engineered Foods Pose to Kraft 

                Foods, Inc. and Shareholders.” </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report 

                reveals that Kraft’s use of genetically engineered ingredients 

                poses risk of product recalls and liability lawsuits, especially 

                with the possibility that biopharm crops—food crops genetically 

                engineered to produce prescription drugs or industrial chemicals—could 

                contaminate Kraft’s products. Other financial risks include loss 

                of competitive advantage, consumer rejection of Kraft’s products, 

                and damage to reputation resulting from increased controversy 

                surrounding these foods. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report 

                also makes the case that genetically engineered foods do not offer 

                financial benefits to Kraft or marketable benefits to consumers. 

                Genetically engineered crops may even cost more to produce than 

                non-genetically engineered counterparts. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“Continued 

                use of genetically engineered ingredients is a no-win situation 

                for Kraft and shareholders,” stated Kate Madigan, advocate for 

                the state Public Interest Research Groups and author of the report. 

                “Kraft is gambling with controversial ingredients when there is 

                nothing to gain from doing so.” </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The financial 

                risks of genetically engineered foods became evident with the 

                StarLink contamination of the food supply in 2000, which is estimated 

                to have cost the food industry billions of dollars. StarLink is 

                a variety of genetically engineered corn that was not approved 

                for human consumption because of concerns that it might trigger 

                allergic reactions. StarLink was first discovered in Kraft’s Taco 

                Bell brand taco shells and Kraft’s brand name has been linked 

                with genetically engineered foods ever since. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“Kraft derives 

                no financial or nutritional benefit from using genetically engineered 

                foods, there is no consumer demand for these products and the 

                massive recall of Kraft products has already proven them to be 

                a liability,” stated Michael Passoff of As You Sow Foundation. 

                “Kraft shareholders have a right to know about the risks their 

                investments are exposed to, especially if these risks can be avoided.” 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In response 

                to these financial risks and to the growing consumer demand for 

                non-genetically engineered foods, many U.S. food companies have 

                already removed genetically engineered ingredients from their 

                products, including Frito-Lay, Gerber, McDonald’s, and supermarket 

                chain Trader Joe’s. These manufacturers reported no financial 

                difficulties resulting from the switch and sales increased in 

                most cases as a result. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“Kraft has 

                already removed genetically engineered ingredients from its products 

                in Europe,” stated Rebecca O’Malley, program director for ecopledge.com, 

                an organization that organizes students, consumers, and investors 

                to influence corporate social and environmental responsibility. 

                “These financial risks can be avoided and Kraft knows how to avoid 

                them. The company needs to finish the job and remove these ingredients 

                from the rest of its products.” </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to 

                the report, current FDA regulations do not shield Kraft from liability 

                lawsuits and other financial risks posed by genetically engineered 

                foods.
