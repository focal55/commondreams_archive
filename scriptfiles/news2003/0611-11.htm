<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SAN FRANCISCO, CA - June 11 - Bluewater Network is placing a full-page advocacy ad in the New York Times this weekend calling on consumers to boycott Ford Motor Company. The ad targets Ford just as the company celebrates its centennial anniversary. The group was prompted to place the ad because of Ford&#146;s broken promise to increase SUV fuel mileage and a growing concern about global warming, air pollution, and risky dependence on foreign oil due to an increasingly inefficient U.S. vehicle fleet.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The <a href="http://www.bluewaternetwork.org/press_releases/pr2003jun11_gl_nytimes.pdf" target="_new">ad</a>  features a caricature of Bill Ford with a Pinocchio nose and reads, &quot;Bill Ford Jr. or Pinocchio? Don&#146;t Buy His Environmental Rhetoric. Don&#146;t Buy His Cars.&quot; It also has a clip-off letter for consumers to pledge not to buy a Ford vehicle until the company builds cleaner vehicles and lobbies Congress for doubled fuel mileage standards.</font></p>

<p> </p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Last year, after countless public statements vowing corporate environmental stewardship, Bill Ford Jr. personally lobbied Congress against increasing fuel mileage standards. And last month, Ford Motor Company reneged on its July 2000 pledge to increase SUV fuel mileage by 25 percent. The increase would have reduced greenhouse gas pollution and protected public health. It also could have resulted in industry-wide fuel economy improvements, since General Motors and Chrysler had pledged to meet or beat Ford&#146;s goal.</font></p>

<p> </p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to a Union of Concerned Scientists report on model year 2001 vehicles, Ford&#146;s cars and trucks are less efficient than the average for other five major U.S. auto sellers. In many size classes, Ford&#146;s most popular models have the lowest fuel economy in the industry.</font></p>

<p> </p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Ford has misled the American public with their environmental promises,&#148; said Russell Long, Executive Director of Bluewater Network. &#147;It&#146;s like being led down the garden path and then shot in the back.&#148;</font></p>

<p> </p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The ad is the latest step in a growing effort to pressure Ford Motor Company to keep its promises. Hundreds of protesters are expected at Ford&#146;s centennial celebration in Detroit this weekend. Bluewater Network will hire a plane to fly a banner over Ford&#146;s anniversary events, saying &#147;Ford broke pledge to protect the planet. Boycott Ford.&#148; And Bluewater&#146;s Executive Director will attempt to speak at Ford&#146;s Monday shareholder&#146;s meeting.</font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;After years of waiting hopefully for environmental progress, it&#146;s now clear that Ford is no friend to the planet. As a result, it&#146;s time for some tough love,&#148; said Elisa Lynch, Global Warming Campaign Director of Bluewater Network.</font></p>

<p> </p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ford has the technology to lead the automobile industry to protect America&#146;s children and future generations--they have even developed a clean, affordable hydrogen car that uses a conventional combustion engine. But consumers won&#146;t see it in showrooms anytime soon--Ford has no plans sell it.</font></p>
