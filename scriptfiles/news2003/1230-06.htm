- December 30 - The Humane Society of the United States is applauding today's announcement by Agriculture Secretary Ann Veneman that the U.S. will ban the processing of downed cattle for human consumption.</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;We are delighted with Secretary Veneman's emphatic declaration that downed cattle are unfit for human consumption and will not be channeled into the human food supply,&quot; said Wayne Pacelle, a senior vice president at The HSUS, which is the nation's largest animal protection organization.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;This decision also means that these animals will no longer be inhumanely treated by being dragged by chains or pushed by bulldozers to get them to slaughter,&quot; said Pacelle.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The HSUS wrote to Secretary Veneman on Tuesday, Dec. 23 asking her to implement this ban. The letter relayed the history of efforts by The HSUS and Farm Sanctuary (a New York-based farm animal welfare group) to ban the processing of downed animals. In 2002, both chambers of Congress passed amendments to the Farm Security Act restricting the transport of downed animals, but a conference committee nixed the provision. Earlier this year, the Senate passed an amendment banning the processing of downed animals for human consumption, but the House rejected similar language by just three votes. A conference committee struck the downed animal language on Dec. 9 -- the very day that the Holstein infected with Mad Cow Disease was processed in Washington state.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">According to USDA, there are perhaps 130,000 -- 190,000 animals that go down every year and cannot stand up again and that are presented at slaughterhouses. According to the best estimates provided by USDA for 1999 -- 2001, nearly three quarters of these animals were processed for human food -- often on the basis of only a visual inspection at slaughterhouses. Even with the stepped-up testing program of the USDA, only 10-15 percent of downed animals were tested for BSE.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;We are pleased that the government is willing to reassess its position based on the facts at hand and the overwhelming view by Americans that processing downed animals is inhumane and unsafe,&quot; said Pacelle. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The HSUS has more than eight million members and constituents. The HSUS is a mainstream voice for animals, with active programs in companion animals and equine protection, wildlife and habitat protection, animals in research and farm animals and sustainable agriculture. The HSUS has protected all animals through legislation, litigation, investigation, education, advocacy and field work. The non-profit organization, which celebrates its 50th anniversary in 2004, is based in Washington, D.C. and has 10 regional offices across the country.
