                - April 10 - In the wake of the federal conviction of medical 

                marijuana grower Ed Rosenthal -- found guilty of felony marijuana 

                cultivation charges by a jury that was not allowed to consider 

                that the marijuana was for medical use by seriously ill patients 

                and was grown with the express authorization of the city of Oakland, 

                California -- U.S. Reps. Sam Farr (D-CA), Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA), 

                and at least 23 other members of Congress today introduced legislation 

                to prevent such injustices in the future. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Truth in 

                Trials Act would allow individuals accused of violating federal 

                marijuana laws to introduce evidence in federal court that they 

                followed state law for the purpose of alleviating suffering. Defendants 

                could be found not guilty if the jury found that they followed 

                state medical marijuana laws. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Rosenthal 

                case sparked outrage nationwide, starting with the jurors who 

                felt they had been duped into convicting an innocent man. "I helped 

                send a man to prison who does not belong there," juror Marney 

                Craig wrote in a column for the San Jose Mercury News. Newspaper 

                editorial boards nationwide, including The New York Times and 

                Baltimore's The Sun, condemned the verdict, using terms like "mean-spirited" 

                and "cruel." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This is an 

                issue of states' rights, plain and simple," said Rep. Farr, lead 

                sponsor of the bill. "The voters of California have passed a medical 

                marijuana initiative, but the federal government has exhibited 

                little respect for our state's laws. Attorney General John Ashcroft 

                has insisted that his opinion is of greater consequence than the 

                citizens of California -- five million of whom voted for Proposition 

                215 in 1996 to allow doctors to recommend medical marijuana to 

                patients in pain." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This is a 

                matter of basic fairness," said Robert Kampia, executive director 

                of the Marijuana Policy Project in Washington, D.C. "Jurors who 

                could imprison someone for decades for trying to help the sick 

                have a right to hear the whole truth, not a censored version that 

                is stripped of any facts the government doesn't like." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Joining Reps. 

                Farr and Rohrabacher at a Capitol Hill press conference to announce 

                the bill's introduction was fellow sponsor Rep. Barney Frank (D-MA). 

                Also lending their support were Rosenthal juror Marney Craig; 

                Ashley Epis, eight-year-old daughter of medical marijuana grower 

                Bryan Epis, who is currently serving a 10-year federal prison 

                sentence; Valerie Corral, co-founder of the Wo/Men's Alliance 

                for Medical Marijuana, which was raided by the Drug Enforcement 

                Administration on Sept. 5, 2002; Robert Kampia, executive director 

                of the Marijuana Policy Project; and Steph Sherer of Americans 

                for Safe Access, a grassroots organization dedicated to ending 

                the federal government's war on medical marijuana. </font>

                members nationwide, the Marijuana Policy Project is the largest 

                marijuana policy reform organization in the United States. MPP 

                works to minimize the harm associated with marijuana -- both the 

                consumption of marijuana and the laws that are intended to prohibit 

                such use. MPP believes that the greatest harm associated with 

                marijuana is imprisonment. To this end, MPP focuses on removing 

                criminal penalties for marijuana use, with a particular emphasis 

                on making marijuana medically available to seriously ill people 

                who have the approval of their doctors. </font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
