                - March 23 - Amal Shamuri is the fifth child in a family of eight, 

                living in a small apartment off Baghdad's Karrada shopping district. 

                Irrepressable and precocious, Amal joked last January that she 

                wouldn't mind a war if George Bush would only bomb her school.

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today was 

                  a different story. Today, Amal celebrated her thirteenth birthday 

                  on the fourth day of American air strikes on Baghdad with plumes 

                  of black smoke surrounding the city and darkening the sky, reportedly 

                  from oil set afire by Iraqi forces defending the capitol. </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Her family 

                  and friends gathered with members of the Voices in the Wilderness' 

                  <a href="http://www.iraqpeaceteam.org" target="_new">Iraq Peace 

                  Team</a> in a small garden near the Tigris river to mark the 

                  occasion. They blew balloons and soap bubbles, strung party 

                  streamers, played tag, and ate barbequed chicken, potato salad, 

                  deviled eggs, and chocolate cake. True to form, the kids ate 

                  the cake first, before serving the rest of the meal to the adults 

                  present.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cruise missiles 

                  exploding to the south and east occasionally interrupted the 

                  party, one powerful enough to rattle tableware and partygoers 

                  alike. The explosions only temporarily silenced the festivities; 

                  but with moments the garden once again erupted to squeals of 

                  laughter and boisterous childhood games, played beneath rising 

                  plumes of air-borne debris and smoke in the distance. </font></p>

                  is more powerful than death,&quot; said Shane Claiborne, age 

                  27, from Philadelphia. &quot;How can George Bush bomb these 

                  kids?,&quot; he asked. </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Amal's mother, 

                  Kareema, sat silently to one side, watching her kids play. Her 

                  husband died in a car accident eight years ago, leaving her 

                  to raise eight children by herself. To her credit, none of them 

                  beg in the streets, and all save the oldest remain in school. 

                  Amal herself dreams of becoming a lawyer one day. </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When asked 

                  what she wanted for her birthday, Amal - who's name means &quot;hope&quot;
