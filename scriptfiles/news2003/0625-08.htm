- June 25 - REF: Permit applications [PRT-060008 and PRT-060006] for the import of wild African elephants from the Kingdom of Swaziland to the San Diego Wild Animal Park and Lowry Park Zoo.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Statement of Adam M. Roberts,

Senior Research Associate, AWI</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To Whom It May Concern:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On behalf of the Animal Welfare Institute I submit the following comments in support of Alternative 2, the no action alternative, regarding the above-referenced permit application requests.  The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service should not issue permits to allow the importation of eleven young elephants from the Kingdom of Swaziland.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Before addressing the specific information contained in the relevant Environmental Assessment (EA), it should be noted that the EA contains a startling paucity of scientific data and independent analysis.  It too frequently relies on information provided by the zoos that are requesting import permits and the Parks managers in the Kingdom of Swaziland who stand to benefit financially by the sale of these wild elephants.  Much more detailed analysis of the consequences of such an import&#151;with respect to the welfare of the individual elephants themselves, the potential detriment to the remaining wild population, the conservation and educational value of the import, and other significant factors&#151;must be addressed before any true &#147;assessment&#148; could be offered, let alone any import permit be granted.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As the opening section of the EA notes, the elephants slated for import were orphaned ten years ago from a cull in South Africa.  As the Fish and Wildlife Service is aware, South Africa has since abandoned the practice of culling its elephants.  In fact, numerous studies in Kruger National Park have, in recent years, revealed the outstanding success and potential of immunocontraception as a humane means of controlling wild animal populations.  With respect to the specific origin of these animals, they have already been ripped from their families once, at a very young age.  To grant these two import permits would be to accept implicitly a second such severing of friendship and social bonds.  These emotional connections in elephants, as is well known throughout the scientific community, are incredibly strong.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is also somewhat curious that the Background section of the document claims that &#147;Swaziland currently has 30 adult elephants plus six calves in portions of two managed areas.&#148;  This results in a total of 36 elephants.  Yet later in Section VII: &#147;&#133;from designated areas within two protected areas that have a total population of 31 adults and seven calves.&#148;  This results in a total of 38 elephants.  It is concerning that the EA does not endeavor to present a uniform total elephant population for the two protected areas in the Kingdom of Swaziland.  In either instance, should the permit applications for import be granted, the Fish and Wildlife Service would be accepting the removal of nearly one-third of a country&#146;s wild elephant population.  This is neither scientifically-based nor scientifically-sound, as will be discussed later in greater detail.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Further, in the Background portion of the document, it is noted that &#147;no formal management plan&#148; has been developed to conserve elephants and other wild animals&#151;including threatened and endangered species&#151;within the Mkhaya Game Reserve and Hlane National Park in Swaziland.  If there is no management plan in place, on what scientific basis does the Fish and Wildlife Service conclude that there would be no long-term detriment to the survival of the species within the Kingdom of Swaziland?  Though the EA suggests that the Swaziland Parks Department relies on Kruger National Parks&#146; management plan since the habitat is &#147;very similar,&#148; it does not account for the differences in size of these protected areas in the two countries, nor in the differences in size of the elephant populations in these areas.  Swaziland&#146;s Big Game Parks admits, for instance, that the entire country of Swaziland is smaller than South Africa&#146;s Kruger National Park, and while Swaziland has an estimated 36 elephants, South Africa has approximately 13,000.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The EA admits that the area dedicated to elephant protection could be expanded, but mistakenly concludes that &#147;the required financial resources are not available.&#148;  Quite the contrary, the resources are available if Big Game Parks would be willing to enter into negotiations with nongovernmental organizations that have already expressed a willingness to engage in such a partnership.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Similarly, with respect to relevant funding of internal wildlife management in the Kingdom of Swaziland, the EA suggests that the importation of these eleven elephants would secure &#147;financial support for the management of elephants in parks and game reserves, and allow for protection and eventual expansion of elephant habitat.&#148;  The EA, however, lacks significant analysis of alternative sources of funding to accomplish these same goals regarding elephant management, as well as any analysis of alternative elephant management strategies to alleviate pressure on the existing protected areas as a result of the total number of elephants in these areas.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lastly, under the Background section, the EA notes that the ESA and CITES both seek to protect listed species.  African elephants within Swaziland are listed on Appendix I of CITES, indicating that they are a species that is threatened with extinction, which is, or may be, affected by trade.  As such, the Convention mandates that such an import &#147;be for purposes which are not detrimental to the survival of the species involved,&#148; be to a destination which is &#147;suitably equipped to house and care for [the animal],&#148; and not &#147;be used for primarily commercial purposes.&#148;  This EA does not support a conclusion that the above criteria have been met.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Section II of the EA, which outlines the purpose of the proposed action, suggests that &#147;the elephants will be used for display purposes and, if possible, breeding.&#148;  Thus, the conservation value, if one exists from breeding endangered species in captivity, is of secondary value to the import.  &#147;Display,&#148; the primary purpose of this import application, brings in visitors to the zoo, which further generates revenue for the zoos.  This transaction appears to be primarily commercial (though perhaps secondarily for other purposes) in violation of CITES Article III.  Furthermore, the same paragraph of the EA notes explicitly that the zoos will be paying a total of $132,000 to Swaziland Parks Department for these elephants.    </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At the conclusion of Section II, without scientific justification or analysis, the EA states the following: &#147;The import will serve to increase the U.S. African elephant population, improve the development of more natural social relationships in elephant groups within the U.S., and provide increased educational opportunity to improve the understanding of elephants by U.S. residents.&#148;  First, the United States does not have an &#147;African elephant population.&#148;  The U.S., to the contrary, maintains African elephants in captivity.  Second, it is unclear on what basis the conclusion was reached that this importation would improve the development of natural social relationships among the elephants in captivity.  In fact, the import would accomplish the exact opposite; it will remove elephants from the natural social relationship in which they currently exist, destroy the social fabric that they have developed over the past decade, and install them in entirely artificial surroundings.  Lastly, there is no scientific data to justify the claim that this import would improve the understanding of elephants by U.S. residents.  San Diego Zoo had four elephants but has sent them all to other U.S. zoos.  Why would these specific wild elephants from Swaziland increase educational opportunities for zoo customers as opposed to the elephants they already had? </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Section III of the EA performs a cursory examination at best of the &#147;affected environment&#148; of these elephants in their current wild setting.  The EA mentions that the eleven elephants slated for import have been captured from fenced areas of more than 5,000 acres of wild habitat within two protected areas devoted to wildlife protection encompassing nearly 90,000 acres within Swaziland.  This must be juxtaposed with the four-and-a-half combined acres available in the two zoos.  How can a &#147;natural&#148; social relationship be created in such an unnaturally small enclosure for elephants?  Dr. Jeheskel Shoshani, for example, notes that an elephant&#146;s home range in the wild may vary from five to twenty square miles for cows and two hundred to six hundred square miles for bulls. (Elephants, The Deciding Decade. Sierra Club Books, San Francisco, 1991).  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Further, the EA calls San Diego&#146;s enclosure &#147;savanna-like,&#148; which highlights that it is not a savanna and, therefore, not natural.   The EA describes both enclosures as &#147;large&#148; without offering any definition of what &#147;large&#148; means&#151;large compared to what?  Though the EA asserts that both zoos &#147;intend&#148; for the enclosures to provide sufficient environmental enrichment and &#147;hope&#148; that the elephants will form family groups and breed, there is no evidence that either will be fulfilled.  The precautionary principle contends that in the absence of conclusive scientific evidence to support such a move, the elephants receive the benefit of the doubt and be left in southern Africa.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Section IV of the EA explicitly admits that &#147;African elephants in captivity historically have not bred well,&#148; and that elephants in captivity are declining.  Such an admission should raise the burden of proof considerably that this import must provide some significant change in breeding ability.  There is no such evidence.  The EA vaguely refers to &#147;new medical information&#148; and &#147;improved husbandry techniques&#148; that &#147;may&#148; correct past breeding mistakes.  There is no scientific or technical information to define these alleged medical and husbandry advances that may increase the likelihood of captive breeding success.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Current evidence actually suggests that even with breeding advances such as the use of artificial insemination, fatalities are likely to occur.  The Fish and Wildlife Service is surely well aware that Amali, an elephant conceived via artificial insemination, recently died at the Indianapolis Zoo.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Again, there is no independent analysis to justify the EA&#146;s unsubstantiated claim &#147;that the elephants to be imported will successfully breed since they will be maintained in more natural social groups, and have been exposed to successful breeding animals.&#148;  If the zoos claim that elephants may breed successfully if they can be kept in more &#147;natural&#148; social environments in captivity and be exposed to elephants who have bred successfully (a condition that is not guaranteed in this instance), then these same zoos bear the burden of proving it can be done successfully with the animals already in captivity before engaging in an experiment to bring young elephants from Swaziland for this same purpose.  It would be patently inhumane to break up the existing family and/or friendship bonds of these eleven elephants, ship them thousands of miles to captivity in the U.S., and place them in comparatively small enclosures, only to find out that whatever advances have been claimed do not ultimately succeed and no breeding occurs.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The EA, once more without scientific or other substantiation, asserts that import of these elephants will &#147;in part allow the development of more natural &#145;herd&#146; environments in these two zoos.&#148;  How can a natural herd environment be created with one adult animal and either four (Lowry) or seven (San Diego) same-age elephants?  This is not the definition of a natural elephant herd.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Moreover, these elephants have already developed into a natural herd over the last decade in the wild.  What is the justification for removing eleven elephants from an existing natural herd in a natural environment and moving them into an unnatural setting with the mere hope that they will develop in captivity the very social structure that they already possess in the wild?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Under Section V, the EA assumes a continent-wide population of 500,000 African elephants.  From where does this figure arise?  The African Elephant Specialist Group provides a 1998 &#147;definite&#148; estimate of 301,773 and a best case estimate of 487,345, which includes &#147;probable,&#148; &#147;possible,&#148; and &#147;speculative&#148; estimates.  The EA compares this inflated number of elephants in Africa to the smaller population of rhinos in Africa, seemingly as a justification for removing elephants who allegedly compete with the rhinos for habitat.  Does the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service advocate removing elephants to add available habitat for rhinos in other countries?  If so, when was this arbitrary and unscientific determination developed? </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, although there is a significant disparity continent-wide in the number of elephants and the number of all species of rhinos, the EA curiously omits the population figures for rhinos in Swaziland specifically.  According to the IUCN Rhino Specialist Group, there are 50 Southern White Rhinos and ten South Central Black Rhinos in Swaziland&#151;nearly twice as many rhinos as elephants (the 1998 population of African elephants in Swaziland was 39 according to the African Elephant Specialist Group).  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While rhinos and elephants may compete for similar natural resources, the EA does not detail whether Swaziland&#146;s elephants and rhinos are held in the same protected areas.  If so, perhaps the Parks Department has made a fundamental management error in not expanding these habitats many years ago.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Moreover, the EA concludes that funds transferred from the zoos to the Swaziland Parks Department would benefit rhinos as well, adding additional protection for these animals who &#147;suffer from poaching as do elephants due to the demand for rhino horn.&#148;  Of course, elephants do not suffer from poaching for rhino horn, but for their tusks.  However, the EA does not assess the current levels of poaching of rhinos for their horn or elephants for their tusks within Swaziland&#146;s protected areas.  The previous discussion was entirely related to competition between rhinos and elephants for suitable habitat.  Perhaps this competition could be alleviated with a simple internal management decision that does not involve export of elephants overseas: perhaps the Department of the Interior through the African Elephant Conservation Fund should provide specific resources to the Government of the Kingdom of Swaziland for anti-poaching wildlife law enforcement.  Until the real internal problems in Swaziland&#146;s protected areas are presented accurately and assessed fully, the Fish and Wildlife Service should not conclude arbitrarily that elephant export to zoos in the U.S. is the most advantageous option.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Further, Ted Reilly, Head of the Swaziland CITES Management Authority, is referred to as supporting the transport of these elephants to U.S. zoos.  This recognition is somewhat disingenuous since he has merely not considered other live animal translocation options and has stated that culling is regarded &#147;as the last resort and we will do everything in our power to avoid this situation as it would obviously impact negatively on the remaining animals.&#148; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Regarding consultation with the United States Department of Agriculture&#146;s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, APHIS may have &#147;no concern regarding foot and mouth disease (FMD) coming from Swaziland,&#148; but this is based on one informal conversation between employees of APHIS and FWS.  Is this the official position of the USDA?  An <a href="http://www.oie.int/eng/publicat/press/a_a010126.htm" target="_new">OIE Press Release</a> of January 26, 2001 notes, &#147;In Swaziland, following the intensification of surveillance measures in all dip tanks in the country, FMD was detected in the Macakula dip tank, in the Lubombo region in December 2000.&#148;  Moreover, although the EA states that Swaziland &#147;has certified itself to be FMD-free,&#148; it has not been so certified by the competent international authority on such matters, the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE).  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While two U.S. government agencies seem to accept Swaziland&#146;s self-certification of FMD-free status, there is no discussion of the data used by Swaziland to make such a declaration, nor by the U.S. to decide that such information justifies the self-certification.  The OIE is quite clear on the matter: &#147;Member Countries can also declare themselves free of diseases for which there is, as yet, no specific procedure for obtaining Official OIE recognition of Member Country status. In this case, they must provide the relevant epidemiological information to importing countries in proof of their position. The data provided must conform to the standard measures contained in the International Animal Health Code, which is recognised by the SPS Agreement of the WTO.&#148;  Has the U.S. government received and analyzed the relevant epidemiological information used by the Government of Swaziland to declare self-certification in order to determine whether such certification is scientifically sound?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Fish and Wildlife Service determines three possible courses of action in Section VI of the EA: issue the permits for importation of wild African elephants to captivity in two U.S. zoos, do not issue these permits, or issue permits for a reduced number of elephants.  The Fish and Wildlife Service should not pursue its proposed course of action (granting the permits) and should, instead, follow Alternative 2 (no action).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Fish and Wildlife Service claims that other alternatives may be possible, but they are not considered in this EA.  Even if these alternatives, such as translocation and immunocontraception, are not considered specifically as alternatives, they should be considered in light of possible courses of action that are at least available rather than the U.S. making a decision based on the misguided assumption that there are no other alternatives to consider beyond importation for captivity.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Section VI of the EA claims further &#147;that the elephants intended for importation have already been captured and confined to bomas (corral-like areas).&#148;  This is only partially true.  Thirteen elephants are being held in this boma, from which eleven will be selected and possibly exported.  So, while out of these thirteen elephants, the eleven intended for export have been captured and are being held, there are two other elephants, not intended for export, who are also being held.  This suggests two very important conclusions: the first is that there are not eleven specifically-identified animals to be exported, and second, that there is some risk that one or two of the eleven elephants, at least, may fall sick or become incapacitated as a result of the capture and preparation for transport, necessitating replacement by the other two.  This suggests inherently that there is an unnecessary risk to these elephants&#146; health and well-being.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The EA relies on the permit applicants and Mr. Reilly, not independent veterinary analysis, to determine that &#147;no elephants were adversely affected by the action&#148; of capturing them and containing them in the boma.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Section VII endeavors to assess the environmental consequences of each possible course of action.  From the outset, the EA in this section acknowledges that a financial value would be placed on the head of each of these elephants by the zoos.  The EA must, though it clearly does not, show that this international live elephant sale is not primarily commercial under CITES in order to justify approval of the permit applications.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Further, while this section of the EA outlines the remaining sex ratios in Hlane and Mkhaya after removal of the eleven elephants for export, it does not offer any analysis of the age ratios of these animals.  Such information is vital to assess the long-term viability and future breeding probability of the remaining elephant herd. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There is no reason to doubt Mr. Reilly&#146;s claims that the habitat in which the elephants are confined in Swaziland is being destroyed (his word) or at least modified (our word) by elephants. However, it is also evident from Mr. Reilly's own submissions that additional land could become available for elephants in Swaziland, subject to funding.  It is entirely possible that more funds than the $132,000 from the elephant sale could be attained to assist in Swaziland&#146;s conservation and wildlife protection program.  If that were the case, clearly there would be greater advantage to acceptance of another alternative than selling off these animals for $12,000 each. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In fact, the EA assumes that the money received in exchange for the elephants will be used &#147;for increased protection of the elephants, the habitat, and of other endangered species such as rhinos.  The money contributed by the two zoos will allow expansion of the protected areas through the acquisition of new land and more fencing, and provide more resources for anti-poaching&#133;.&#148;  What guarantee exists that the money will, in fact, ultimately be used for these purposes, and what recourse exists if the money is used for something else?  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Additionally, has the Fish and Wildlife Service received any breakdown of the way in which the money will be spent, how much each of the above-mentioned efforts will cost, and what prioritization will exist among these goals?  Without such a breakdown (let alone a true analysis of the greatest problems within the protected areas) it is impossible to assess accurately whether or not the removal of these animals is justifiable.  The Animal Welfare Institute absolutely supports financial assistance for land preservation, fencing, and wildlife law enforcement in African elephant range states.  In this specific case, however, we remain unconvinced that the expense for such an endeavor must be the sale and removal of the very animals that would benefit from this increased protection in their natural wild range.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While the Animal Welfare Institute is not inherently opposed to the general keeping of animals in captivity, as in zoos, we must take specific exception with the broad claim in the EA that &#147;There is no reason to believe, given the strong interest the zoos have in receiving the eleven elephants safely, that the utmost care will not be taken in moving these elephants.&#148;  This same argument has been used historically by wildlife traders who wish to capture and sell live wildlife for the pet trade&#151;whether birds, reptiles, or mammals.  The argument is made consistently that wildlife traders would not want to lose animals in transit.  However, there is a very high potential mortality rate in the live wildlife trade, which many of these traders consider nothing more than the cost of doing business.  With respect to these zoos and these elephants specifically, however, prolonged transit by air may result in serious injury and/or death despite the best efforts by the zoo personnel to avoid such a calamity.  The EA does not outline how the transport would take place and, therefore, FWS is in no position to provide any reliable, accurate or scientifically-based assessment as to the possibility for 100% survival.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Similarly, in the following paragraph, the EA concludes, &#147;The zoos have provided sufficient information to show that they are qualified to care for the elephants and provide all necessary medical and husbandry care required.&#148;  What information did the zoos supply to the Fish and Wildlife Service to justify this claim?  One must ask how the conclusion can be reached that the zoos can care for the elephants appropriately, especially when one of the importing zoos, Lowry Park, has not held elephants for many years, and when it is admitted that elephants in captivity are dying out, hence the need for supplements from the wild.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To this point, the EA notes that five elephants have been born in the San Diego Wild Animal Park since 1971.  Can one say that five births in more than three decades is a breeding success?  And what has become of the animals born to the San Diego Zoo?  How have they contributed to the conservation of the species in the wild?  Reportedly, of these births, only three elephants survived: two were traded to a zoo in China and one went to a circus, ultimately ending up at the Pittsburgh Zoo.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Additionally, it is terribly misleading to suggest that San Diego Wild Animal Park has an 1,800 acre facility.  The EA has already specified that the elephants would be restricted in a two acre area.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Next, the EA assumes that &#147;both elephant groups would be introduced to a socially dominant female that has shown appropriate social behavior as the matriarch of an elephant group.  San Diego Zoo has no matriarch as it has evicted all of its elephants in anticipation of the import of these wild elephants from Swaziland.  Lowry Park Zoo has a submissive, sub adult elephant who spent the past four years of her life at the Knoxville Zoo breeding program, where no breeding activity took place with any of the elephants.  This elephant, Ellie, was kept isolated since the other elephants bullied her.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Further, it is interesting to note as an aside that the reference used to reach this conclusion about the benefits of introducing young elephants to a socially dominant female is Gerry Ellis&#146;s fabulous book, Wild Orphans, which is about Dr. Daphne Sheldrick&#146;s wildlife orphanage in Kenya.  Dr. Sheldrick raises orphaned animals (including both elephants and rhinos) in preparation for ultimate release into the wild.  Wild Orphans is not about elephant introductions in a zoo setting.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In declining to consider sufficently the alternative to decline the permit request (recalling that these permits already have been relinquished once as a result of the determination that they included false information), the EA suggests that &#147;there would be a negative environmental impact to the affected environment if the elephants remain in their current habitat.&#148;  The Fish and Wildlife Service should not be misled into believing that the only financial development project that could be envisioned to assist in wildlife management in Swaziland (or any other nation, for that matter) is a commercial purchase of native wild elephants.  Other nongovernmental organizations have already offered funds to the Kingdom of Swaziland to assist in its elephant management and alternatively have found other locations within southern Africa for the elephants to be translocated.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There is little conclusive evidence that this permit application includes the best scientific data available to justify the import of these wild elephants from Swaziland.  As such, the entire issue is scientifically highly controversial.  The effect on the existing elephant population may be detrimental; the impact regarding injury, damage to health, or cruel treatment to the individual elephants being shipped may be great; the transaction appears to be primarily commercial, in violation of CITES; and any claims of educational value by displaying elephants are negated by the fact that the San Diego Zoo has already had elephants but unceremoniously sent them elsewhere.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Animal Welfare Institute urges the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to reject both of these permit applications, encourage the zoos to engage in financial contributions to in situ conservation efforts in Swaziland and other African elephant range states, including the purchase of additional protected lands and appropriate fence construction, and suggests that the Fish and Wildlife Service consider making a similar financial contribution through the African Elephant Conservation Fund.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Animal Welfare Institute remains committed to elephant conservation in Africa and stands willing to work with FWS, the AZA, San Diego and Lowry Park Zoos, and Ted Reilly to create a positive way forward that is best for wild African elephants.</font></p>
