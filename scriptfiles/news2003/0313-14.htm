                - March 13 -"The Senate's passage today of the deceptively named 

                'partial birth abortion ban' should be a call to action for women's 

                rights supporters everywhere," said National Organization for 

                Women (NOW)President Kim Gandy. "Proponents of this legislation 

                know that the bill's provisions are unconstitutional, based on 

                the Supreme Court's decision in Stenberg v. Carhart. Behind the 

                rhetoric, this bill is really an abortion procedures ban. It's 

                a political game and an attempt to send us back to pre-Roe days 

                when countless women died from illegal abortions." </font> 

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"You won't 

                  find the term 'partial birth abortion' in any medical dictionary 

                  -- instead try looking for it in the ultraconservative rhetoric 

                  manual," Gandy said. "Contrary to what opponents of abortion 

                  rights would have you believe, this bill is not about a specific 

                  late-term procedure. This bill, like each of its predecessors, 

                  is purposely worded so vaguely that it could criminalize even 

                  some of the safest and most common abortion procedures after 

                  twelve weeks and well before fetal viability." </font>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The abortion 

                  procedures ban passed by the Senate, which will soon be taken 

                  up in the House of Representatives, is not supported by the 

                  American Medical Association, the American College of Obstetricians 

                  and Gynecologists or the American Medical Women's Association. 

                  "This legislation has nothing to do with the best interests 

                  of medicine or women's health. In fact, this ban does not even 

                  include a constitutionally required exception to preserve the 

                  health of the woman," Gandy said. </font>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Senators 

                  who otherwise support reproductive rights allowed themselves 

                  to be caught up in the political rhetoric instead of standing 

                  firm in their commitment to women's rights," Gandy said. "Senators 

                  who voted for the abortion procedures ban disappointed voters 

                  in their own states and across the country." </font>
