                  Editor of <i>The Sun Never Sets</i>, a book about U.S. military 

                  bases worldwide, Gerson is director of the Peace and Economic 

                  Security Program at the American Friends Service Committee. 

                  He said today: &quot;Behind the rhetoric of 'liberation' and 

                  not staying 'a day' longer than needed, the Bush administration 

                  is clearly working to create a client government which will 

                  allow the U.S. to maintain military bases for the long term, 

                  as it has recently done in Central Asia. The U.S. government, 

                  in effect, will be transforming Iraq into an 'unsinkable aircraft 

                  carrier for the United States.' The U.S. government has massive 

                  bases in Japan over 50 years after the end of World War II; 

                  in South Korea nearly 50 years after the end of the Korean War. 

                  Bases in Iraq can serve as an alternative to bases in Saudi 

                  Arabia and will serve to threaten Syria, Iran and other nations 

                  in the region. The unprecedented network of U.S. bases is the 

                  basis of a global empire, there's no way to avoid that term. 

                  The bases are one of the reasons for resentment against the 

                  U.S. throughout Arab and Islamic nations. Imagine how we would 

                  feel if we had Saudi military bases or Chinese or German troops 

                  in or near our major cities. Actually, the Declaration of Independence 

                  cites the presence and actions of King George's troops here 

                  as 'abuses and usurpations' that necessitated the War of Independence 

                  against Britain.&quot; </font>

                  Professor of government and women's studies at Clark University, 

                  Enloe is author of the book <i>Maneuvers: The International 

                  Politics of Militarizing Women's Lives</i>. She studies how 

                  the military continues to operate in what are often thought 

                  to be 'post-war' or 'post-conflict' societies. Enloe points 

                  to Status of Forces Agreements, which outline the rules of policing 

                  and other aspects of life surrounding U.S. basing facilities 

                  around the world. She said today: &quot;Often these agreements 

                  are classified, so local populations don't even know what's 

                  been agreed to.&quot; </font>

                  Assistant professor of geography at the University of Wisconsin-Eau 

                  Claire, Grossman wrote the recent article &quot;New U.S. Military 

                  Bases: Side Effects Or Causes Of War?&quot; He said today: &quot;After 

                  every recent U.S. military intervention ... the Pentagon has 

                  left behind clusters of new bases in areas where it never before 

                  had a foothold. The new string of bases stretch from Bosnia, 

                  Kosovo and adjacent Balkan states, to Iraq and other Persian 

                  Gulf states, into Afghanistan and other Central Asian states. 

                  Together, they appear to form a new U.S. sphere of influence 

                  in the strategic 'middle ground' between the European Union 

                  and East Asia, and may well be intended to counteract the emergence 

                  of these global economic competitors. The administration is 

                  using every crisis as a convenient opportunity to establish 

                  a permanent military presence in the strategic belt from Hungary 

                  to Pakistan. The only two obstacles left to a geographically 

                  contiguous U.S. sphere of influence are Syria and Iran. The 

                  U.S. military is also returning to countries where it previously 

                  had lost basing rights, such as Somalia, Yemen, and the Philippines. 

                  This over-extension of U.S. military power risks increasing 

                  regional resentments (already being seen in the 'Iraq for Iraqis' 

                  demonstrations) and 9/11-type 'blowback' attacks. The Romans 

                  similarly used their ability to project military might as a 

                  substitute for their inability to develop respectful economic 

                  relationships, only to see their empire fall at the hands of 

                  humiliated civilians.&quot; </font>
