- December 2 - On Friday, December 19, 2003, the African American Ministers Leadership Council (AAMLC), a non-partisan organization dedicated to empowering African-American communities on the local, state and national levels, will launch a national voter registration, education and mobilization campaign in preparation for the 2004 presidential election.  The campaign, known as &quot;Sanctified Seven - Victory Through Voting,&quot; will be active in Florida, Illinois, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and will encourage participants to register at least seven members of their community to vote every few weeks leading up to next year's election.</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;For years now, the Religious Right has co-opted the language of the church and the language of the Bible and used it as a tool to motivate people in ways that conflict with our core beliefs and that are harmful to our communities,&quot; said Rev. Dr. Arnold Howard, chair of the AAMLC.  &quot;For this reason, we are asking our clergy and our congregations to dedicate themselves to countering the rhetoric of the Religious Right by mobilizing voters within their communities.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The launch event, a Christmas gospel concert and voter registration rally, will be held at the New Spirit Revival Center in Cleveland Heights, Ohio. Renowned gospel singer Kirk Carr and the Kirk Carr Singers will be performing.  There will be a Christmas dinner banquet beginning at 9:30 p.m. with a performance by gospel comedian and singer Broderick Rice. Participants will be asked to register to vote, or if they are already registered, to bring someone who is not yet registered to vote. Admission is free.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Sanctified Seven - Victory Through Voting</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WHAT: 	Gospel Concert and Voter Registration Drive</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WHEN: 	Friday, December 19, 2003 beginning at 6:30 p.m.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WHERE: 	New Spirit Revival Center, 3130 Mayfield Road, Cleveland Heights, Ohio</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WHO: 	Gospel artists Kirk Carr and the Kirk Carr Singers</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">		Gospel comedian and singer Broderick Rice</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The AAMLC, a project of People For the American Way Foundation, was founded in 1997 to identify and implement practical methods of creating social justice.
