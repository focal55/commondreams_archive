The son of the newly 

appointed Palestinian Prime Minister he Chief Islamic Justice of 

Palestine, Israeli Knesset and Cabinet Members, and Palestinian PLC 

and Cabinet Members are among the 1500 Israelis and Palestinians 

who are supporting a new grassroots effort to seize the agenda from 

violent extremists. They have joined OneVoice, a project that uses 

the Internet and other means to amplify the voice of Israeli and 

Palestinian moderates. People from both sides won't just be 

signing petitions, they will actually negotiate a concrete plan-the 

"People's Road Map"-to end the conflict. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Renewed international attention has magnified the need for 

moderates to take an active stand. On May 13, the heads of the 

World Jewish Congress and the American Sufi Muslim Association will 

take the lead by jointly signing a proclamation that acknowledges 

the right of both Israelis and Palestinians to live with freedom, 

security, dignity, respect and self-determination. OneVoice will 

then engage thousands to support the proclamation and join an 

interactive negotiation process to achieve consensus on ten 

critical issues. People will participate via the Internet, print 

ads, a confidential toll-free number, and other venues. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The OneVoice initiative has steadily gained the backing of a 

growing list of U.S. political leaders, businesspeople, spiritual 

leaders, and entertainers, including such diverse figures as Stuart 

Eizenstat (former Deputy Secretary of Treasury), James Zogby 

(president of the Arab American Institute), Edgar Bronfman 

(president of the World Jewish Congress), and actors Rhea Perlman, 

Danny Devito, Brad Pitt, Jennifer Aniston, and many, many others. 

In addition, the IBM International Foundation is backing the effort 

and developing the internet-based interactive negotiation platform.
