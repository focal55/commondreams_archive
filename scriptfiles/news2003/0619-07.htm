- June 19 - Saturday is the first day of summer, and families have more to worry about than just their tans - unhealthy air.  Last year, cities across America set records for the number of red and orange air quality alerts and there are more on the way.  Already, Atlanta, Los Angles and Houston have reported unsafe air days.  To warn communities about the air quality, many cities issue alerts when the air is unhealthy to breathe and urge parents to keep their kids inside.  Some cities offer free rides on public transportation on unsafe air days. But instead of working to clean up the air, the Bush Administration is giving polluters a pass on cleaning up their messes in the so-called &quot;Clear Skies&quot; initiative.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Thirty years of environmental progress has taught us that there is a better way,&quot; said Carl Pope, Executive Director of the Sierra Club. &quot;Americans know how to clean up the smog in our air.  By enforcing, rather than weakening, the Clean Air Act, we could improve air quality and reduce the risk of asthma attacks so families can breathe easier.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Additionally, as Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Christie Whitman spoke today at the National Conference on Asthma, the Sierra Club reminded the Bush Administration that it is impossible to prevent and control asthma while simultaneously weakening the Clean Air Act.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;There's no question that asthma awareness and prevention are important goals,&quot; continued Pope.  &quot;But it is irresponsible of the Bush Administration to say they're addressing the problem of asthma while at the same time allowing polluting industries to release more asthma-inducing pollution into the air.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Poor air quality greatly increases the risk of asthmatic attacks. New cases of asthma among Americans are increasing so rapidly that by the time another generation of children is born, asthma will strike almost 30 million Americans - nearly the population of New York and New Jersey combined.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In his 2003 State of the Union address, President Bush touted a so-called &quot;Clear Skies&quot; plan that will actually result in more pollution than would occur if we simply enforced the existing Clean Air Act.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Bush plan creates a loophole that would exempt power plants from the Clean Air Act protection that requires older factories to install modern pollution control technologies when they make a change that increases the pollution they produce.  The Administration's dirty skies initiative would allow electric power plants to triple the amount of mercury they could emit under our current Clean Air Act.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Clearly, the Bush Administration's air proposals will leave our communities and families at risk from increased smog,&quot; concluded Pope. &quot;Some doctors have likened exposure to smog to getting a sunburn on your lungs.  When smog levels are too high, cities issue air quality alerts warning children, the elderly and people with respiratory problems to stay inside.&quot;</font></p>
