U.S. organizations represented include the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, Catholic Relief Services, the Conference of Major Superiors of Men, the Association of Catholic Colleges and Universities, the Maryknoll Office for Global Concerns, Pax Christi USA, numerous universities and other organizations. (A complete list of participants is attached.)</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHAT:  'Preemptive Peace: Beyond Terrorism and Justified War', a global consultation on peacemaking featuring theologians, academics, policy analysts, peace activists, human rights workers, community organizers, authors and church officials from the international Catholic community.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHEN:  Thursday, July 31, 2003 from 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHERE:  St. John's University, Jamaica, New York, in the Moot Court, Law Building.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHY:  This unique consultation, comprised of three facilitated &quot;fishbowl&quot; conversations, seeks to contribute to the discernment of a global framework, including a nonviolent ethic, for evaluating and responding to violent conflict and war in the 21st century. It is part of a much larger and ongoing discussion taking place in the United States and internationally, in the Catholic community and beyond. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">International representatives from Palestine, the DR Congo, the Philippines, Rwanda, Pakistan, and elsewhere will share insights gained through their lived experience of violent conflict and injustice in their homelands.  Theologians, human rights workers, academics, activists and others with a background in international peacemaking will contribute wisdom from their experiences, the teaching of the church, and political theory.  The consultation will explore ways of promoting nonviolent alternatives to conflict and further the debate over the definition of &quot;Just War Theory&quot; in light of the War on Terrorism and the increased capacity of weapons of mass destruction.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

 

The one-day conference will cover three specific topics: 1) the use and misuse of the &quot;just war&quot; criteria, including its application to the war against Iraq and the War on Terrorism; 2) how countries can respond to egregious human rights violations, threats to use weapons of mass destruction, and other 'just causes' for war without resorting to violence; and 3) how local and/or indigenous peace initiatives contribute to efforts to avoid war, even in the face of grave threats to peace. </font></p>
