                - March 18 - Looking at two weeks of coverage (1/30/03-2/12/03), 

                FAIR examined the 393 on-camera sources who appeared in nightly 

                news stories about Iraq on ABC World News Tonight, CBS Evening 

                News, NBC Nightly News and PBS's NewsHour with Jim Lehrer. The 

                study began one week before and ended one week after Secretary 

                of State Colin Powell's February 5 presentation at the U.N., a 

                time that saw particularly intense debate about the idea of a 

                war against Iraq on the national and international level. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">More than two-thirds 

                (267 out of 393) of the guests featured were from the United States. 

                Of the U.S. guests, a striking 75 percent (199) were either current 

                or former government or military officials. Only one of the official 

                U.S. sources-- Sen. Edward Kennedy (D.-Mass.)-- expressed skepticism 

                or opposition to the war. Even this was couched in vague terms: 

                "Once we get in there how are we going to get out, what's the 

                loss for American troops are going to be, how long we're going 

                to be stationed there, what's the cost is going to be," said Kennedy 

                on NBC Nightly News (2/5/03). </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Similarly, 

                when both U.S. and non-U.S. guests were included, 76 percent (297 

                of 393) were either current or retired officials. Such a predominance 

                of official sources virtually assures that independent and grassroots 

                perspectives will be underrepresented. Of all official sources, 

                75 percent (222 of 297) were associated with either the U.S. or 

                with governments that support the Bush administration's position 

                on Iraq; only four out of those 222, or 2 percent, of these sources 

                were skeptics or opponents of war. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Twenty of the 

                297 official sources (7 percent) represented the government of 

                Iraq, while a further 19 (6 percent) represented other governments-- 

                mostly friendly to the U.S.-- who have expressed doubts or opposition 

                to the U.S.'s war effort. (Another 34 sources, representing 11 

                percent of officials, were current or former U.N. employees. Although 

                members of the U.N. inspection teams made statements that were 

                both critical of Iraq's cooperation and supportive of further 

                inspections, because of their official position of neutrality 

                on the question of war they were not counted as skeptics.) Of 

                all official sources, 14 percent (43 of 297) represented a position 

                skeptical or opposed to the U.S. war policy. (Sources were coded 

                as skeptics/critics if either their statements or their affiliations 

                put them in that category; for example, all French government 

                officials were counted as skeptics, regardless of the content 

                of their quote.) </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The remaining 

                96 sources-- those without a current or former government connection-- 

                had slightly more balanced views; 26 percent of these non-official 

                sources took a skeptical or critical position on the war. Yet, 

                at a time when 61 percent of respondents in a CBS poll (2/5-6/03) 

                were saying that they felt the U.S. should "wait and give the 

                United Nations and weapons inspectors more time," only sixteen 

                of the 68 U.S. guests (24 percent) who were not officials represented 

                such views. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Half of the 

                non-official U.S. skeptics were "persons in the street"; five 

                of them were not even identified by name. Only one U.S. source, 

                Catherine Thomason of Physicians for Social Responsibility, represented 

                an anti-war organization. Of all 393 sources, only three (less 

                than 1 percent) were identified with organized protests or anti-war 

                groups. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Overall, 68 

                sources, or 17 percent of the total on-camera sources, represented 

                skeptical or critical positions on the U.S.'s war policy-- ranging 

                from Baghdad officials to people who had concerns about the timing 

                of the Bush administration's war plans. The percentage of skeptical 

                sources ranged from 21 percent at PBS (22 of 106) to 14 percent 

                at NBC (18 of 125). ABC (16 of 92) and CBS (12 of 70) each had 

                17 percent skeptics.
