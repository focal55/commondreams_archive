- October 28 - Senate Republican leaders were expected to file a cloture petition late tonight to bring the nomination of Judge Charles Pickering to the Senate floor.  If they are successful, a full Senate vote on the controversial nomination could come as early as Thursday.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ralph G. Neas, President of People For the American Way, said that PFAW and numerous other groups and individuals continue to oppose the judge on the basis of his longtime record of hostility to civil and constitutional rights.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Judge Pickering's record hasn't changed.  The issues haven't changed.  The only thing that has changed is the mounting pressure from the GOP to put ultra-conservative, extremist judges on the federal bench.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The latest tactic - claiming that opposition to Pickering is based on his religious beliefs - is an offensive attempt to deflect the debate away from his record.  Many men and women of deep religious belief oppose his nomination because of his longtime, demonstrated hostility to key legal principles that protect the civil and constitutional rights of minorities, women, and all Americans.  This debate is not about his character or his faith, but his record as a judge and a public official.</font></p>
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We remain hopeful that the courageous senators who are opposing this nomination in the face of tremendous pressure from the White House will prevail, and that the cloture vote will not succeed.&quot;</font></p>
