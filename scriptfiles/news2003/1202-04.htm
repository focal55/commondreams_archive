- December 2 - With growing momentum behind the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), Infact and the Network for Accountability of Tobacco Transnationals (NATT) are releasing the FCTC Ratification Campaign Handbook, a resource for public interest organizations across the globe. The Handbook will facilitate campaigning toward the treaty&#146;s ratification in countries around the world. Already 77 nations have signed the FCTC, and five-Fiji, Malta, Norway, Seychelles, and Sri Lanka-have ratified. The treaty enters into force and becomes international law after 40 countries sign and ratify it.</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;The Ratification Campaign Handbook is energizing the movement to implement the FCTC at a critical time. As more governments ratify the treaty, the tide continues to turn against Big Tobacco&#146;s deadly expansion. With activists and advocates campaigning in every region of the world, the FCTC could enter into force in record time,&#148; says Kathryn Mulvey, Executive Director of Infact, a US-based corporate accountability organization and NATT member. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Ratification Campaign Handbook includes background on the FCTC, tips and tools for developing campaign strategies, insight into the precedents the FCTC sets for other dangerous and deadly industries, and information on the treaty ratification process in dozens of countries. Already more than one hundred public interest organizations from 80 countries have requested copies of the Handbook to support their campaigns at the national level.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">China, a country with a population of more than one billion people, generated much attention last month by signing the FCTC. According to international law, once a country signs and indicates its formal support, it is bound by the spirit and intent of the treaty and is expected to improve its domestic laws accordingly. The FCTC, initiated by World Health Organization, bans tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship (such as Philip Morris/Altria&#146;s Marlboro Man) with exceptions only for constitutional reasons, and protects public health policy from tobacco industry interference. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The tobacco industry is deeply concerned about the impact of the FCTC on its profits and expansion plans. According to the cover story in a recent Tobacco Reporter, an industry trade journal, &#147;While it remains to be seen whether the FCTC&#146;s bite is as bad as its bark-all provisions must be translated into national laws and there is no enforcement mechanism-it is safe to assume that business will not get any easier for the tobacco industry.&#148; Internal industry documents released through litigation show that tobacco giants such as Philip Morris/Altria sought advice from the notorious public relations firm Mongoven, Biscoe and Duchin on how to prevent or delay adoption of the FCTC. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Health and corporate accountability advocates around the world are now preparing for the next phase of industry opposition. The Ratification Campaign Handbook provides strategies and tools for exposing and challenging tobacco industry interference in public policy. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;As the political battles over the FCTC now take place in capitals across the globe, vigilance to Big Tobacco&#146;s dirty tricks is more important than ever. This Handbook empowers people around the world to stand up to tobacco giants like Philip Morris/Altria, British American Tobacco, and Japan Tobacco International. We are demanding that our governments prioritize people over profits and ratify the FCTC swiftly,&#148; says Akinbode Oluwafemi of Environmental Rights Action (Nigeria), also a NATT member. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">For up-to-date information on countries that have signed and ratified the FCTC visit <A HREF="http://www.who.int/tobacco/fctc/signing_ceremony/countrylist/en" TARGET="_new">www.who.int/tobacco/fctc/signing_ceremony/countrylist/en</A>.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><I>Since 1977, Infact has been exposing life-threatening abuses of transnational corporations and organizing successful grassroots campaigns to hold corporations accountable to consumers and society at large.
