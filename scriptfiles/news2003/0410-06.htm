                IL - April 10 - A Veterans Town Meeting will draw hundreds of 

                veterans from throughout Illinois in a campaign to protect health 

                care benefits they were promised when they answered their country's 

                call. Congressional representatives have been invited to this 

                important meeting at VFW Post 1197 in Batavia, Ill., on Thursday. 

                April 17, 2003, from 7-9 p.m. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Years of inadequate 

                budgets have forced drastic cuts in health care services to veterans. 

                The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system is 

                unable to meet the needs of veterans as funding shortfalls have 

                led to a rationing of health care through reduced services, lengthy 

                delays and veterans being turned away completely. Illinois is 

                home to some 925,000 veterans. According to VA statistics, some 

                200,000 veterans across the country are waiting over six months 

                for a primary health care appointment. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Together with 

                our fellow veterans from the American Legion and Disabled American 

                Veterans we have called this Town Meeting to focus public attention 

                on the need for full and predictable funding for veterans' health 

                care," Mike Carlson, commander of Batavia VFW Post 1197 said. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Veterans 

                Town Meeting has been called to urge the Illinois Congressional 

                delegation to support mandatory funding for VA health care. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The only way 

                veterans will have access to timely, top quality and readily accessible 

                health care is to remove VA healthcare from the appropriations 

                process and mandate a fair and necessary budget for VA," Charles 

                Brimm, commander of the VFW Department of Illinois said. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This Veterans 

                Town Meeting shows that we were united in battle and that we are 

                united again to defend the VA health care system. No veteran should 

                ever be left behind," Carlson said.
