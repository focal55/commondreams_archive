-  
November 21 - Green Party leaders attending the rallies against the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) summit this week provided firsthand reports of police violence against peaceful protesters.</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Officers of the Green Party of the United States witnessed numerous instances of rights violations, including arrests without charges and brutal treatment, by police against people gathering peacefully for nonviolent protest.  On Wednesday afternoon, about thirty police officers raided the Information Clearing House, a legally rented space set up by the Florida Fair Trade Coalition media working group, searching it with neither permission nor a warrant.  For Independent Media Center reports from the protests, visit <A HREF="http://www.ftaaimc.org/en/index.shtml" TARGET="_newe">http://www.ftaaimc.org/en/index.shtml</A>.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Greens, arriving in Miami from all over the U.S., maintained a strong presence, displaying over 300 Green Party flags, and were welcomed by other protesters.</FONT></P><P> <FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">==&gt; Eyewitness account from Annie Goeke, co-chair of the International Committee of the Green Party of the United States, cell phone 717-468-1880:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">[Thursday evening] &quot;Tensions were building up between protesters and police the past few days as more areas were blocked off.  There were early morning police attacks on small groups throughout the entire city. Anyone who looked like a suspect was picked up, beaten, or escorted away from the area.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Chris Doran [organizer of PressurePoint.org] was attacked by police, thrown to ground, and a tear gas gun was held to his head.  He later said that he felt the police were way over nervous and were scared of protesters.  He was all right in the end and let go.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Protesters were targeted all day, especially young people.  AFSC protesters and observers often surrounded the younger protesters to shield them from the police.  All the people who were able to attend the rally place inside the arena were contained for hours so as not to join the others outside confronting the police who were using tear gas, rubber bullets, pepper spray, and other tactics.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Media avoided content about the purpose of the protests against the FTAA and were only interested in covering conflict and security matters.  Reporters never really questioned why people were there. Protesters were portrayed as evil-doers on TV, with no information about why they were protesting.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">280 buses carrying protesters were denied access to the area.  It's like a police state, with the entire downtown area and all public transportation closed, making it very difficult for groups to get together, especially Greens.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Delegates from Brazil, Venezuela, and Argentina met up with Marta Benavides of El Salvador and others this morning to say that the U.S. was annoyed that the negotiations were going too slowly.  The reason was because other nations wanted the opportunity to go into further details and get their issues on the table.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">[Friday at noon]  Some of the protesters have been charged with felonies.  At 2 p.m., Greens and others will rally in front of the Miami courthouse, when protesters charged with felonies will be released on bail, to show support for those arrested and for those injured by the police.  We're not sure what the felony charges are yet.  Miami is still closed, and downtown Miami seems to be under martial law.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">==&gt; Eyewitness account from Ben Manski, Wisconsin Green and co-chair of the Green Party of the United States:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;At the end of the permitted march today [Thursday, November 20], about 4 p.m., people were gathered at a permitted rally and concert.  Police announced that if the event remained peaceful it could continue, but within a minute of this announcement, police moved into the area immediately outside the amphitheater swinging batons and striking participants.  Within five minutes, the police forced everyone back, using pepper spray, concussion grenades, rubber bullets, and tear gas.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">For the next two hours, the police suppressed every gathering that they could find, dispersing people in the street.  Throughout, there was little resistance to the police and most of the crowd was peaceful; the police used violence regardless of the behavior of people in the street.  At least four people ended up in the hospital; dozens of others were injured, many with head wounds from the rubber bullets.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">People who remained in the amphitheater were trapped there for over two hours; anyone who tried to leave was assaulted or gassed by police.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">It was clear that a decision was made by police commanders to suppress the protesters, and to use whatever violent means they found necessary.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Efforts by city officials and police to put the fear of God into Miami residents seems not to have worked; all the Miamians we met were very friendly and welcoming, and were curious about the issues involved in the protests.  Meeting us was their first opportunity to hear what the demonstrations were actually about.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">It was obvious that the majority of people demonstrating knew that the FTAA was the tip of the iceberg, and that George W. Bush is only the latest in the line of recent presidents who have sought to enshrine the power of corporations in international law.  Personally, I blame Bill Clinton for setting American trade policy on this destructive course,beginning with the first FTAA ministerial in Miami in1994.&quot;</FONT></P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p></font><!-- #EndEditable --></td></tr>
