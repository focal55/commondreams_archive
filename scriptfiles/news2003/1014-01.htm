- October 14 -  Devastating new research published by the UK Government shows that pollen from genetically modified (GM) oilseed rape travels six times further than previously documented and if not controlled can contaminate non-GM crops for generations. Further findings indicate that some GM crops could make birds such as the skylark extinct within 20 years in the UK.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
The announcement comes days before the results of some of the biggest and most controversial outdoor trials of GM crops are published on October 16th in London. [1] Media reports have speculated that those trials will show that GM oilseed rape and GM beet damage biodiversity.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
The UK Government published on october 13 the results of four different projects (<a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/news/2003/031013b.htm" target="_new">http://www.defra.gov.uk/news/2003/031013b.htm</a>) which show that:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
* Bees can take oilseed rape pollen and pollinate with non-GM oilseed rape over a distance of 26 Km.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
* If wild GM oilseed rape is not &quot;rigorously controlled&quot; then contamination &quot;would not fall below 1% for 16 years.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
* Modelling indicates that the effects of introducing GM sugar beet could be &quot;extremely severe, with a rapid decline, and extinction of the skylark within 20 years.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
The findings are likely to intensify the debate over proposals to allow GM contamination of conventional seed and the co-existence of GM, conventional and organic food production. European member states are due to vote on proposals to allow the contamination of seeds later this month.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
Adrian Bebb of Friends of the Earth Europe said:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This research shows that allowing GM crops to be grown in Europe will be a recipe for disaster. Containing GM crops like oilseed rape is virtually impossible and will cause contamination for years to come. The co-existence between GM and conventional or organic farming is simply not possible. Furthermore the research shows that our wildlife is being put at an unnecessary risk with birds facing extinction. The public and the environment must come before the commercial interests of the biotech companies.&quot;</font></p>

Notes to editors</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
[1] The Farm Scale Evaluations (FSE) results will be presented at 10.30 (UK time) on Thursday 16th October and also published on the UK Government website <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/gm/fse/index.htm" target="_new">http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/gm/fse/index.htm</a></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
The Farm Scale Evaluations of GM crops were commissioned by the UK 
Government in 1999 following intense public hostility and concern from its 
own wildlife advisors about the effects of introducing GM 
herbicide-resistant traits. The crops trialed were Bayer's oilseed rape, 
maize and fodder beet, and Monsanto's sugar beet. All crops are modified to 
be resistant to the companies' own herbicide. The biotech industry must 
legally forward the results of the trials to the European country where 
they have made an application to market the crop. For the oilseed rape and 
sugar beet this is Belgium, the fodder beet Denmark, the sugar beet also 
Germany and the maize France.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
The trials were highly controversial creating anger throughout communities 
in the UK.  In particular there was no obligation to protect neighbouring 
farmers or beekeepers from GM pollution or to listen to the views of local 
people. As a result the trials were unwelcome and many GM plants were 
uprooted by local people and campaigners. In addition Friends of the Earth 
discovered GM pollen in beehives 4.5km from a trial. Subsequently 
beekeepers had to move their hives 6 miles (9.6km) from FSE sites.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
Earlier this year Friends of the Earth published a new report highlighting 
the problems in the design of the trials and accused them of being politically driven. 
(<a href="http://www.foe.co.uk/resource/press_releases/new_analysis_casts_doubt_o0.html" target="_new">http://www.foe.co.uk/resource/press_releases/new_analysis_casts_doubt_o0.html</a>)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
The main findings of the report included:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
o Ecologically significant differences between GM and non-GM crops may be 
missed because the experiment does not have sufficient statistical power.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
o Monitoring of important soil organisms was dropped because of money and 
time constraints. Similarly, rare arable plants were excluded because of 
time constraints.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
o Advice on the use of weed killer on the GM crops was given by the biotech 
companies who developed the technology, leading to concerns that the GM 
crops may have been managed to maximise biodiversity whilst ignoring the 
final yield.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
o Evidence that in the United States additional herbicides are used to 
achieve the required level of weed control in maize crops has been 
overlooked, meaning the maize results could be irrelevant.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
Last week, several reports in the UK press highlighted possible outcomes of 
the British research programme. According to the daily newspaper the 
Guardian - which claims to have spoken to scientists involved - the 
research will show that GM oilseed rape and sugar beet damages the 
environment. The damage to biodiversity is so serious that the UK 
government is reportedly already considering a ban on GM oilseed rape and 
GM sugar beet.</font></p>
