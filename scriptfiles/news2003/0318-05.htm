                ILL. - March 18 - The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s (NRC’s) 

                proposal for limited testing of nuclear waste transportation casks 

                does not go far enough, public interest organizations said today. 

                The groups held a press conference today in downtown Chicago and 

                will deliver comments Wednesday at an NRC meeting in Rosemont. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Tens of thousands 

                of deadly high-level radioactive waste shipments could pass through 

                Chicago en route to the proposed nuclear waste dump at Nevada’s 

                Yucca Mountain and ‘Private Fuel Storage’ facility at Skull Valley, 

                Utah," said Bruch Reed, board member of the Nuclear Energy Information 

                Service. "We need the NRC to take our safety concerns seriously 

                and institute a more rigorous program for testing nuclear waste 

                transportation containers." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The NRC is 

                responsible for evaluating license applications for the Yucca 

                Mountain dump and the Private Fuel Storage project (a nuclear 

                waste facility proposed by a private consortium), as well as the 

                casks used to transport high-level nuclear waste to the dumps. 

                Current NRC regulations do not require casks to be physically 

                tested. The agency relies mainly on computer modeling in its licensing 

                process. The new proposal, called the Package Performance Study, 

                would subject just two of the 16 licensed designs to crash tests 

                and fire tests. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"It is encouraging 

                that the NRC has finally recognized the need for physical testing 

                of nuclear waste transportation casks, but the NRC testing proposal 

                fails to actually demonstrate cask safety," said Bob Halstead, 

                of the Nevada Agency for Nuclear Projects. "The NRC’s primary 

                concern is testing casks to demonstrate the accuracy of their 

                computer models. Instead, they should be testing every cask design 

                to demonstrate compliance with safety regulations. Beyond that, 

                the agency should test casks to failure, to determine the adequacy 

                of safety regulations." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to 

                the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) environmental impact statement, 

                Illinois will be heavily impacted by transportation of spent nuclear 

                fuel and high-level radioactive waste to Yucca Mountain. In addition 

                to shipments from Illinois reactors, the state would be traversed 

                by shipments from almost all the commercial reactors east of the 

                Mississippi River, plus shipments from DOE facilities in New York 

                and South Carolina. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During the 

                first 24 years of Yucca Mountain’s operations, the DOE would make 

                either 8,000 rail and truck shipments or 39,000 truck shipments 

                through Illinois. Over 38 years, the DOE could make either 16,000 

                rail and truck shipments or more than 69,000 truck shipments, 

                through the state. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The DOE’s proposal 

                to ship spent fuel by barge on Lake Michigan also would affect 

                Illinois, Michigan and Wisconsin. Because the Kewaunee, Point 

                Beach and Palisades reactor sites lack rail access, DOE has proposed 

                shipping large rail casks by barge from these sites into the Ports 

                of Milwaukee and Muskegon. After being transferred to rail cars, 

                these casks would travel through Illinois by train. The DOE could 

                make up to 431 barge shipments on Lake Michigan over 38 years.

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"I’m astounded 

                that the NRC has not included submersion testing in its proposal, 

                given that the Department of Energy is considering hundreds of 

                barge shipments on the Great Lakes if the Yucca Mountain Project 

                moves forward," said Kevin Kamps, nuclear waste specialist with 

                Nuclear Information and Resource Service. "Moreover, the NRC’s 

                study would also ignore cask vulnerabilities to a terrorist attack." 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Independent 

                analyses have indicated that an attack on a nuclear waste convoy 

                could release lethal doses of radiation. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The Yucca 

                Mountain and Private Fuel Storage projects would involve unprecedented 

                nuclear shipping campaigns. How can the NRC consider licensing 

                these projects without thoroughly evaluating the vulnerabilities 

                of nuclear waste transportation casks?" asked Lisa Gue, senior 

                energy analyst with Public Citizen. "The proposed study does not 

                go nearly far enough to address the concerns of communities along 

                transportation routes," she concluded. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>To discuss 

                these issues further, the groups will host a public workshop and

                Information Service, at 845 Chicago, Suite 207, Evanston, Ill.,
