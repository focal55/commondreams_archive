                at March 13th Gala </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The National 

                Association of Social Workers (NASW) is highlighting the important 

                role of professional social workers in our nation's child welfare 

                systems. Professional social workers will be honored at the 2nd 

                Annual NASW Foundation Gala on Thursday, March 13 at 7 p.m. during 

                National Professional Social Work Month. The Gala will also serve 

                as a forum to discuss child welfare. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to 

                Douglas W. Nelson, President of the Annie E. Casey Foundation, 

                "We have learned a great deal about what works in serving vulnerable 

                kids and their families-but we also know that the clearest visions 

                for reform won't be enough unless we do a much better job of recruiting, 

                training, supporting and retaining good people to do this hard 

                work at the frontline." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NASW asked 

                governors, in a letter following the November elections, to ensure 

                that children in state child welfare systems are cared for by 

                making a commitment to hiring an adequate number of professionally 

                trained social workers, and maintaining reasonable caseloads and 

                workloads, with adequate compensation. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Gaps in care 

                for our most vulnerable children are unacceptable, but unavoidable, 

                if resources are not increased," says Elizabeth J. Clark, PhD, 

                ACSW, MPH, executive director of NASW. "The public has high expectations 

                for frontline human services workers, but without a competent 

                and stable workforce and appropriate supports it is nearly impossible 

                to deliver uniform high quality services." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Recently, there 

                have been a number of high profile reports of child fatalities 

                and other tragedies for children and families involved with the 

                child welfare system. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The persistence 

                of preventable child fatalities, reports that children have been 

                lost while in custody of the state, and continuing difficulties 

                finding permanent living arrangements for children and youth within 

                reasonable timeframes, are all indicators that this nation has 

                not yet made an adequate investment in protecting children and 

                youth," adds Clark. </font>
