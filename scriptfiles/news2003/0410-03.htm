                - April 10 - Public Citizen is urging lawmakers to cancel the 

                Bush administration’s nuclear power expansion plan, known as Nuclear 

                Power 2010, and reject the recommendations of a government consultant 

                that suggested ways to lower the industry’s capital costs of new 

                reactor construction at the expense of taxpayers. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The administration’s 

                initiative to promote the construction of new nuclear reactors 

                is enshrined in House and Senate energy legislation. On Thursday, 

                the House is scheduled to vote on the energy bill (H.R.6), and 

                senators on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee will vote 

                on the nuclear title of a separate bill drafted by Chairman Pete 

                Domenici (R-NM). </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Both bills 

                direct the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to implement the Nuclear 

                Power 2010 program and authorize spending taxpayer money on it. 

                Senate legislation more specifically opens the door to unusual 

                and unacceptable taxpayer subsidies for new reactors, including 

                loan guarantees and power purchase agreements between the government 

                and plant operators. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">More details 

                about this program’s likely direction surfaced in a report commissioned 

                by the DOE, which sought recommendations on how the government 

                can promote investor interest in nuclear power expansion. That 

                report, prepared by Scully Capital Services, Inc., a Washington-based 

                investment banking and financial services firm, is entitled Business 

                Case for New Nuclear Power Plants: Bringing Public and Private 

                Resources Together for Nuclear Energy. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Business 

                Case report recommended various extreme measures needed to promote 

                the construction of new nuclear power plants. Among the recommendations 

                are government power purchase agreements at above market price, 

                subsidized federal loans, tax-exempt financing and taxpayer-backed 

                insurance of last resort. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report 

                also recommended government action on three "show-stoppers" that 

                now prevent the construction of new nuclear power plants – nuclear 

                waste, liabilities associated with catastrophic accidents, and 

                the potential that successful interventions, such as lawsuits, 

                could block plants’ operating licenses. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Nuclear power 

                poses safety and security risks unlike any other source of electricity, 

                and the issue of long-term nuclear waste management remains a 

                costly problem," said Wenonah Hauter, director of Public Citizen’s 

                Critical Mass Energy and Environment Program. "Throwing more tax 

                dollars at nuclear power will not make it safer, cleaner or more 

                economical. Lawmakers should reject the corporate welfare recommendations 

                contained in the Business Case report." </font>
