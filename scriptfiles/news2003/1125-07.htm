-  
November 25 - The following is the statement of Ron Pollack, Executive Director of Families USA, concerning the Medicare legislation passed by Congress:</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The Medicare legislation will cause deep disappointment for America's seniors and people with disabilities. It provides very limited drug coverage; fails to moderate skyrocketing drug costs; and spends lavishly to push seniors into managed care plans.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;This legislation has numerous shortcomings, including:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">* &quot;The legislation provides seniors with inadequate drug coverage that is sparse compared to the coverage available for younger populations. Seniors with annual drug costs between $2,250 and $5,100 will be required to pay all of those costs out of their own pockets - a so-called &quot;doughnut hole&quot; that is more like a coverage chasm. (See attached Q&amp;A.)</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">* &quot;Even the best feature of the legislation - the help to low-income seniors, which allows them to purchase drugs for only $1 to $5 per prescription - is flawed. Due to a miserly assets test, 2.8 million very low-income seniors will be disqualified from such needed relief.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">* &quot;The legislation genuflects to the pharmaceutical lobby by thwarting any meaningful effort to contain skyrocketing drug costs. The legislation prohibits Medicare from using its bargaining power to negotiate lower prices. It also stops seniors from re-importing much cheaper drugs from Canada. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">* &quot;The legislation provides a boondoggle to the managed care industry. In an effort to push seniors into HMOs, PPOs, and other managed care plans, the legislation showers private insurance plans with lavish and wasteful subsidies.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The more seniors learn about this legislation, the less they will feel that it reflects their interests and needs.&quot; </FONT></P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p></font><!-- #EndEditable --></td></tr>
