- May 12 - "The revelation that Halliburton's multibillion-dollar 

postwar contract involves distribution of Iraqi oil tops off a list of White 

House deceptions about the purpose of the invasion of Iraq," said Jake 

Schneider, treasurer of the Green Party of the United States.  "Rep. Henry 

Waxman's [D.-Calif.] exposure of the Halliburton deal proves what Greens and 

other opponents of the war have said all along.  The U.S. victory over 

Saddam's forces wasn't a matter of liberation for the people of Iraq, but of 

conquest -- of regional political dominance and control over Iraq's oil 

resources."

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many of the deceptions surrounding the U.S. invasion have been blatant and 

known to be false all along, say Greens.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"What does it say for the health of American democracy, when President Bush 

or Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld can make patently false statements, without 

challenge from most of the media or most Democrats?," asked Mark Dunlea,



chair of the Green Party of New York State.  "Many Americans seem to believe 

that the dishonesty is justified simply because the U.S. won the war."

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greens cite numerous examples of wartime deceit and evasion:

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*** According to countless speeches and statements by President Bush and his 

cabinet and staff, the menace of Saddam's weapons of mass destruction, with 

the imminent threat they posed to Iraq's neighbors and the U.S., was the



major cause for the war.  But after a massive invasion in which thousands of 

sites were targeted throughout Iraq, the U.S. has discovered no evidence of 

WMDs.  Some White House officials have conceded that Iraqi WMDs was not the 

real cause for the war 

<http://abcnews.go.com/sections/nightline/US/globalshow_030425.html>.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"If the U.S. truly believed that Iraq possessed WMDs, if the intelligence 

that Secretary of State Powell presented to the U.N. in February was at all 

valid, their discovery should have been a strategic goal during the first 

days of the invasion," asked Dunlea  "Why didn't U.S. forces make securing 

Iraq's nuclear facilities at Kut and al Tuwaitha a priority?  Any postwar 

search for WMDs in Iraq or elsewhere should be conducted by U.N. inspectors, 

since U.S. officials can no longer be trusted."

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*** Rumsfeld expressed great concern over Iraq's cultural heritage and 

promised that the U.S. would do everything to protect sites, artifacts, and 

museums and libraries.  But while U.S. troops guarded Iraq's Ministry of



Oil, they did nothing to protect Iraq's museums, libraries, and colleges



from looting and destruction.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*** Numerous conflicts of interest, in which the Bush Administration's top 

corporate contributors and cronies won million- and billion-dollar wartime 

deals, have gone uninvestigated.  The exposure of Pentagon advisor Richard 

Perle's scandalous conflicts of interest connections with defense contractor 

Global Crossing led to Perle's resignation as board chair last week, but



Perle retains a seat on the board.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*** In the months leading up to the war: The International Atomic Energy



Agency disavowed President Bush's claim in September 2002 that an agency



report showed evidence that Iraq in 1998 was 'six months away' from 

developing a nuclear weapon.  The Bush Administration, including Powell 

speaking before the U.N. and the President in his victory speech on board 

the U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln on May 5, claimed that Saddam had conspired with 

al-Qaeda, despite the lack of evidence and the fact that al-Qaeda and Osama 

bin Laden have called for Iraqi Muslims to topple Saddam; about half of the 

American public believed this unsupported allegation, according to polls.  

Powell's claim that Iraq tried to buy uranium for nuclear weapons from Niger 

was based on clumsily forged evidence.  Powell's exclusive British 

intelligence information was plagiarized from a paper published over a 

decade ago by an American graduate student.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greens also note that the White House and intelligence agencies are blocking 

the release of information about the September 11 terrorist attacks, 

delaying publication of a 900-page report from Congress on how the attacks 

happened.  The blocked information includes details of early warnings 

received by the FBI, as well as testimony already published, such as the



Phoenix memo.

</font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Why aren't these deceptions and evasions a major scandal and cause for 

investigation and prosecution?", asked Starlene Rankin, Lavender Green 

Caucus delegate to the national party.  "Where's the outrage from the public 

and media?  Why is perjury about oral sex cause for impeachment, but not



perjury before Congress, the American people, and the U.N. about reasons for 

war?  Why is the Democratic Party, except for a few vigilant Congressmembers 

like Henry Waxman, asleep in the passenger seat?"</font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
