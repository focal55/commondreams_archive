Executive Summary:</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

Since 1995, the current members of the North Carolina legislature have received a total of $350,575 from tobacco companies and allies of the tobacco industry have contributed $393,132.  Seventy-eight percent, or 133 members of the 170-member North Carolina legislature, have received contributions from either the tobacco industry or its allies.</font>

</p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Since 1995, the tobacco industry has given a total of more than $800,000 to officials running for public office in North Carolina.  Allies of the tobacco industry, including tobacco lobbyists and farmers, have contributed a total of nearly $1.2 million during the same period.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Tobacco company contributions to political candidates have risen dramatically during the last four election cycles.  Comparing the 1996 and 2000 gubernatorial elections, tobacco industry contributions have nearly tripled from $121,818 to $347,512. A similar increase occurred in the off-gubernatorial election years of 1998 and 2002, with tobacco industry contributions climbing from $98,545 to $276,569.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Smoking costs the state of North Carolina roughly $4.7 billion each year in health care costs and lost productivity, equivalent to 31 percent of the state&#146;s annual budget.  North Carolina&#146;s Medicaid program spends nearly $600 million annually treating people who suffer from smoking-related illnesses.  Each pack of cigarettes sold in North Carolina contributes $3.15 to the state&#146;s economy, while at the same time costing North Carolina&#146;s taxpayers $5.90 in related health care expenses.  Broken down by household, taxpayers in North Carolina spend $498 annually to cover smoking-caused health care costs.  None of these estimates, however, includes other costs associated with smoking, such as second-hand smoke, smokeless tobacco, or cigar or pipe smoking.  In short, smoking is an expensive habit for North Carolina.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

North Carolina has one of the lowest tax rates for cigarettes in the country. The average excise tax on cigarettes for all 50 states is 69 cents per pack.  In tobacco-producing states, that average drops to 8.3 cents. North Carolina&#146;s current excise tax of 5 cents per pack is the third lowest in the nation.  It is a telling sign of the tobacco industry&#146;s influence that, in over 40 years, North Carolina&#146;s legislature has approved only two small tax increases on cigarettes.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

The CDC estimates that an effective smoking prevention and cessation program in North Carolina would require minimum funding of $42.6 million annually.  The 2002-2003 budget allocation is $6.2 million, which comes from the Master Settlement Agreement (MSA)&#150;the financial agreement between 46 states and the major tobacco companies that requires tobacco companies to bear some of the costs of treating people with tobacco-caused illnesses and to restrict certain tobacco marketing practices.  That is about 15 percent of the CDC&#146;s minimum recommended amount, ranking the state 37th for prevention funding among the 50 states in 2003.  In addition to the MSA settlement money, North Carolina earns an estimated $209 million a year in tobacco taxes.  When the settlement money and tobacco taxes are combined, North Carolina spends only 3 percent of its total tobacco revenues on smoking prevention and cessation efforts.</font></p>

This Common Cause Education Fund report seeks to increase public awareness of the influence of the tobacco industry in the North Carolina state legislature by showing the link between the tobacco industry&#146;s campaign contributions and lobbying efforts and the specific actions that the legislature has taken on measures that are relevant to tobacco interests.</font></p>
