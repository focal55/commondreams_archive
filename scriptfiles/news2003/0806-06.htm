The annual event is being coordinated by Kitchen Gardeners International (KGI), a new international non-profit group that seeks to promote closer connections between people, their food, the land, and each other.  </font>

Despite some encouraging trends to the contrary, food now travels on average between 1,500 and 2,500 miles from field to table, as much as 25 percent farther than two decades ago*.  &quot;Our current long-distance relationship with food is a losing equation,&quot; says KGI founder Roger Doiron. &quot;Lettuce grown on the west coast and shipped 3,000 miles to the east coast requires more than 35 times as much fossil fuel energy in transport as</font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> it provides in food energy.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

According to Doiron, the environment is not the only loser.  &quot;By eating road-weary, industrially-grown produce coming from thousands of miles away, we miss out on a great opportunity for achieving health for our bodies and pleasure for our palates,&quot; he says.  &quot;The simple act of growing some of what you eat is the most local, most healthful, and most delicious way of experiencing food and represents a precious part of the world's common cultural heritage.&quot;
