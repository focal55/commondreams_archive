-June 20 - Ten cases remain for the Supreme Court to decide this term. These cases could have a tremendous impact on civil rights, equal rights and free speech. People For the American Way Foundation either filed an amicus brief or served as co-counsel in several pending cases. Attorneys with PFAW Foundation will be available for comment as soon as the rulings are announced.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Affirmative Action: The University of Michigan Cases --</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Gratz v. Bollinger &amp; Grutter v. Bollinger</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The U.S. Supreme Court is reviewing the constitutionality of the University of Michigan's college and law school affirmative action admissions programs. The Bush administration threw its weight behind the forces attacking the programs. That move represented one more step by the national Republican Party away from what had been for decades a bipartisan consensus on civil rights, the importance of diversity, and effective remedies for the lingering impact of discrimination.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PFAWF joined a friend of the court brief in support of the affirmative action programs. We also helped organize a rally that drew tens of thousands of affirmative action supporters to the steps of the Supreme Court on the day the case was heard. The case has several possible outcomes. The Court could uphold affirmative action and both of the University of Michigan programs in dispute. It could also affirm the principle of affirmative action while deciding that either or both of these specific programs fail to meet the Court's criteria. The Court could conceivably abandon affirmative action altogether, as right-wing groups have urged.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Gay Rights, Privacy Rights and Equal Protection Under the Law: The Texas Sodomy Law --</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lawrence and Garner v. Texas</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PFAWF has filed an amicus brief in what could be a landmark gay rights case challenging the constitutionality of Texas' &quot;Homosexual Conduct Law,&quot; which criminalizes private consensual sex between people of the same gender but not between opposite-gender partners. In 1998, police entered the Houston home of John Lawrence in response to a false report of an armed intruder. They found Mr. Lawrence and another man, Tyron Garner, engaged in sex, and arrested the men for violating the state's &quot;Homosexual Conduct Law.&quot; The men were ultimately jailed and convicted for having engaged in private, consensual sex.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Court could use this opportunity to overturn its appalling 1986 Bowers v Hardwick decision upholding state sodomy laws. Alternatively, the Court could leave its Hardwick decision intact, and overturn the Texas law on equal protection grounds, since the law explicitly treats gay Texans differently than others. Either way, a decision overturning the Texas law would be a significant advance in the struggle toward full equality for gay and lesbian Americans.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Challenging Protected Speech: Internet Blocking in Libraries Through CIPA --</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">American Library Association v. United States</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">People For the American Way Foundation served as co-counsel in this suit brought by the American Library Association, other library associations, library patrons and others challenging a federal law that would require public libraries to install internet blocking software on all computers as a condition of receiving federal funding. The software could inhibit the ability of library patrons to, for instance, gather information on public health matters, or perform personal medical research.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PFAW Foundation has been involved in the other major attempts by Congress to restrict the free flow of information on the internet. The Supreme Court has never upheld such a law, choosing either to strike down earlier attempts or send them to lower courts for further consideration.</font></p>
