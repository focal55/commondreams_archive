- June 11 - On Monday, June 16, 2003, Baltimore, MD, resident

Ellen Barfield will go on trial for an act of civil disobedience at the U.S. Capitol on March 17, 2003. During the last days of buildup before the attack on Iraq, Barfield joined a procession to the Capitol, in order to demand that Congress prevent the impending attack.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;At a time when we most need to protect and practice

our Constitutional rights to peacefully assemble and

to petition our government, we were instead confronted

with an arbitrary police line that prevented us from approaching the Capitol,&quot; said Barfield. &quot;Although we posed no threat of violence to anyone, we were prevented from going to the Capitol steps purely because of our political speech. Tourists were clearly being allowed to go up the steps that were decided to be off limits for us.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The procession, organized by many groups including the DC Iraq Pledge of Resistance, included roughly 200

people. They carried homemade signs opposing war,

photos of Iraqi civilians who would suffer in thelooming attack, and copies of voided blank checks for

Congress. A total of 51 were arrested for crossing a

Capitol police line in their attempt to bring to the

steps of the Capitol their request that Congress take

back the blank check for war it gave George Bush in

the fall. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For those four who asked for a trial, the charge could

result in a fine of $300 or up to 90 days in jail.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The protesters followed a strict code of nonviolence,

and interaction with the police was cordial, in spite

of the police obstruction of the protesters' rights. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The trial will start at 9am in Courtroom 120 of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, 500

Indiana Avenue in Washington, DC. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Attacking Iraq was an immense violation of international law, and made us less safe in the United States,&quot; added Barfield. &quot;It is disappointing to find

that even protesting the war is now against the law in many instances, but I intend to do everything in my

power to continue the struggle through the legal

process and through continued actions like the one we

took on March 17.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Barfield will also stand trial on Wednesday, June 18

in the same court for a similar action at the White

House on March 19 as the attack on Iraq was beginning,

and on Friday June 20 in Alexandria, VA, for an action

at the Pentagon on Good Friday, April 18.</font></p>
