- May 12 - Two national drinking 

water associations announced their opposition to a couple of hotly 

contested provisions in House and Senate energy legislation at a 

press conference today. The Association of Metropolitan Water 

Agencies and the American Water Works Association, which together 

represent water systems serving approximately 180 million 

Americans, oppose provisions in legislation that would provide 

product liability immunity to producers of the fuel additives MTBE 

and ethanol. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">H.R. 6, which passed the House on April 11, includes product 

liability immunity provisions for both MTBE and ethanol. S. 791 

includes only the ethanol provision. It passed the Senate 

Environment and Public Works Committee on May 9 and is expected to 

be offered as an amendment to the Senate energy bill, S. 14, this 

week. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is well known that MTBE (methyl tertiary butyl ether), a 

possible human carcinogen according to the U.S. Environmental 

Protection Agency, renders water undrinkable due to its foul taste 

and odor of paint thinner. Drinking water systems and their 

customers potentially face billions of dollars in costs to cleanup 

contaminated supplies and secure new sources of water to replace 

shutdown wells. Moreover, the MTBE industry knew of the additive's 

environmental dangers long before it was put in use to meet the 

oxygenate requirement. Documents uncovered in a lawsuit by the 

South Tahoe Public Utility District against eight oil companies 

demonstrate the MTBE industry's knowledge since the early 1980s 

that the product spread rapidly in groundwater and was difficult to 

clean up. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"If the MTBE liability immunity provisions in H.R. 6 are 

eventually enacted, producers will have little incentive to clean 

up contaminated water supplies or cover water systems' costs for 

cleanup and/or acquisition of new sources of water, such as new 

pipelines and wells," said Diane VanDe Hei, executive director of 

the Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies (AMWA). 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"If water systems are denied their day in court to prove this 

product is defective, the ultimate victims of immunity from 

liability will be the American people, who will lose their aquifers 

to contamination and their money to cleanups and new sources of 

water," said Tom Curtis, deputy executive director of the American 

Water Works Association (AWWA). 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Liability immunity supporters say that MTBE use was mandated by 

the Clean Air Act, and thus the product deserves Congress's 

protection. But it turns out this is not true. Neither the Clean 

Air Act, nor EPA's reformulated gasoline regulations, require the 

use of MTBE in any way. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This week, the Senate is expected to take up the ethanol issue. 

Ethanol, which H.R. 6 and S. 791 propose to mandate, is not as 

innocuous as its supporters contend. Researchers recognize that 

groundwater plumes containing gasoline and ethanol biodegrade more 

slowly than a plume containing only gasoline. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition, there are several studies demonstrating that 

ethanol increases the size and migration of benzene plumes. 

Researchers say that many more groundwater wells will experience 

contamination from MTBE and benzene, a known carcinogen, if ethanol 

leaks into water supplies. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Ethanol producers say that ethanol is safe," said VanDe Hei. 

"If this is true, why are they seeking liability immunity?" 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Clearly the jury is still out on whether ethanol is 

environmentally safe," said AWWA's Tom Curtis, "Questions 

surrounding ethanol should be answered before Congress gives big 

business a liability exemption and leaves ordinary Americans 

holding the bag. We don't want ethanol to become the next MTBE." </font>
