                - March 17 - The following statement by Vicki Saporta, president 

                and CEO of the National Abortion Federation, was released today: 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">James Kopp 

                last week waived his right to a jury trial for the murder of Dr. 

                Barnett Slepian and will be appearing in court today for a bench 

                trial. Regardless of the trial process, Kopp must be held accountable 

                for his actions and must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of 

                the law. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Nov. 2002, 

                Kopp confessed to the murder of Dr. Slepian. Unfortunately, there 

                are many anti-choice extremists who believe that it is justifiable 

                to kill doctors because they provide women with safe and legal 

                abortion care. The Army of God, of which Kopp is a member, supports 

                the use of force to end abortion. Let me be clear, violence against 

                abortion providers is never acceptable or justified. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For over 25 

                years, the National Abortion Federation (NAF) has been compiling 

                statistics on anti-choice violence and disruption. Our database 

                is the most comprehensive of its kind and often allows us to predict 

                trends in violence aimed at abortion providers. One trend we have 

                documented is that when one murderer is brought to justice another 

                one is quickly recruited to become the next assassin. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Kopp's trial 

                must not lead to another series of assassination attempts directed 

                at physicians who perform abortions. We, therefore, continue to 

                urge law enforcement to remain especially vigilant in enforcing 

                the law and prosecuting those who would use violence to advance 

                their own personal, political agendas. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We hope that 

                justice will be served today. We know that the trial cannot bring 

                back Dr. Slepian, but we do hope that it will send a clear message 

                to extremists that violence against abortion providers is not 

                justifiable and will not be tolerated.
