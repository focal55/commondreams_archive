- July 1 - An article in the current issue of American Scientist, and reported in Tuesday's New York Times, re-ignites a long-standing debate among scientists over the best approaches to large-scale conservation. It is a topic of great importance to the public and worthy of further exploration.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many scientists are re-thinking the value of the &quot;hot spots&quot; approach to the larger task of maintaining healthy ecosystems and conserving nature. The World Wildlife Fund's (WWF) broader ecoregional Blueprint for a Living Planet may offer a glimpse of where conservation consensus is headed and should be a key element of coverage of this important issue.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Unlike hotspots that concentrate only on the highest biodiversity and tend to cluster in tropical regions, WWF's approach prioritizes nature by looking not only at the density but also the diversity of life. The key to this approach, embodied in what we call the &quot;Global 200,&quot; is representation. Global 200 ecoregions collectively represent the broadest range of the Earth's most important ecosystems. Thus they include not only hot spots like the Amazon, but also the frigid waters of the Bering Sea, the vast forests of Siberia and the uniquely rich rivers and streams of the southeastern United States.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Amid continuing controversy over hotspots, scientists from both sides of the debate are working together to identify and agree on a common set of global priorities that will determine the direction and set the agenda for conservation well into the next century. It is likely to result in consensus that will combine the close-up focus of hot spots with the broader vision of the Global 200; one that builds upon the best science and experience that these and other approaches have to offer.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">World Wildlife Fund experts are available to discuss the current debate and the Global 200 and to assist in providing your audience with a thorough understanding of the conservation challenges and opportunities facing our world. With projects in more than 150 countries around the globe--far beyond just the &quot;hotspots&quot; -- WWF remains dedicated to ensuring that the broadest possible array of present-day biodiversity survives for future generations to enjoy.</font></p>
