                - March 11 - Today, 150 students from more than 30 states converged 

                on Capitol Hill to send the message that patriotism starts with 

                the protection of America's heritage and public lands. Students 

                were joined by Representative Ed Markey of Massachusetts (D-MA), 

                the recent sponsor of the Morris K Udall Act to protect the Arctic 

                National Wildlife Refuge, and Rep. Jay Inslee (D-WA), sponsor 

                of the National Forest Roadless Area Conservation Act. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Sierra 

                Student Coalition brought these high school and college students 

                to Washington, DC, from across the nation for their fifth annual 

                Public Lands Action Summit. At the Summit, students learned about 

                various issues, focusing on protecting America's last treasures: 

                the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska, Utah Wilderness, 

                and our National Forests. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"As Americans 

                and the future of this nation, we as students are taking a stand 

                to ensure that these wild places are protected for future generations," 

                said Meighan Davis, the SSC's Conservation Chair and a senior 

                at Peace College in North Carolina. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During the 

                Summit's weekend of training, students were joined by renowned 

                author Terry Tempest Williams who stressed the importance of acting 

                from the heart in these dark times. After their training, students 

                took to the halls of Congress to lobby on several issues: protecting 

                the Arctic Refuge, America's National Forests, and Utah Wilderness, 

                as well as local issues ranging from tribal land in Arizona to 

                public lands in Puerto Rico. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Students really 

                recognize and appreciate the role that our Representatives and 

                Senators have played in the fight to keep these unique, precious 

                places safe. And the sentiment is obviously mutual -- Representative 

                Markey has been extremely supportive of student involvement in 

                the protection of our public lands, as have many others," said 

                Joanna Winchester, the SSC Arctic Campaign Coordinator and sophomore 

                at Kenyon College in Ohio. "This is a key time for students to 

                be in Washington talking about these issues," said Myke Bybee, 

                the SSC's National Director, "We are in the midst of constant 

                attacks on our environment, especially in the area of public lands 

                protection. Congress is considering Arctic drilling as a source 

                of revenue, National Forest protections are being decimated, and 

                wildlands in Utah are facing destructive energy development. We 

                need every student to be reaching out to their Members of Congress 

                in this crucial time." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The urgency 

                of public lands issues was underscored by Jim Steitz, SSC Forest 

                Protection campaign coordinator, who said, "America's National 

                Forests are under attack from an administration that is listening 

                to timber corporations instead of Americans. Students are here 

                to demand that America's natural heritage be safeguarded." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The Bush administration 

                is undermining efforts to protect unique places like Wild Utah 

                through administrative loopholes and rule changes. We are here 

                to be the voice of the people in defense of our public lands," 

                said Geoff Milz, Media Coordinator for the Public Lands Action 

                Summit and junior at University of Cincinnati. </font>
