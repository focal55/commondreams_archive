<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BRUSSELS  / LONDON- October 16 - The results released today of 
some of the biggest and most controversial outdoor trials of genetically modified (GM) 
crops show that growing GM oilseed rape and beet damages biodiversity.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Friends of the Earth has called for both GM crops to be immediately banned from 
Europe.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Farm Scale Evaluations of GM crops were commissioned by the UK Government 
in 1999 following intense public hostility and concern from its own wildlife advisors 
about the effects of introducing GM herbicide-resistant traits. The crops trialed were 
Bayer's oilseed rape, maize and fodder beet, and Monsanto's sugar beet. All crops are 
genetically modified to be resistant to the companies' own herbicides.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The researchers concluded that growing conventional beet and oilseed rape was better 
for many groups of wildlife than growing GM varieties. In particular:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* in GM beet fields there were 60% fewer weed seeds, less butterflies and less bees</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* in GM oilseed rape there were 80% fewer weed seeds and also less butterflies</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">They concluded that the widespread introduction of both these crops would lead to 
birds struggling to find food later in the year. The researchers also concluded that the maize crop might be beneficial for wildlife.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However Friends of the Earth has criticised these trials as they did not represent how 
farmers would grow maize in practice and compared GM with a weed killer regime that 
is being withdrawn from Europe.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The biotech industry must legally forward the results of the trials to the European 
country where they have made an application to market the crop.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For the oilseed rape and sugar beet this is Belgium, the fodder beet Denmark, the 
sugar beet also Germany and the maize France.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Adrian Bebb of Friends of the Earth Europe said:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Companies such as Monsanto and Bayer told the world that their crops were 
environmentally safe. These trials have shown that this was simply not true. GM 
oilseed rape and beet cause more damage to the environment than conventional crops. Europe has now no choice but to ban these crops. The protection of the public 
and the environment must come before the financial interests of the biotech industry.&quot;</font></p>
