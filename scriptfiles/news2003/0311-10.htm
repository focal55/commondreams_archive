                - March 11 - Environmental groups announced today they are suing 

                the Bush Administration for refusing to divulge information about 

                energy industry efforts to drill in the Arctic National Wildlife 

                Refuge. The Bush Administration has refused to respond to two 

                separate Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to make public 

                communications about drilling in the Arctic Refuge, including 

                any communications with the oil industry or associations and lobbying 

                groups. The suit is being filed today by Sierra Club, Alaska Wilderness 

                League, Defenders of Wildlife, and The Wilderness Society. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Unfortunately, 

                the Bush Administration demonstrates a pattern of keeping the 

                public in the dark when it comes to policies that threaten America's 

                environment," said David Bookbinder, Sierra Club attorney. "We 

                know the Bush Administration supports destructive drilling in 

                the pristine Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the public deserves 

                to know how and why that decision was made. So far, all the Administration 

                has given the public is the runaround." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Last year the 

                environmental groups submitted two requests under the Freedom 

                of Information Act for records, including scientific information, 

                relevant to Department of Interior's (DOI) treatment of the Arctic 

                National Wildlife Refuge and proposals to open the coastal plain 

                to oil development. To date, DOI has not provided any documents 

                responsive to these requests and has instead engaged in tactics 

                designed to simply delay or obstruct the process. These tactics 

                left the groups with no option but to have a court force the Administration 

                to obey the law. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Drilling in 

                the Arctic has been the centerpiece of Bush's energy policy, and 

                Congress could vote on the issue as early as this week, by adding 

                an amendment to the Federal Budget bill. The groups seek to uncover 

                what information the Bush Administration considered when deciding 

                to advocate drilling in the Arctic, as well as what information 

                was ignored. Last week the National Academy of Sciences released 

                its report on the cumulative impacts of drilling on Alaska's North 

                Slope which reaffirmed the devastating impacts that drilling has 

                already caused across the region. The report provided further 

                evidence that allowing this destructive development to extend 

                into the Arctic Refuge would only exacerbate existing environmental 

                and cultural problems and cause more damage. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We need to 

                know if the Administration has more information about the dangers 

                to wildlife and the environment from drilling in the Arctic Refuge," 

                said Rodger Schlickeisen, President of Defenders of Wildlife. 

                "If the Bush Administration is confident about their decision 

                to drill, they should make the information public." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Drilling in 

                the Arctic will do nothing to solve our current energy demands. 

                Any oil from the Refuge will not reach the lower 48 states for 

                at least 7-10 years according to the oil industry. The most optimistic 

                estimates say that there is a total of about 6 months supply of 

                oil in the Arctic. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Arctic 

                Refuge serves as the staging area for hundreds of thousands of 

                migratory birds, denning habitat for polar bears, and calving 

                grounds for the 130,000 member Porcupine River caribou herd. Moreover, 

                the Refuge plays an integral part in the lives of the Gwich'in 

                people who depend on the seasonal migrations of the caribou for 

                both survival and cultural identity. The biological heart of this 

                pristine wilderness is the 1.5 million-acre coastal plain. Permitting 

                oil development on the coastal plain would not only disturb a 

                unique and fragile ecosystem, but it would also jeopardize the 

                traditional lifestyle of these Native Alaskans. </font>
