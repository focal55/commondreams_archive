                - April 17 - The following was released today by the National 

                Environmental Trust: </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Are you a member 

                of the Republican leadership or even, possibly, the President 

                of the United States? Is your record on the environment terrible? 

                Is that terrible record making you dread the fast approaching 

                Earth Day like a visit to the dentist? Then maybe it's time you 

                visited LUNTZSPEAK.COM! </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LuntzSpeak 

                is the exciting (some would say "sneaky") new way to spin your 

                anti-environmental record, and it has been widely embraced by 

                the Administration and some Republicans in Congress. That's why 

                the National Environmental Trust created LuntzSpeak.com: so that 

                anyone can learn LuntzSpeak and recognize it when they see it 

                in a press release or hear it in a speech. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"It's not rocket 

                science to say that voters don't trust the President and some 

                members of his party on the environment," said National Environmental 

                Trust President and LuntzSpeak enthusiast Phil Clapp. "After all, 

                this is an administration with only a few bright spots amid a 

                torrent of anti-environmental rollbacks." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"LuntzSpeak 

                represents a major new covert campaign by the Administration and 

                the Republican leadership," Clapp said. "They're trying to dupe 

                the public and the media into thinking a truly awful record on 

                the environment is actually green." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LuntzSpeak 

                is based on a memo by famed Republican pollster Frank Luntz, architect 

                of the Contract With America. Luntz is concerned that "the environment 

                is probably the single issue on which Republicans in general -- 

                and President Bush in particular -- are most vulnerable." Unfortunately 

                for Luntz, the Environmental Working Group gave the memo to the 

                New York Times. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"If you look 

                at what leading Congressional Republicans and Administration officials 

                have been saying in recent months, it's clear that the Luntz memo 

                is being treated like Gospel," Clapp said. "What we've done at 

                LuntzSpeak.com is collect examples of this spin in action, and 

                laid out the tools to help you see through it." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To kick off 

                its new effort to get out the word about LuntzSpeak, the National 

                Environmental Trust is: </font>
