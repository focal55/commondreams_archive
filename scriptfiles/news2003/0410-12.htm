- April 10 - Previously secret gun 

industry documents, statements from industry whistle-blowers, and 

sworn testimony from a host of industry executives obtained in 

lawsuits show that firearms industry businesses have actively and 

knowingly allowed guns to be sold into the illegal market, 

according to a report released today by attorneys at the Brady 

Center to Prevent Gun Violence. </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The report, entitled Smoking Guns: Exposing the Gun Industry's 

      Complicity in the Illegal Gun Market, discusses specific 

      documents and deposition testimony that the industry 

  unsuccessfully tried to keep confidential in court proceedings 

      across the country. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;This reports shows that U.S. firearms manufacturers and gun 

      dealers maintain a distribution system that gives felons access 

      to unlimited arsenals of weapons,&quot; said Michael Barnes, president 

      of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. &quot;It's 

      unconscionable to think that the United States Congress is moving 

      rapidly towards granting wide-ranging immunity to an industry 

  that knows how to stop arming our nation's most dangerous 

      criminals, but refuses to change.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Smoking Guns was released one day after the U.S. House of 

      Representatives voted to grant the gun industry unprecedented 

  immunity from lawsuits and limit the legal rights of gun violence 

      victims. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Before the Congress votes to give the gun industry special 

      immunity from legal accountability, it should get to know the 

      companies it seeks to protect,&quot; said Dennis Henigan, Director of 

      the Brady Center's Legal Action Project. &quot;Because of lawsuits 

      targeted by this legislation, the dark underside of the gun 

      industry is exposed for all to see. We now know the sad story of 

  an industry that has aided and abetted the illegal gun market for 

      years and has profited handsomely from it.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The report is available on the Web site of the Brady Campaign 

      to Prevent Gun Violence United with the Million Mom March, at <a href="http://www.bradycampaign.org" target="_new">http://www.bradycampaign.org</a>. A media summary follows this 

      release. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence United with the 

      Million Mom March, and its sister organization the Brady Center 

      to Prevent Gun Violence, are dedicated to reducing gun violence 

      in the United States through education, outreach, grassroots 

      mobilization, civil litigation against the gun industry, 

      political action and support for common sense gun safety laws on 

      the local, state and national levels. Formerly known as Handgun 

      Control, the organization fought for passage of the Brady Law, 

      the assault weapons ban and other reasonable laws. Sarah Brady, 

  wife of former Reagan Presidential Press Secretary Jim Brady, 

      serves as Chair of the Brady Campaign. </i></font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font></p>
