- May 20 - Keeping people safe and protecting homes must be the first and most important priority for any wildfire policy. We share the concern of all Americans that every effort is made to protect the safety of those threatened by wildfires, and for the men and women who risk their lives to protect our communities. We know what needs to be done. Now we need to roll up our sleeves, get to work, and protect these communities.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Universal agreement already exists that making homes firewise and creating a defense space around communities will dramatically improve homeowner and firefighter safety. The highest responsibility of any elected official is to provide for the safety and security of our citizens. At a time when we urgently need to focus on protecting communities from wildfires, it is wrong to entertain proposals that would weaken environmental protections and encourage logging in the backcountry, far from threatened homes.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The President's wildfire bill cynically uses the emotion of wildfires to promote an agenda that science and research have repeatedly shown have no merit and little to do with wildfire safety. The bill fails on three counts. First, it does not focus efforts on improving the safety of people, homes, and communities at risk from wildfires this summer. Second, the bill is based on flawed assumptions that have been directly contradicted by three independent studies. Third, the measure unnecessarily weakens environmental safeguards and the right to public participation.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During the past several wildfire seasons, the President, several Members of Congress, and the timber industry have been quick to blame conservationists for obstructing wildfire prevention efforts. For the second time in two years, however, a study by the General Accounting Office has demonstrated that wildfire prevention efforts are not hampered by the public comment and appeals process. The findings of the two GAO reports strongly support an independent Northern Arizona University report issued this April.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The President's bill stands in direct contrast to two better approaches, one by Rep. George Miller and the other by the Western Governors' Association. These measures focus on protecting people, homes, and communities. The Miller bill, for example, would provide funds for fuel reduction on private, state and tribal land --– which comprise 85 percent of the forested land near vulnerable communities -- as well as on federal lands. The Governors ten-year plan released last year, with the participation of The Wilderness Society, also is based on the fundamental principle that resources for wildfire prevention should be prioritized first on where it makes the most difference: in the Community Protection Zone. Nowhere in the Governors' plan was there any mention of changing or repealing environmental laws or restricting access to the courts, as is the case with the President's bill.
