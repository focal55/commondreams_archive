- November 7 - At Wednesday night's Planned Parenthood forum in New Hampshire, 
John Kerry, Wesley Clark, and Howard Dean supported requiring 18-year-old women 
to register for the military draft, as 18-year-old men are now required to do. 
Congressman Kucinich, along with Carol Mosley Braun and John Edwards, opposed 
expanding mandatory draft registration to include women.</FONT><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Today 
Congressman Kucinich released this statement:</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Our 
nation has conducted a war against Iraq and is currently occupying that nation 
at a cost thus far of close to 400 American lives and $150 billion dollars. The 
three candidates who said they support requiring women to register for the draft 
have each made Iraq a key issue in their campaign and have each committed to keeping 
U.S. troops in Iraq for an indeterminate amount of time. The Pentagon has just 
announced plans to send another 85,000 Army and Marine combat forces to Iraq early 
next year to relieve troops completing one-year tours, and 43,000 National Guard 
and Reserve support troops have been alerted that they could soon be sent as well. 
Among those on Capitol Hill who support the occupation, it is a widely held belief 
that more troops are needed in Iraq.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Schools 
in low-income areas (those receiving Title IX funding) are now required to turn 
students' names, addresses, and telephone listings over to military recruiters. 
The military is working hard to recruit our young men and women. Given the current 
climate, the question of a draft is not an academic issue, and therefore the question 
of expanding the draft to include women becomes an urgent matter for debate.</FONT></P><P> 
</P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Our campaign is 
reaching out to high schools and colleges across the country to raise the issue 
of military recruitment and the problems surrounding a possible draft as the situation 
in Iraq worsens. I am not prepared to accept the loss of a single life for any 
oil in Iraq or the profits of Halliburton.&quot;</FONT></P><P></P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p></font><!-- #EndEditable --></td></tr>
