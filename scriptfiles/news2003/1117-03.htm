- November 17 - A coalition of the nation&#146;s environmental, consumer and public 
policy organizations, including Friends of the Earth, The Foundation on Economic 
Trends, Global Resource Action Center for the Environment, Greenpeace, the League 
of Conservation Voters, MoveOn.org, Public Citizen, the Sierra Club and the U.S. 
Public Interest Research Group (US PIRG), announced today an election year public 
education campaign to challenge the upcoming launch of President Bush&#146;s International 
Partnership for the Hydrogen Economy (IPHE). The White House will host a meeting 
of energy ministers from around the world on November 19-21, in Washington, D.C., 
to sign a landmark agreement to share research and development on hydrogen related 
activity, with a goal of ushering in a hydrogen economy over the course of the 
next several decades. The United States will serve as the secretariat of this 
first-of-a-kind global research and development effort.</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">While 
the Green Hydrogen Coalition supports a hydrogen future for America and the world, 
it charges the Bush administration with promoting a black hydrogen rather than 
a green hydrogen research and development agenda.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The 
Bush administration says that harnessing hydrogen will free the U.S. from dependence 
on Mideast oil and provide a non-polluting source of energy for electricity and 
transport. In reality, the White House plan calls for massive subsidies to the 
coal and nuclear industries to extract hydrogen&#151;a black hydrogen agenda. 
While Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham claims that the Bush administration 
is equally committed to research and development of renewable sources of energy 
to extract hydrogen&#151;a green hydrogen agenda&#151;the current energy bill 
tells a different story. The bill contains subsidies of more than $8 billion to 
the fossil fuels and nuclear industries and less than $4 billion to the renewable 
energy industries in its current draft.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The 
Green Hydrogen Coalition (GHC) charges the White House with using the IPHE initiative 
both as a smokescreen to deflect attention away from its dismal anti-environmental 
record and as a forum to promote the interests of the coal, oil, gas and nuclear 
industries.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The 
Green Hydrogen Coalition warns that if the United States is successful in steering 
the IPHE towards a black hydrogen future, it could lock the global economy into 
the old energy regime for much of the 21st century, with dire environmental and 
economic consequences.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The 
Green Hydrogen Coalition announces its own plan to launch a public education campaign 
to expose the Bush administration&#146;s black hydrogen agenda and says that it 
will mobilize voters and call on candidates for office to support expanded research 
and development into using renewable sources of energy to extract hydrogen.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The 
Green Hydrogen Coalition believes that the shift to fuel cells and a hydrogen 
economy will be as significant and far reaching in its impact on the American 
and global economy as the steam engine and coal in the 19th century and the internal 
combustion engine and oil in the 20th century. The vast energy and ecological 
benefits of a hydrogen future will only be realized, however, according to the 
Coalition, if renewable sources of energy become the prime source for extracting 
hydrogen. The coalition will lobby member countries in the IPHE to support a green 
hydrogen approach to the research and development of hydrogen energy.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The 
Green Hydrogen Coalition advocates an intentional program to build a renewable 
hydrogen-based future. While the green hydrogen economy is being phased in, the 
Coalition advocates simultaneously dealing with today&#146;s environmental problems 
directly and without delay through immediate implementation of solutions that 
are currently available, including: significant increases to vehicle fuel economy, 
the introduction of hybrid electric vehicles which pave the way to fuel cell cars, 
the redesign and overhaul of the nation&#146;s power grid, massive energy conservation 
measures, the Kyoto Protocol global warming treaty, and benchmarks targeting renewable 
energy adoption. The Coalition believes that these initiatives should parallel 
efforts by the IPHE to subsidize and underwrite the research and development of 
renewable energy technology, hydrogen and fuel cells. Governments should set the 
goal of a fully integrated green hydrogen economy by the middle of the 21st century.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">To

path toward a hydrogen economy must be paved with renewable energy and energy 
conservation. Unfortunately, the Bush administration is poised to pollute a hydrogen 
future by emphasizing dirty and dangerous fuels such as coal and nuclear power.&quot;</I></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">--Brent 
Blackwelder, president, Friends of the Earth</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><I>&quot;President 
Bush and the environmental community agree that hydrogen is America&#146;s future. 
We disagree on where to get the hydrogen from. The White House would like to extract 
hydrogen from coal and natural gas and by harnessing nuclear power to the task&#151;locking 
us into a black hydrogen future. The environmental community would like to use 
renewable sources of energy like wind, solar, hydro and geothermal to extract 
hydrogen from water or to extract hydrogen from biomass&#151;a green hydrogen 
future. The issue of black versus green hydrogen is going to be the seminal environmental 
question of the coming century.&quot;</I></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">--Jeremy 
Rifkin, president, The Foundation on Economic Trends</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><I>&quot;Powerful 
forces from the fossil fuel and nuclear industries are trying to hijack the promise 
of clean, safe energy &#150; generated sustainably by the wind, the sun and the 
tides&#151;in a cynical attempt to produce hydrogen fuel from the self-same energy 
sources which are wreaking havoc on our environment, increasing the likelihood 
of nuclear war and the destruction of earth&#146;s habitat. We need to employ 
the already existing solutions for conservation and sustainable energy production 
while shifting enormous taxpayer subsidies from polluting fuel industries and 
moving full speed ahead to develop the abundant promise of a green hydrogen economy.&quot;</I></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">--Alice 
Slater, president, Global Resource Action Center for the Environment</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><I>&quot;The 
Bush Administration is distracting us with the veil of energy security and leading 
the world down the wrong hydrogen road with a dirty scheme of hydrogen from nuclear 
and coal power. The Bush hydrogen partnership is another attempt to divert attention 
from their dangerous environmental policies by doing research and development 
instead of taking action now to solve problems. The only hydrogen economy that 
will ultimately provide national and environmental security is green hydrogen.&quot;</I></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">--John 
Passacantando, executive director, Greenpeace</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><I>&quot;While 
this international program of hydrogen research is laudable, the Bush administration 
should consider itself on notice that a mere photo-op does not constitute a progressive 
global energy policy. Hydrogen-related research should focus on renewable energy 
sources, not old, discredited, polluting technologies.&quot;</I></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">--Deb 
Callahan, president, League of Conservation Voters</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><I>&quot;If 
the Bush administration had its way, the world would be overrun with nuclear power 
plants to fuel an extremely energy-inefficient economy. Creating thousands of 
tons of nuclear waste while extracting hydrogen makes a mockery of clean energy 
goals; we must emphasize conservation and renewables over production and pollution.&quot;</I></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">--Joan 
Claybrook, president, Public Citizen</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><I>&quot;Getting 
hydrogen from dirty or unsafe sources makes no sense. It&#146;s like trying to 
lose weight by jogging to McDonalds.&quot;</I></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">--Dan 
Becker, director, Sierra Club Global Warming and Energy Program</FONT></P><P> 
<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><I>&quot;The good news is that 
here in the U.S., we have great untapped potential to generate energy and hydrogen 
from clean renewable sources like solar, wind, clean biomass and geothermal energy. 
The bad news is the Bush Administration opposes setting strong national renewable 
energy standards and global warming pollution reduction standards, and instead 
keeps us in the dark ages with continued reliance on fossil fuels and nuclear 
power.&quot;</I></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">--Katherine
