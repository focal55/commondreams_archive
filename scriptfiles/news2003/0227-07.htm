                SC, - February 27 - Columbia attorney and former state senator 

                Tom Turnipseed will be departing for Iraq on Wednesday, March 

                5 to remain there for a month as part of the Iraq Peace Team, 

                a Voices in the Wilderness delegation. The Peace Team works with 

                everyday Iraqi citizens in this time of uncertainty and threat 

                of renewed attacks by the US military. Turnipseed opposes a US 

                invasion on moral and religious grounds and will be an eye witness 

                for truth as to the devastating effects sanctions and military 

                aggression have had on Iraqi citizens. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Turnipseed 

                said his research shows, "During the Gulf War we bombed Iraq's 

                eight multi-purpose dams, destroying flood control systems, irrigation, 

                municipal and industrial water storage, and hydroelectric power. 

                Major pumping stations were targeted and sewage facilities were 

                destroyed. Article 54 of the Geneva Convention prohibits attacks 

                on drinking water installations and supplies and irrigations works. 

                After such deliberate destruction, we used sanctions to prevent 

                Iraq from rebuilding, knowing epidemics would ensue. The United 

                Nations' Children's Fund (UNICEF) estimates that well over a million 

                Iraqis have died as a result. In 2000, UNICEF said that thousands 

                die every month, including many children who are without necessary 

                medicine due to sanctions. The cancer rate among people of all 

                ages, and especially the very young, has exploded due to the unprecedented 

                bombing of Iraq with depleted uranium warheads in the 1991 War 

                and during the sanctions period since." </font>

                launch a new massive military attack against the people of Iraq, 

                I am traveling with the Iraq Peace Team to see first hand the 

                damage the United States has inflicted on Iraqi citizens by twelve 

                years of hostile acts. My first grandson and third granddaughter 

                are due to be born while I am away, but my grandchildren are the 

                main reason I'm going on this mission of peace." </font>

                of Tom's South Carolina Support Team is his wife, Judy who said, 

                "If not for the pending births, I would be going with Tom. He 

                carries my heart and spirit with him and I will be his presence

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Voices in the 

                Wilderness has campaigned to end the economic sanctions against 

                the people of Iraq since March 1996. With nearly fifty delegations 

                traveling to Iraq, the Peace Team is maintaining a constant presence 

                in Iraq to stand in solidarity for peace with the Iraqi people. 

                By reporting to their home countries the situation in Iraq, the 

                delegates hope to bring awareness of the reality of Iraqi life, 

                a reality not available on most media outlets. </font>
