- May 22 - "Once again, the anti-choice dominated House and Senate have jeopardized the health, dignity and lives of overseas military women and dependants by denying them access to privately funded abortions," declared NARAL Pro-Choice American President Kate Michelman. Today both the House and Senate rejected amendments to the Department of Defense authorization bill that would have repealed the ban on privately funded abortions at overseas military facilities.

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"At a time when more and more military women are defending Americas' rights and freedoms abroad, Congress is curtailing their constitutional liberties. It is appalling that women who sacrifice their lives in service must continue to forego basic health care services in overseas military hospitals." Michelman continued, "Now is the time it would seem most appropriate to reaffirm their fundamental rights. Apparently anti-choice lawmakers disagree." 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Today's vote further signifies the lengths to which anti-choice policymakers will go to deny servicewomen and dependants access to safe, legal, medical procedures." Michelman concluded, "Our overseas military personnel deserve the same rights as women here America." 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Background: The respective amendments offered by Representative Loretta Sanchez (D-CA) and Senators Patty Murray (D-WA) and Olympia Snowe (R-ME), would have lifted the current-law ban on privately funded abortions in overseas military hospitals. The amendments would not require the Department of Defense to pay for abortions, nor would it affect current policies that permit military personnel who object to abortion to participate in the procedure.
