                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Encon Environmental 

                Services of El Paso, Texas; Encon's owners, Roberto Loya of El 

                Paso and Jesus Audelio Uribe Franco of Ciudad Juarez, Mexico; 

                Victor Manuel Arroyo Balderas, warehouse coordinator of Encon, 

                Raul Chavez Beltran; and Ramon Martinez Altamirano of El Paso, 

                Texas; were named in an indictment, unsealed on Feb. 13 in U.S. 

                District Court for the Western District of Texas in El Paso. Loya, 

                Altamirano, Franco and Balderas were subsequently arrested. The 

                indictment charges violations of the Resource Conservation and 

                Recovery Act when the five men and Encon participated in a scheme 

                resulting in the illegal importation of hazardous waste into the 

                United States. The indictment alleges Encon, Beltran and Franco 

                developed a business relationship, in about 1995, with Loya to 

                illegally import hazardous wastes, including soil contaminated 

                with mercury, into the United States without a permit. Altamirano 

                and Balderas allegedly supported the illegal operation. The defendants 

                allegedly informed companies that had hired Encon to dispose of 

                hazardous wastes that the wastes were being disposed of in a legal 

                manner. Instead, the charges state that the wastes were illegally 

                stored in a warehouse in El Paso. Failing to properly dispose 

                of mercury- containing wastes can lead to human contact with mercury 

                which, in sufficient amounts, can cause brain damage and other 

                illnesses. The case was investigated by the EPA Criminal Investigation 

                Division Dallas Area Office, the Texas Commission on Environmental 

                Quality, and the Texas Environmental Task Force. It is being prosecuted 

                by the U.S. Attorney's Office in El Paso. An indictment is merely 

                an accusation, and all defendants are presumed innocent unless 

                or until proven guilty in a court of law. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Gary Wasserson 

                was indicted on Feb. 13 in U.S. District Court for the Eastern 

                District of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia for allegedly violating 

                the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. Wasserson was owner 

                of the now closed Chief Executive Officer of Sterling Supply Co. 

                in Philadelphia, Pa., which provided dry cleaning supplies to 

                Philadelphia-area dry cleaning stores. While in operation Sterling 

                Supply accumulated hundreds of drums and containers of chemicals 

                such as acetone, sodium perborate tetrahydrate, sodium hydrosulfite, 

                isopropanol, tetrachloroethylene (also known as perchloroethylene 

                or perc), methylene chloride, xylene, and naphalene. These chemicals 

                are toxic and/or flammable and present hazards to those who unknowingly 

                came into contact with them. The government charges Wasserson 

                illegally transported and disposed of the chemicals stored at 

                the Sterling Supply facility in 1999, by sending them to the Girard 

                Point Transfer Station in Philadelphia from where they were taken 

                to the Modern Landfill in York, Pa. Improperly landfilling of 

                toxic chemicals can contaminate ground water and make it unfit 

                for human consumption. If convicted, Wasserson could receive a 

                maximum sentence of up to 12 years in prison and/or a fine of 

                up to $150,000. The case was investigated by the Philadelphia 

                Area Office of the EPA Criminal Investigation Division and by 

                the FBI. It is being prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney's office 

                in Philadelphia. An indictment is merely an accusation and all 

                defendants are presumed innocent unless or until proven guilty 

                in a court of law. </font>

                MEN INDICTED AND ARRESTED FOR FAILURE TO DISCLOSE LEAD PAINT </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thomas F. Sailor 

                of O'Fallon, Mo., and Marco Webster of St. Louis, Mo., were each 

                indicted on Feb. 12 and were arrested Feb. 19. The charges are 

                they both violated the Toxic Substances Control Act by failing 

                to disclose lead-based paint to home buyers and charges they falsified 

                lead paint disclosure forms. Exposure to chips and dust from lead-based 

                paint can produce neurological damage and other diseases so disclosing 

                the presence of lead-based paint to home buyers is required by 

                federal law. The risk of exposure to lead is especially high among 

                small children who can experience significant delays in mental 

                development and may even die when they are exposed to lead as 

                they crawl and play on the floor. If convicted on all counts, 

                each defendant faces a maximum sentence of up to six years in 

                prison and/or a potential fine of more than $250,000. Charges 

                were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District 

                of Missouri in St. Louis. The case was investigated by the St. 

                Louis Area Office of EPA's Criminal Investigation Division, the 

                EPA Region 7 Office of Inspector General and the City of St. Louis 

                Division of Health. It is being prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney's 

                Office in St. Louis. An indictment is merely an accusation and 

                all defendants are presumed innocent unless or until proven guilty 

                in a court of law. </font>

                Christie Whitman recognized 37 new members of the Performance 

                Track program. The program is a voluntary partnership program 

                with public and private entities that go beyond compliance with 

                environmental regulations and commit to continual environmental 

                improvement over the next three years. Facilities recognized in 

                this program consistently meet their legal requirements, implement 

                environmental management systems, voluntarily achieve environmental 

                improvements beyond compliance, and report on progress. Launched 

                in June 2000, Performance Track now has quickly grown and now 

                has a total of 304 members. This round of Performance Track members 

                includes the first port facility, the Port of Houston; the first 

                jet manufacturer, Dassault Falcon Jet Corp; and the first concrete 

                manufacturing facility, Lafarge Alpharetta Ready Mix. EPA also 

                welcomes seven small businesses, one federal facility and additional 

                facilities from already-represented organizations, such as International 

                Paper, Baxter International Inc., Dupont, Arizona Chemical, Dana 

                Spicer, Lockheed Martin, Sony, Bridgestone-Firestone, Motorola, 

                Pfizer, 3M and NASA. Individual facilities commit to specific 

                environmental improvements, examples of this include: a 64 percent 

                reduction in Volatile Organic Compound emissions by 2005; a 50 

                percent reduction in water use that will save 20 million gallons 

                per year; and recycling and reduced energy consumption commitments.
