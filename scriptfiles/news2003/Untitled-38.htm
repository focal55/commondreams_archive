                MD. - March 5 - The just-released March 2003 issue of the science 

                journal, Pediatrics, features commentary from Drs. Karen Nelson 

                and Margaret Bauman on the possible role of thimerosal as a cause 

                of autism. Thimerosal is a mercury-based preservative used in 

                many vaccines. While Bauman and Nelson consider the autism-thimerosal 

                link "improbable", many scientists and parent advocacy groups 

                think otherwise and blame its use for the devastating rise in 

                autism which now affects up to 1 in 150 children. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thousands of 

                parents have reported biological and neurodevelopmental changes 

                in their children directly following administration of mercury-containing 

                vaccines. Symptoms, including sudden onset of shyness, GI distress, 

                loss of motor skill function, allergies, the inability to speak, 

                tremors and autonomic disturbances, mimic those associated with 

                mercury poisoning. In 1999, the FDA issued a statement indicating 

                some children may have been exposed to unsafe levels of mercury 

                via thimerosal-containing vaccines. Public attention to the thimerosal 

                issue increased after several congressional hearings and after 

                lawmakers snuck a provision into the Homeland Security Bill that 

                would protect drug companies from thimerosal-based lawsuits. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The Nelson-Bauman 

                commentary has a number of inaccuracies that call into question 

                the legitimacy of the paper's conclusions," said Sallie Bernard, 

                Executive Director of the advocacy group Safe Minds and the lead 

                author of two autism-mercury papers cited by the Pediatrics article. 

                "For example, they claim that survivors of acrodynia, a form of 

                mercury poisoning, did not have behavioral disorders suggestive 

                of autism but case descriptions clearly show that they did, such 

                as loss of speech, odd behaviors, and social withdrawal. Likewise, 

                the authors remark that mercury studies from the Faroe Islands 

                found no cases of autism, but these studies by design excluded 

                any children with neurological disease." </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lyn Redwood, 

                RN, President of Safe Minds and a co-author of the two autism-mercury 

                papers, pointed out that the Pediatrics authors base their argument 

                of thimerosal safety on a purportedly "weak association" between 

                neurodevelopmental disorders and exposure to thimerosal containing 

                vaccines found by the Centers for Disease Control in an unpublished 

                study. "The supposedly weak association is a mischaracterization. 

                Safe Minds obtained an earlier version of the CDC study that in 

                fact found a 2 1/2 times increase in the risk of developing autism 

                after exposure to increased thimerosal in vaccines. In a court 

                of law, a relative risk of 2.0 or greater is sufficient to substantiate 

                that a given exposure caused disease." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many parents 

                are angry that the Nelson-Bauman article compares symptoms of 

                mercury poisoning to those found in classic but often inadequate 

                descriptions of autistic children. Lori McIlwain, co-founder of 

                parent advocacy group MOMA, says that once the word "autism" comes 

                up, the medical community puts their blinders on. "After receiving 

                a mercury-containing vaccine, my child had tremors and unusual 

                sweating patterns, which doctors don't associate with autism, 

                yet they diagnosed him with autism based on the more well-known 

                symptoms. He was also exposed to thimerosal during pregnancy via 

                my RhoGAM(tm) injection, and he has almost every symptom listed 

                on the FDA's web site for prenatal mercury exposure." </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A thorough 

                review of the Pediatrics article is currently underway by Safe 

                Minds. One area of investigation is the failure of the authors 

                to acknowledge the high mercury levels found in children with 

                autism. During the Institute of Medicine review of thimerosal 

                in 2001, Dr. Jeffrey Bradstreet presented a study of 191 children 

                with autism with documented mercury levels 500 percent greater 

                than those of children without autism. </font>
