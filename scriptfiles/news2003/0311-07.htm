                SPRINGS, OHIO - March 11 - In a referendum including students, 

                faculty, staff, and community government Antioch College passed 

                a resolution opposing a pre-emptive strike on Iraq. A total of 

                328 community members voted: 308 in support of the resolution, 

                16 opposed, 4 undecided. The resolution states, ?we the members 

                of Antioch College declare that we will not support a war without 

                boundaries, without rationality and ultimately without just cause.? 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The community-wide 

                vote follows two resolutions against the war passed on February 

                18, one by the faculty of Antioch College and a unanimous vote 

                by the elected members of the Administrative Council of the College. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the past 

                months the College has hosted events on the subject of the Iraq 

                crisis including poetry and dramatic readings and a joint discussion 

                with the village of Yellow Springs. In addition, a day of workshops, 

                panel discussions, and performances about the threat of war with 

                Iraq will be held all day and evening Friday, March 14. </font>

                of the referendum is included below: </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Referendum 

                passed by the Antioch Community on March 4, 2003 OPPOSING THE 

                WAR ON IRAQ </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As people in 

                a nation whose government has in the past chosen violence over 

                diplomacy, secrecy over public discourse and fear over understanding, 

                we are deeply saddened and angered that the call to war has been 

                made in such haste. As the hundreds of millions who share our 

                sentiments around the United States and around the world have 

                already stated, we, the members of Antioch College, declare that 

                we will not support a war without boundaries, without rationality 

                and ultimately without just cause. This declaration is a plea 

                for international diplomacy and due process over unwarranted bloodshed 

                and the fervent rush to war with Iraq. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A pre-emptive 

                strike against Iraq will not protect our national security, but 

                may, in fact, threaten it. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Bush Administration 

                has failed to present irrefutable evidence of an imminent danger 

                to our national security. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Waging war 

                against Iraq without United Nations consent violates International 

                law. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Given the current 

                domestic economic situation, we believe that the funds allocated 

                toward a war effort would be better spent on education, housing, 

                health care, job training, and renewable energy. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Due to the 

                inevitable effects of war: loss of civilian life, destruction 

                of infrastructure, displacement of peoples, and environmental 

                devastation; all avenues to a peaceful resolution should be seriously 

                pursued to avoid armed conflict. A pre-emptive war and a regime 

                change will only serve to destabilize the region. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Given that 

                a disproportionate percentage of the U.S. armed forces are working-class 

                and people of color, the burden of war will rest unjustly on their 

                shoulders. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The continued 

                bombing and economic sanctions have primarily impacted the civilians 

                of Iraq; another war will further deprive the Iraqi people of 

                their basic human rights. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We believe 

                that American interests as defined by the Bush Administration 

                are not synonymous with the public interests. The true beneficiaries 

                of this war will be the few privileged enough to shape the consequences. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Let this declaration 

                not stand as the end to discussion and deliberation, rather, let 

                it be an invitation to further debate within our campus and our 

                country. Education only happens through discourse; therefore we 

                welcome all who wish to take part in the larger conversation.
