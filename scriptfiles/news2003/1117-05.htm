British author of Regime Unchanged, a just-released book on the invasion of Iraq, 

Rai is in the U.S. until November 25. He said today: &quot;President Bush recently 

said in an interview with the BBC of the war on Iraq: 'War is my last choice, 

not my first choice.' In March 2002, a year before the war on Iraq, President 

Bush told three senators meeting National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice, '[Expletive 

deleted] Saddam. We're taking him out.' The President was determined to avoid 

a peaceful resolution of the Iraq crisis. On March 17, 2003, UN weapons inspectors 

presented the Security Council with a program of activities which they felt could 

clarify the lingering questions.... Instead of allowing the Security Council to 

consider, and possibly approve and initiate these 'key remaining disarmament tasks,' 

President Bush chose that night to give Iraq a 48-hour ultimatum, and to order 

the inspectors out of Iraq immediately. War was the first choice, ahead of inspections.&quot;<br>

is the editor of the soon-to-be-released Tell Me Lies: Propaganda and Media Distortion 

in the Attack on Iraq and a member of the Stirling Media Research Institute. He 

said today: &quot;Opposition to the war, the occupation of Iraq and the Bush visit 

are re-galvanizing U.K. public opinion, which has been shifting back to opposition 

to the war. This has been partly because public opinion now believes that Blair 

duped them over the issue of weapons of mass destruction. It is also partly because 

U.K. voters feel that the relationship between Blair and Bush is too close and 

that the U.S. is making the world a more dangerous place. The news that the U.S. 

government effectively asked for the right to 'shoot to kill' protestors in the 

U.K. will not play well in the U.K.&quot; <br>

pathologist from Iraq who has lived in the U.K. since 1981, Ibrahim has substantial 

contact with his family in Basra, which he last visited in January. He said today: 

&quot;My family doesn't want me to visit now because that would make the family 

a target for thieves. Lack of order means that gangs of thugs can do what they 

want. My brother is considering moving to Baghdad. Doctors in Basra are killed 

and kidnapped; the hospital can't function. Everyone is terrified...&quot; Ibrahim

lecturer in politics at Cambridge University, Rangwala was last in Iraq in September 

this year. He said today: &quot;President Bush last visited the U.K. in April, 

during the first phase of the war on Iraq. Tony Blair stood alongside him and 

told him that 'the regime is weakening, the Iraqi people are turning towards us.' 

As they talk this time ... U.S. jets and helicopters will still be bombing Iraq, 

as they grapple with the prospect of a violent resistance movement that can outlast 

and outwit them, having brought chaos to Iraqi society and having deepened the 

poverty of many.... [In April] Blair assured the President, 'On weapons of mass 

destruction, we know that the regime has them, we know that as the regime collapses 

we will be led to them.'&quot;</FONT></li>
