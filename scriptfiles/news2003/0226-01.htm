                - February 26 - As U.S. officials intensify their arm-twisting 

                offensive to gather support for a war on Iraq, the Institute for 

                Policy Studies is releasing a new study today that examines the 

                specific levers of U.S. military, economic, and political power. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The study, 

                entitled "Coalition of the Willing or Coalition of the Coerced?," 

                looks at how this leverage applies to each current member of the 

                UN Security Council. It also analyzes the power the U.S. government 

                exerts over the broader group of countries that the Bush Administration 

                has dubbed the "Coalition of the Willing." Although the Administration 

                refuses to release a list of the members of this coalition, the 

                authors compiled a list of 34 nations cited in press reports as 

                supporters of the U.S. position on Iraq. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Major findings: 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although the 

                Bush Administration claims that the anonymous "Coalition of the 

                Willing" is the basis of genuine multilateralism, the report shows 

                that most were recruited through coercion, bullying, and bribery. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The pursuit 

                of access to U.S. export markets is a powerful lever for influence 

                over many countries, including Chile and Costa Rica, both of which 

                are close to concluding free trade deals with the United States; 

                African nations that want to maintain U.S. trade preferences; 

                and Mexico, which depends on the U.S. market for about 80 percent 

                of its export sales. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The populations 

                of the countries in the so-called "Coalition of the Willing" make 

                up only about 10 percent of the world's population. Opponents 

                of the U.S. position currently include the leading economies of 

                four continents (Germany, Brazil, China, and South Africa). </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">President Bush 

                could make or break the chances of Eastern European members of 

                the "Coalition of the Willing" that are eager to become members 

                of NATO. In order for these nations to join the military alliance, 

                Bush must ask the Senate for approval. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The authors 

                of the 13-page study include: IPS UN and Middle East expert Phyllis 

                Bennis, IPS Director John Cavanagh, and IPS Fellow Sarah Anderson. 

                According to Bennis, "It's hardly a new phenomenon for the U.S. 

                to use bribes and threats to get its way in the UN. What's new 

                this time around is the breathtaking scale of those pressures 

                -- because this time around, global public opinion has weighed 

                in, and every government leaning Washington's way faces massive 

                opposition at home." </font>
