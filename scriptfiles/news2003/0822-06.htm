- August 22 - &quot;President Bush's comments in the

wake of last week's blackout are correct --  we need a practical restructuring of the U.S.'s inefficient and dangerous energy system,&quot; said Don Eichelberger, Energy Action Group coordinator for the Green Party of California.  &quot;We need to begin by reversing the deregulation of the electrical power industry, which has proved itself more concerned about profits than in improving safety and efficiency.&quot;</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greens note that the power failure caused nine nuclear

reactors to shut down, revealing the vulnerability of

nuclear power and the peril it poses to the

surrounding environment, especially nearby cities and

towns.  The Green Party of the United States has

called for public control and re-regulation of

electricity; conversion from fossil fuel and nuclear

to safe, clean, renewable solar, wind, and fuel cell

energy; and reduced consumption. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greens have also supported decentralized production of electricity and incentives for local generation of energy, such as rooftop solar panels.  In Delaware, Greens fought the sale of Delmarva Power to Potomac Power, an out-of-state utility on the basis of responsiveness to the community, protection of the pensions of retired workers, and the need for money to be set aside for development of green energy initiatives.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;In June 2001, President Bush lobbied against

legislation to provide $350 million worth of loans to

update the power grid after weaknesses were exposed,&quot;

said Mark Dunlea, chair of the Green Party of New York

State.  &quot;He convinced Republicans in Congress to vote

it down.  We must hold Bush and his party responsible

for the blackout and its disastrous financial effect

on cities throughout northeastern and midwestern

states.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;If reform means further deregulation, gifts and deals

for energy and power companies, and greater corporate

control over energy policy, we're going to see a lot

more breakdowns, security breaches, energy crises of

the kind we saw in California, and Enron-style

scandals,&quot; said Beth Ingalls, Green member of the

Truckee, California City Council.  &quot;Unfortunately,

this is the direction we're headed under the Bush Administration.&quot;</font></p>
