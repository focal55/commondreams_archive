                - March 6 -<P>

                <LI>Has the National Security Agency, as the <I>Observer</I> in 

                  Britain recently reported, been spying on delegates from various 

                  countries at the UN? Is the U.S. bribing and threatening other 

                  UN members?

<P>

                <LI>You have said that this invasion of Iraq would be &quot;moral,&quot; 

                  yet the national board of your own denomination, the United 

                  Methodists, has said: &quot;It is inconceivable that Jesus Christ 

                  ... would support this proposed attack.&quot; How do you respond 

                  to them

<P>

                <LI>Considering that the U.S. government has based its case for 

                  war against Iraq on a non-existent IAEA report, a plagiarized 

                  dossier, non-existent Iraq-Al'Qaida link, and twisting of the 

                  words of Saddam's late son-in-law Hussein Kamel (see the March 

                  3 <I>Newsweek</I> for background information), what evidence 

                  can you offer to support your claim that Iraq represents a threat 

                  to the world today?

<P>

                <LI>Doesn't your push towards war actually foster resentment against 

                  the U.S. and place American lives at risk?

<P>

                <LI>Do you have an estimate of how many Iraqis would be killed 

                  in an invasion?

<P>

                <LI>If Iraq disarms, will you allow the lifting of the economic 

                  sanctions on that nation?

<P>

                <LI>Does Israel possess nuclear weapons? Is Israel in violation 

                  of UN Security Council resolutions? How much money do we send 

                  to Israel each year?

<P>

                <LI>Why won't you give the American people an estimate of the 

                  full financial costs of this invasion?

<P>

                <LI><I>National Review</I> online today reports that some Democrats 

                  are considering introducing articles of impeachment against 

                  you. What is your comment?

<P>

                <LI>Both you and Vice President Cheney were oil men; Condoleezza 

                  Rice even had an oil tanker named after her. Iraq has the second-largest 

                  oil reserves with very low drilling costs. Are we really to 

                  believe that this conflict with Iraq has nothing to do with 

                  oil?

<P>

                <LI>You have said that you want democracy in the Mideast, but 

                  the vast majority of the people in Turkey, the region, and indeed 

                  the world are opposed to your policies. Isn't there a contradiction 

                  between saying you're for democracy and advancing policies that 

                  relatively few people seem to want?

<P>

                <LI>Why do you claim Iraq threatens its neighbors while its neighbors 

                  assert the contrary?

<P>

                <LI>Donald Rumsfeld was helping to normalize relations with Saddam 

                  Hussein, shaking his hand in the mid-'80s. Have you discussed 

                  this with Rumsfeld?

<P>

                <LI>The U.S. government has stated its intention to avoid civilian 

                  casualties while the Pentagon stated there will be &quot;no 

                  safe place in Baghdad.&quot; How do you reconcile these claims?

<P>

                <LI>At the same time that you have made demands on Iraq, your 

                  administration has undermined various arms control agreements, 

                  such as the Biological Weapons Convention and the ABM treaty.
