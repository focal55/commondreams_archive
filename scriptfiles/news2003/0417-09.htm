                FRANCISCO - April 17 - A settlement proposal to restore the San 

                Joaquin River and resolve one of California's longest-running 

                water disputes has been rejected by water districts who have diverted 

                all the river's water for more than 50 years. By walking away 

                from a federal mediator's final compromise proposal, the Friant 

                Water Users Authority ended four years of negotiations with a 

                coalition of conservation and fishing groups led by NRDC (Natural 

                Resources Defense Council), sending the case back to court. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If the Friant 

                irrigation districts had accepted the compromise settlement proposal 

                by the Chief Mediator of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, 

                it would have marked an historic agreement between conservationists, 

                fishing groups and farmers to restore flows and salmon populations 

                to California's second largest river, which currently runs dry 

                below Friant Dam. It also would have prevented a return to litigation, 

                where the Friant farmers repeatedly have lost major rulings in 

                both the trial and appellate courts. The current stay of litigation 

                expires on April 22. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We are disappointed 

                and puzzled that Friant rejected this historic opportunity to 

                restore the San Joaquin River," said Jared Huffman, NRDC staff 

                attorney and San Joaquin River project manager. "After swallowing 

                the entire river for more than 50 years, the Friant water districts 

                just can't swallow the idea of changing business as usual." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The dispute 

                centers on whether the federally owned Friant Dam near Fresno 

                is subject to the same laws that require all other dams in California 

                to release water to sustain fish. Unlike other major dams, Friant 

                releases no water for the environment, causing parts of the river 

                to completely dry up. Before the dam was built in the 1940s, the 

                river supported hundreds of thousands of spawning salmon every 

                year, the southernmost Chinook salmon run in North America. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Friant 

                water districts' gamble could put its users in a difficult position. 

                The water users and their co-defendant, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, 

                which owns the dam, have lost repeated rulings in the 15-year 

                court battle. After Judge Lawrence Karlton of the U.S. District 

                Court in Sacramento invalidated the water districts' federal water 

                contracts in 1997, the U.S. government declined to appeal. The 

                water districts appealed, anyway, and lost. The parties then began 

                a four-year settlement process, during which they commissioned 

                several joint studies of how the river could be restored in a 

                balanced manner that would meet the water supply needs of current 

                users. They also agreed that all new water contracts for Friant 

                water users would depend on the outcome of the case. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The comprehensive 

                studies conducted by Friant and the environmental coalition over 

                the past four years demonstrate that a living river can be restored 

                while preserving a strong and healthy agricultural economy," said 

                Gary Bobker, program director of the Bay Institute and one of 

                the lead negotiators for the coalition. "In fact, there are dozens 

                of water management measures that can be employed to benefit both 

                farmers and the environment. But by rejecting the settlement proposal, 

                Friant is trading a world of cooperation -- where partnerships 

                with conservationists, government agencies and other water users, 

                coupled with major funding for environmental and water management 

                initiatives from Proposition 50 and other sources, would help 

                support a smooth transition to restoring the river -- for a world 

                of non-cooperation where the river will have to wait for a solution 

                from the court." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Historically 

                the upper San Joaquin River was a major source of water to the 

                delta," said Tom Zuckerman of the Central Delta Water Agency, 

                which represents farmers in San Joaquin County. "Friant Dam cut 

                off those flows and caused harm all the way downstream. This was 

                aggravated by the export of water from the delta to the west side 

                of the San Joaquin Valley and the return of polluted drainage 

                water back into the river. The Bureau of Reclamation's management 

                has had a terrible impact on the health of the river and downstream 

                agriculture -- all the way through the delta." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There is no 

                question that the river will be restored, according to the NRDC, 

                which leads 15 conservation and fishing groups in the case representing 

                more than 2 million members. The plaintiffs say the only question 

                is whether it will be accomplished through a mediated settlement 

                or by court order. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We must ensure 

                that through balanced planning we can protect this vital public 

                resource for farmers, families, fish and wildlife, not just for 

                ourselves, but for our children and all future generations," said 

                Huffman. "Only by taking action now to restore the river can we 

                protect both our economy and our quality of life." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite significant 

                concerns, the NRDC coalition accepted the mediator's confidential 

                settlement proposal. "After meeting with both sides for months, 

                the mediator proposed a compromise that would restore the San 

                Joaquin River while ensuring an adequate, long-term water supply 

                for Friant area farmers," said Huffman. "Neither side got everything 

                it wanted in the mediator's proposal, but we made the difficult 

                decision to accept this compromise in order to get on with the 

                task of restoring the river." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The drying 

                up of the San Joaquin River has caused devastating hardship for 

                California's fishermen and the communities they support," said 

                Zeke Grader, executive director of the Pacific Coast Federation 

                of Fishermen's Associations. "Restoring the river will benefit 

                a broad cross-section of the state, but it appears the growers 

                who are calling the shots at Friant prefer to keep all the water 

                themselves and continue to impoverish the fishermen." </font>
