- May 5 - Burma's dictatorship, led by Senior General Than Shwe, has released 75-year-old political prisoner Dr. Salai Tun Than and 17 other of Burma's 1,400 political prisoners after his hunger strike brought intense international pressure and attention from grassroots citizens and governments, including from the U.S. State Department, leading members of U.S. Congress, and the United Nations. Dr. Tun Than launched his hunger strike on Sunday, April 27 to protest cruel and inhumane treatment of political prisoners, and to demand their release.

<p></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Upon his release, Dr. Salai Tun Than said, "Thanks to everyone that helped us to obtain our freedom.  Please continue your actions to get the release of all political prisoners."

</font>

<p></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">His release from the prison is conditional.  If he conducts any political acts deemed "illegal" under the draconian Emergency Provisions Act, a law used to imprison political activists, his current seven-year sentence will be added to any additional sentence.

</font>

<p></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The release of Salai Tun Than shows that the military regime will respond only to intense international pressure," says Aung Din, Director of Policy for the Free Burma Coalition and himself a former prisoner of conscience in Burma. "While we welcome his release, it is all but certain that the regime has sidestepped the issues at hand - the continued imprisonment of up to 1,400 other political prisoners and the ongoing violations of their basic human rights and religious liberties.

</font>

<p></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the United States and United Kingdom, recipient of a substantial portion of Burma's exports that provide a critical source of foreign currency for the dictators, grassroots groups organized by the Free Burma Coalition conducted protests in five cities while hundreds of students and others participated in a 24 hour hunger strike on Friday in solidarity with Dr. Tun Than.  Leading U.S. Senators Russell Feingold and Herb Kohl supported Dr. Salai Tun Than and demanded his release. U.S. Congressman Max Burns also took up the case, calling Tun Than's imprisonment "unlawful".  As a result of their advocacy efforts, the U.S. State Department weighed in heavily with the regime, exercising its considerable political clout.  The United Nations also demanded Tun Than's release through one of its envoys.

</font>

<p></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Still, cautions Dr. Tun Than's daughter, the dictators may be sidestepping the real issue.

</font>

<p></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"My father did not conduct his hunger strike to demand his own release," says Mai Theingi Tun Than, Salai Tun Than's daughter, who lives in California. "He did it protest cruel and inhumane treatment and to demand the release of all 1,400 prisoners, but there is no evidence to suggest they are responding."

</font>

<p></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dr. Salai Tun Than mounted his nonviolent resistance to protest the continued imprisonment of political prisoners even after many have completed their sentences, interrogations of prisoners following visits by the United Nations and International Committee of the Red Cross, restrictions on communication between prisoners, unsanitary prison conditions, inadequate medical supplies and treatment, and forced "hooding" as prisoners are transported outside. He also protested restrictions on his religious freedom as a Christian, including the regime's refusal to allow him a Bible or to receive communion.

</font>

<p></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It seems clear that without even more international pressure, the regime is not going to release these political prisoners any time soon," Aung Din says

</font>

<p></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dr. Tun Than's hunger strike put him in great danger as he suffers from severe ill health including eye problems, bone disease, and other ailments.</font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
