- July 10 - The Bush administration's push for &quot;faith-based&quot; solutions to drug abuse raises serious constitutional problems, according to Americans United for Separation of Church and State.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This week, Bush Drug Czar John P. Walters and other administration officials are campaigning at a series of public appearances for a religiously based response to drug abuse. Today, Walters unveiled a new website and other resources aimed at religious leaders.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Americans United, which has spearheaded opposition to President George W. Bush's &quot;faith-based&quot; initiative, said the new project is just one component of a larger agenda.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Bush administration seems to think there's a 'faith-based' solution to every social and medical problem in America,&quot; said the Rev. Barry W. Lynn, Americans United executive director. &quot;The project announced today is one very small part of a larger crusade that raises troubling constitutional concerns.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The White House is ignoring vital constitutional safeguards,&quot; continued Lynn. &quot;The Constitution calls for a separation between religion and government, not a merger.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lynn said the Bush administration can't seem to distinguish between treatment programs that follow accepted medical and scientific strictures and those based on preaching and evangelism. Many religiously motivated programs follow accepted treatment procedures, but some of those touted by the White House do not. The Bush administration has called for $600 million in new federal funds for treatment options, including religiously based programs.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On July 8, Bush Drug Czar Walters appeared in Riverside, Calif., at a &quot;Teen Challenge&quot; facility that relies on conversion to fundamentalist Christianity as its form of treatment. The group hires only evangelical Christians to staff its work. In testimony before Congress in 2001, a Teen Challenge official noted that some Jews who participate in the program convert to Christianity, becoming what he called &quot;completed Jews.&quot; Many Jewish leaders found the term offensive.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to the Los Angeles Times, Walters praised Teen Challenge, saying, &quot;It is an honor to celebrate your miracles.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Said AU's Lynn, &quot;It is unconstitutional for the federal government to pay for programs that proselytize and discriminate in hiring. The Bush administration is way out of line on this. &quot;</font></p>
