</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Chet Guinn announced &quot;I am here today to present enthusiastically and wholeheartedly STAR*PAC's endorsement of Dennis Kucinich for President of the United States in 2004.&quot; Guinn said that Kucinich could be 'the first President of the new millennium to stand for peace' and noted that &quot;Dennis Kucinich's campaign commitments constitute a significant alignment of purpose with the goals and mission of STAR*PAC. They emphatically set this candidate apart from the field and most closely represent the views and aspirations of STAR*PAC's mission.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Guinn outlined the mission of STAR*PAC as &quot;working to educate Iowans and others on peace issues, influence legislation in Congress and actively support candidates who are dedicated to peace.&quot;  In past elections, Guinn said, the organization has supported peace candidates through direct endorsements, candidate forums on peace issues, sponsorship of speaking tours featuring nationally known military experts and peace advocates, media campaigns, direct contributions and get out the vote efforts.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Guinn called Kucinich &quot;a visionary, but not an idle dreamer.  He sets out practical and reasoned ways to achieve peace.  He demonstrates vision and holds aloft a glimpse of what a renewed commitment to peace could mean for our nation's people, our economy, our reputation in the world, for regaining our place as a respected world leader... not just because of our military might but because of our heart.  He reminds us that America's civil liberties and Democracy should be a model for the rest of the world.  And that Democracy can be nurtured but never imposed from the outside.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Guinn noted that Kucinich's long term plan for peace &quot;makes sense and is based on building relationship, on collaboration, on understanding how our nations has come to be perceived as an aggressor, as a bully, and what we can do to regain the collaboration and respect of the rest of the world.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Citing Kucinich's understanding of the world, his experience in the legislature, and a deep empathy for the struggles of 'the common man', Guinn set forth components of Kucinich's campaign which won STAR*PAC's endorsement

including:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">.	his early and consistent opposition to the war in Iraq

.	his call for an inquiry into an Administration deception regarding

weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and Iraq's ability to imminently threaten America

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">.	his commitment to disengage from the dangerous and rash 'pre-emptive

strike' strategy of this Administration.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

.	his call for real intelligence and for substantive changes in how we

dismantle terrorism</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

.	his provision for a strong military, but not at any cost.  He vows

to

cut $60 billion from the $400 billion proposed 2004 military budget, which would still mean that our military would far exceed the capabilities of every one of our perceived 'enemies' and the next (in size) 30 nations combined.  He vows to distribute those dollars to essential human services, decaying infrastructure, Homeland Security, universal healthcare and education services inside the United States.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

.	his intent to strengthen Homeland Security without sacrificing

America's

essential civil liberties which are a model for the rest of the world. 

Kucinich promises to cancel or re-write the controversial US Patriot Act.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

.	his vow to return to Congress the right to thoughtfully review

groundbreaking changes in constitutional law and strategies for war... a check our founders realized would ultimately protect America from rash and unjust actions</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

.	his call for early withdrawal of American troops from Iraq</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

.	his commitment to a collaborative international rebuilding and

peace-keeping mission in Iraq that shares lucrative rebuilding contracts with our allies</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

.	his vow to address world poverty and the desperation that makes 

terrorists out of people denied a voice in their own future.  Kucinich notes that no country should practice terrorism and that we 'must all refrain from condoning some acts of violence as justified while similar actions by others are dismissed as 'terrorism'.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

.	his promise to cancel NAFTA and boldly change US policy supporting

the

World Trade Organization, both of which have only served to increase global poverty, deepening one of the most virulent causes of terrorism.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

.	his assertion that world opinion can be turned to America's

advantage

once again by an understanding that &quot;We share this fragile planet and we are our brother's keeper&quot;.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">.	his commitment to raise salaries and benefits of our military and

their

families while reducing funding for unnecessary new weaponry systems.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

.	his determination to reduce world tensions without relaxing our

guard.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

.	his call for a cabinet level, pro-active Department of Peace to

promote

peaceful conflict resolution and peace-keeping as an alternative to the primitive choices of war and violence for settling differences at home and abroad.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

.	his promise to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty again to

reduce

the global threat of nuclear weapons to our environment, our health, our planet and people.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

.	his promise to end the use of landmines and sign the international

treaty to do so.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

.	his recommitment of US support for the United Nations, the

Declaration

of Human Rights and multi-lateral approaches to diplomacy and conflict resolution, promises to sign the Kyoto Treaty on Global Warming and to ratify the International Criminal Court

.	</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">his vow to end government underwriting and promotion of weapons

sales,

along with severe limitations on selling the US's latest high tech weaponry. This deadly cycle of creating the most devastating weapons, selling them to others, then calling for escalating development of even more devastating weapons must end.

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">.	his commitment to stop exporting small arms to the world's poorest nations whose people plead for bread and jobs but get guns instead.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Kucinich's approach to peace is a holistic approach&quot; Guinn noted, &quot;moving our nation systematically and on many levels in a new direction... the direction of peace.  It is a practical, long term plan that makes sense and is based on building relationship, on collaboration, on understanding how our nation has come to be perceived as an aggressor, as a bully, and what we can do to regain the collaboration and respect of the rest of the world.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Guinn noted that the Central Committee of STAR*PAC had used statements from all the candidates, campaign materials, speeches, and their responses to a STAR*PAC candidate questionnaire as the basis for their decision to endorse Dennis Kucinich.  He said they would be actively promoting his candidacy in many ways.  He asked that people interested in learning more about STAR*PAC's endorsement and their efforts for Kucinich should contact the organization's Des Moines office at 515-282-5111 for more information, to donate or to volunteer.  &quot;Within a couple days folks can also check the <a href="http://www.starpac.org" target="_new">STAR*PAC website</a> for the full content of STAR*PAC's endorsement speech and record of the questionnaire responses&quot;, Guinn promised.  </font></p>
