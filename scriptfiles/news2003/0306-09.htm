                - March 6 - Refusing to cave in to intense pressure from the White 

                House and Republican leaders, Democratic senators rejected an 

                effort to force a vote on the nomination of Miguel Estrada to 

                the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Estrada has refused 

                to answer many questions about his approach to the Constitution 

                and the White House has refused to release documents that would 

                allow senators to more fully evaluate his fitness for a federal 

                judgeship. People For the American Way President Ralph G. Neas 

                called the vote a victory for the Constitution and the American 

                people, and a rebuff to the Bush administration's efforts to pack 

                the federal appeals courts with right-wing ideologues and frustrate 

                the Senate's advise and consent role. Neas said there would be 

                many more tests of senators' resolve in the coming weeks and months, 

                as long as the Bush administration refuses to engage in bipartisan 

                consultation and compromise on judicial nominations. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Neas' statement 

                follows: </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This vote was 

                tremendously important for the future of the federal judiciary 

                and for the rights and freedoms Americans count on the courts 

                to protect. It is a major loss for the Bush administration and 

                its political allies, who have tried to bully senators into submission 

                with outrageous threats and accusations. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We salute the 

                courageous leadership of Senators Tom Daschle, Harry Reid, Judiciary 

                Committee Ranking Member Pat Leahy, his committee colleagues Charles 

                Schumer, Ted Kennedy, and Richard Durbin, and all the other senators 

                who stood up to the intimidation tactics employed by the Bush 

                White House and Senate Republican leaders. Especially disturbing 

                were the repugnant efforts of a number of Republicans to characterize 

                opponents of Mr. Estrada's confirmation as anti-Hispanic. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We also applaud 

                the several hundred thousand Americans, including 40,000 supporters 

                of People For the American Way, who contacted senators and recorded 

                their opposition to Mr. Estrada's confirmation. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">People For 

                the American Way hopes that selected filibusters, public pressure, 

                and other measures will lead to true bipartisan consultation, 

                negotiation, and compromise on judicial nominations. Only a bipartisan 

                solution fully supported by President Bush can solve a problem 

                created by the unprecedented ideological blockade against Clinton 

                administration Circuit Court nominees by the Senate Republican 

                leadership from 1995 to 2000 (35 percent of those nominees were 

                blocked) and by President Bush's efforts to fill those judicial 

                vacancies with judges in the mold of Antonin Scalia and Clarence 

                Thomas. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The effort 

                by Republican leaders to invoke "cloture" failed to receive the 

                60 votes required to cut off debate and force a final vote on 

                the nomination. It came in the midst of an intense lobbying and 

                public relations campaign by the White House, Senate Republicans, 

                and their political allies, a campaign marked by accusations that 

                opposition to Estrada's confirmation was grounded in anti-Hispanic 

                bigotry. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Neas noted 

                that a significant majority of Hispanic legal, civil rights, and 

                worker rights organizations, as well as a huge and diverse coalition 

                of civil rights, women's rights, labor, environmental protection 

                and other groups, are opposed to Estrada's confirmation because 

                they are concerned that as a federal judge he would work to restrict 

                protection of individuals' rights. </font>
