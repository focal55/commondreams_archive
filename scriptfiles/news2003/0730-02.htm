<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- July 30 - NARAL Pro-Choice America, the leading national advocate of privacy and women&#146;s right to choose, today raised concerns about President Bush&#146;s nomination of California Supreme Court Justice Janice Rodgers Brown to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, because of her demonstrated hostility to the Constitutional right to privacy. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

Combined with other administration nominations and regulatory actions &#150; and with comments on the right to privacy by such Bush allies as Senator Rick Santorum &#150; this nomination raises the question of where the President stands on the Constitutional guarantee of a right to privacy.</font>

</p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Kate Michelman, President of NARAL Pro-Choice America, said &#147;Americans cherish the right to privacy, but the right wing continues to chip away at this basic freedom. It&#146;s time for the President to let us know where he stands.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Michelman added: &#147;I challenge President Bush to make this 16-word statement: &#145;I believe the Constitution of the United States guarantees every American the right to personal privacy.&#148;</font></p>

Since taking office, President Bush has nominated more than 40 people to federal appeals courts &#150; many of whom have appeared hostile to privacy rights. His latest nominee, California Supreme Court Justice Janice Rogers Brown demonstrated her opposition to a woman&#146;s right to privacy when she wrote a caustic dissent to a California Supreme Court&#146;s ruling that a California parental consent law with respect to abortion violated the state constitution&#146;s right to privacy. [American Academy of Pediatrics v. Lungren, 16 Cal.4th 307 (1997)]</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Background: President Bush&#146;s Record on Privacy</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

While campaigning in 2000, George W. Bush laid out a platform to protect an individual&#146;s right to privacy. At the time he said, &quot;I'm a privacy-rights person. The marketplace can function without sacrificing the privacy of individuals.&#148; [Business Week, 6/05/00] Yet a number of administration actions have raised questions about that commitment.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">President Bush has issued 22 &#147;Statements of Administration Policy&#148; urging Congress to insert government into private medical decisions and undermine family-planning services. Among the Administration&#146;s actions are repeated statements of support for the global gag rule. This gag rule cuts off U.S. funding to international family planning organizations that offer abortion counseling or services with their own privately-raised funds, lobby the host government for abortion law reform, or disseminate information about abortion. [The Washington Post, 1/23/01; Statement of Administration Policy, HR 2506, 10/31/01, 7/18/01 and HR 1646, 5/18/01]</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bush Issued Rule Changes to Medical Privacy Laws: Repealing Patient Consent Provisions and Allowing Business to Use Private Information without Consent. In August 2002, the Bush Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued the final rule changes to federal laws governing medical privacy. Under the Bush rules the provision requiring written consumer consent is eliminated; the new proposal mandates only that patients be notified of their privacy rights at some point. The Chicago Tribune reported, &#147;But in a reversal of regulations proposed by former President Bill Clinton, Bush would allow doctors and hospitals to share patients' medical information with insurance companies, health maintenance organizations and, in some circumstances, marketing companies, without patients' prior approval.&#148; [HHS Press Release, 8/9/02; 12/20/00; Washington Post, 8/10/02; HHS Fact Sheet, 8/9/02; Chicago Tribune, 8/10/02]</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Administration Allies Opposed to Personal Right to Privacy</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., the third highest ranking Republican in the US Senate and a close ally of President Bush, recently insisted the government has the authority and responsibility to prohibit activities that offend individual conceptions of morality, even if they occur in private. &#147;If you make the case that if you can do whatever you want to do, as long as it&#146;s in the privacy of your own home, this &#145;right to privacy,&#146; then why be surprised that people are doing things that are deviant within their own home?&#148; Santorum asked in an interview with The Associated Press. &#147;If you say, &#145;There is no deviant as long as it&#146;s private, as long as it&#146;s consensual,&#146; then don&#146;t be surprised what you get.&#148; [various, including AP, 4/21/03 and ABC News 4/29/03]</font></p>
