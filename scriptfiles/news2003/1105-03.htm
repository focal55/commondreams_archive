<td valign="top" align="left" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BRUSSELS - November 4 - Friends of the Earth today attacked the European Union's executive Commission after <a href="http://register.consilium.eu.int/pdf/en/03/st13/st13733.en03.pdf" target="_new">documents </a>seen by the environmental pressure group reveal that the Commission proposes to allow unprocessed genetically modified (GM) corn into European shops.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Allowing GM corn would break the current European 'de facto' moratorium on GM food despite the fact that a majority of European citizens do not want unlabelled and poorly tested GM food.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The European Commission is trying to get the GM corn (known as 'Bt11') approved quickly before new legislation comes into force in November. Legislation would subject the modified crop, made by Swiss-based biotech giant Syngenta, to more rigorous new tests.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The documents from the European Commission's Secretary-General  show that the Commission will ask European member states to approve the 'Bt11' corn in a vote (on November 10 or December 12) under the previous, weaker 'Novel Food' Regulations.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In May this year a US-led coalition launched an official complaint at the World Trade Organisation against Europe's moratorium on GM foods and crops.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Adrian Bebb of Friends of the Earth Europe said:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Commission's behaviour is disgraceful. The Commission is caving in to US pressure and trying to ram through GM foods using out-dated laws rather than protecting the interests of the public. If the Commission gets its way, there is a big chance that these foods would get to the market unlabelled. Europe's member states must stand up to the US pressure and make GM foods go through the more transparent and thorough approval process that will be applicable next year.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;If the Commission proceeds with this plan, it will make the European public even more suspicious against genetically modified food,&quot; Bebb added.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The new approval process and labelling regime for GM foods -which will be applicable in April 2004, is a substantial improvement on the present 'Novel Foods Regulations' it replaces as it:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Enforces strict traceability of the food and facilitates recalls should anything go wrong.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Installs mandatory labelling of all processed food and animal feed derived from GM organisms, whereas under the present, outdated Regulation, only fresh foods will have to be labelled.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Gives the new European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) a mandate to take into account not only short or middle term effects but also effects on future generations, probable cumulative toxic effects and the effects on health sensitive consumers.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Friends of the Earth previously called for the application for a marketing consent for Bt11 maize to be rejected for health and environmental reasons and the fact that Syngenta withheld crucial food safety data on the grounds of &quot;commercial confidentiality&quot;.</font></p>
