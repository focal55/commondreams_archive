                Hurley and Edwards (al-Dar Hotel), Liteky and Kelly (al-Fanar 

                    Hotel) are in Baghdad with 20 other members of the Iraq Peace 

                    Team. Phone lines are intermittent. Team members are assessing 

                    damage, visiting hospitals and placing articles and photos on 

                    the web. Several additional team members have recently crossed 

                    into Iraq from Jordan. Muller, in Chicago, is in regular touch 

                    with team members. </font>

                <a href="mailto:jgordon@fair1.fairfield.edu">jgordon@fair1.fairfield.edu</a>, <a href="http://www.harpers.org/online/cool_war" target="_new">www.harpers.org/online/cool_war</a>

                Gordon, a Fairfield University professor, wrote "Cool War: Economic 

                Sanctions as Weapons of Mass Destruction," which appeared in Harper's 

                magazine (Nov. 2002). She said today: "The head of USAID, Andrew 

                Natsios, claimed Tuesday that the Iraqi regime chose 'not to repair 

                the water system or replace old equipment with new equipment, 

                so in many cases people are basically drinking untreated sewer 

                water in their homes and have been for some years.' But it has 

                been the U.S. government that has prevented the procurement of 

                the material needed to fix the water system. As a veto-bearing 

                member of the Security Council's 661 Committee, whose approval 

                is required for infrastructure contracts for the oil-for-food 

                program, the U.S. government unilaterally blocked billions of 

                dollars of urgent humanitarian goods, including critical water 

                and sanitation supplies. This, despite the frequent pleas from 

                the Secretary General and continual requests from agencies such 

                as UNICEF. While child mortality rates skyrocketed from water-borne 

                diseases and other illnesses, the U.S. government unilaterally 

                blocked or delayed urgently needed humanitarian contracts, including 

                three sewage treatment plants, refrigerators for blood banks -- 

                even $210 million of child vaccines." </font>

                President of Conscience International, a humanitarian relief organization, 

                Jennings is currently in Amman, Jordan, working with the U.N. 

                and other relief organizations. He said today: "The U.S. government 

                has recently discovered the Geneva Conventions, along with Iraq's 

                desperate humanitarian need, after years of deliberate deafness 

                to urgent pleas. Now, ironically, these two agendas have suddenly 

                become a lately-invented casus belli for invasion. The international 

                humanitarian aid community is firmly against the idea of armies 

                posing as humanitarians, with bread in one hand and a gun in the 

                other. This discredits genuine humanitarian assistance and puts 

                the lives of aid workers in jeopardy." </font>

                War in Iraq," issued in February following a CESR research visit 

                to Iraq. The report warned of a humanitarian catastrophe in the 

                event of war and outlined likely failures of water and sewage 

                systems, as is now occurring in Basra. </font> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
