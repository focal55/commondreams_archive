- October 7 - Twelve nonprofit leaders will be inducted into a new 

Public Interest Hall of Fame, and three promising young activists will each 

receive a Public Interest Rising Star Award on Oct. 9 in Washington, D.C., 

when OMB Watch celebrates its 20th anniversary.</font>

</p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The ceremony will be conducted by John Podesta, president of the Center for 

American Progress and former White House chief of staff to President

honorees include grassroots organizers, academics, lawyers, service 

providers, and a former congressional staffer.  They represent national, 

state, and local organizations from across the country and are being 

recognized for their work in such fields as disability rights, economic 

justice, worker health and safety, government accountability, philanthropy, 

citizen participation, and environmental protection.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The twelve inductees into the Hall of Fame are  William F. Chamberlin, 

director of the Marion Brechner Citizen Access Project at the University of 

Florida College of Journalism and Communications (Gainesville, FL); Rick

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The three recipients of Public Interest Rising Star Awards are Christine

First/Institute for Food and Development Policy (Oakland, CA); Terry 

Pastika, executive director and community lawyer at Citizen Advocacy Center 

(Chicago, IL); and Kikanza Ramsey-Ray, senior community organizer and 

volunteer coordinator at the Labor/Community Strategy Center (Los Angeles, 

CA).  All three are in their early 30s.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;For the Public Interest Hall of Fame, we were looking for unsung heroes, 

for people who have shown a huge commitment to protecting and promoting the 

public interest but who have received very little attention for their 

efforts,&quot; said Gary D. Bass, OMB Watch's executive director.  &quot;For the 

Rising Star awards, we wanted to honor inspirational young people who have 

demonstrated significant impact in just the first few years of their 

careers.&quot;  The 15 honorees, selected from a field of nearly 70 nominees, 

were chosen for their unusual courage, creativity, commitment, or tenacity; 

significant success or series of successes; or especially effective 

leadership.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">OMB Watch, a Washington-based public interest organization, is launching 

both award programs as part of its 20th anniversary celebration.  &quot;Creating 

the Hall of Fame is our way of showing our appreciation to those who help 

make groups like OMB Watch effective,&quot; explains Bass.  Additional 

information about all 15 honorees is available at 

http//www.ombwatch.org/article/articleview/1833.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">OMB Watch was founded in 1983 to lift the veil of secrecy shrouding the 

White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB), which oversees 

regulation, the federal budget, information collection and dissemination, 

and much more.  Over the years, the focus has shifted from solely

monitoring OMB to a broader agenda of government accountability.  The group 

is guided by the belief that improving access to governmental 

decision-makers and encouraging citizen participation will lead to a more 

just and equitable society. OMB Watch now concentrates on four policy 

areas  budget and government performance; federal regulation; public access 

to government information; and policies affecting the nonprofit sector, 

particularly relating to free speech.  The group attributes much of its 

success during the past two decades to partnering with a wide range of 

national, state, and local organizations.</font></p>
