<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">SAN FRANCISCO - June 12 &#150; The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit will hear arguments next Tuesday, June 17th at 8:30 A.M. in the landmark human rights case, Doe et al. versus Unocal et al. The suit was brought on behalf of Burmese villagers by EarthRights International and the Center for Constitutional Rights, who accuse the California oil company of complicity in forced labor, murder and rape committed by the Burmese military on behalf of the company&#146;s gas pipeline project.</font>

<p> </p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This case will determine whether multinational corporations may be held accountable for their complicity in egregious human rights crimes or whether U.S. courts will give them immunity,&quot; said Paul Hoffman, Cooperating Attorney with the Center for Constitutional Rights and a partner in the Venice law firm of Schonbrun, De Simone, Seplow, Harris &amp; Hoffman, who will argue the appeal for the plaintiffs in Doe v Unocal. &quot;We are confident that the Court of Appeals will reaffirm the principle that U.S. courts remain open to the victims of torture, summary execution and forced labor.&quot;</font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The hearing by 11 judges of the Ninth Circuit revisits a September 2002 decision by a 3-judge panel of the Court to allow the case to go forward under the Alien Tort Claims Act (ATCA). The panel had determined that plaintiffs presented evidence that Unocal &#147;aided and abetted&#148; the Burmese military in committing atrocities against villagers living in the pipeline region.</font></p>

<p> </p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In May, The U.S. Department of Justice provoked outrage among human rights advocates by filing a &#147;friend of the court&#148; brief arguing that ATCA should not be applied to claims alleging violations of fundamental human rights, and that 23 years of jurisprudence applying the law to such claims had been wrongly decided. The Ninth Circuit denied the Government&#146;s request to make oral arguments in support of that view at Tuesday&#146;s hearing. </font></p>

<p> </p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The plaintiffs in this case have suffered horrific abuses at the hands of Unocal&#146;s partner for the benefit of its project,&#148; said Rick Herz of EarthRights International, co-counsel in the lawsuit. &#147;The fact that the Justice Department would seek to deny them their day in court is outrageous.&#148;</font></p>
