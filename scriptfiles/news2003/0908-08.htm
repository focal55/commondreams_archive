Potorti is the primary author of the new book <i>September

11th Families for Peaceful Tomorrows: Turning Our Grief into Action for Peace</i>.

His brother was killed in the World Trade Center. He said today: &quot;With the

worst kind of cynicism, George W. Bush continues the hallucinatory link of Iraq

to the deaths of our loved ones on Sept. 11.... Calling the invasion of Iraq

'one of the swiftest and most humane military campaigns in history' is not just

a lie, but a damned lie. Between 6,000 and 10,000 civilians have been killed --

two to three times the number who died on 9/11. To deny the reality of these

deaths is not only dishonest to the innocent people of Iraq, but to the

Americans in whose name we are waging the 'war on terror.'&quot; This week

about 25 members of the Peaceful Tomorrows organization, including Potorti, are

in New York City, where they will participate in a series of events.

Also a member of Peaceful Tomorrows, Lasar lost her brother

at the World Trade Center. She is available for a limited number of interviews.

She said today: &quot;Bush says he's doing this to avenge the victims of 9/11

and to make us safer. But with the course he is taking us on, children are not

yet born who will be fighting over this. This isn't about keeping us safe, but

because he wants to keep himself and his cronies rich.&quot;

Members of Military Families Speak Out, both Lessin and

Robison are in Washington, D.C., and will speak at a congressional briefing

Tuesday afternoon. With several other military families, they watched Bush's

speech last night together.

Hartung is director of the World Policy Institute's Arms

Trade Resource Center; Berrigan is senior researcher with the group. They said

today: &quot;Former White House economic advisor Lawrence Lindsay was ridiculed

for estimating a year ago that the invasion would end up costing $200 billion.

It now looks like it will exceed that. Contrary to the impression given by

Bush, the bulk of the $87 billion will go to military-related activities, much

of which will profit companies close to his administration.&quot;

Executive director of the Institute for Public Accuracy,

Solomon is co-author of <i>Target Iraq: What the News Media Didn't Tell You</i>.

He wrote in an essay published on Sunday by the San Francisco Chronicle:

&quot;In a cauldron of media alchemy, the human suffering of Sept. 11 became

propaganda gold. Sorrow turned into political capital.&quot;
