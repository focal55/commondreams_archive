- July 22 -  

At the Green Party's national meeting, state

delegates endorse resolutions calling for

impeachment and an end to the U.S. occupation of

Iraq.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

On the final day of the 2003

national meeting of the Green Party of the United

States, delegates from state Green Parties

represented in the national party's Coordinating

Committee approved two major proposals: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(1) The Green Party endorsed a call to Congress

to initiate impeachment proceedings and resolved

to take political leadership in the growing

movement for impeachment. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The resolution cites President George W. Bush's

and Vice President Dick Cheney's &quot;pattern of

making false statements to Congress, the American

people, and the world to win support for actions

by the American government and military forces&quot;

in violation of the U.S. Constitution, Charter of

the United Nations, and other international laws; &quot;[s]quandering the resources of the American people to serve the interests of transnational corporations&quot;; and war crimes, including the use of depleted uranium and cluster bombs in the preemptive invasion of Iraq.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to the resolution, &quot;Evidence has

emerged that the intelligence agencies of the

United States had repeatedly informed the

President that Iraq had no weapons of mass

destruction nor means to threaten the United

States, and that alleged evidence produced by the administration was fraudulent.&quot;  The resolution also authorizes the Green Party's Peace Action Committee (GPax) to coordinate party activities with other organizations that have called for impeachment.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The problem isn't 16 erroneous words in the

President's January 28 State of the Union

address, but dozens of false statements on dozens

of issues,&quot; said Elizabeth Shanklin, chair of the

Bronx County Green Party and a New York delegate

at the national meeting.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(2) Greens endorsed a &quot;Home by the Holidays&quot;

campaign calling for the U.S. to begin

withdrawing troops from Iraq, Afghanistan,

Colombia, and the Philippines, with this year's

winter holidays as a deadline for total return of

military personnel.  The resolution demands the

removal of U.S. troops from harm's way, citing

the rising number of combat deaths (over 340) and

injuries and numerous noncombat fatalities and

the damage to health and the environment from the

deployment of chemical, nuclear, and ecological

weapons.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to the resolution, the White House's

policy of invading other countries &quot;is hostile to

the democratic traditions of the American

Revolution, and must be actively resisted by all

patriotic Americans.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The texts of both resolutions will be posted at

the <a href="http://www.gp.org" target="_new">Green Party's web site</a> shortly.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The meeting took place from Friday, July 18

through Sunday, July 20 at the Mayflower Hotel in

Washington, D.C.  During the meeting, the Green

Party of Alabama was admitted to the national

party, bringing the number of accredited state parties to 43.</font></p>
