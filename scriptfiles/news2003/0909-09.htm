- September 9 - Green Party leaders in the

U.S. joined Green officials in Africa and other

global Green parties in protest against the

dumping of genetically modified food on African

nations.  Greens will speak out against this and

other globalization policies at the Fifth World

Trade Organization (WTO) Ministerial Conference

in Canc&uacute;n, Mexico, September 10-14, 2003.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Corporate interests, having failed to convince

other continents of the safety of genetically

modified food, have set their sights on Africa,&quot;

said Annie Goeke, co-chair of the International

Committee and a delegate to the WTO.  &quot;They're

using the antidemocratic WTO to override national

protections and the will of the people in African

countries.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greens accused U.S.-based corporations and

organizations such as the recently founded

African Agricultural Technology Foundation,

funded in part by USAID, Monsanto, and DuPont, of

working in tandem with U.S. officials, including

Secretary of Agriculture Ann Veneman, a former

Monsanto subsidiary boardmember, to promote

distribution of modified organisms to Africa.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Food shortages in Africa are the result of

drought, poverty, lack of transport and storage,

and political instability,&quot; said Diane White,

Green candidate for City Treasurer of Harrisburg,

Pennsylvania and an activist in the Black Caucus

of the Green Party of the United States. &quot;GE

[genetically engineered] seeds will create more

problems for African farmers.  GE seeds are

expensive, require good growing conditions, often

don't increase yields, are less effective on

small labor-intensive farms, and reduce seed

diversity.  If a GE seed has been engineered to

work with a particular herbicide or pesticide,

use of a different one may destroy an entire

crop, endangering a whole community.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greens note that USAID has attempted to donate GE

maize to African countries facing starvation as a

strategy to introduce unwanted GE foods in

Africa.  Malawi, Zambia, and Zimbabwe have

objected and Zambia has refused GE maize out of

fear of health risks and agricultural

contamination.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;World hunger is best addressed by food supply

independence,&quot; said Michele Tingling-Clemmons,

co-chair of the Black Caucus and a member of the

D.C. Statehood Green Party.  &quot;We support

self-determination for Africans to choose the

future course of agriculture in the ways they

know best to increase food production for their

communities.  Since GE foods have not been

properly tested, allergic reactions will be an

additional health issue for people with already

low immune systems.  Local farming techniques

should be supported, not replaced.&quot; </font></p>
