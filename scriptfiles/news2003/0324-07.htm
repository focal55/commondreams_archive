                - March 24 - In an ad published in today's Roll Call by the Brady 

                Campaign United With the Million Mom March, a former New Jersey 

                police officer blasts NRA-supported bills introduced in the Senate 

                and House of Representatives that would provide unprecedented 

                immunity from lawsuits to the gun industry. The bills would override 

                last week's ruling by a West Virginia court allowing former Orange 

                County Detective Kenneth McGuire to proceed with his lawsuit against 

                a West Virginia gun dealer. In the ad, Detective McGuire implores 

                Congress: &quot;A reckless gun dealer almost cost me my life. 

                Don't let the gun lobby and Congress put him above the law.&quot; 

                </font> 

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The ad recounts 

                  the role of the dealer, Will's Jewelry and Loan of South Charleston, 

                  West Virginia, in supplying the 9-mm Ruger semiautomatic pistol 

                  used by a career criminal to wound Officer McGuire and his partner, 

                  Detective David Lemongello, in a shoot-out in January, 2001. 

                  Six months before the shooting, the pistol was one of 12 handguns 

                  sold by Will's to a &quot;straw purchaser&quot; for a gun trafficker 

                  in a single transaction. In three separate visits to Will's, 

                  the straw purchaser and trafficker bought 22 guns in one month. 

                  The lawsuit charges the dealer with negligence and contributing 

                  to a public nuisance by engaging in large-volume sales to a 

                  purchaser who clearly intended to supply the illegal market. 

                  </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The proposed 

                  legislation, introduced as S. 659 by NRA Board Member Senator 

                  Larry Craig (R-Id.) in the Senate and H.R. 1036, introduced 

                  by Rep. Cliff Stearns (R-Fla) in the House, would give unprecedented 

                  special immunity from lawsuits to gun sellers. In introducing 

                  the bill last week, Senator Craig stated that the lawsuits affected 

                  by the bill &quot;are not brought by individuals seeking relief 

                  for injuries done to them by anyone in the industry.&quot; As 

                  Officer McGuire's suit shows, Senator Craig's statement is flatly 

                  untrue. </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Michael 

                  Barnes, president of the Brady Campaign United With the Million 

                  Mom March said, &quot;Any Senator or Representative who supports 

                  legal immunity for the gun industry should explain to Officer 

                  McGuire, his partner Detective Lemongello and gun violence victims 

                  like them, why their rights are being taken away.&quot; </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The proposed 

                  legislation also would threaten the lawsuit recently filed by 

                  victims of the D.C.-area sniper shootings against the Tacoma, 

                  Washington gun shop from which the Bushmaster assault rifle 

                  used by the suspected snipers mysteriously disappeared. The 

                  assault rifle was reported stolen by Bull's Eye Shooter Supply 

                  only after law enforcement authorities confiscated it after 

                  arresting the suspected snipers. According to a federal search 

                  warrant, over 230 other guns are recorded &quot;missing&quot; 

                  from Bull's Eye in the last three years. </font></p>
