                YORK - March 18 - War against Iraq is "unequivocally illegal under 

                the UN Charter and international law generally", according to 

                a new report. The report rejects efforts by the U.S., U.K, and 

                Australia to circumvent the U.N. Security Council and claim legal 

                justification from past resolutions. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Attempting 

                to legitimize a war opposed by world public opinion, the U.S. 

                Secretary of State, the U.K. Attorney-General, and the Australian 

                Prime Minister have in the past 24 hours each issued major statements 

                insisting that international law justifies their decision to attack 

                Iraq. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report, 

                issued by the New York-based Center for Economic and Social Right, 

                cites a range of authoritative legal sources to dismiss their 

                arguments. According to Professor Thomas Franck, a leading authority 

                on the use of force, the use of old resolutions to support military 

                action today "makes a complete mockery of the entire system" of 

                international law. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"It is the 

                height of hypocrisy for the U.S. and U.K. to base war on Resolution 

                1441 when they are fully aware that France, Russia and China approved 

                that resolution on explicit written condition that it could not 

                be used by individual states to justify military action," said 

                CESR Executive Director Roger Normand, who recently returned from 

                a fact-finding mission to Iraq. "This war violates every legal 

                principle governing the resort to force. It clearly has little 

                to do with disarmament, democracy, human rights, or even Saddam 

                Hussein, and everything to do with oil and power." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report 

                warns that an illegal war in Iraq would threaten the pillars of 

                collective security established after World War II to protect 

                civilians from a recurrence of that unprecedented carnage. "This 

                is an attack on the very institutions of international law and 

                the United Nations," said Philip Alston, Professor of Law and 

                Director of Human Rights and Global Justice and New York University. 

                "It opens the door for every country to take the law into its 

                own hands and launch preemptive military strikes without any universally 

                binding restraints." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1946, the 

                Nuremberg Tribunal rejected German arguments of the necessity 

                for preemptive attacks against its neighbors and instead outlawed 

                preventive war as a crime against the peace. In the Tribunal's 

                judgment, "To initiate a war of aggression, therefore, is not 

                only an international crime; it is the supreme international crime 

                differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within 

                itself the accumulated evil of the whole." </font>
