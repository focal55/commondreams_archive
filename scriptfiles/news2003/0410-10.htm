                GA - April 10 - Following is a statement by NOW President Kim 

                Gandy at the Martin Luther King, Jr., Center in Atlanta, Georgia: 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The controversy 

                surrounding the Augusta National Golf Club and its Masters Tournament 

                is not about golf any more than the debates over Title IX are 

                about college wrestling. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The question 

                here at Augusta is whether sex segregation is acceptable. Hootie 

                Johnson, chairman of Augusta National, tries to hide behind the 

                private-club excuse -- but during the Masters, this club becomes 

                the public face of golf. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"I have a word 

                for the members of Augusta National: You could have taken a bold 

                stand on behalf of women, and against discrimination -- instead 

                you helped Hootie hang the sign on the treehouse: 'No Girls Allowed.' 

                But you're not little boys, and Augusta National isn't a treehouse. 

                The membership roster of Augusta National reads like a who's who 

                of the corporate world. I say to those business and academic leaders, 

                politicians, captains of industry -- what message does it send 

                to your female employees, customers, students, constituents ... 

                when you say publicly that you support equal opportunity but your 

                private actions support discrimination? </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Ask yourself 

                whether it is acceptable in this country for leaders of corporations 

                and universities, even members of Congress, to be a member of 

                a club that discriminates against women ... for a television network 

                that has a license from Congress for free use of our public airwaves 

                as a public trust, to air coverage from such a place... for the 

                PGA to look the other way, with the excuse that the Masters isn't 

                an 'official' part of the tour. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Finally, some 

                food for thought (and this one IS about golf): In a survey last 

                year of corporate executives who play golf, 43 percent of men 

                but 63 percent of women said their 'biggest business or sales 

                deal was made while playing golf.' And a similarly wider margin 

                of women than men believe that 'the way a person plays golf is 

                very similar to how he/she conducts their business affairs.' What 

                does this say about the corporate leaders who are happy to discriminate 

                against women on the links?"
