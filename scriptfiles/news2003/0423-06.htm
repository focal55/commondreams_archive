- 

April 23 - EPA's flurry of cheery 

pre-Earth Day announcements caused us to stop and think. The truth 

is, we have been puzzling for some time about the remarks of EPA 

Assistant Administrator Jeffrey Holmstead, who has argued 

repeatedly that the Clean Air Act's new source review program does 

not reduce emissions (1). We find his diehard views a curious 

contrast to various EPA press releases (including one this week 

involving Virginia Electric Power) touting pollution reductions 

from enforcement of new source review. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So we decided to list and add up the results of all the press 

releases in one place, so the casual reader can decide who's right 

-- Jeffrey Holmstead, or his EPA press office. (Hint: EPA's own 

press releases list 1.3 million tons of annual emissions reduced by 

new source review settlements in the past three years. All to be 

done within a decade. The final resolution of one announced 

settlement is still pending. To put this in context, that's 

actually more cleanup -- and a lot sooner -- than EPA says would be 

accomplished by its very positive and much-touted proposal to clean 

up diesel heavy equipment and fuel -- 950,000 tons by 2030. 

Jeffrey, are you paying attention? It seems like we're doing pretty 

well by enforcing the law you want to change.)

tons 



</font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">---------</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(1) Take, for example, this passage from BNA's Daily Environment 

Report, dated September 7, 2001: "...In contrast, the new source 

review program does not achieve emissions reductions at existing 

sources, Holmstead said...`For the vast majority of these sources 

that have essentially continued to operate in the same way, it 

doesn't get any emissions reductions from those facilities,' 

Holmstead said. `They can continue to operate as long as they want 

to.'" Of course, the totals listed in this release are only those 

resulting from legal settlements. Pollution reductions from those 

following the law would be additional. 

</font></p>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(2) This is a company projection, as reported by Cox News 

Service. It is consistent with EPA's press release. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(3) Initially announced November 16, 2000 by the Clinton 

Administration. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(4) Announced by the Clinton Administration. Not yet finalized 

by the Bush Administration. Which raises the question: what the 

heck has happened to this agreement? Are we going to have to wait 

until the next Earth Day for a pr splash on this one? 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(5) EPA's report, "EPA Achieves Significant Compliance and 

Enforcement Progress in 2001" released in January 2002 notes the BP 

and Motiva settlements contributed "to the significant required air 

pollutant reductions" under the Clean Air Act and that "These 

reductions are consistent with the Agency's goal of reducing 

emissions." Jeffrey, please take note! </font>
