in Ecuador last week.</FONT><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Friends

demonstration was organised by Friends of the Earth Austria (GLOBAL 2000) on behalf 
of Friends of the Earth International (FoEI), the world's largest grassroots environmental 
federation. Some of the 68 FoEI national groups around the globe announced they 
also intend to organise protests outside Ecuadorian embassies in their countries.</FONT></P><P>

of the Austrian transnational corporation OMV to get involved in Ecudorian oil

Shingre, 47 years old, was outstanding in his dedication to helping small farmers

environmental rights and defend affected communities in the face of abuses by 
oil companies and a culture of impunity in the region. </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">At

plaintiffs in the name of 30.000 rainforest inhabitants against Chevron Texaco 
for damages the transnational corporation allegedly caused in the Amazon Rainforest 
since the 1970s. The lawsuit takes place in Lago Agrio, 170 km north east of Quito.</FONT></P><P></P><P>
