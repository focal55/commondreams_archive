Chadian civil society groups who have called for a national day of 

mourning on October 10, the date of the official inauguration of the 

publicly financed Chad Cameroon Oil Pipeline. The call, which is 

supported byHuman Rights and women&#146;s organisations, unions and 

NGOs,warns that Chadian oil revenues &#147;will only be another 

weapon in the hands of a plundering oligarchy used to oppress the 

Chadian people.&#148; The groups denounce the insecurity and impunity 

which prevail in the country and which &#147;will only increase with the 

exploitation of oil&#148;. On September 12, the government prohibited a 

peaceful march organised by human rights groups. </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

The 3.7 billion dollar Chad Cameroon oil project, which is 

managed by a consortium of Exxon, Chevron and Petronas, 

represents the biggest private investment in Africa today. In June 

2000, the World Bank decided to co-finance the project against the 

wishes of Chadian, Cameroonian and international organisations. A 

month later, the European Investment Bank (EIB) followed with an 

additional loan of 144 million Euro. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

A mechanism has been put in place that is supposed to ensure the 

transparent management of oil revenues, but continued corruption 

and lack of capacity in the Chadian government has cast doubt on 

its effectiveness. &#147;The World Bank&#146;s assessment of the situation in Chad is based on 

unrealistic assumptions&#148;, says Susanne Breitkopf, Africa 

Campaigner at Friends of the Earth France, &#147;While World Bank 

officials organise satellite conferences for the international press, 

Chadian citizens are literally left in the dark, without means to 

communicate their grievances.&#148; The Chadian government, 

notorious for its corruption and human rights abuses, used the first 

$4.5 million of the signing bonus that it received from the oil 

companies to purchase arms. &#147;It is cynical for the World Bank to 

claim that the situation has changed. In its own internal project 

report to the executive directors of August 2003, the Bank found 

new financial &#145;misreportings&#145; by the Chadian authorities,&#148; says 

Breitkopf.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

Magda Stoczkiewicz, leading the EIB campaign for Friends of the 

Earth International and CEE Bankwatch Network adds: &#147;The EIB 

loan was given despite negative advice from the European 

Parliament, putting EU money into a highly controversial project. 

The Chad-Cameroon pipeline example puts into question the 

usefulness of channelling EU aid to Africa via the EIB.&#148; 

According to a network of Chadian NGOs active on issues related 

to the oil sector, the Commission Permanente P&eacute;trole de 

N&#146;djam&eacute;na (CPP), the project has already caused considerable harm 

in the oil producing area and the measures promised by the World 

Bank to protect the environment and the population have not been 

implemented to their satisfaction. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In a press conference in 

N&#146;djam&eacute;na, CPPN representatives criticized, among other things, 

the increased food insecurity and social tensions in the oil- producing region, due to the massive migration induced by the 

project. During the construction of the pipeline, prostitution 

developed on a large scale, increasing the spread of AIDS.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#147;In Cameroon, the construction of the pipeline has not brought 

benefits to the population. Instead, it has caused destruction of the 

environment and of important resources such as fisheries.&quot; says 

Samuel Nguiffo, director of the Center for Environment and 

Development in Cameroon, and adds: &quot;October 10 will be a public 

celebration of the broken promises of the pipeline construction in 

Chad and Cameroon, and of human and worker&#146;s rights abuses. The 

World Bank should not be proud. We are joining our neighbours in 

Chad in the day of mourning, because we ourselves have no reason 

to celebrate this day.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

Meanwhile, the oil companies are exploring other oil-rich areas in 

Chadand Cameroonand any additional oil will use the existing 

pipeline. New exploration is occurring without informing the 

Chadian public, thereby ignoring the World Bank and EIB loan 

agreements. As a condition of its financial support, the World 

Bank required that any oil to be transported through the pipeline be 

developed in compliance with the standards set for the Doba 

project.

International organisations have expressed their support for 

Chadian groups, who have declared, &quot;The ceremony of October 10 

has for us no meaning, it is a non-event.&quot; According to Korinna 

Horta,a scientist with Environmental Defense in Washington:&quot;A 

regional development plan was promised to mitigate the negative 

impacts of the project and ensure development benefits for the 

people most directly affected, yet to date no such plan has been 

made public or thethe regional structures put in place to administer 

the promised oil funds&quot;.
