- June 24 -  A poll by Zogby International released today found that 41% of Americans agree that &#147;the government should treat marijuana more or less the same way it treats alcohol: it should regulate it, control it, tax it and only make it illegal for children.&#148; This represents a striking increase from previous nationwide polls on making marijuana legal.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Over 40% of Americans basically think that marijuana prohibition makes no more sense than alcohol Prohibition, and should be repealed,&#148; said Ethan Nadelmann, executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nearly two years ago USA Today ran a front page story with the findings of a USA Today/CNN/Gallup poll which found that support for legalizing marijuana was at its highest in 30 years, with 34% in favor, up from 15% in 1972.  The jump over two years to 41% is similar to other rapid shifts in public opinion around marijuana decriminalization in Canada, Britain and elsewhere.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The poll released today interviewed 1,204 adults chosen at random nationwide.  They were asked to agree or disagree with the following statement: &#147;Some people say the government should treat marijuana more or less the same way it treats alcohol: it should regulate marijuana, control it, tax it, and only make it illegal for children.&#148;  The margin of error is +/- 2.9%.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;No other criminal law on the books in this country is enforced so vigorously, yet backed by such a small majority of Americans,&quot; said Nadelmann.  &quot;When two of every five citizens say it's time to make marijuana legal, the government's response should be to reduce penalties and re-evaluate the law, yet the federal government is doing just the opposite:  blocking the availability of marijuana for medical purposes, prohibiting the production of hemp for industrial purposes, and spending billions of dollars per year on the war on marijuana.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;U.S. marijuana policy is increasingly out of step with our closest allies and neighbors,&quot; said Nadelmann, pointing to the decriminalization of marijuana in Canada, Switzerland, Britain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, Italy and elsewhere.</font></p>
