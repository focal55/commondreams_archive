                YORK - April 9 - Following yesterday's indictment of Indonesian 

                military and police officials, the East Timor Action Network/U.S. 

                (ETAN) today urged the United States and United Nations to fully 

                support the prosecution of Indonesian officials accused of committing 

                crimes against humanity in East Timor by the joint UN/East Timor 

                Serious Crimes Unit. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We urge the 

                U.S. and the UN to actively pursue the extradition and prosecution 

                of all those indicted by the Serious Crimes Unit (SCU) currently 

                residing in Indonesia. The Bush administration must use all diplomatic 

                resources at its disposal to ensure Indonesian authorities honor 

                the indictments issued and comply with extradition requests," 

                said John M. Miller, spokesperson for ETAN. "There must be concrete 

                repercussions for Indonesia's complete failure to cooperate with 

                the SCU." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The serious 

                nature of the crimes committed, the inability of the new nation 

                of East Timor to seek justice on its own, and the extreme violence 

                aimed at a UN Security Council-mandated mission all necessitate 

                international involvement," added Miller. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Indonesia has 

                publicly refused to extradite anyone to East Timor for trial. 

                Of the 227 suspects previously indicted by the SCU, nearly two-thirds 

                reside in Indonesia. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In an effort 

                to avoid an international court process, Indonesia established 

                its own ad hoc court on East Timor, considered a sham by nearly 

                all observers. The Indonesian court is expected to announce its 

                last verdicts this month. So far, the court has acquitted 11 of 

                14 Indonesian defendants before it. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The SCU indictment 

                accuses 16 persons, including nine Indonesian military (TNI) officers 

                and the former Indonesian District Chief of Police, of crimes 

                against humanity committed against the civilian population of 

                Covalima district in 1999. Among incidents involved is the notorious 

                September 1999 massacre at the Suai church, where scores of women, 

                men, and children were killed, including three priests. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"East Timorese 

                officials have expressed concern about the impact of the SCU indictments 

                on relations with Indonesia, but East Timor's civil society has 

                repeatedly called the pursuit of justice fundamental for stability 

                and stated that the East Timorese people are crying out for justice," 

                said Miller. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">East Timor's 

                National Alliance for an International Tribunal, praising February's 

                indictment of the former head of the Indonesian military General 

                Wiranto and other high-ranking officials, wrote to UN High Commissioner 

                for Human Rights Sergio de Mello, "East Timorese victims have 

                complained that [earlier SCU] indictments only charged lower-ranking 

                Indonesian military and police personnel as well as militia members, 

                but failed to address the primary perpetrators. The people of 

                East Timor, who since 1975 have lived under Indonesian military 

                occupation. are well aware that the violence in 1999 was part 

                of an ongoing systematic and planned use of violence against our 

                people." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The U.S. and 

                UN must ensure that the SCU and its courts have sufficient resources 

                to finish investigations and conduct effective trials," added 

                Miller. "The current May 2004 deadline for the SCU must be extended 

                by the Security Council. Otherwise, justice will become just one 

                more broken international promise to the people of East Timor."

                includes the September 6 massacre of refugees who sought refuge 

                inside the Suai Church compound. Last August, the ad hoc court 

                in Jakarta found five of those named in the SCU indictment not 

                guilty of the church massacre. </font>

                1272 (25 October 1999) to set up a system to administer justice 

                in East Timor. The SCU has focused on investigating serious crimes 

                that took place during 1999 and prosecuting those responsible. 

                The UN also created a hybrid international-East Timorese Special 

                Panel of the Dili District Court to hear serious crimes cases.

                to investigate and prosecute serious crimes committed through 

                1999 in the post-independence UN support mission UNMISET through

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Indonesia's 

                ad hoc Human Rights Court on East Timor has acquitted 11 of 14 

                Indonesian defendants tried thus far, in addition to two convictions 

                for the only East Timorese on trial. The five sentences handed 

                down were not commensurate with the crimes committed; four defendants 

                received less than the legal minimum under Indonesian law. All 

                remain free pending appeal. Few of the top architects of the terror 

                in East Timor were even named as suspects, much less brought to 

                trial. Other serious shortcomings of the Indonesian court include 

                an extremely unprofessional courtroom environment packed with 

                high-ranking military and militia; inadequate witness protection; 

                and a prosecution that has presented weak and inaccurate indictments 

                and arguments, painted a false picture of the conflict in 1999, 

                and failed to present the overwhelming amount of evidence available.
