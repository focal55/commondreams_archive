                - April 2 - Several grassroots Jewish peace organizations today 

                urged Members of Congress to support the Rachel Corrie Resolution 

                (H.Con.Res. 111). Rachel Corrie was a 23 year-old American peace 

                activist who was killed by an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) bulldozer 

                while attempting to protect a Palestinian home from demolition 

                through an act of nonviolent civil disobedience in the Gaza Strip 

                on March 16. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Rachel 

                Corrie Resolution was introduced in the House of Representatives 

                on March 25 by Brian Baird (WA-3) and currently has 10 cosponsors. 

                The resolution expresses sympathy to the Corrie family for their 

                loss, calls for a U.S. investigation into her death, and urges 

                the United States and Israel to work together to ensure that this 

                never happens again. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Charles Lenchner, 

                President of Jews for Peace in Palestine and Israel, stated that 

                "according to an Israeli peace group, the Israeli military judge 

                advocate general has concluded that no charges will be brought 

                against the bulldozer driver. Therefore it is even more imperative 

                that the United States conducts a full investigation into Rachel's 

                death." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to 

                Rachael Kamel, an activist with Jewish Mobilization for a Just 

                Peace, "Rachel Corrie represented the finest tradition of nonviolent 

                peacemaking. At this time, the international nonviolent peace 

                forces provide the only protection available to the Palestinian 

                civilian population. An investigation is needed not only to clarify 

                the circumstances of her death but also to help Congress and the 

                American public understand more fully the violence carried out 

                every day in the Occupied Territories in our name and with our 

                tax dollars." </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mitchell Plitnick, 

                Co-Director of A Jewish Voice for Peace adds, "Rachel Corrie was 

                an American civilian killed during a foreign military operation. 

                Eyewitnesses have expressed doubt that the incident was accidental. 

                Under such circumstances, the need for an impartial investigation 

                to establish the truth of the matter is undeniable." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The IDF is 

                treating this death as an accident, in spite of eyewitness reports 

                and photographs that directly contradict the military account. 

                Given the historic brutality of the IDF's actions in the Occupied 

                Territories, a more objective investigation must be carried out 

                if justice is to be served. " said Sam Miller/Eisenstein, a member 

                of Jews Against the Occupation. </font>

                of Visions of Peace with Justice in Israel/Palestine and Jewish 

                Women for Justice in Israel/Palestine, concluded, "Rachel Corrie 

                was a hero to many of us, as well as to the Israeli peace and 

                justice activists with whom we work and to the Palestinians for 

                whom she risked and lost her life. Our hearts go out to her family, 

                her friends, and her colleagues in the International Solidarity 

                Movement; and we join the call for an impartial U.S. investigation 

                of the circumstances of her brutal death." </font>
