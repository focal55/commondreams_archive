- October 2 - Global citizens are contacting their political representatives and demanding that the Israeli government immediately rescind the demolition order against a Palestinian home that has been demolished four previous times.  Four hundred United Methodist Churches of Minnesota provided a &quot;love offering&quot; to finance the home's construction, bringing Israelis, Palestinians, and internationals together last August to build.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On Monday, the &quot;Civil&quot; Administration, Israel's military government in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, issued Mr. Salim Shawamreh a summons to appear before a military court. His &quot;crime&quot;: rebuilding a home for his family on his own privately-owned land. On Tuesday, the Civil Administration issued a house demolition order to be executed within 48 hours. Citizens gathered at the home to prevent demolition.  This afternoon, an Israeli Court stayed demolition for 2 weeks time - standard procedure to give the Civil Administration time to show why the house must be demolished.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Since first demolished by the Israeli authorities five years ago, the Shawamreh house has become a symbol of resistance, not only against the Occupation, but against Israel's sustained campaign to displace Palestinians altogether,&quot; said Jeff Halper, Coordinator for the Israeli Committee Against House Demolitions. &quot;It is only one of over 10,000 houses demolished in the Occupied Territories since 1967 -- the house of a family of refugees who cannot return home. Yet they are not allowed to build a new home in their place of refuge: on their own land.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Unable to continue living in the densely-packed Shuafat refugee camp in Jerusalem, the Shawamreh's bought a plot of land in the nearby village of Anata. Four times they applied for, but were denied, a building permit, with total application costs of $20,000: their barren stony plot was zoned &quot;agricultural&quot;; &quot;the slope was too steep&quot;; unnamed signatures were missing on the deed; the plot was too close to a planned Israeli highway. Finally, the Civil Administration &quot;lost&quot; their file. But the underlying reason for not granting them a permit and demolishing their home is to confine them, and other Palestinians, to the 42% of the West Bank Sharon has in mind as the Palestinian &quot;state.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;I faxed Senator Norm Coleman of the Foreign Relations Committee to request his urgent action:   that he call the Israeli Foreign Minister to demand they let our house stand,&quot; said Reverend Ric Koehn, of the Palestine-Israel Justice Project of the Minnesota Methodist Church. &quot;It is time our political leaders find their voice and stand up for those Israelis and Palestinians who build together and refuse to be enemies.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Israeli Committee Against House Demolitions, www.ICAHD.org, is a non-violent,

direct-action group established to resist Israeli demolition of Palestinian houses. Fundraising to rebuild the Shawamreh home was organized by the Global Campaign to Rebuild Palestinian Homes, www.RebuildingHomes.org. The Palestine-Israel Justice Project of the Minnesota Annual Conference of the United Methodist Church, www.mumac.org/pijp educates and encourages parishioners to take action for social justice.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jeff Halper and Rev. Ric Koehn are available for interviews.   Salim and Arabia Shawamreh arrive in Detroit on Oct. 3rd for a midwest speaking tour.</font></p>
