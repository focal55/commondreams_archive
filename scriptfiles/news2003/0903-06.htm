<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- September 2 -  A ruling issued today by the Ninth Circuit Court

of Appeals could result in nearly 150 death sentences being

invalidated, the latest result of the U.S. Supreme Court's 2002

determination that juries, not judges, must decide between a

sentence of death or life in prison.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

The Court's 8-3 vote is believed to mean that anyone sentenced to

death in Arizona, Idaho and Montana under those states' old death

sentencing statutes faces commutation to life. The same reasoning

that led to the ruling eventually could apply to Colorado and

Nebraska, two states that are not within the Ninth Circuit's

jurisdiction, and perhaps could one day be extended to other

states such as Alabama, Delaware and Florida, where in the past

judges have overruled jurors' recommendation for life in prison and 

instead sentenced defendants to death.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Today's ruling is landmark,&quot; said Brian Roberts, interim executive

director of the National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty.&quot;The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has upheld the bedrock principle

that juries and only juries may decide an issue as important as

life or death. We are cautiously optimistic that either the U.S.

Supreme Court will decline to accept an appeal of this decision

or, if it does, that it will affirm the simple constitutional logic

underlying it.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

 

At issue prior to the Ninth Circuit's ruling was whether the

Supreme Court's 2002 Ring decision applied to all death row inmates

in Arizona and other states with similar death-sentencing statutes,

or whether it applied only to a small number of people who were early

in their appeals process.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

 

Writing for the majority, Circuit Judge Sidney R. Thomas wrote,&quot;By deciding that judges are not constitutionally permitted

to decide whether defendants are eligible for the death penalty,

the Supreme Court altered the fundamental bedrock principles

applicable to capital murder trials.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

 

Of the three states believed to be directly impacted by today's

decision, Arizona has the largest death row population, at 126.

Idaho has 17 people on death row and Montana has five.
