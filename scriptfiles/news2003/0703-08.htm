- July 3 - The increase in unemployment to 6.4 percent in June, the highest level in more than nine years, officially confirms the pain America&#146;s working families are feeling in an economy that has been steadily closing its doors on workers for more than two years. For any national leader who cares about the working men and women who are the heart and soul of this country, it should be intolerable that tomorrow, as we celebrate America&#146;s promise as the land of opportunity, 11 million Americans are out of work, with diminishing prospects and fading hopes. There are so few job opportunities for the millions of people looking for work that it has taken two million laid-off workers at least six months to find a job.  </font>

<p> </p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">America has yet to see the economy that President George Bush promised when he signed his first $1.6 trillion tax cut two years ago. In fact, the economy has worsened. In June, we lost another 56,000 manufacturing jobs, marking the 35th straight month of losses. Since manufacturing employment last peaked in July 2000, 2.6 million industrial jobs have been eliminated, nearly all of those&#151;2.4 million&#151;since President Bush took office. During the Bush term, the economy has shrunk by 3.1 million private sector jobs. A hundred thousand people lost jobs just in the last 60 days. </font></p>

<p> </p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Bush Administration&#146;s economic policies of putting tax cuts that benefit the wealthy ahead of investing in priorities that benefit the country has led to no growth in new jobs and too much growth in debt. Restoring job growth to this nation will take a serious effort to put our nation&#146;s resources to work for working families, not only for the wealthiest and the biggest corporations.</font></p>
