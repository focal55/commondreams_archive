- May 21 - Under the circumstances, Christie Whitman did the best she could at the EPA, but the Bush Administration simply wouldn't allow her to do the job. It's unfortunate that after the Bush Administration picked someone with environmental credentials to head the EPA, she wasn't given the power to do the job of cracking down on polluters and protecting our families and communities.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While Whitman came into office having demonstrated a concern for the environment, the Bush Administration's actions on the environment  did nothing to build on that record.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From resisting efforts to get arsenic out of our drinking water, to weakening the clean air act and the enforcement of environmental safeguards, the Bush Administration has demonstrated a pattern of siding with corporate polluters over the health and safety of America's families.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Just weeks after taking office, Whitman tried to act on President Bush's campaign pledge to curb the carbon dioxide causing global warming, but the Administration quickly cut her off.  Then, in June, both President Bush and Administrator Whitman disavowed a government report acknowledging humans' role in causing global warming.  An administration that ignores their own scientists' report on global warming makes us fear for the future.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In New Jersey, Gov. Whitman worked for clean air, supporting strong New Source Review protections to cut power plant pollution.  Yet last year the Bush Administration weakened the Clean Air Act by gutting the New Source Review protections that require dirty power plants to install pollution controls when they increase their emissions.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The EPA did make one move in the right direction under Whitman, announcing a proposal last month to require cleaner fuel and engines for "non-road" diesel machinery, such as tractors, bulldozers, and other heavy equipment. But it is just a proposal.  The EPA will take public comment on the proposal, and must fend off any attempts to weaken this rule.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Given the Administration's track record on the environment, we have little hope that President Bush's next EPA Administrator will be allowed do a better job of cutting pollution and keeping families safe.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some lowpoints of the Bush Administration's EPA environmental record:



</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*    Recommended cutting EPA enforcement budget by 13 percent, gutting

the

government's   ability to hold polluters accountable for breaking the

law.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*    Breaking the campaign promise to curb carbon dioxide, which causes

global warming.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*    Weakening the Clean Air Act to allow more power-plant pollution.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*     Opposing efforts to make polluters pay for cleanup of their toxic

waste sites.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*    Initially opposing efforts to reduce the amount of arsenic in our

drinking water      before public outcry forced a reversal.
