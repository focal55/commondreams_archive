- October 1 - In its New York Times op-ed page advertisement today, TomPaine.com quotes from &quot;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1400050669/commondreams-20" target="_new">The Lies of George W. Bush</a>&quot; (Crown Publishers) by David Corn, Washington editor of The Nation Magazine and columnist for TomPaine.com.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;He lied when he said the estate tax forced families to sell their farms. When he said he only got to know Kenneth Lay after becoming governor. When he said that budget deficits were the result of 9/11. When he said he would produce a plan to &quot;reduce&quot; global warming emissions. These were all lies. Yet most media outfits did not see it as their mission to stamp &quot;lie&quot; on a demonstrably untrue Bush remark or to question Bush's truthfulness.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Corn writes, and the ad quotes:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It's not that the traditional media has failed to create a record of Bush's lies or covered up for him. Bush lies could readily be found in The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, The Los Angeles Times and other influential media enterprises.... But, more often than not, the contradiction is not the story, not the subject of the headline; it is merely found in a reference several paragraphs into a piece.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Rarely was the gap between Bush and reality emphasized. Consequently, Bush's untruthful ways have not -- as of this writing -- become a defining a theme of his presidency.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;His lies have been hidden in plain sight.&quot;</font></p>
