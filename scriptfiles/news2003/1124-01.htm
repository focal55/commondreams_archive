<td valign="top" align="left" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">PHILADELPHIA, PA - November 24 - The American Friends Service Committee is saddened by the recent suicide bombings in Istanbul &#151; which targeted two synagogues, the British Consulate, and a British Bank &#151; and affirms our care for all of the victims and their families.</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">We condemn in the strongest terms those violent acts that have claimed the lives of helpless worshippers as well as diplomats and bank workers. We note that the greatest number of those killed and injured were Turkish and Muslim civilian men, women and children. We extend sympathy to all victims of this violence - those who lost their lives, the hundreds of people injured, and to their families.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The increasing attacks on symbols and the rising tide of violence to achieve political goals, which are exemplified by disenchanted political factions throughout the world or by the US government, are alarming. Increased violence, bombing and military force will not stop terrorism. Vilifying unfamiliar cultures, races, nations or religions will not make us safe.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Where will it end?</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Guided by our historic testimony to renounce violence and war, AFSC continues to call for an end to the continuing spiral of death and destruction. We are horrified and saddened by the escalating violence and loss of life as these tragedies continue to spread from one community and nation to another.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Our long standing commitment to confront all hatred and discrimination compels us to speak forcefully against the bombing of the synagogues and the directed violence against the British interests. Hatred is intolerable and repugnant to all faith communities of good will, whether it be overt or in another insidious form. No cause justifies violence.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Although the governments of Britain and the United States say their pre-emptive action in Iraq is justified by bombings such as this, others maintain that the invasion of Iraq is a contributing factor to the escalating suicide bombings. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">We reaffirm the sacredness of all life and the futility and absolute wrongness of violence. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Mary Ellen McNish, General Secretary  </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Paul A.
