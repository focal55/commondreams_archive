                - April 2 -The American Civil Liberties Union today launched a 

                new online advertising campaign addressing the Computer Assisted 

                Passenger Prescreening System II, the Transportation Security 

                Administration’s airline passenger profiling system that threatens 

                to create a permanent blacklist of people who cannot fly. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“The proposed 

                CAPPS II program will conduct unnecessarily invasive background 

                checks into the private lives of innocent travelers, providing 

                neither security nor freedom,” said Laura Murphy, Director of 

                the ACLU Washington Legislative Office. “The ACLU is committed 

                to bringing these intrusions into our personal lives to the attention 

                of the American public. In this era of the Internet, we believe 

                we can reach a whole new audience with these ads.” </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Under the proposed 

                CAPPS II system, a check against various databases, including 

                law enforcement, intelligence, and credit agencies, would be run 

                each time someone buys an airline ticket and a risk assessment 

                “score” for each passenger would be assigned: green for minimal, 

                yellow to spark heightened security procedures and red for those 

                judged to pose an acute danger. People with red scores would be 

                referred to law enforcement. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The advertisements, 

                which are running on the USA Today website, highlights that knowing 

                one’s “score” is pretty much a guessing game as “the government’s 

                new rating system” is secretive. The ads toggle back and forth 

                between red, yellow and green reflecting the government’s arbitrary 

                color-coded system for rating the traveling public. The ad will 

                link to a new section on the ACLU web page detailing the CAPPS 

                II program. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Americans of 

                all ideologies are alarmed with the intrusive proposals the Administration 

                is proposing. Conservative groups like Eagle Forum, the Free Congress 

                Foundation and the Christian Coalition share the ACLU’s concerns 

                that CAPPS II could be circumvented with fake IDs. What’s more, 

                the system creates the potential for innocent Americans to be 

                blacklisted and prohibited from flying, the ACLU said. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CAPPS II would 

                operate with little public accountability, and make it extremely 

                difficult for travelers who have been assigned an inaccurate threat 

                level to clear their records. The government has not fully explained 

                how the system will work, what information will be accessed and 

                how it will protect the data. Nor has it guaranteed that private 

                and public third parties will not abuse the data. The Transportation 

                Security Administration also has failed to show that the invasive 

                program will even be an effective measure to screen and stop potential 

                threats. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“It is clear 

                that CAPPS II threatens our liberty, but its security benefits 

                are far from clear," Murphy said. "It will drown security screeners 

                in an ocean of private information; some of that data will be 

                fraudulent, and much of it just plain wrong. CAPPS II is apparently 

                based on the belief that you can find a needle in a haystack by 

                adding more hay to the stack." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The new ad 

                is part of the "Keep America Safe and Free" coordinated campaign 

                at the ACLU, an initiative aimed at rolling back repressive federal 

                policies implemented since 9/11. Last month, the ACLU began an 

                advertisement campaign that features a striking image of a contact 

                lens decorated with the image of an American flag, reminding the 

                public that “it takes more than a display of pride” to protect 

                our rights. </font>
