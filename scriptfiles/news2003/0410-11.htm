- April 10 - In response to current events in Iraq suggesting a U.S. military 

victory

over the regime of Saddam Hussein, Gordon Clark, the National Coordinator 

of the Iraq Pledge of Resistance, asserted that the campaign of nonviolent 

resistance to the war and subsequent military occupation of Iraq remains 

essentially unchanged.



<p>"We are no more swayed by pictures of Iraqis cheering George Bush in 

the

streets of Baghdad than we were swayed by pictures of Iraqis cheering 

Saddam Hussein in the streets of Baghdad, " said Mr. Clark. He continued - 

"No one ever questioned that once the Bush Administration started this 

war, that the U.S. possessed the firepower to win a short term military 

victory. That does not change the fact that this war continues to be 

illegal, immoral and unjust, and that the planned U.S. military occupation 

of Iraq will be equally illegal, immoral and unjust - and that it will be 

equally bloody, if not much more so."



<p>Mr. Clark also questioned the support for the U.S. allegedly 

demonstrated

by cheering crowds. "Many Iraqis hated Saddam Hussein for killing their 

friends and loved ones, but cheered him in the streets because they 

understood that he controlled the tanks and militias that ran Iraq. There 

is no doubt that many Iraqis now hate the U.S. for having killed their 

friends and loved ones, but cheer in the streets for the same reason - 

they know it is now the U.S. which controls the tanks, as well as the 

local militias that now rule the streets of Iraq. It is also likely that 

many among those cheering are the same opportunists who are now looting 

the city. None of this represents public sentiment within Iraq."



<p>"Regardless of when the war is declared officially over and regardless 

of

what happens to Saddam Hussein, resentment and hatred can only continue to 

grow with each day of U.S. military occupation, and it will grow not only 

in Iraq but throughout the Arab and Muslim world. If terrorists were 

motivated by the presence of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia, how much more 

will they be motivated by U.S. troops occupying Iraq as well?"



<p>"In this context, it seems that pictures of cheering crowds are more 

part

of public relations campaign than they are a true measure of sentiment in 

Iraq or the Arab world. Why is the same U.S. media which now shows us 

these pictures so unable to show us the pictures of continuing protests 

and unrest in the Middle East? Why were they unable to show us the 

pictures of the civilian casualties of this war, pictures that the rest of 

the world saw?"



<p>Far from being unsuccessful, Mr. Clark asserted that the anti-war 

movement

was able to force President Bush to seek approval from the United Nations, 

to push him to seek consent from the U.S. Congress (neither of which he 

was initially willing to do), and to galvanize the greatest demonstration 

of global anti-war sentiment in the history of the planet. "All of this 

has combined to demonstrate the naked illegitimacy of this war to the 

world, and to create a large base from which we will continue to oppose 

the military occupation of Iraq, and the Bush Administration's ongoing 

plans for military intervention in the Middle East and throughout the world."



<p>In the meantime, according to Mr. Clark, the campaigns will continue. 

"All

campaigns for social change ebb and flow in relation to current events, 

and this one is no different. For a while the crowds may be smaller, or 

the actions less frequent. But the campaigns do not stop, and given the 

Bush Administrations plans it is clear that the mass numbers can and will 

be mobilized again... and probably sooner than we think." Already, civil 

disobedience actions are planned for the week of April 14, with additional 

actions being planned for May.



<p><i>The Iraq Pledge of Resistance is a campaign of nonviolent resistance 

and

civil disobedience to war on and occupation of Iraq. The campaign was 

launched in October of 2002, and is responsible for coordinating 

nonviolent CD actions in over 50 cities. More information can be found at
