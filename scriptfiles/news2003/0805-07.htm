- August 5 - The Gray Panthers organization distributed the following statement on 31 July 2003 made on its behalf by Corporate Accountability Project Director Will Thomas. He said: </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The General Services Administration (GSA) finally did today what it should have done several months ago -- found that MCI/WorldCom 'lacks the necessary internal controls and business ethics' to do business with the U.S. government. If the GSA had acted earlier, it could have kept this corporate criminal from being the telecommunications provider for the U.S. House of Representatives, the U.S. military, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, as well serving as the wireless provider for Baghdad. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By waiting to reach the conclusion that it was urged by many parties to arrive at in the spring, the GSA allowed MCI to cement its position as the largest telecommunications provider to the U.S. government. We now have the unfortunate situation where a company that is labeled as unfit to do business with the U.S. government is being propped up and kept alive by taxpayers at the rate of millions of dollars per month. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We call on the General Accounting Office (GAO), which is investigating GSA's original decision, to look into how this travesty came about. Yes, the GSA did the right thing, but it finally acted after tens of millions of dollars in contracts were awarded. By the time the tardy GSA acted, the MCI horse was not only out of the barn, it was already in the next county.&quot; </font></p>
