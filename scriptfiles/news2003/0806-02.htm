-Detainee Nigel Maccado (A#21-098-333) at the Passaic County Jail has been on a hunger strike since June 18, 2003.  This is a hunger strike to protest his detention and possible deportation and to expose the injustice of all the immigrant detentions. Tomorrow will be the 49th day of Nigel's hunger strike.  He is now unable to get out of bed without having fainting spells, falling and hitting his head.  Nigel, who has a heart condition, is in dire need of medical treatment.  The doctor and nurse at the jail are denying him medical treatment, on the grounds that &quot;you are trying to kill yourself anyway.&quot;</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The New Jersey Civil Rights Defense Committee is demanding that the jail move him immediately to a hospital where he can receive proper medical care that is not available to him at Passaic County Jail. The Committee will be holding a vigil outside the jail on Wednesday, August. 6.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nigel Maccado, an immigrant from India, like all the other thousands of immigrant &quot;detainees&quot; is not charged with any crime, yet he has been imprisoned for 21 months without charge or trial. Without any other hope, Nigel  has taken the desperate measure of a hunger strike to protest his unjust imprisonment. He has been joined in this hunger strike for the past 37 days by Hemnauth Mohabir, an immigrant from Guyana and fellow detainee at Passaic County Jail. Hemnauth, a permanent resident, has now been imprisoned for 16 months.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Both men emphasize that their hunger strike is not just for themselves, but to protest the unjust imprisonment of all the detainees.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The New Jersey Defense Committee demands the release of all detainees, all those held without charges.</font></p>
