- November 12 - The Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA) today expressed strong support for senators fighting the confirmation of extremist judges, including Carolyn Kuhl, Priscilla Owen, and Janice Rogers Brown, who have each built records in opposition to choice and women's reproductive rights. The Senate Republican leadership hopes to force votes on Friday, Nov. 14, on these three highly controversial nominees.
    </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Anti-choice hardliners believe now is the time for additional attacks on women's fundamental freedom of choice and they see the courts as their best tool to eradicate that freedom. We need judges who will protect reproductive rights in the face of many state legislatures, courts, and even the U.S. Congress, that are growing increasingly hostile to choice,&quot; said Planned Parenthood Federation of America President Gloria Feldt.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Planned Parenthood will not sit on the sidelines while the administration tries to ram through extremist judicial nominees who are far out of the mainstream on core issues affecting women. We commend Senate efforts to block these unacceptable extremist nominees-and we hope that they will not be intimidated by anti-choice colleagues in Congress who seek to rollback freedom of choice,&quot; Feldt said.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- Judge Kuhl co-wrote a Supreme Court brief that called Roe &quot;so far flawed that this court should overrule it and return the law to the condition in which it was before that case was decided.&quot; Kuhl also demonstrated support for George H.W. Bush's &quot;gag rule&quot; prohibiting Title X funding for health centers that counsel women on abortion as an option.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- During her tenure on the Texas Supreme Court, Justice Owen pushed to create hurdles for minors seeking abortion. She showed disregard for young women who feel that they cannot involve parents in their decision to have an abortion for various reasons, including rape or incest.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- During her tenure on the California Supreme Court, Justice Brown dissented from a ruling that struck down parental consent regulations that violated privacy protections guaranteed by the state constitution. She was twice found to be an unacceptable nominee by the California Judicial Commission.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Despite claims to the contrary, this Senate has confirmed 98 percent of all administration judicial nominees.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Planned Parenthood Federation of America is the nation's oldest and largest voluntary family planning organization. We believe that everyone has the right to choose when or whether to have a child -- and that every child should be wanted and loved. Planned Parenthood affiliates operate 850 health centers nationwide, providing medical services and sexuality education for millions of women, men, and teenagers each year -- regardless of race, age, sexuality, disability or income.</i></font></p>
