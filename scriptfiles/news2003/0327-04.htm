                - March 27 - The U.S. Department of Labor today published a proposal 

                to modernize its 50-year-old regulations defining exemptions from 

                the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) for "white-collar" employees, 

                a measure that will help small businesses grow and guarantee overtime 

                pay for 1.3 million more low-wage workers. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Our proposal 

                will strengthen overtime for the most vulnerable low-wage workers 

                and allow for stronger Department of Labor enforcement of this 

                important worker protection," said U.S. Secretary of Labor Elaine 

                L. Chao. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For the first 

                time since 1975, the Department's proposed regulations would raise 

                the salary threshold-below which workers would automatically qualify 

                for overtime-from $155 a week to $425 a week. This increase of 

                $270 a week would be the largest since Congress passed the FLSA 

                in 1938. The impact of this revision will be to increase the wages 

                of 1.3 million lower-income workers and reduce the number of low-wage 

                salaried workers currently being denied overtime pay. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Other proposed 

                changes include revising job duties required to qualify for the 

                exemption to better correspond to 21st century workplace realities. 

                The old regulations, written in 1949, mention job classifications 

                that no longer exist, such as key punch operators, straw bosses, 

                leg men and gang leaders. Clarifying which job duties qualify 

                for overtime pay will help workers and employers easily determine 

                overtime entitlement for millions of workers whose status is currently 

                unclear. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Updating these 

                regulations is long overdue-the types of jobs people do and the 

                skills they need have changed, but the regulations have not, " 

                said Wage and Hour Administrator Tammy D. McCutchen. "By recognizing 

                the professional status of skilled employees, the proposed regulation 

                will provide them a guaranteed salary and flexible hours." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The department 

                invites comment on the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that will 

                be published in the Federal Register on Monday, March 31, 2003.
