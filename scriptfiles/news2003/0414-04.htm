                NY - April 14 - On Friday April 25, 2003. Ralph Nader's "People 

                Have The Power" tour will bring to Western New York a unique blend 

                of community activism and world-class entertainment. Acknowledging 

                the historic bond between social movements and music, Nader has 

                woven the two together into a series of events that is expanding 

                civic activism and grassroots organizing -- addressing such timely 

                and critical issues as the human, social, economic and political 

                costs associated with the war in Iraq, the corporate business 

                of war, the fragile state of our civil liberties and how citizens 

                must stay vigilant to protect their environment and social services, 

                such as education and health care. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Internationally 

                acclaimed singer/songwriter Patti Smith and her band will join 

                Mr. Nader and perform in Buffalo for the first time in twenty-five 

                years. Community leaders working for progressive social change 

                will speak as well, and encourage the audience to connect with 

                local campaigns. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#8220;The 

                purpose of these events this year is to bring people together 

                in cities across America, which is especially critical now,&#8221; 

                said Nader, America&#8217;s leading consumer activist. &#8220;Progressive 

                people and organizations in Western New York must work together. 

                Civil liberties, our nation&#8217;s security and the nation&#8217;s 

                major social priorities, are at risk in the Executive Branch and 

                Congress. All major peace and social justice successes in our 

                history have started with a mobilization of the citizenry. We 

                must further this tradition and strive to ensure that the values 

                of democracy, law enforcement, respect for human rights and the 

                protection of all innocent people prevail here both at home and 

                around the world.&#8221; </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Buffalo is 

                the fourteenth stop of Nader&#8217;s nationwide tour beginning 

                in 2001 in Portland, Oregon, and has since packed venues from 

                San Francisco to Cleveland and Wall St. to Tampa. Nader likened 

                this current tour to the &#8220;Super Rallies&#8221; he headlined 

                during his bid for the Presidency in 2000. Those rallies filled 

                ten major arenas, from Portland&#8217;s Memorial Coliseum to New 

                York&#8217;s Madison Square Garden, with turnouts far larger than 

                those of the 2000 major party candidates. This event is being 

                sponsored by Nader's newest organization, Democracy Rising, which 

                seeks to unify people &#8220;in the cause of freeing American 

                politics from the grip of corporate interests,&#8221; Nader said.

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The rally will 

                be held at the Koessler Center at Canisius College, 2001 Main 

                St. Buffalo, NY. The official program begins at 7:00 p.m. (doors, 

                live music, and community group tabling at 5:30 p.m). An array 

                of Western New York community organizations will have information 

                tables to distribute literature and solicit signatures for a variety 

                of progressive causes. General admission tickets are $12 in advance 

                and $15 at the door. Children 12 and under are free.
