                - April 17 - The Democratic presidential contenders each raised 

                large chunks of money in their home states during the first quarter 

                of this year, and relied on traditional money centers including 

                New York City, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., for much of the 

                rest, according to a study of itemized contributions in reports 

                filed this week. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sen. John Kerry 

                (Mass.) raised more from New York City donors than did any other 

                candidate. His take in the Big Apple from January through March 

                was nearly $779,000. The only region where Kerry raised more was 

                Boston, where he collected $1.4 million. Sen. John Edwards (N.C.) 

                collected the second-highest total from New York--$567,000, good 

                enough for second among the most lucrative metro areas for him. 

                Sen. Joe Lieberman (Conn.) raised $466,000 in New York, more than 

                anywhere else in the country; former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean 

                took in $238,000 from there; and Rep. Dick Gephardt (Mo.) raised 

                $216,000. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Former Sen. 

                Carol Moseley Braun (Ill.) raised $3,000 in New York, which ranked 

                third on her list of metro areas for fundraising. New York was 

                not among the top five metro areas for Sen. Bob Graham (Fla.) 

                or Rep. Dennis Kucinich (Ohio). As of this afternoon, a report 

                for the Rev. Al Sharpton was not available from the FEC. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Los Angeles 

                donors gave the most money ($637,000) to Edwards. He was the only 

                candidate to raise more in L.A. than anywhere else in the country. 

                Kerry took in $560,000, putting Los Angeles third on his metro-area 

                list behind Boston and New York. Gephardt collected $388,000 from 

                Los Angeles donors; the only place he raised more was in his home 

                town of St. Louis ($769,000). Dean raised $232,000 in the City 

                of Angels, slightly less than his total in New York. Lieberman 

                raised $221,000, putting Los Angeles fourth on his metro-area 

                list. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Washington, 

                D.C., ranked among the most lucrative metro areas for Kerry ($377,000), 

                Lieberman ($323,000), Gephardt ($314,000) and Dean ($168,000). 

                Other top metro areas for presidential fundraising included Chicago, 

                which made the top five list for Gephardt ($242,000) and Moseley 

                Braun ($51,000), and San Francisco, where Kerry raised $445,000 

                and Dean collected $91,000. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Also on Edwards' 

                list was Raleigh ($380,000) - the only metro area in North Carolina 

                among his top five - as well as Dallas and Houston. Lieberman 

                took in $276,000 and $149,000 from the Connecticut areas of Stamford 

                and Hartford, respectively. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Kucinich posted 

                the most eclectic list of top metro areas - San Francisco, Louisville 

                (Ky.), Cleveland, Santa Cruz (Calif.) and Oakland. Graham, who 

                formed a presidential committee in late February and has been 

                recovering from heart surgery, raised virtually all of his money 

                (89 percent) in his home state of Florida. His top five areas 

                for fundraising were all in the Sunshine State. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Edwards appeared 

                to take the most advantage of the new McCain-Feingold law's increased 

                contribution limit, which is now $2,000 per individual to a candidate. 

                He raised $5.2 million in contributions of $2,000 or more, compared 

                to $4.2 million for Kerry, $2.2 million for Gephardt and $1.8 

                million for Lieberman. Graham raised $844,000 from contributors 

                who maxed out to his campaign, Dean took in $644,000, Moseley 

                Braun raised $42,000 and Kucinich collected $32,000.
