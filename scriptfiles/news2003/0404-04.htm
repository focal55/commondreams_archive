                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MONTEVIDEO, 

                  Uruguay -- April 4 - APC opposes actions against the online 

                  presence of Al-Jazeera. The Internet must be allowed to freely 

                  perform its unique and vital role as a promoter of &quot;freedom 

                  of expression&quot; and content diversity, especially in times 

                  of conflict. </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">APC opposes 

                  censorship on the Internet and states in its Internet Rights 

                  Charter[1] that &quot;the Internet must be protected from all 

                  attempts to censor social and political debate&quot;. The Internet 

                  Rights Charter argues that &quot;the Internet is an ideal space 

                  for the recording and promotion of culturally and politically 

                  diverse content&quot;.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This is 

                  consistent with Article 19 of the UN International Covenant 

                  on Civil and Political Rights[2] which states that the right 

                  to freedom of opinion and expression, including the right to 

                  seek, receive and impart information is a recognised human right 

                  and must be protected. </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Case 

                  of the Al-Jazeera Website:</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">APC is concerned 

                  to note that a prominent online Middle Eastern news and information 

                  source - the Al-Jazeera website - has been the target of hacker 

                  attacks, domain name hijacking and the withdrawal of hosting 

                  services all within the first few weeks of the war on Iraq led 

                  by the United States. </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Called &quot;an 

                  unusually independent voice in the Arab world&quot; by the Associated 

                  Press wire service, the Al-Jazeera satellite TV network launched 

                  its English-language web site on Monday March 24, attracting 

                  significant media coverage. </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, 

                  instead of news articles from an Arab perspective, visitors 

                  to the Al-Jazeera website on Thursday March 27 were greeted 

                  by the image of the United States' flag and a message proclaiming 

                  &quot;Let Freedom Ring&quot;. The Al-Jazeera website address 

                  <a href="http://www.al-jazeera.net" target="_new">www.al-jazeera.net</a> 

                  had been hijacked so that visitors who attempted to read either 

                  the English or Arab language sites were unable to do so as their 

                  browsers were automatically &quot;redirected&quot; to the pro-U.S. 

                  page. </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Al-Jazeera 

                  has also had to contend with denial of service (DOS) attacks 

                  from so-called &quot;patriotic&quot; hackers. These attacks 

                  artificially increase the levels of visitor traffic to a site 

                  until the server hosting the site cannot cope with the traffic 

                  any longer and crashes, knocking the site offline. </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Al-Jazeera's 

                  US-based Internet service provider has also just cancelled their 

                  contract with Al-Jazeera. It is understood that Al-Jazeera has 

                  found a new provider in Europe, however in the meantime on April 

                  2 (the estimated date of the contract cancellation) the Al-Jazeera 

                  sites were unreachable. </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The computer 

                  hacks, online vandalism and the canceling of Al-Jazeera's web 

                  hosting contract all interfere with the UN declared right to 

                  &quot;receive and impart information and ideas through any media 

                  and regardless of frontiers&quot;.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Internet 

                  is a valuable tool for the diversification of media sources, 

                  especially for citizens of the countries that make up the invading 

                  coalition forces. </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;One 

                  could watch the US television networks around the clock for 

                  a week and not realise the extent of public opposition and disquiet 

                  [to the war] &#133; Why is the unease and disaffection of the 

                  American public so invisible? The answer is that it's only invisible 

                  if you're looking for it in the mainstream media. It's there 

                  all right - but it's on the net,&quot; wrote John Naughton of 

                  the British newspaper, the Observer[3]. </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the second 

                  week of the war, the most searched on word in various search 

                  engines was &quot;Al-Jazeera&quot; and other variants. A considerable 

                  number of subscribers have joined their English language news 

                  service and North American readers in huge numbers are actively 

                  seeking outside media sources on the war, according to a study 

                  by the Pew Internet and American Life project[4]. </font></p>
