- November 5 - This week marks one year from the 2004 elections and American Family Voices (AFV), an organization focused on providing a strong voice for middle and low income families on economic, health care, and consumer issues, with bushrecall.org have launched an outreach campaign to highlight the Bush administration and the Republican Congressional track record of questionable results.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today, AFV launched 'Daily Reality Check', which will be a daily column exposing the weaknesses of the Bush administration.  This column, which will track daily Bush follies, lies, and scandals will be posted on all of the websites on <a href="http://www.Bushrecall.org" target="_new">bushrecall.org</a> and <a href="http://www.americanfamilyvoices.org" target="_new">www.americanfamilyvoices.org</a> and will be sent out to over 60,000 Americans.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;American Family Voices will be a voice for thousands of disenfranchised voters and constituents who want this nation&#146;s leadership to address their most basic concerns and needs,&#148; Mike Lux, President of American Family Voices said today.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition, a special year out action alert to all action members of both BushRecall.org and AFV will be an organizing tool for Americans to address their frustration with the Administration with letter writing campaigns, speaking out on radio talk shows, and organizing in their communities against the Bush right wing agenda on issues such as:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>The Economy: Anemic</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">George W. Bush turned a $127 billion surplus, into a $455 billion deficit that is expected to increase at least another $50 billion over the next year.  Nine million Americans cannot find work while almost 3 million jobs have simply disappeared from the economy. </font></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The War on Saddam: Quagmire</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld distances himself from the Bush administration as one US soldier is killed and four wounded per day.  This is despite George W. Bush announcing &#147;Mission Accomplished&#148; on the USS Abraham Lincoln.</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Crime in America: Healthy</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to FBI statistics released, October 27, the number of serious crimes reported to authorities rose to about 11.0 million offenses under the Bush Administration.  This included significant increases in violent crimes including rape and murder</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Education in America: Not-So-Healthy</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">George W. Bush claimed to be the education president; he pledged that innovative educational programs like Teach for America and Americorps would be amply funded.  Yet, the Bush administration gutted the program and denied hundred of thousands of college graduates and inner-city students the opportunity to learn. </font></p>
<p> </p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AFV and <a href="http://www.Bushrecall.org" target="_new">Bushrecall.org</a> are coordinating their efforts with other national organizations with the release of special reports and initiating other major activities to mark the week.  </font></p>
