- August 28 - Seventy-five organizations representing journalists, scientists, librarians, environmental groups, privacy advocates, and others today sent a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge calling on the Department of Homeland Security to allow public input on procedures for &quot;safeguarding&quot; and sharing a vaguely defined set of information between firefighters, police officers, public health researchers and federal, state, and local governments.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Under the auspices of fighting terrorism, the Department is poised to write

- without guarantees for public input - procedures that could sweep up otherwise publicly available information that has nothing to do with terrorism into a zone of secrecy while subjecting millions of Americans to confidentiality agreements.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The letter asks Secretary Ridge to release to the public a draft version of the new procedures - which would not themselves contain classified information - and address public comments in writing a final version. The letter expresses concern that the procedures may cut a broad swath of information out of the public domain, that the procedures would subject millions inside and outside of government to nondisclosure agreements and criminal penalties for disclosing information improperly, and cut out the ability of journalists, community groups, and others to inform the public of activities of federal, state and local governments.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The law that created the Department, the Homeland Security Act, included a provision that required the federal government to safeguard and share &quot;homeland security information&quot; with government officials, public health professionals, firefighters and others in order to respond to a terrorist attack.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Included in that set of information is a potentially broad set of information, such as maps of environmental contamination, that is not classified but which may be perceived as helpful to a terrorist or potentially helpful in responding to or preventing an unknown future attack.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">August 27, 2003</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Honorable Tom Ridge,

Secretary</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

U.S. Department of Homeland Security</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Washington, D.C. 20528</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dear Mr. Secretary:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We are writing to urge the Department of Homeland Security to give the public an opportunity to comment on procedures that are being developed that may restrict the public dissemination of &quot;homeland security information,&quot; including information that is &quot;sensitive but unclassified.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These procedures are being developed to implement the Homeland Security Information Sharing Act (HSISA).  The Act was passed into law as Section VIII of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 with the purpose of fostering the sharing of information among federal, state, and local officials about possible terrorism activities.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The public's ability to remain informed of and participate in the decision-making of government is fundamental to the democratic process. Democracy is undermined whenever openness is compromised.  Consistent with these democratic principles, those compromises, when they are made, should be made only when necessary and only after an open process in which the public participates.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Public comment on the procedures implementing the Act is warranted for several reasons.  First, the definition of Homeland Security Information

(HSI) included in HSISA is so broad that it raises the question whether activities of government officials and the public that have little to do with terrorism could be harmed by these implementing  regulations.  In particular, Section 892(f)(1) of HSISA defines homeland security information to include information that (A) relates to the threat of a terrorist activity, (B) relates to the ability to prevent, interdict, or disrupt terrorist activity, (C) would improve the identification or investigation of a suspected terrorist or terrorist organization, or would (D) improve the response to a terrorist act.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What remains unclear until implementing regulations are written and released is whether these procedures would preclude public access to information that community residents, parents, journalists and others in the public currently obtain from or with the assistance of government in order to make their communities safer, inform the public, and for other purposes.  Equally unclear is whether these procedures will require government to remove information already publicly available.  The public should have an opportunity to address that question in a public notice-and-comment rulemaking and government policymakers should consider those answers in formulating the information sharing procedures.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Second, public comment is warranted because the procedures developed under HSISA could directly affect a large number of people both inside and outside of the federal government.  The HSISA would prohibit public disclosure of information subject to agreements between the government and those receiving &quot;sensitive but unclassified&quot;  information.  One recent analysis estimates that roughly four million people - including public health officials not employed by government at any level - could be asked under the requirements of HSISA to sign formal  nondisclosure agreements.  Those agreements would be enforceable through civil and criminal sanctions.  In addition, the procedures implementing the Act could expand the list of those subject to these agreements even further.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Third, the public has an interest in being informed of new procedures for sharing information that may infringe on the public's ability to obtain information from government about its activities.  Since the procedures that are to be created will directly address the &quot;safeguarding&quot; of information and restrictions on public dissemination of information, the public should have the opportunity to review a draft version of these implementing procedures, analyze their adequacy and potential impact, and make recommendations for improvements, as necessary.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Homeland Security Information Sharing Act was passed into law with little public review and scrutiny and, thus, the impacts of the procedures that are to be developed to implement the Homeland Security Information Sharing Act are unknown.  Since its passage, though, the law has attracted increased attention outside the government.  We ask that the Department of Homeland Security provide the public with a period of sufficient length (i.e., 90 days) to review and comment upon a draft version of the procedures before they are finalized.</font></p>
