                - April 22 - We, the Women's International League for Peace and 

                Freedom, U.S. Section, reject the recently announced &quot;victory&quot; 

                in Iraq, and accompanying &quot;liberation&quot; of the people 

                after the demise of their government. The U.S./U.K. military invasion 

                and takeover of Iraq has resulted in the deaths of thousands of 

                Iraqi civilians and military, a death toll that may never be reported.</font> 

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We know 

                  there is a severe humanitarian crisis in Iraq, with lack of 

                  food, water, medical supplies, hospitals and doctors to care 

                  for the wounded. Over half of the 24 million Iraqis are children 

                  whose lives are permanently damaged by this invasion; many are 

                  orphaned. The major cities of Iraq, and their infrastructures, 

                  have been devastated, if not destroyed. We support a plan that 

                  would ensure the UN administration of humanitarian aid and reconstruction 

                  by civilian authorities, not the U.S. military.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is costing 

                  the U.S. taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars to destroy 

                  Iraq, and it will cost billions more to pay favored U.S. corporations 

                  to rebuild it. In the process, the Bush administration manufactures 

                  a false sense of economic scarcity as communities all over the 

                  United States are forced to make massive cuts in education, 

                  health care, and job creation.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We condemn 

                  the U.S. military occupation of Iraq, which is illegal, immoral 

                  and unjust. We support a form of government in Iraq duly chosen 

                  by the Iraqi people. Ownership of Iraqi oil should remain with 

                  the Iraqi people, not U.S. oil companies. The Iraqi people need 

                  to lead the reconstruction of their economy and their society.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We call 

                  upon WILPF members to continue our resistance to the occupation 

                  and militarization of Iraq and any expanded war in the Middle 

                  East. Secretary of Defense (War) Rumsfeld justifies and alludes 

                  to the possibility of military attacks on Syria and Iran. We 

                  will be asked to believe a continuing series of lies as this 

                  next military phase moves forward.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The U.S. 

                  has committed war crimes - crimes against humanity - in Iraq, 

                  and must be held accountable at the International Criminal Court. 

                  These crimes have been committed in our names. As an anti-war 

                  movement, we must join with others in bringing these crimes 

                  to court under international law.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We condemn 

                  the Bush Administration's drive for military domination worldwide 

                  that threatens to wage permanent war against countries considered 

                  strategically important. We join the global movement in opposition 

                  to war and in strategizing to build a world of peace with justice.</font></p>
