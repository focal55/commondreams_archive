                YORK - April 16 - The agrochemical giant Monsanto has received 

                the lowest possible environmental and strategic management rating 

                of a triple-C from Innovest Strategic Value Advisors, a global 

                environmental and social investment research firm. Innovest's 

                report, &quot;Monsanto and Genetic Engineering: Risks to Investors,&quot; 

                commissioned by Greenpeace, was released at a briefing at the 

                Harvard Club in New York City this morning. </font> 

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report, 

                  which comes just days before Monsanto's annual general meeting, 

                  warns shareholders and potential investors of Monsanto's &quot;above 

                  average risk exposure and less sophisticated management than 

                  peers.&quot; Innovest analysts predict that &quot;it [Monsanto] 

                  will likely under-perform in the market over the mid to long-term.&quot; 

                  </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Monsanto 

                  suffered $1.7 billion in losses in 2002 and has failed to open 

                  new markets for its controversial genetic engineered (GE) products. 

                  Yet Monsanto continues to pursue its unsound business strategy 

                  of betting on a speedy and widespread global acceptance of GE 

                  foods. Next in the Monsanto pipeline is GE wheat, which is being 

                  boycotted in key markets by farmers and food industry even before 

                  its approval. </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;While 

                  last year's profit losses led to a change in leadership at the 

                  company, they did not lead to a change in strategy. If Monsanto 

                  does not take steps to mitigate its substantial market risks, 

                  further investor losses are likely,&quot; said Frank Dixon, 

                  Managing Director at Innovest Strategic Value Advisors. &quot;The 

                  risk of heavy financial losses due to genetic pollution or technology 

                  failure coupled with sustained market rejection of GE foods 

                  makes Monsanto a poor investment.&quot; </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In its assessment 

                  of Monsanto's key markets, Innovest underscores the lack of 

                  regulatory approval and stiff consumer opposition that continue 

                  to block the company's GE crops. GE products constitute one 

                  of the most widely rejected product groups ever, and major food 

                  importers such as China, Japan and Korea have recently followed 

                  the restrictive European approach. In the US, upwards of 90% 

                  of consumers now demand GE food to be labeled and many would 

                  reject GE food if given the choice. </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Innovest 

                  analysis of the risks and liabilities associated with Monsanto's 

                  genetic engineering (GE) business pays special attention to 

                  the inevitability of GE contamination. Referring to the example 

                  of the StarLink corn contamination scandal in 2000, in which 

                  the company Aventis lost $1 billion, Innovest estimated Monsanto's 

                  potential financial fallout from a &quot;StarLink scenario&quot; 

                  to be $3.83 liability per share. </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Monsanto's 

                  cash cow remains its agrochemical business, but last year's 

                  24% drop in sales of Round-up and other non-selective herbicides 

                  has left the company vulnerable and increasingly desperate. 

                  Monsanto appears to be digging its own grave with its GE strategy,&quot; 

                  said global markets specialist with Greenpeace, Lindsay Keenan.</font></p>
