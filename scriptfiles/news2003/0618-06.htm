- June 18 - A container with about 2 grams of weapons-grade plutonium is missing from a facility at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, sources have told the Project On Government Oversight (POGO).</font>

<p> </p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The plutonium has been missing since 2001, but was only reported last week to Department of Energy (DOE) headquarters officials responsible for overseeing the lab. DOE requires that any missing weapons-grade nuclear material a half-gram or more be reported.</font></p>

<p> </p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The fact that the missing material was not reported is a violation of department policy and raises serious questions about the level of confidence in the DOE&#146;s Material Control and Accountability System that tracks hundreds of tons of weapons grade nuclear material.</font></p>

<p> </p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A former DOE official advised POGO that even these small quantities of missing plutonium are a potential threat to public health and safety and are taken very seriously. DOE headquarters normally dispatches a &#147;tiger team&#148; from headquarters to investigate what happened to the material and who was responsible. In fact, in the past when quantities even as small as a half-gram of missing nuclear material was reported missing from other lab facilities, investigators have conducted detailed searches of buildings and even dug up trash heaps, the former official said.</font></p>

<p> </p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A House National Security Subcommittee hearing, &#147;Emerging Threats: Assessing Nuclear Weapons Complex Facility Security,&#148; is scheduled for 9 a.m., June 24, 2003, in Room 2247 of the Rayburn Office Building. POGO Executive Director Danielle Brian and former DOE security contractor Ronald Timm are among those scheduled to testify at the hearing.</font></p>
