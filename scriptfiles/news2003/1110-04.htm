  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NAIROBI, Kenya - November 10 - Elaborate CFC (chlorofluorocarbons) smuggling operations spanning three continents and including Singapore, South Africa, and the United States have been exposed through in-depth undercover investigations by the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) as revealed in its new report launched today at the opening of the Meeting of the Parties of the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The report, entitled &quot;Lost in Transit -- Global CFC Smuggling Trends and the Need for Faster Phase Out&quot; reveals the global nature of the illegal trade and exposes CFC smuggling operations coordinated by Singaporean dealers who seek to deceive US authorities and dump illegal CFCs on the American market.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">EIA reveals how Singaporean companies offer to sell CFCs to the U.S., mislead the US Environmental Protection Agency, and engineer elaborate international trading schemes to avoid U.S. enforcement efforts. One scam involves the gold mines of South Africa. As used CFCs are legally permitted to import into the U.S., opportunistic traders claim to extract CFCs from refrigeration equipment required in South Africa's goldmines. However, the CFCs are often not genuine used material at all, but a mixture of used and illegal virgin material, or illegal virgin CFCs that have been deliberately contaminated to give the appearance of used chemicals, which fetch a very high price on the lucrative U.S. market. To facilitate this scam, virgin CFCs are smuggled into South Africa through the neighboring countries.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Alexander von Bismarck, EIA senior campaigner, states, &quot;Over the last decade, the United States has been working hard and effectively to stop the illegal import of these dangerous chemicals. Our investigations suggest that these efforts are now threatened by sophisticated smuggling operations in Singapore and other transit countries.&quot; From 1998 to mid 2003, U.S. authorities have imposed more than US $40 million in fines, more than U.S. $30 million in restitution and more than 76 years of jail time for CFC smuggling.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">EIA undercover investigators met with Singaporean businesses involved in such illegal practices and revealed the role which transit countries play in this trade by facilitating the diversion of CFCs onto the black market. Singapore and other significant transit points in the illegal CFC trade such as Dubai have strong economies founded on their role as major trade hubs, however they do not sufficiently control or monitor the movement of CFCs through their ports, and companies are able to operate illicit trading schemes with minimal interference. One particular company, Leempeng Enterprise Pte Ltd offered EIA investigators a shipment of CFCs complete with false paperwork and offered to conceal the goods behind uncontrolled chemicals to avoid detection.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Despite the achievements of the Montreal Protocol, the slow reaction to the problem of smuggling has allowed the illicit CFC trade to undermine the success and integrity of the Protocol. This could further delay the recovery of the ozone layer. The ozone hole reached a maximum size of 28km2 this year, equaling the record size hole of 2000.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">EIA is calling on the Parties of the Montreal Protocol to strengthen the controls of ozone depleting substances (ODS) through transit countries and provide adequate training and resources for enforcement in order for greater transparency and trace-ability to be achieved thereby preventing the diversion of material onto the black market.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In May 2003, President Bush signed a Free Trade Agreement with Singapore, which Congress ratified last September. EIA's report suggests that the smuggler-friendly climate of Singapore threatens the efforts of the United States to protect its borders from environmentally harmful substances. An environmental side-agreement is currently being negotiated between the two governments, with no sign as yet of Singapore taking steps to stop the illegal trade in CFCs.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Von Bismarck continued: &quot;These sophisticated global smuggling operations in Singapore undermine the Montreal Protocol and the enforcement efforts by the United States. As part of the new trade agreement with the US, Singapore must clamp down on these companies which are profiting by trading away the future of the global environment.&quot;</font></p>

  <p><i><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- The Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) is the only environmental organisation in the world that is actively investigating the illegal international trade in CFCs and other ozone depleting substances. EIA have been actively tracking the global illegal trade in ozone depleting substances (ODS) since the mid-1990s to provide information to the Montreal Protocol and other relevant bodies.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- The Montreal Protocol was agreed on 1 January 1987 and is now ratified by 184 countries. Under the Montreal Protocol and its amendments, ozone-depleting substances are to be reduced and eliminated through the development of chemical substitutes and alternative manufacturing processes (elimination is the final objective). Phase out should be complete by 2010.</font></i></p>
