-  

June 16  - Anti-death penalty activists from across the United States

will converge on Washington, D.C. June 29 through July 2 for four days of

activities commemorating the historic 1972 and 1976 Supreme Court rulings

that suspended the death penalty in the United States and later allowed

executions to resume.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

The annual event is organized by the Abolitionist Action Committee

and endorsed by such groups as the American Civil Liberties Union

Capital Punishment Project, American Friends Service Committee,

the National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty and Students

Against the Death Penalty. At the same time the Washington, D.C.

event is going on, groups and individuals across the United States

and abroad will stage solidarity actions.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

 

June 29 marks the 31st anniversary of the Furman v. Georgia decision

suspending executions, while July 2 marks the 27th anniversary of the

Gregg v. Georgia ruling allowing executions to resume. Since Gregg,

858 people have been executed in the United States though a combination

of lethal injections, hangings, firing squads, gas chambers and

electrocutions. In the past 12 months alone, 78 people have been executed, while eight people have been freed from death row and released from prison

due to actual innocence. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The death penalty in 1972 was arbitrary and capricious and the death

penalty in 2003 is arbitrary and capricious,&quot; said Abe Bonowitz,

spokesman for the Abolitionist Action Committee. &quot;The difference

between 1972 and 2003 is that the abolition movement in the United

States is now committed to a strategy of legislative repeal -

organizing on a grassroots level, state by state, legislature by

legislature. It is no longer a question of whether we will abolish the death penalty, but when.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

 

Bonowitz said the primary goal of the June 29-July 2 activities is

to educate the public. &quot;This is the tenth year that we will stand vigil

in front of the U.S. Supreme Court between the historic anniversaries

of when all death penalty laws were thrown out in 1972 and when new

laws were upheld in 1976,&quot; Bonowitz explained. &quot;Our goal is to further

educate the public about why the death penalty is a bad public policy, and we invite everyone to stand with us for alternatives to the death

penalty. But the Fast and Vigil also serves as an opportunity for

activists to come together and renew our commitment to the struggle

for abolition.&quot;</font></p>
