- December 12 - As holiday spirit runs high in our nation&#146;s capital and Bush Administration officials slip out of the office to do Christmas shopping, the countdown continues on one group that was left off the White House Christmas list: more than 2 million active adult workers who have been unemployed for six months or more.</FONT><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">For the second time in two years, the President &#150; who has presided over the loss of more jobs during his term in office than any administration since that of Herbert Hoover &#150; is making no effort to renew unemployment insurance coverage.  Despite a recent blip in the unemployment rate, the number of chronically unemployed Americans remains at an 11-year high.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;The president is giving huge tax breaks to the rich, working to allow employers to stop paying overtime for 8 million workers, and pushing custom legislation for media giants,&#148; said Zack Exley, organizing director for MoveOn.org.  &#147;But when it comes to unemployed workers losing their benefits at Christmas time, this is the Scrooge White House.&#148;</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In its daily &#147;Misleader&#148; campaign report, MoveOn.org notes that in the past, Bush has said such stirring things as &#147;I don&#146;t think [Congress] ought to balance their budget on the backs of the poor.&#148;  But when asked about the Republican Congress&#146; refusal to extend jobless benefits, the best the White House could offer yesterday was: &#147;We&#146;ll continue to work with Congress on that issue.&#148;  Merry Christmas, jobless Americans!</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">To read today&#146;s daily Mislead, visit: <A HREF="http://www.Misleader.org" TARGET="_new">www.Misleader.org</A>.</FONT></P><P></P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p></font><!-- #EndEditable --></td></tr>
