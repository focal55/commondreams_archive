                - April 22 - According to data released today by the Afterschool 

                Alliance, Florida would lose an estimated $19,955,940 for afterschool 

                programs next year if Congress accepts President Bush's proposed 

                cut to the 21st Century Community Learning Centers Program (21st 

                CCLC -- the federal government's principal afterschool program). 

                Using current state allocation funding formulas and the U.S. Department 

                of Education's estimate of $700 per child for afterschool programming 

                yearly, the Alliance determined that 28,509 Florida children would 

                lose access to afterschool programs if the budget cut is adopted. 

                The president proposed the cut in spite of a demonstrated need 

                for afterschool programs; Florida received $54.9 million in grant 

                applications in 2002 and had only $13.7 million in funds available.

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nationwide, 

                  the president's proposed cut from the current $1 billion 21st 

                  CCLC appropriation to $600 million would deny more than 550,000 

                  children afterschool care according to &quot;Closing the Doors 

                  on Afterschool Programs: An Analysis of How the Proposed Cut 

                  to the 21st Century Community Learning Centers Program Will 

                  Affect Children and Families in Every State.&quot; The cut is 

                  even deeper when compared to the authorization the President 

                  signed in his No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB). That law called 

                  for $1.75 billion for the 21st CCLC in fiscal year 2004. The 

                  gap between the Bush proposal ($600 million) and the NCLB authorization 

                  ($1.75 billion) could fund afterschool care for 1.6 million 

                  children nationwide. Experts estimate that up to 15 million 

                  children are without adult supervision during the afternoon 

                  hours. </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Cutting 

                  federal afterschool funding would be bad for Florida,&quot; 

                  said Jennifer Faber of the Florida Children's Forum. &quot;We 

                  need to invest in our kids and give them safe places where they 

                  can learn and grow. Cutting funds for afterschool programs would 

                  be short-sighted and counterproductive.&quot; </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Everyone 

                  who cares about keeping children safe in the afternoons and 

                  providing them with academic support should oppose a cut in 

                  afterschool funding,&quot; said Afterschool Alliance executive 

                  director Judy Y. Samelson. &quot;We are not nearly meeting the 

                  demand for afterschool in America today. To cut back even further, 

                  as the president proposes, would be to betray our children, 

                  their parents and communities.&quot; </font></p>
