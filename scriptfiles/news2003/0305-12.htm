                - March 5 - Today's introduction of the Arctic Wilderness bill, 

                coming on the heels of last year's historic Senate vote against 

                drilling in the Arctic and last month's Arctic budget letter signed 

                by six moderate Republican Senators, sends a strong message to 

                the White House and the oil industry - it makes no sense to drill 

                for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It makes no 

                sense to ruin one of America's last wild places for what amounts 

                to six months worth of oil and gas-- oil that wouldn't even reach 

                American consumers for another 10 years. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It makes no 

                sense for the Bush Administration to think that drilling in the 

                Arctic Refuge is a substitute for an energy policy. The fact is 

                that there is a better way. We can promote renewable energy. We 

                can make the cars we drive right now go much farther on a gallon 

                of gas. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It makes no 

                sense to destroy land that is sacred to the Gwich'in, Native Americans 

                who have lived adjacent to the coastal plain for thousands of 

                years. Protecting the Refuge means that the Gwich'in can maintain 

                their way of life and hunt the caribou uninterrupted by the spills 

                and explosions that plague the existing oil fields of Prudhoe 

                Bay. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Yesterday's 

                release of the National Research Council Report on the cumulative 

                impacts of oil and gas drilling on Alaska's North Slope is just 

                the latest reminder that oil drilling and wilderness don't mix. 

                The report documents the negative environmental and cultural impacts 

                of 30 years of oil drilling in the area near Prudhoe Bay, noting 

                that, "The structures and activities also violate the spirit of 

                the land, a value that is reported by some Alaska Natives to be 

                central to their culture. Given that most of the affected areas 

                are not likely to be rehabilitated or restored to their original 

                condition, those effects will persist long after industrial activity 

                has ceased on the North Slope." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It makes no 

                sense to allow an industry with a track record of destruction, 

                damage, and drilling to get their hands on America's Arctic. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The American 

                people understand and appreciate the wilderness and human values 

                supported by the coastal plain of the Arctic Refuge. Independents, 

                Democrats and Republicans alike strongly oppose drilling there, 

                and continue to support protecting this one of a kind American 

                treasure from oil and gas drilling. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We hope the 

                Bush Administration gets the message: Arctic drilling just doesn't 

                make sense. </font>
