- July 22 - The Animal Legal Defense Fund (ALDF) and the Animal Welfare Institute (AWI) have filed suit in U.S. District Court, challenging the U.S. Department of Agriculture&#146;s failure to fulfill its obligation under the federal Animal Welfare Act (AWA) to ensure the humane treatment of primates in captivity. In 1985, Congress amended the AWA to require that standards be established to promote the psychological well-being of nonhuman primates in zoos, laboratories and other facilities. Though regulations aimed at fulfilling that obligation were finally issued in 1991, USDA itself determined seven years ago that the standards are inadequate and that its own inspectors did not know how to judge compliance. Yet despite years of study and review &#151; including issuing a 108-page scientific report &#151; USDA still has failed to act to correct this problem. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Almost 20 years ago, I assisted the Animal Welfare Institute in helping to educate members of Congress about the vital importance of appropriate environments for nonhuman primates,&#148; says world-renowned chimpanzee expert Jane Goodall. &#147;Congress understood this importance and passed a law calling for the development of such regulations. It is a disgrace that after all these years Congressional intent has been brushed aside at the expense of these magnificent beings.&#148; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Congress directed USDA to promote the psychological well-being of nonhuman primates in no uncertain terms,&#148; adds ALDF Executive Director Joyce Tischler. &#147;We think it&#146;s time for USDA to start living up to that obligation.&#148; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The suit was filed on behalf of ALDF, AWI and three individuals, all of whom have had regular contact with individual primates. The plaintiffs allege that inadequate housing is causing these animals severe psychological distress. For example, Chico &#151; an adult chimpanzee on display in a roadside tourist attraction &#151; sits alone in his enclosure with no other nonhuman primates in sight. His suffering has been observed first-hand by plaintiff Jane Garrison, who visits him frequently. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;His frustration is obvious,&#148; Garrison says. &#147;He sways back and forth, his head bobbing up and down. Other times he just paces for hours at a time.&#148; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to clinical veterinarian Viktor Reinhardt, Chico&#146;s behavior would come as no surprise to primate experts. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Any healthy primates are going to start acting this way if they&#146;re kept permanently in an environment that lacks species-appropriate stimulation. Primates need companionship, and they need to be in a space where they have opportunities to climb up to someplace safe&#148; says Reinhardt, who is AWI&#146;s laboratory animal advisor. &#147;A primate kept in a barren cage is literally a behavioral cripple.&#148; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Garrison says it doesn&#146;t take science to figure that out: All it takes is a little common sense. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Solitary confinement is the punishment we give the most hardened criminals in society,&#148; says Garrison, an expert on the care of exotic animals who has worked as a consultant for the Smithsonian Institution and the American Aquarium and Zoo Association. &#147;Yet Chico has done nothing wrong, and he&#146;s been sentenced to solitary confinement for life.&#148; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As AWI President Cathy Liss sees it, that wouldn&#146;t have happened if USDA had been doing its job as mandated by Congress through the Animal Welfare Act. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;After all these years, captive primates still don&#146;t have environments that meet their needs,&#148; Liss says. &#147;What&#146;s so odd is that USDA has already done so much work to figure out how to fix the problem. Why haven&#146;t they finished what they began? Thousands of primates could and should benefit from a new policy.&#148; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">That call for justice has been picked up by leading primate experts like Goodall and Dr. Roger Fouts, co-director of the Chimpanzee and Human Communication Institute and author of the groundbreaking book Next of Kin. According to USDA, nearly 100,000 nonhuman primates were held in captivity for research purposes in 2002. Hundreds more could be found at zoos and roadside tourist attractions. With that many animals unprotected, the experts say, USDA needs to start doing its job. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The USDA draft policy that appears to have been discarded would have been a major improvement for primates,&#148; Fouts says. &#147;To have discarded the policy at this point, following all the work that went into it, is at the least bizarre and from the animals&#146; standpoint, clearly tragic.&#148; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The majority of primates who are being used for experimentation are kept isolated in cages. Many primates at roadside zoos are also housed alone. This is enough to make them crazy,&#148; Goodall says. &#147;Nonhuman primates, such as chimpanzees, are highly social and intelligent beings. It is a crime to keep them in solitary confinement in small barren cages, often for the rest of their lives.&#148; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Animal Welfare Institute, founded in 1951, seeks to reduce the pain and fear inflicted on animals by people. The Institute has a long history of strong support for the chief federal law for protection of animals, the Animal Welfare Act.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Founded by attorneys active in shaping the emerging field of animal law, the Animal Legal Defense Fund has blazed the trail for stronger enforcement of anti-cruelty laws and more humane treatment of animals in every corner of American life.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The plaintiffs in the suit are being represented by Meyer &amp; Glitzenstein, a public interest law firm based in Washington, D.C., and Wendy Anderson, managing attorney of ALDF&#146;s D.C. litigation office.</font></p>
