- July 10 -  Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham has embarked on a multi-city

road show of photo-ops aimed at asking Americans to do their share to

conserve energy.  Back in Washington, however, the Bush Administration is

continuing to push policies that hamper efforts to improve energy

efficiency.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Conservation is an important step for consumers to take, but the

Administration also has a responsibility to generate an overall energy

policy that increases efficiency; produces clean, renewable power; and

stops wasting taxpayer money subsidizing dirty, dangerous polluters like

oil companies and coal and nuclear power plants.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;After Vice President Cheney pooh-poohed conservation as a 'personal

virtue', we're glad to see the Bush Administration giving it lip service,

but we'd rather see them proposing policies that actually provide a secure

energy future,&quot; said Debbie Boger, Sierra Club Energy Representative.&quot;American families know it's patriotic to conserve energy, and they want to

put energy-efficient technology to work to help their families save energy.

Rather than lecturing people, it's time for the Bush Administration to walk

the walk and start investing in energy-efficient technology and clean,

renewable power.  There's a better way to secure our energy future, and it

doesn't include wasting taxpayer dollars on subsidies to big, polluting

utilities.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to the Department of Energy's own numbers, if America produced 20

percent of our electricity from clean, renewable energy sources, like windand solar power by 2020, we would reduce natural gas consumption by 11

percent and reduce natural gas prices by 9 percent. Yet the Bush

Administration has opposed repeated efforts to include a Renewable Energy

Standard in the energy bill that would require utilities to produce up to

20 percent of their electricity from renewable energy by 2020.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Unfortunately, the Bush Administration's policy record on energy

consumption is poor.  It has already weakened existing energy efficiency

standards for air conditioners and cut funding for energy efficiency

research and development and other programs.  On May 27, Secretary Abraham

announced that efficiency standards for gas-fired residential furnaces,

boilers, and mobile home furnaces have been downgraded from high priority

to low, meaning it is unlikely to be completed by year's end.  In addition,the Bush Administration has proposed a 30 percent cut in EPA's

highly-regarded Energy Star program, which helps consumers identify the

most energy-efficient products available.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Administration's energy bill provides nearly $10.7 billion in tax

breaks to polluters, including a first-ever tax break for burning coal.  In

addition, the bill provides tens of billions of dollars in loan guarantees

to build new nuclear plants and indefinitely exempts the nuclear industry

from liability.  The bill also allows the oil and gas industry to stop or

reduce royalty payments to the government and states at a time when they

are in a fiscal crisis.</font></p>
