<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;It&#146;s more clear than ever that a handful of big corporations with close ties to the Bush Administration are making hundreds of millions of dollars off the death and destruction of war, all at taxpayer expense,&#148; says Rania Masri, a program director at the non-profit Institute for Southern Studies and co-director of the Campaign. &#147;That&#146;s war profiteering, and it needs to stop.&#148; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Campaign, launched by the Institute earlier this month, has quickly galvanized veteran, peace, and other public interest groups across the country. Veterans for Peace, New York Labor Against the War, Peace Action, and other leading organizations have signed on to the campaign, as well as national progressive luminaries Noam Chomsky, Bill Fletcher, Jim Hightower, Naomi Klein, and Howard Zinn.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Yesterday&#146;s reports concerning Halliburton (Washington Post) and Bechtel (Wall Street Journal) revealed vital new information about the scope of insider deals and war profiteering, including:</font></p>

<ul>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Washington Post reports that &#147;As much as one-third of the monthly $3.9 billion cost of keeping U.S. troops in Iraq&#148; is being handed out to for-profit, big business contractors, led by Halliburton and Bechtel &#150; both major contributors to and allies of the Bush Administration.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Halliburton, including its subsidiary Brown and Root, has been handed &#147;contracts worth more than $1.7 billion &#133; and stands to make hundreds of millions more,&#148; mostly under contracts in which other companies were not allowed to bid. At least one contract had &#147;not previously publicly acknowledged&#148; by the Pentagon. (Washington Post)</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to the Wall Street Journal, Bechtel&#146;s Iraq contract was increased by $350 million &#150; &#147;more than 50%&#148; &#150; on top of the $680 million already given to the company in a &#147;secret, no-bid contract.&#148; Bechtel has former board members, former and current VPs and Presidents, the current CEO, and &#147;friends&#148; with seats in the President&#146;s Export Council, the Defense Policy Board, Committee for the Liberation of Iraq, USAID, the CIA, and several other government agencies.</font></li>

</ul>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Ever since Halliburton received a secret, unlimited contract for logistical support operations in 2001 for the &#145;war on terror,&#146; it&#146;s been clear that Bush-connected corporations have had an inside track,&#148; said Chris Kromm, director of the Institute and a coordinator with the campaign. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;When Halliburton reports that the company&#146;s profits jumped $26 million in the second quarter of 2003 while the rest of the economy is stalling, it&#146;s also clear they&#146;re making a killing off the business of war,&#148; Kromm added.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Campaign organizers say the recent revelations of war profiteering add urgency to demands the Campaign set our earlier this month, including:</font></p>

<ul>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CONGRESSIONAL HEARINGS ON WAR PROFITEERING: Congress should convene hearings immediately to investigate the scope of war profiteering, modeled on hearings in the 1930s by Sen. Gerald Nye or during World War II by Sen. Harry Truman.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">STOP CONFLICTS OF INTEREST AND &#147;DIRTY&#148; CONTRACTS: As part of its investigation, Congress should examine and implement measures against conflicts of interest between companies receiving contracts and Administration leaders. Contracts should also only go to companies with clean business records &#150; unlike Halliburton, which is under SEC investigation for financial scandals, has been accused of running up $2.2 billion in over-charges for previous contracts, and has yet to explain its business dealings in Iraq during the 1990s, when the country was supposedly under sanctions.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">REIGN IN PROFITEERING THROUGH AN &#147;EXCESS PROFITS TAX&#148;: As contractors rake in billions of dollars in profits from military contracts &#150; such as the $490 million in taxpayer-funded profits promised to Halliburton in just one contract &#150; the Campaign demands that Congress reinstate the &#147;Excess Profits Tax.&#148; Such taxes to stop undue profiting from military contracts were levied during the Civil War, both World Wars, and the Korean War.</font></li>

</ul>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Tara Purohit, an Institute associate working on the campaign, noted that during World War II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt said &#147;I don&#146;t want to see a single war millionaire created in the United States as a result of this disaster,&#148; and then-Senator Harry Truman denounced war profiteering as &#147;treason.&#148; Earlier in the century, Sen. Robert LaFollette called war profiteers &#147;enemies of democracy in the homeland.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Our country has a proud history of leaders who have stood up to the war profiteers,&#148; said Purohit. &#147;Now it&#146;s time for today&#146;s leaders to stand up to the new merchants of misery and corporate war looters.&#148;</font></p>
