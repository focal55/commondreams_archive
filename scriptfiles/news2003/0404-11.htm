                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NEW YORK 

                  - April 4 - In two separate incidents last week, dozens of Iraqis 

                  were killed by what eyewitness survivors claim were U.S. airstrikes. 

                  U.S. officials, however, offered a range of denials and evasions 

                  about what may have caused the explosions. Despite evidence 

                  uncovered by one British newspaper about the second (and more 

                  deadly) of the incidents, however, most U.S. media outlets have 

                  allowed the story to end with the official denials.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On March 

                  28, in an open-air market in the Shuala section of Baghdad, 

                  over 60 people were reportedly killed in what seemed to be a 

                  missile attack-- the Los Angeles Times (3/29/03), for example, 

                  reported matter-of-factly that &quot;a missile slammed into 

                  a crowded market area.&quot; But as with an earlier explosion 

                  on March 26, the New York Times' John F. Burns reported (3/29/03) 

                  that &quot;it was impossible to determine the cause,&quot; adding 

                  that &quot;a Central Command spokesman in Qatar said Friday 

                  night that the United States could not tell what caused the 

                  bombing on Friday.&quot; Burns suggested that these incidents 

                  &quot;threaten to become yet another major problem for the Bush 

                  administration.&quot;</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The PR angle 

                  was also highlighted on the CBS Evening News after the earlier 

                  explosion (3/26/03), with anchor Dan Rather noting that &quot;scenes 

                  of civilian carnage in Baghdad, however they happened and whoever 

                  caused them, today quickly became part of a propaganda war, 

                  the very thing U.S. military planners have tried to avoid.&quot; 

                  (Of course, the extensive preparations the Pentagon made for 

                  communicating to the press before the war indicate that it was 

                  not hoping to &quot;avoid&quot; a propaganda war-- but to win 

                  one.)</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While one 

                  might hope that reporters would be interested in uncovering 

                  the cause of more than 60 civilian deaths, U.S. media have so 

                  far made little effort to investigate the Shuala incident. One 

                  British reporter on the scene, however, found evidence that 

                  appears to shed light on the origin of the devastation.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On March 

                  30, Robert Fisk reported in the London Independent that what 

                  appeared to be a missile fragment was found on the scene of 

                  the explosion-- and that it bore a visible serial number, which 

                  Fisk published. In a follow-up report on April 2, the Independent's 

                  Cahal Milmo reported that the serial number could be traced 

                  back to the Raytheon Corporation, and that the weapon was &quot;thought 

                  to be either a HARM anti-radar missile or a Paveway laser-guided 

                  bomb.&quot; The Independent continues: &quot;The American military 

                  has confirmed that a navy EA-6B 'Prowler' jet, based on the 

                  U.S.S. Kitty Hawk, was in action over the Iraqi capital on Friday 

                  and fired at least one HARM missile to protect two American 

                  fighters from a surface-to-air missile battery.&quot;</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some media 

                  accounts have pointed to the relatively small crater created 

                  by the explosion at Shuala as an indication that a U.S. cruise 

                  missile was not responsible. But cruise missiles are not the 

                  only weapons being launched from U.S. planes in Iraq. The Independent 

                  reported that, according to experts, &quot;the damage caused 

                  at Shuala was consistent with that of Paveway or, more probably, 

                  a HARM weapon,&quot; which are smaller than cruise missiles.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So far, 

                  according to a search of the Nexis database, no major U.S. news 

                  outlet has picked up this new information; instead, reporters 

                  have continued to relay U.S. officials' denials of any knowledge 

                  about the Shuala blast. The New York Times' Burns (4/4/03) questioned 

                  why the Iraqis have not been able to explain the incident: &quot;Often, 

                  as in Shuala, officials have delayed taking reporters to the 

                  site for hours, and have met with evasions the inquiries about 

                  the unusually small crater at the marketplace, and the fact 

                  that most victims appeared to have died from shrapnel wounds 

                  and not from the kind of blast associated with high-energy bombs 

                  and missiles.&quot;</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On NPR's 

                  Talk of the Nation (4/2/03), the question of civilian casualties 

                  was discussed by host Neal Conan with guests Michael O'Hanlon 

                  of the Brookings Institution and retired Marine Col. Gary Anderson. 

                  In response to a caller's question, Conan explained that U.S. 

                  military officials still could not find any evidence that the 

                  first bombing was caused by a U.S. weapon.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">O'Hanlon 

                  then explained that an investigation into these cases would 

                  involve answering three questions: verifying where you were 

                  shooting, and tracking &quot;how many of the bombs or cruise 

                  missiles that you fired reached their proper targets&quot;; 

                  looking for bomb fragments; and, finally, judging the size of 

                  the crater left by the explosion, &quot;whether it's consistent 

                  with the size of the explosive charge that was on the warhead 

                  in question, possibly even the shape of the crater and things 

                  like that.&quot;</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Interestingly, 

                  the report in the Independent provides what could be answers 

                  to all of those questions. But Conan summed up the matter this 

                  way: &quot;There were other attacks, though, and as so far, 

                  the investigations by the U.S. military... are not complete, 

                  and again, as Michael O'Hanlon knows, it may be some time, if 

                  ever, before we actually know what happened there.&quot;</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NPR's listeners 

                  might have been interested to know that more information was 

                  available-- even though it wasn't part of an investigation by 

                  the U.S. military.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ACTION: 

                  Encourage NPR's Talk of the Nation and the New York Times to 

                  continue to investigate what caused the March 28 explosion in 

                  Baghdad that killed dozens of Iraqi civilians. You might suggest 

                  that they interview reporters from the Independent who have 

                  pursued the story.</font></p>
