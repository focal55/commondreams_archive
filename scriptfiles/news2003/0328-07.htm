                - March 28 - Florida's office of the Washington-based Council 

                on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR-FL) today called on Attorney 

                General Charlie Crist to apply the full weight of the law to three 

                men accused of harassing a Muslim woman. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The harassment 

                allegedly occurred March 6 as the woman, who was wearing an Islamic 

                head scarf, drove her car along a Pinellas County highway. According 

                to the victim, a native of Guyana who is a U.S. citizen, the men 

                repeatedly leaned out of their van's windows and shouted "terrorist" 

                as the vehicle changed lanes several time in an intimidating manner. 

                One of the perpetrators allegedly threw an object at the women's 

                car. A juvenile was arrested and charged with "throwing a deadly 

                missile into an occupied vehicle," (Case No. CRC0301979DL) but 

                the driver and the other passenger were apparently not taken into 

                custody. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Without a 

                strong statement from the attorney general's office, followed 

                by equally strong action, we are concerned that such incidents 

                will not be treated with the seriousness they deserve. It is time 

                that all community leaders work to end hate crimes," said CAIR-FL 

                Executive Director Altaf Ali. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A number of 

                anti-Muslim incidents have been reported recently across the United 

                States. CAIR attributes these incidents to pro-war rhetoric, coupled 

                with existing levels of anti-Muslim bias in American society.

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On Monday, 

                an Indianapolis, Ind., Muslim suffered burns over 60 percent of 

                his body in what may have been a bias-related attack. Last Saturday, 

                an explosive device destroyed an Illinois Muslim family's van. 

                In other Illinois incidents, an Evanston resident received a mailed 

                death threat, a Glendale Heights Islamic center received a phoned 

                bomb threat and projectiles were fired at a mosque in Villa Park.

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In California, 

                four Muslim women visiting a restaurant were verbally assaulted 

                by another patron. Death threats were made against Muslim students 

                at San Jose State University in Northern California. In Michigan, 

                a Muslim father and son report that they were refused service 

                at a store. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Physical assaults 

                against Muslims have been reported in Northern California, Southern 

                California, Georgia, New Jersey, and South Carolina. One incident 

                in Yorba Linda, Calif., left a Muslim teenager badly beaten by 

                a group that allegedly included white supremacists. </font>

                largest Islamic civil liberties group. It is headquartered in
