- July 16 - While today the EPA holds a press briefing touting the accomplishments of its enforcement program, yesterday a Bush Administration proposal to cut the Environmental Protection Agency's enforcement budget moved forward in the House.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;How can the Bush Administration take credit for an enforcement program they want weakened?&quot; asked Nat Mund of Sierra Club's Environmental Quality Program.  &quot;They're taking the environmental cop off the beat. The Bush Administration doesn't deserve credit for enforcing environmental laws they want to weaken with a program they want to cut. While using one side of their mouth to claim they're cracking down on polluters, the Bush Administration is using the other side to let polluters off the hook, threatening our families' clean air and safe drinking water.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to an EPA news advisory, today EPA Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance Assistant Administrator J.P. Suarez &quot;will discuss accomplishments and plans for continuous improvement in the agency's criminal enforcement program.&quot;  At the same time, EPA's civil and criminal enforcement programs are in serious danger of staffing cuts in the VA/HUD Appropriations bill, which includes EPA's budget.  The bill was marked up yesterday in the House Subcommittee on VA, HUD, and Independent Agencies.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Bush Administration's proposed budget would cut 54 enforcement positions from the EPA's budget compared to last year's spending, down 126 positions from 2001 spending.  Although states have a principal role in enforcing some federal environmental laws, federal enforcement capability is essential to protecting communities from pollution. The federal government is often better suited than states to take enforcement actions against large corporations conducting business in many states.  The threat of federal enforcement is a vital safety net for communities.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Americans want tough enforcement of the laws protecting our air and water, but the Bush Administration is letting polluters get away red-handed,&quot; Mund said.  &quot;Strong enforcement of environmental laws is the reason our air and water are cleaner than they were 30 years ago. That kind of progress won't continue under the Bush Administration's plan to cut enforcement funding.</font></p>
