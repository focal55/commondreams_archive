-  
November 6 - Congress is poised to gut key wildlife laws in the next few days, including the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) and the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Using the National Defense Authorization Bill, a must-pass funding bill for the Pentagon, a House/Senate Conference Committee has reportedly adopted anti-environmental amendments to the MMPA and ESA as riders, pushed by the Bush Administration.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Voting on the package is scheduled on the House Floor as soon as tomorrow and will likely be before the Senate early next week.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This is the most egregious assault on wildlife laws in this country,&quot; stated David Phillips, Director of Earth Island Institute. &quot;These amendments will roll back 30 years of progress in federal protection of whales, seals, dolphins, and endangered species.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Congress and Bush Administration should be ashamed of themselves,&quot; added Phillips.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to information from the Conference Committee, the new amendments would:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Allow Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld to exempt ANY ACTIVITY of the military from the MMPA, regardless of the impact on whales, seals, and dolphins.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Weaken the MMPA definition of &quot;harassment&quot; of marine mammals for the military, making enforcement of the MMPA virtually impossible.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Extend exemptions to scientists working on federal research, essentially eliminating any restrictions on harm to whales, seals and dolphins from such research sponsored by the Navy and other federal agencies.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Eliminate language in the MMPA designed to protect marine mammals with permit conditions, undoing a number of recent key lawsuits brought by environmentalists to protect whales and dolphins from intense Navy sonars, invasive research, and other future activities, such as bombing in whale habitat.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Exempt U.S. military bases and lands from ESA language that protects endangered wildlife habitat, effectively removing any incentives to preserve millions of acres of wildlands under military use that are critical to preventing the extinction of myriad species.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Bush Administration is using the Defense Authorization Bill to gut these environmental laws in order to keep the issues out of sight of the public behind the closed doors of the Republican Congress,&quot; explained David Phillips. &quot;The Bush Administration and the Pentagon know that the public would never stand for these exemptions in the light of day. The Defense Bill cannot be filibustered and includes important defense spending budgets for the Pentagon, so any members of Congress who speak out will be branded as unpatriotic. This process stinks to high heaven.&quot;
