<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - April 30 - People For the American Way is urging the U.S. House of Representatives to reject private-school voucher amendments that would seriously tarnish the landmark Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).  Debate on the IDEA reauthorization bill, H.R. 1350, begins today, and votes on expected amendments, including one creating a private school voucher provision, are expected today or Thursday.  Florida's McKay disability voucher program is the model for at least one of the voucher amendments.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Supporters of any voucher amendment are inviting children with disabilities and their parents into a risky and unpredictable world,&quot; said PFAW president Ralph G. Neas.  &quot;We know from Florida's experience that these types of voucher schemes jeopardizes the educational needs of children.  These amendments jeopardize the more than a quarter-century of progress that IDEA has provided.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Florida's McKay disability voucher program offers powerful evidence of the dangers inherent in diverting public dollars to private schools, especially for students with disabilities.  PFAW Foundation and the Disability Rights and Education Defense Fund recently released a report on McKay raising serious concerns about financial abuse and the law's adverse impact on parent's rights, the quality of special education services and public schools' funding.  The report, Jeopardizing a Legacy, is available at: <a href="http://www.pfaw.org/pfaw/general/default.aspx?oid=9063" target="_new">http://www.pfaw.org/pfaw/general/default.aspx?oid=9063</a></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The sponsors of these voucher amendments are trying to clone Florida's McKay program,&quot; said Neas.  &quot;If successful, they will have produced a flawed voucher program that is not accountable to parents, taxpayers or students. Parents must be cautious.  Under a disability voucher program of this type, parents sacrifice key rights, legal protections, and services normally guaranteed under IDEA.  Parents have almost nowhere to turn if a private school fails to deliver on its promises.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Also troubling is that vouchers may be a convenient vehicle for cutting IDEA funding and weakening the law's commitment to children.  A few years ago, an article published by the Heritage Foundation expressed hope that &quot;vouchers could limit how much taxpayers must pay to educate the disabled and begin a movement toward cost containment.&quot;  In 1999, when Mike Petrilli, a spokesman for the Fordham Foundation, was asked to describe what a voucher system for special education students would look like, he described a system that &quot;would probably end up looking like a managed health-care plan where an HMO decides how much to pay for each procedure.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Parents should also be wary of the extra costs associated with accepting a voucher.  For example, under the McKay program, eight out of ten families must take on additional out-of-pocket, private school costs that their voucher does not cover.  Similarly, the expected voucher amendments compromise the promise IDEA was originally passed to keep -- that every child receive a &quot;free appropriate public education.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Unlike public schools, private schools accepting disability vouchers would not required to comply with open records laws, make public their budget and finances, or report school achievement data,&quot; said Nancy Keenan, PFAW education policy director.  &quot;Currently under IDEA, public schools must develop an education plan for each student.  Private schools would be under no such requirement.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;IDEA set forth a commitment to serve all children - a commitment that the proposed amendments turns their back on,&quot; added Keenan.</font></p>
