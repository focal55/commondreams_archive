<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NORTHAMPTON, MA - July 8 - National media reform group Free Press announced the 

launch of a Congressional Call-in Campaign today urging members of both 

chambers to support a rollback of media ownership rule changes passed by the FCC on June 2.

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Over one million people commented to the FCC, and they spoke with one 

voice: do not loosen media ownership rules,&quot; said Josh Silver, Free 

Press Managing Director. &quot;This campaign is designed to deliver that 

message to Congress loud and clear.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The campaign allows citizens from across the country to enter their zipcode on the website  and receive talking points and phone numbers 

for their elected officials. Free Press urges everyone to participate 

by visiting <a href="http://www.mediareform.net/stopthefcc" target="_new">www.mediareform.net/stopthefcc</a>.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;For far too long, the FCC has only thought of the American public as 

consumers, and not citizens,&quot; said Free Press co-founder Robert 

McChesney. &quot;The time is now for Congress to pick up the FCC's slack, 

listen to the people and vote for media diversity. Only with a media 

system that supports diverse media ownership can we have a functioning democracy.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Congressional Call-In Campaign focuses on several bills dealing 

with the FCC rule changes:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Senate Bill 1046, the &quot;Preservation of Localism, Program Diversity, 

and Competition in Television Broadcast Act of 2003.&quot;  This bill would 

preserve the rule that restricts one company to owning television 

stations that reach no more than 35 percent of U.S. TV households as 

well as the rule preventing one company from owning a broadcast station and a newspaper in the same market or a radio station and TV station in 

the same market.         S 1046 would also require the FCC to hold at least 

five geographically diverse formal public hearings the next time an 

ownership rule change comes up for consideration.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">S 1046 was passed out of the Senate Commerce Committee on June 19 (read 

the <a href="http://www.mediareform.net/news.php?id=364" target="_new">Free Press release</a>); 

the campaign will put public pressure on Senators, particularly Senate 

Majority Leader Bill Frist, to have the bill brought for a full vote 

before the Senate.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* HR 2462, sponsored by Rep. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), rolls back all of the June 2nd rules, and HR 2052, sponsored by Reps. Richard Burr (R-NC) 

and John D. Dingell (D-MI), reverses the national audience cap rule 

from 45% of households back down to 35%. Call-in campaign participants 

are encouraged to phone Rep. Billy Tauzin (R-LA) in addition to their 

own Representatives, due to his stated opposition to media reform and 

key role as chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.</font></p>
