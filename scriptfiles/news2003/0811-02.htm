<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Network Director of South Carolina Progressive Network, Brett Bursey faces federal charges for threatening the president with a &quot;No War for Oil&quot; sign at a Republican rally last October. Bursey was originally arrested for refusing to go to the &quot;free speech zone&quot; and charged with trespassing. Five months after the arrest, the state dropped the charges and the US Justice Department brought charges under the &#147;threatening the president&#148; statute. Bursey faces prison and fines if convicted.</font></p>
