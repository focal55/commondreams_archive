<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 
- November 5 - Today, the House's most outspoken opponents of media  consolidation took a major step forward in their fight against the  FCC's new media regulations. A bipartisan group of House members  delivered a letter to Speaker of the House, J. Dennis Hastert (R-IL),  signed by 205 House Members, including 11 Republicans demanding a 
House vote on the &quot;resolution of disapproval&quot; passed by the Senate on 
 September 16th.  This measure would nullify the Federal Communications 
 Commission's media ownership rule changes that (if allowed to stand) 
would permit dramatic economic consolidation in the media system.  The 
 Senate resolution was passed by a wide, bipartisan, 55-40 margin and 
was perceived as a fierce rebuke of Chairman Michael K. Powell's FCC.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

The letter to the Speaker, co-authored by Rep. Bernie Sanders (I-VT),  
 Rep. Maurice Hinchey (D-NY), Rep. Jim Leach (R-IA), Rep. David Price 
(D-NC), Rep. Dan Burton (R-IN), and Rep. Edward Markey (D-MA), has set 
a new highwater mark of support for media reform in the House.  Under 
 the rules of the CRA, the Senate resolution is not referred to a House 
committee, but sits at the Speaker's desk until he brings it to the 
 floor.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

Rep. Sanders said, &quot;There is simply no defense for allowing fewer and 
fewer massive corporations to control more and more of our media 
channels. If the FCC decision stands, we can expect lower standards, 
less attention to local interests and talent, and a general decline in 
the variety of public voices we hear, see, and read.  We believe we 
have the votes to pass this resolution.  This letter demonstrates that 
the conventional wisdom that the House would function as a roadblock 
for this popular measure has been utterly shattered. It's a simple 
 message here, give us a vote. Anything less would be an unconscionable 
betrayal of public opinion and the democratic process.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

 Rep. Hinchey said, &quot;Newspapers and radio and television stations are 
the main vehicles for public discussion of important issues. When a 
 handful of corporations control the great majority of those media 
outlets, we lose a fundamental component of our democracy and cripple 
the public's ability to make informed decisions on matters that affect 
their everyday lives. I believe that the FCC rule changes lead us 
 further down this treacherous path. Judging by the number of my 
colleagues who have signed this letter to Speaker Hastert asking for a 
vote on the Senate resolution, it's clear I'm not the only one. I 
earnestly hope the speaker will recognize the wishes of so many 
members of the House and give us the opportunity to vote on this vital 
issue.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

 Rep. Leach said, &quot;American history, indeed American political 
philosophy, is rooted in the encouragement of disparate expression and 
competition of ideas. Diversity of views are stifled if diversity of 
information sources is concentrated.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

 Rep. Ed Markey (D-MA), ranking member of the House Subcommittee on 
Telecommunications and Internet said, &quot;It's time to allow the House of 
Representatives to have a full debate and a vote on the FCC decision. 
 The FCC mass media decision permits a single company to jointly own 3 
 over-the-air television stations, the city's cable system, the daily 
 newspaper, and 8 radio stations. This level of concentration is 
ludicrous, unjustifiable, and will make Citizen Kane look like an 
 underachiever.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;There's only one reason the Speaker is reluctant to bring this 
legislation to the Floor for a full and fair vote: it has the 
 bipartisan support to win,&quot; said Price.  &quot;The American people want to 
be heard on this issue, and so do we.  Across the political spectrum 
 -- from Common Cause to the NRA -- organizations, lawmakers, and 
everyday Americans are saying they want localism, competition, and 
diversity in their media.  It's high time the powers-that-be started 
 listening.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

The public has shown overwhelming support for reducing media 
 concentration and protecting diversity, localism, and the public 
interest.  The Senate has voted to support the people.  The House, 
 long thought the missing piece that would doom reform, is now stepping 
up to the challenge. It remains to be seen if the Speaker of the House 
will grant a vote, given the vocal opposition of Congressional 
Republican Leadership and the White House.
