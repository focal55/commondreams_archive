- December 5 - Today&#146;s dip in the nation&#146;s unemployment rate does not erase the hard reality faced by too many working families. Millions of American workers still do not have jobs, and our nation has lost more jobs under the Bush Administration than under any president since Hoover. </FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Fifteen million people are now unemployed and underemployed. There are three jobless workers for every job opening and the number of long-term unemployed has stood at more than two million for the past three months, its highest level since the recession began. The 57,000 jobs added to the economy last month fall far short of the 306,000 per month needed to fulfill the job growth promises used to sell the Bush tax cuts. Millions more jobs are needed before our nation climbs out of the giant job deficit created under the Bush Administration&#146;s watch. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The industrial heartland lost 17,000 manufacturing jobs last month &#150; solid middle-class jobs that too often are replaced with low-paying jobs that are indicative of the new &#147;Wal-Mart economy.&#148; Furthermore, the Administration continues to wage a vicious assault on overtime protection for millions of workers in an attempt to undermine the 40-hour workweek. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Congress should grant a much-needed unemployment benefit extension this holiday season. Since the temporary extension of the unemployment benefits program began, more than four million unemployed workers have run out of their limited federal UI benefits. Starting December 21st about 90,000 workers a week will lose their state unemployment benefits. Unless Congress and the Administration act to extend benefits for at least another 26 weeks, more than two million workers will run out of benefits by the middle of 2004. A 13-week extension is not good enough. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">America&#146;s workers understand what economists confirm: the jobs crisis is bigger than one bad economic cycle. It represents a convergence of economic and political forces that are reshaping this country. Many of the jobs that have been lost are not coming back, and our nation&#146;s middle class is being chipped away. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">We cannot celebrate a slight dip in the unemployment rate when millions of people stand to lose unemployment benefits, and when millions of Americans are still out of work. </FONT></P><P></P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p></font><!-- #EndEditable --></td></tr>
