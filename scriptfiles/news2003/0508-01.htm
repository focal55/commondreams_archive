- May 8 - The League of Women Voters 

of the United States (LWVUS) and Capitol Advantage LLC today joined 

forces to bring citizens one of the most comprehensive and 

nonpartisan online election and campaign information services. A 

unique pair, the League, a nonprofit organization founded by women 

suffragists, and Capitol Advantage, a pioneer in bringing civic 

information to the marketplace, is bonded by their commitment to 

educate and inform citizens. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We are excited to embark on this new venture with Capitol 

Advantage, a firm dedicated to many of the same principles as the 

League -- voter education and civic participation,&quot; stated Kay J. 

Maxwell, president, League of Women Voters of the United States. &quot;As a trusted source of nonpartisan election information for over 

80 years, the League is thrilled to enhance the information we 

provide to citizens through our partnership with Capitol 

Advantage,&quot; Maxwell noted. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The new partnership includes broad distribution of content from 

the League's DemocracyNet (DNet; <a href="http://www.dnet.org" target="_new">http://www.dnet.org</a>) Web site. The award-winning DNet is a nonpartisan, interactive resource for 

election and voting information. Capitol Advantage, a respected 

nonpartisan aggregator of content on federal and state elections, 

has a distribution network that includes many of the Internet's 

largest media properties. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DNet, which will now be housed under the Congress.org site, 

brings a breadth and depth of candidate and election information to 

the merger. Launched nationally in 2000, DNet allows participating 

candidates for federal, state and local offices to provide all 

their own issue and biographical information. Through DNet, 

candidates are able to &quot;speak&quot; directly to voters and voters are 

able to get candidate positions straight from the candidates 

themselves. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This partnership will make it easier for voters to not only 

identify candidates for office, but also to make informed choices,&quot; 

said Bob Hansan, president of Capitol Advantage, &quot;and we're very 

pleased to have such a strong and like-minded partner in the League 

of Women Voters. DNet's extraordinary content will now have the 

widest possible exposure,&quot; Hansan added, &quot;both on Congress.org and 

via our Media Network, which includes AOL(r), MSN(r), Yahoo!(r), 

USA Today(r), C-SPAN(r), The New York Times, Los Angeles Times, and 

more than 100 other media portals.&quot; </font></p>
