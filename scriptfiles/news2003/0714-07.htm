A delegation will also try to meet with consulate staff to deliver letters demanding Bove's release and requesting additional information about Bove. 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jose Bove, a family farmer and best-selling author in France, is a global leader of movements to save family farms, to oppose genetically engineered foods, and to roll back corporate monopoly and globalization of the food system. He is also a leader of the international farmers' movement Via Campesina (http://www.viacampesnia.org), which represents more than 100 million farmers, indigenous people and landless peasants world wide. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On Sunday, June 22nd, heavily armed French police forced their way into the home of Bove, tied him up and flew him by helicopter to the nearby Villeneuve-les-Maguelone prison to serve out a 10-month sentence for his protests against biotech crops and foods. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bove, who lives near the village of Millau in southern France, is being held in complete isolation, allowed only a half-hour exercise break per day, and only two brief meetings per week with his lawyers. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The <a href="http://www.nffc.net" target="_new">National Family Farm Coalition</a>, the U.S. representative of Via Campesina, is calling for this protest together with the Bay Area food policy think-tank <a href="http://www.foodfirst.org" target="_new">Food First/The Institute for Food and Development Policy</a>. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Jose Bove is a prisoner of conscience,&quot; said Dr. Peter Rosset, co-director of Food First. &quot;He speaks for people everywhere in his concern over the genetic engineering of our food supply. He speaks for family farmers everywhere in his concern over the policies that drive them off the land. Jose Bove speaks for all of us, and we demand his immediate and unconditional release.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This is part of the on-going criminalization of dissent around the world, a process being led by the Bush Administration,&quot; said Anuradha Mittal, also co-director of Food First. &quot;Jose Bove has been jailed for political reasons-to appease the United States on genetically engineered food, and to send a message to activists and farmers everywhere that dissent will no longer be tolerated. The message we send back is that his jailing is unjust and we demand his immediate release.&quot; </font></p>
