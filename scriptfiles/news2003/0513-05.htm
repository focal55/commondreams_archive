<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Arizona Kicks Off National Seat Belt Crackdown with TV Ads, 

Awards to Law Enforcement Agencies 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Aim is to Surround Young Drivers With a Strong Safety Belt 

Enforcement Message 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This Memorial Day in Arizona and across the country, teenagers 

and young adults will be surrounded with the strong message, 

"Buckle Up, Arizona-No Excuses; If you won't buckle up to save your 

life, then buckle up to save yourself a ticket." More than 100 

police and sheriffs' departments across Arizona will be 

participating in the Buckle Up, No Excuses education and 

enforcement campaign. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Arizona is part of a nationwide seat belt crackdown, deploying 

more than 12,000 law enforcement agencies from all 50 states, D.C., 

and Puerto Rico. The campaign is supported by nearly $10 million in 

targeted national advertising, including $200,000 in Arizona alone. 

The advertising to support enforcement is based on a proven public 

health model to increase belt use called "high visibility 

enforcement." 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Arizona State Capitol will host the kickoff for the two-week 

Buckle Up, No Excuses enforcement wave, which runs from May 19 

through June 1. At the kickoff, the Governor's Office of Highway 

Safety will also honor law enforcement agencies and officers from 

across the state for their efforts during the 2001-2002 seat belt 

enforcement campaigns 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 2001, 5,341 teens, ages 16-20, died and thousands more were 

injured in traffic crashes nationwide. Fatality rates for teens are 

twice that of older drivers and the risk of crashes for teens is 

four times that of older drivers.
