- April 15 - Americans United for Separation of Church and State has renewed its call for U.S. Education Secretary Rod Paige to resign in light of Paige&#8217;s ongoing refusal to repudiate his belief that public schools should promote Christianity.

    </font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the latest twist to a continuing controversy, the Baptist Press has issued a full transcript of Paige&#8217;s interview with reporter Todd Starnes. The interview generated controversy last week when it was reported that Paige revealed a preference for Christian education over public schools and stated that public schools are at a disadvantage because they must teach &#8220;many different kids&#8221; who may hold various religious beliefs.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Americans United, which had quickly called for Paige to either repudiate the comments or resign his post, said the full transcript puts Paige in an even worse light.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In an April 14 letter to Paige, AU Executive Director Barry W. Lynn said that release of the entire interview only confirms AU&#8217;s belief that Paige is not fit to preside over the operation of a public school system that serves 90 percent of America&#8217;s children.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;I find your full comments about religion and public education to be all the more troubling,&#8221; Lynn wrote. &#8220;It is apparent to me, after reading this transcript, that you do not appreciate religious diversity in America or the application of church-state separation to public schools. Since you are unable to endorse these important features of American life, I urge you to step down as Secretary of Education.&#8221;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lynn said he was especially troubled because the full transcript of the secretary&#8217;s interview with Baptist Press reveals Paige blithely accepting inflammatory and bogus Religious Right attacks on public education, as well as endorsing the idea that public schools should inculcate religious values.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the interview, Paige agreed with Starnes&#8217; assertion that &#8220;there&#8217;s such animosity towards religion and God in general in the schools and educational system.&#8221; Paige replied, &#8220;It&#8217;s a real puzzle to me. My upbringing just shields me from even thinking that way, so I can&#8217;t imagine why, what&#8217;s at the root of that.&#8221;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Elsewhere in the interview, when asked by Starnes if public schools should embrace religious values, Paige responded, &#8220;Absolutely. I think that religious values are wonderful values that we should embrace in our daily lives wherever we are&#8230;.&#8221;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lynn said these remarks indicate that Paige is out of touch with public education.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;You seem to take it as a given that public schools are hostile to religion,&#8221; observed the Lynn letter. &#8220;Religious Right groups frequently make this assertion, but it is little more than propaganda intended to smear public education. Most public school administrators and teachers understand it is not their job to inculcate religion. At the same time, they permit truly voluntary forms of individual religious expression.&#8221;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lynn concluded the letter by noting that Paige at first refused to repudiate his comments -- and indeed endorsed them -- and now appears to be shifting the blame to the Baptist Press reporter (who was fired over the incident).</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;Despite your protestations to the contrary, it is obvious to me, Dr. Paige, that you do not value church-state separation and religious diversity in America&#8217;s public schools,&#8221; Lynn&#8217;s letter reads. &#8220;I believe this makes you unsuitable for the public trust you have been given. I urge you to please resign your post.&#8221;</font></p>
