Milk's death and that of Mayor George Moscone at the hands of a fellow city official has long been recognized as a galvanizing point in the Gay Rights movement.  </font>

Square.   Other major 25th anniversaries taking place in 2003 will also be

recognized.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;There is no one in the LGBT community whose leadership was more vital and whose memory is more dear to us than that of Harvey Milk,&quot; said Rev. Dr. Penny Nixon, Metropolitan Community Foundation president from her office just blocks away from the site of Milk's Castro Street camera shop.  &quot;We are proud to honor him on the 25th anniversary of his death, and we are delighted that our entire community will come together on this occasion to acknowledge the many silver anniversaries of key events in 1978, a very seminal year of our community.&quot;</font></p>

The award to Milk will be accepted by a committee of his colleagues and associates and will be held and displayed by the International Museum of GLBT History located in San Francisco.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A native of the New York City area, Harvey Milk became the first openly gay elected official in the US in 1977 with his election to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors.  Having entered the Navy shortly after completing college in 1951, Milk advanced to the rank of chief petty officer aboard the U.S.S. Kittyhawk only to receive a dishonorable discharge when his homosexuality was discovered.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Arriving in San Francisco's Castro District in 1972, he opened a camera shop which became a center of political organizing.  After only eleven months in office, Milk was murdered by Dan White who had resigned his post on the Board of Supervisors following the enactment of the Gay Civil Rights bill which he opposed.  Milk's life has inspired gay rights marches attended by hundreds of thousands in Washington, DC; San Francisco and other cities. Numerous award-winning literacy and artistic works have also addressed his life and legacy, including Randy Shilts' The Mayor of Castro Street: The Life and Times of Harvey Milk.</font></p>
