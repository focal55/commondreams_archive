- November 14 - As the U.S. Senate ended its marathon debate over judicial nominees, 
Ralph G. Neas, President of People For the American Way, had the following statement:</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The 
Republican strategy backfired. They wanted sympathy, but their theatrics generated 
only ridicule. They wanted to demoralize the Democrats, but in the end they energized 
the Democrats, and fostered even greater solidarity.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;What 
the American people saw in this 40-hour debate was this: Statesmanlike Democrats 
have approved 168 Bush Administration right-wing nominees, and blocked just a 
handful of the most extreme. Meanwhile, the public saw hours of debate that accomplished 
no change in outcome, while the pressing business of the nation went undone.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;This 
was a tremendous victory for the Constitution and for the American people. Courageous 
senators stood fast against right-wing nominees who would undo years of progress 
on civil rights and equality, religious liberty, protection of the environment, 
privacy rights, women's rights and reproductive choice. It was a good night for 
those senators, and a good morning for the nation.&quot;</FONT></P><P></P><P></P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p></font><!-- #EndEditable --></td></tr>
