- November 21 - Statement by David U. Himmelstein, MD and Steffie Woolhandler, MD, MPH,      Harvard Medical School and Physicians for a National Health Program</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) derives significant income from the sale of health and life insurance policies, and stands to make hundreds of millions more under the Medicare Prescription Drug bill now being debated before Congress.  Yet the AARP's financial interests in the bill have received scant attention.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The AARP's current insurance-related revenues come in several streams.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">1- They receive royalties from &quot;AARP&quot; insurance policies marketed to their members by UnitedHealthcare, MetLife and others.  Last year these royalties amounted to $123.283 million.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">2- They receive list access fees from insurance firms that market to their membership.  In 2002, such fees totaled $10.794 million.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">3- AARP receives &quot;Quality Control fees&quot; from insurers that amounted to $893,000 last year.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">4- AARP also earns investment income on the premiums received from members until such premiums are forwarded to UnitedHealthcare and MetLife.  In 2002, AARP earned $26.708 million in such investment income.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The table below summarizes the AARP's income for each of these categories over the past 4 years, as well as their total operating revenues, and the proportion of revenues accounted for by insurance-related items.  All data are derived from the AARP's Consolidated Financial Statements.  Dollar figures are given in millions.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">1999,  2000,  2001, 2002 </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Insurance Royalties $111.3,  $111.8,  $115.5, $123.3</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">List Access Fees $8.6,  $8.9, $9.3, $10.8</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Quality Control Fee $0.7, $0.8, $0.7, $0.9</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Income from Premiums Invested $4.7, $40.3, $33.1, $26.7</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Insurance-Related Total $125.2, $161.8, $158.6, $161.7</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Total Operating Revenues $412.2, $502.1, $520.0, $635.8</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Insurance-Related as % Of Operating Revenues 30.4%, 32.2%, 30.5%, 25.4%</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">We believe the AARP's huge insurance business helps explain why it has endorsed a bill that threatens the future of Medicare and the health of America's seniors.  Under the proposed Medicare legislation the AARP would almost surely reap hundreds of millions of dollars in additional insurance revenues over the next decade.  The Medicare bill would pump $400 billion in Federal Government money into new Medigap drug policies over the next decade.  At present, the AARP's profit from its huge insurance sales amounts to 3.9% of the insurance premiums it collects.  If AARP's partners were to capture even 10% of the new Medicare prescription drug coverage market, their premiums would amount $40 billion, and the AARP's profits would be $1.56 billion.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Medicare prescription drug bill offers huge payoffs to the drug industry, private insurers, and some large employers.  It would provide paltry benefits to Medicare recipients and take a giant step toward privatizing Medicare.  In effect, the AARP leadership has shamefully agreed to sell out its members in exchange for the organization's financial gain.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><I>Physicians for a National Health Program (PNHP) is a research and education organization with more than 12,000 physicians representing every state and specialty.
