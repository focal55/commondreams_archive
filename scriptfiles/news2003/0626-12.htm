- June 26 - Today the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) released the conclusions of its deliberation on the safety of methyl mercury in seafood. The Committee recommended that W.H.O. lower its safe level by half, reflecting scientific concern about mercury exposure. The JECFA recommendation to reduce safe levels is consistent with the conclusions of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences in 2000. The JECFA's recommended safe level is nonetheless twice as stringent as that of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which continues to rely on an outdated and unprotective number which has not been reviewed since 1979. Methyl mercury is a serious pollutant in our food supply, and people are exposed through eating popular foods they consider to be good for them, such as swordfish and albacore tuna fish. It's a particular concern for pregnant women and children, since, like lead, it affects the developing nervous system.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The WHO recommendation can be found on page 18 of the<a href="ftp://ftp.fao.org/es/esn/jecfa/jecfa61sc.pdf" target="_new"> Summary and Conclusions</a> of the 61st Meeting.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NRDC worked with a group of more than 50 international scientific specialists to urge the JECFA panel to adopt a more stringent mercury standard in a letter sent to the panel at the beginning of its deliberations June 9 in Rome. This letter, which summarizes the state of the science and makes recommendations to the panel, can be accessed <a href="http://www.mercurypolicy.org/new/documents/2WHOcommentsFINAL060303.pdf" target="_new">here</a>.</font></p>

BELOW IS A STATEMENT BY LINDA E. GREER, PH.D., DIRECTOR OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAM AT NRDC. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We commend JECFA for their deliberation and conclusions on the threats posed by methyl mercury contamination. This is a move in the right direction. In response, FDA now urgently needs to update U.S. safety levels consistent with the recommendation of the W.H.O. Consumers, particularly pregnant women, should limit their consumption of fish such as swordfish and tuna fish.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;These new stringent health numbers from W.H.O. serve as a clarion call to the Bush administration to aggressively tackle the major sources of mercury pollution, which are enjoying an undeserved relaxation in rule development at the Environmental Protection Agency. EPA is addressing mercury generated by the coal industry (utility MACT rule), the chemical industry (chlor-alkali MACT rule) and the auto recycling industry (iron and steel rule), and none of these rules go far enough to protect human health. The administration's proposal for cleaning up power plant pollution is similarly inadequate to address the problem of mercury contamination.&quot;</font></p>
