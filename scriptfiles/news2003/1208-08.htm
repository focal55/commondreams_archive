- December 8 - Today, with little debate, the House passed the $328 billion Omnibus Appropriations Bill to cover seven Appropriations bills that Congress was unable to pass this year. Congressman Dennis J. Kucinich (D-OH) issued the following statement today on passage of the bill:</FONT><P>        <FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;This bill is nothing more than a fiscally irresponsible boondoggle that in almost every area of concern for families is grossly inadequate.  </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;For our nation's children and schools, the funding shortfalls in the Omnibus are legion.   At a time when we are demanding more of our public schools, and as State and local education budgets continue to be cut, funding for No Child Left Behind is frozen.  At a time when the average Pell Grant is worth about $50 less in real terms than it was in 1975, the size of the maximum grant is frozen.  </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The Omnibus also freezes funding for the 21st Century Community Learning Centers program, the main source of federal funding for after school programs.  Over 1 million children will not have after school opportunities under this bill.  This bill even falls $1 billion short of the level promised in the Republican Budget Resolution and authorization bill passed earlier this year for IDEA, which educates disabled children.  Again, this funding shortfall is passed directly on to local school districts.  </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;For as many as 8 million workers, this bill also represents the end of overtime pay -- but not the end overtime hours.  Although this body voted to strip the administration's plan to eliminate overtime coverage for millions of Americans, the Omnibus continues forward with a regulatory agenda determined to make Americans - from paralegals to paramedics -- work longer hours for less pay.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Finally, last July this Congress took a giant step forward in overwhelmingly voting to eliminate funding for Section 213 of the PATRIOT Act, a provision that allows for so-called &quot;sneak and peak&quot; searches, or searches of property without the advanced notification of the person being searched.   This action spoke to the anxiety of millions of Americans who believe the PATRIOT Act must be repealed or revised to restore fundamental civil liberties in this nation.    Again, the result of this bi-partisan vote is starkly absent from the Omnibus.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Not only does the Omnibus cut education - it defies the will of the House on overtime pay and civil liberties.  Our children and our families suffer and the integrity of the US Constitution remains at risk with the passage of this bill.&quot;</FONT></P><P></P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p></font><!-- #EndEditable --></td></tr>
