                YORK - March 31 - Acting in the tradition of the late Dr. Martin 

                Luther King, Jr. United for Peace and Justice has called for anti-war 

                activities over the weekend of April 4 to 7. From vigils and rallies 

                to mass leafleting and civil disobedience, anti-war protesters 

                around the country will link their messages of peace with broader 

                themes of social and economic justice.</font> 

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According 

                  to UFPJ co-chair, Leslie Cagan, &quot;The Bush Administration 

                  is spending billions of dollars in an unprovoked, illegal and 

                  immoral attack on Iraq while they ignore the plight of people 

                  at home.&quot; </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cagan said 

                  the latest round of activism will urge an immediate end to the 

                  war and withdrawal of troops from Iraq. UFPJ's latest call to 

                  action states: &quot;We must keep the pressure on the Bush Administration 

                  because of its rogue interaction in the world community, its 

                  ignoring of international public opinion, and its disregard 

                  for the international diplomatic community in the UN. We must 

                  mobilize to stop the war now in order to save as many lives 

                  as possible. We must stop the war now so we can prioritize education, 

                  jobs and economic recovery instead of militarism and destruction.&quot; 

                  Dr. King is regarded as the nation's foremost advocate for peace 

                  and justice, articulating the link between immoral war abroad 

                  and racism and poverty at home. This weekend's activities are 

                  being conducted in his honor.</font></p>

                  UFPJ calls for activities at schools, in workplaces and in our 

                  communities that highlight the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, 

                  Jr. by linking our work for peace to the struggle for economic 

                  and social justice: marches, rallies, educational events, vigils, 

                  and mass leafleting.</font></p>

                  (a) Citizen Works calls for teach-ins, rallies, protests, parades, 

                  and other events as part of this year's Big Business Day. Under 

                  the theme of Challenging the Business of War, these activities 

                  will ask who pays and who benefits from this war? For more information,

                  clean-up, mass transit, veterans benefits and other critical 

                  programs. Churches around the country are planning sermons and

                  Day of Direct Action and Civil Disobedience to Stop the War 

                  at Home and Abroad with non-cooperation targeting federal and 

                  government buildings, oil corporations, arms manufacturers and 

                  arms transportation systems. Instead of going to work or school,

                  mass nonviolent direct action. For more information and resources,
