- June 11 - Environmental and human rights protesters today hung a banner saying 'Ford: Driving America&sup1;s Oil Addiction' from the roof of the 12-story Griswold Building at Griswold and State Streets in downtown Detroit this morning.  Tomorrow, Ford will begin celebrations for its 100th anniversary.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Ford Motor Company, once a symbol of American innovation, is now forfeiting our economic and enviornmental future,&quot; said RAN Executive Director Michael Brune. &quot;By refusing to make cleaner and more efficient cars Ford is on the verge of losing more market share and good union jobs to Japanese automakers. Bill Ford Jr. has the opportunity today to be a man of the century. If he commits to building better cars and trucks in the United States, the road truly will belong to Ford.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Two protesters, Suze Bono, 21, and Matt Leonard, 24, hung off the roof of the Griswold Building with the banner.  The banner features a giant graphic of the Earth run over by an SUV tire tread.  Sharon Smith, 25, one of three other banner activists on the roof said, &quot;Ford vehicles are running roughshod over the planet, leading to rainforest destruction, climate change, and compromised national security.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There exists widespread support for a new generation of clean, efficient vehicles that could end America&sup1;s oil addiction. A poll conducted in 2001 found that 74 percent of Michigan voters, and 79 percent of UAW households, favor stricter fuel efficiency standards for both cars and trucks. The poll was conducted by Lake, Snell, Perry and Associates, a nationally known opinion research firm based in Washington, D.C.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ford has tried to position itself as an environmental leader while repeatedly breaking its commitments to produce cleaner and more efficient cars and trucks. The National Academy of Sciences concluded that current off-the-shelf technology could significantly boost fuel efficiency. Other studies have found that a jump to 40 mpg is easily achievable, and that a jump to 60 mpg is can be made with full hybrid engines.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;At the end of its first century, Ford has become the face of American oil addiction&quot;, said Brune. &quot;For its second century, we're asking Ford to lead the way to a clean and secure future.&quot;</font></p>
