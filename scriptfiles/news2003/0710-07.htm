<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BAGHDAD - July 10 - Today, as part of a week of protest and activities 

organized by representatives of the Al-Awda (Right of Return) Temporary 

Refugee Camp in the Haifa Cultural Centre in the Baladiyat district of 

Baghdad, international and local Palestinian-Iraqi activists embark on a seven day hunger strike, beginning 11 July, in solidarity with the camp's demands for permanent homes. Other activitieswill include a letter writing 

campaign, demonstrations, and actions to be announced.

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Activists from Ireland, Poland, Britain, Iraq, Lebanon, France, Iraq, 

Palestine, Lebanon and Italy will be maintaining a seven-day solidarity tent and fast inside Al-Awda in an attempt to draw international attention to the 

deteriorating conditions of the camp. Groups represented include: Voices in 

the Wilderness, Bridges to Baghdad, Christian Peacemaker Teams, and Occupation Watch.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Following the fall of the Ba'ath regime and the subsequent occupation ofIraq by US and UK dominated forces, approximately 300 families living in Baghdad were evicted by their landlords from their homes. Under Saddam, some 

Palestinian families living in Iraq were given subsidized housing, which generated resentment within impoverished Iraqi communities. There are a further 600 Palestinian families living in Baghdad which have been given eviction notices and the population of the camp is expected to swell in the coming weeks. It should be noted that not all Palestinian families currently threatened with eviction were receiving subsidized housing.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For the past 3 and a half months, Palestinian families have been living in 

the Haifa Cultural Center's soccer field in canvas tents, with insufficient 

water, electricity, medical and food supplies, plus inadequate3 sanitation 

facilities, in soaring summer temperatures, expected to reach up to 60 

centigrade by next month. These conditions are exacerbated by the 

intensification of security risks throughout Iraq (Al-Kindi Hospital reports 

a 150-fold increase in violent crimes), such as a drastic rise in cases of 

rape, kidnapping, and murder following the 'stabilization' of Iraq.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition, three members of the Palestinian embassy staff were arrested on 

May 28 by US Occupation troops. They have been denied access to legal 

representation, human rights groups or relatives. No reason has been 

publicly given for their arrest and subsequent indefinite detention.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This, coupled with the increase in targeted attacks against Palestinian in 

Baghdad as well as escalating human rights abuses by Occupation Forces all 

over Iraq, demands international action and resolution.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite continued attempts at negotiation with the American Occupation Administration, and promises of imminent re-housing, no action has been taken to alleviate the deteriorating conditions in Al-Awda.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Camp representatives have made the following demands as part of their 

week of action:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">- Secure housing with basic amenities (i.e. running water and

electricity) 

for all the evicted families.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

- UNRWA's mandate be expanded to include Palestinian refugees living in 

Iraq, in addition to the agency's current aid provision for Palestinian 

refugees living in Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, and the West Bank and Gaza.

- The immediate release of the three Palestinian embassy staff.

- Palestinian refugees all over the world be given their historical and 

internationally recognized, yet systematically denied, Right of Return to 

their homeland, occupied since 1948.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The families living in the Haifa Cultural Center have undergone a double</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">experience of forced transfer. From their roots - many of them are from Haifa itself, and other 1948 Palestinian towns and villages - to their 

current situation, the dynamics of discrimination, racism, and violation of basic human rights are mirrored in the political status and living 

conditions of their families in Occupied Palestine and the world over.</font></p>
