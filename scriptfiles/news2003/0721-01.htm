- July 21 - The U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Appropriations will soon vote on legislation that threatens trail-building efforts across the country. The nonprofit Rails-to-Trails Conservancy (RTC) is conducting a nationwide campaign to combat what could be a potentially devastating loss for local communities seeking federal funding for trails and greenways.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Transportation Enhancements (TE) program - responsible for nearly $3 billion in support of rail-trails and other bicycle and pedestrian facilities nationwide since 1991 - came under attack July 11 when the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, Treasury and Independent Agencies voted to eliminate all funding for the popular program. A full committee vote tentatively scheduled for this evening has been cancelled, but a rescheduled vote could take place as early as Tuesday, July 22.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We put the word out among our 100,000 members and started working with trail activists across the country as soon as this threat became apparent,&quot; said RTC president Keith Laughlin. &quot;It is a big mistake to underestimate local support for trails. Public response against this measure has been overwhelming, and RTC will continue to inform Congress and the public about this short-sighted provision that would harm trail projects everywhere.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Transportation Enhancements fund eligible activities that include pedestrian and bicycle facilities; scenic or historic highway programs; historic preservation; and preservation of abandoned railway corridors and conversion of unused railroad corridors to trails. Approximately $300 million each year is provided to rail-trail, bicycle and pedestrian projects throughout the country. All 50 states have least one open rail-trail, as well as trail projects in process that could be jeopardized if the TE program is eliminated.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rails-to-Trails Conservancy, through a partnership with the Federal Highway Administration, maintains comprehensive databases on Transportation Enhancement spending practices for each state. For more information visit <a href="http://www.railtrails.org/whatwedo/policy/tea21b.asp" target="_new">Rails-to-Trails Conservancy's Web site.</a></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rails-to-Trails Conservancy is the nation's largest trails organization dedicated to connecting people and communities by creating a nationwide network of public tails, many from former rail lines and connecting corridors. Founded in 1986, Rails-to-Trails Conservancy is located in Washington, D.C., and has field offices in California, Florida, Massachusetts, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania.</font></p>
