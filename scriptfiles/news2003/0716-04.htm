- July 16 - Spurred by pressure from the White House, lawmakers in the House of Representatives are on the verge of voting on a troubling revamp of Head Start that allows hiring discrimination by religious providers.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A vote on &#147;The School Readiness Act of 2003&#148; (H.R. 2210) is expected on the House floor this week.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At the behest of the Bush administration, the bill allows churches to discriminate in hiring while running publicly funded Head Start programs. That aspect of the measure is expected to spark strong controversy during the floor debate and may doom its chance of passage in the Senate.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;This bill allows blatant discrimination in hiring in a crucial publicly funded program,&#148; said the Rev. Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State. &#147;It will jeopardize the jobs of Head Start teachers and disrupt the lives of underprivileged children.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Bush administration is ratcheting up its drive to infuse all federal programs with its &#147;faith-based&#148; initiative, which would allow churches and other religious bodies to obtain federal funds to operate social services in a discriminatory manner.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In early July, the administration warned a House committee that it would not accept an appropriation bill for a number of federal agencies unless participating religious groups were allowed to discriminate in their hiring. &#147;The President&#146;s senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill if it included such a provision,&#148; a July 8 &#147;Statement of Administration Policy,&#148; reads.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Coalition Against Religious Discrimination, which includes Americans United, has urged lawmakers in the House to block the proposed changes to Head Start.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today House members have scheduled a press conference at 3:30 p.m. at HC-9 in the Capitol to denounce the proposed changes to Head Start and urge the Senate to block them.</font></p>
