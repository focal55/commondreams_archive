- May 20  

- Following is a statement 

by Ronald J. Tipton, senior vice president, programs, National 

Parks Conservation Association, on the Bush administration's 

privatization plan for the National Park Service: 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Bush administration's privatization plan for the National 

Park Service will neither benefit our treasured national parks nor 

improve NPS efficiency or effectiveness. And it is not designed 

with the type of quality control and oversight that a private 

enterprise would demand when making a similar decision. Instead, it 

could result in the dismantling of an institution acclaimed by the 

American public as the guardian of our natural and cultural 

heritage. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">National Park Service Director Fran P. Mainella has warned that 

privatization could have a substantial negative effect on the 

diversity of the Park Service workforce, on the experience of 

Americans who visit the parks, on the Park Service budget and on 

the taxpayers who must pay millions to "study" jobs for 

privatization. Finding the necessary funding to study Park Service 

jobs for privatization will even reduce the availability of 

seasonal rangers who serve the American public every summer. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In times like these, when Americans are trying to reconnect with 

the history that our national parks preserve, we should not simply 

discard historians, archaeologists, museum curators, interpreters, 

maintenance workers, and architects and place their 

responsibilities in the hands of the lowest bidder. Decisions to 

outsource any position at a national park should be primarily the 

prerogative of the park superintendent and should be based only on 

the best interests of the parks themselves. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For the sake of our national treasures, the Park Service should 

be exempt from participation in the new privatization mandate. This 

is important to ensure the quality of visitors' experience, and to 

protect the parks themselves for future generations.
