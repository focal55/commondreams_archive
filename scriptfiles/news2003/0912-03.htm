-  

September 12 - On Thursday, September 18, Ralph Nader's &quot;People Have The 

Power&quot; tour will bring to Washington a powerful combination of community 

activism and entertainment.  Community leaders and performers working for 

progressive social change will join Nader, Democratic presidential candidate Dennis Kucinich, and entertainer Patti Smith to activate audience members' 



involvement with local campaigns.  This Washington rally will focus on 

issues vital to D.C. citizens, including DC Statehood, increased funding for libraries and affordable housing, restoration of D.C. General Hospital, 

universal health care, and opposing the use of vouchers in D.C. public 

schools.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Washington, D.C., is the sixteenth stop of Nader's nationwide tour that 

began in 2001 in Portland, Oregon.  The tour has since packed venuesfrom 

San Francisco to Buffalo and New York City to Tampa.  They are sponsored by 

Nader's most recent not-for-profit organization, Democracy Rising, which 

seeks to unify people &quot;in the cause of freeing American politics from the 

grip of corporate interests.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The purpose of these events is to bring people together in cities across America, which is especially critical now,&quot; said Nader, America's leading 

consumer activist.  &quot;Progressive people and organizations in Washington and 

beyond must work together.  Civil liberties, our nation's security, and the 

nation's major social priorities are at risk in the Executive Branch and 

Congress.  All major peace and social justice successes in our history have 

started with a mobilization of the citizenry.  We must further this 

tradition and strive to ensure that the values of democracy, law 

enforcement, respect for human rights and the protection of all innocent 

people prevail here both at home and around the world.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Washington, D.C., rally will be held at Metropolitan African Methodist 

Episcopal Church at 1518 M St., NW.  The official program begins at 7:00 

p.m. (doors, live music, and community group tabling at 6:00 p.m.).  An 

array of community organizations will have information tables to distribute 

literature and solicit signatures for a variety of progressive causes. 

General admission tickets are $10 in advance and $15 at the door.  Children 

12 and under get in free.</font></p>
