- May 15 - The National League of 

Cities (NLC) Council on Youth Education and Families will meet in 

Nashville, Tenn., May 16, 2003, to discuss the reauthorization of 

the Head Start program, its success stories, and the Bush 

Administration proposed changes. New Haven Conn., Mayor John 

DeStefano, NLC's President, chose early childhood development as 

the top issue for his year as president. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Since the inception of the program in 1965, more than 20 

million children and their families have benefited from the Head 

Start program," said Nashville Mayor Bill Purcell, chair of the 

Council and host of the meeting. "While Head Start has always been 

a bi-partisan legislative success story, this year marks the most 

critical point in its history. An important part of the success of 

Head Start is the partnership the federal government has had with 

local agencies to serve young children and their families. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The NLC opposes the administrations plan to block grant the Head 

Start program to the states for several reasons: 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Community control would be undermined by giving states more 

authority over Head Start; 

-- Block-granting to states will weaken program performance 

standards; 

-- Block-granting will require more money for administration, 

reducing funds available for children; and 

-- State control of Head Start is not necessary for state 

collaboration on programs. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NLC's position is that Head Starts comprehensive approach must 

be maintained and is best accomplished by keeping it at HHS. The 

key to Head Start's success is the full range of services provided 

to at-risk children, namely, nutrition, immunizations, 

health/dental care, parental involvement, early learning in 

literacy, numeracy and socialization skills. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Head Start funding should be increased to provide learning 

opportunities to all eligible children," said Mayor DeStefano. 

"Head Start is a proven investment and the federal government 

should increase its financial commitment. Administration proposals 

to block grant Head Start funding to states and move its 

administration from the Department of Health and Human Services 

(HHS) to the Department of Education (DOE), coupled with inadequate 

funding commitment, could seriously undermine Head Start."
