- June 5 - "Let's all be clear -- the bill before us is unconstitutional because it does not contain an exemption for the health of the woman who seeks to exercise her reproductive rights.  There is no doubt about that.  This is because the US Supreme Court has already ruled on very similar legislation in Stenberg v. Carhart.  Opponents of the right to reproductive choice should know that.

 </font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This bill likely will not prevent a single abortion.  But it does defeat the rights of women.  

 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"I believe that equal protection under the law and the right to privacy should be freedoms enjoyed by women as well as men. But women will not be equal to men if this constitutionally protected right is denied. This bill infringes on those rights for women, and that is why I will oppose it. 

 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Throughout my career, I have tried to work to reduce the need for abortions by preventing unwanted pregnancies through comprehensive sex education, birth control, and increased access to health care.  I think that all of my colleagues would agree that we should work to prevent unwanted pregnancies that lead to abortions.  I will continue those efforts, but the bill that is before us today is the wrong way to do that.

 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Advocates of this bill who say they stand in defense of life would be more believable if they worked to support families, with adequate child care funding, child tax credit relief for vulnerable families, and peace.  For some, this debate is only about politics. The fact that other abortion legislation, the Unborn Victims of Violence Act, has been advanced on the publicity of the Laci Peterson tragedy shows the unfortunate politicization of this debate.

 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"I do know, however, that many are sincere in their desire to reduce the need for abortions.  In leading the nation toward this goal, we must preserve Constitutional rights.  We must respect the freedom and equality of women.  The best path for our country is not to escalate the divisiveness and political nature of this debate.  Rather, it is to remember the principles of this nation and refrain from undermining the freedom of choice.  We must respect the basic human dignity of women to make personal decisions.

 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This House can do better to truly work to reduce the need for abortions while respecting the freedom of choice. For these reasons, I will oppose the bill today."
