                YORK - March 25 - A lack of skepticism toward official U.S. sources 

                has already led prominent American journalists into embarrassing 

                errors in their coverage of the U.S. invasion of Iraq, particularly 

                in relation to claims that proof had been found that Iraq possesses 

                banned weapons.</font> 

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On March 

                  20, the second day of the invasion, U.S. military sources initially 

                  described missiles launched by Iraq as &quot;Scuds&quot;-- the 

                  U.S. name for a Soviet-made missile used by Iraq during the 

                  Gulf War. They exceed the range limits imposed on Iraqi weapons 

                  by the 1991 ceasefire agreement.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While some 

                  reporters appropriately sourced the Scud reports to military 

                  officials, and cautioned their audience about the uncertainty 

                  of the identification, others rushed to report claims as facts. 

                  NBC's Matt Lauer's report was definitive: &quot;We understand 

                  they have fired three missiles. One of those was a Scud missile. 

                  It was destroyed by a Patriot missile battery as it headed toward 

                  Kuwait.&quot;</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">His colleague 

                  Tim Russert was similarly certain, saying, &quot;Because of 

                  last night's activity, clearly the Iraqis are now trying to 

                  respond with at least one Scud fired at the troops mapped on 

                  the border of Kuwait and Iraq.&quot; Fellow NBC anchor Brian 

                  Williams added, &quot;We learned one Scud had been intercepted, 

                  but two missiles had made it to Kuwaiti soil.&quot;</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On NPR that 

                  day, anchor Bob Edwards was equally sure about what happened: 

                  &quot;Iraq this morning launched Scud missiles at Kuwait in 

                  retaliation for the American strike on Baghdad a few hours earlier.&quot; 

                  Correspondent Mike Shuster helpfully pointed out that &quot;these 

                  Scuds are banned under U.N. Security Council resolutions and 

                  have a range of up to 400 miles.&quot;</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ABC's Ted 

                  Koppel, &quot;embedded&quot; with an infantry division, reported 

                  matter-of-factly that &quot;there were two Scud missiles that 

                  came in. One was intercepted by a patriot missile.&quot; ABC 

                  anchor Derek McGinty had earlier explained that &quot;there 

                  was a Scud attack, one Scud fired from Basra into Kuwait. It 

                  was intercepted by an American patriot battery, and apparently 

                  knocked out of the sky. There is still no word exactly what 

                  was on that Scud, whether or not there might have been any sort 

                  of unconventional weaponry onboard.&quot;</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Fox News 

                  Channel's William La Jeunesse was not only asserting that a 

                  Scud had been launched, but was drawing conclusions about its 

                  significance: &quot;Now, Iraq is not supposed to have Scuds 

                  because they have a range of 175 up to 400 miles. The limit 

                  by the U.N., of course, is like 95 miles. So, we already know 

                  they have something they're not supposed to have.&quot;</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As the day 

                  went on, however, the Pentagon was less definitive about what 

                  kind of missile Iraq was using, prompting some journalists to 

                  back off the story. Associated Press reported on March 22 that 

                  &quot;Maj. Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the vice director of operations 

                  for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a Pentagon news conference 

                  that the Iraqis have not fired any Scuds and that U.S. forces 

                  searching airfields in the far western desert of Iraq have uncovered 

                  no missiles or launchers.&quot;</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Even so, 

                  the next day, columnist Peter Bronson (Cincinnati Enquirer, 

                  3/23/03) was still writing, &quot;The Scuds he swore he did 

                  not have were fired at Kuwait, and Iraq was launching lame denials 

                  while the craters still smoked.&quot; Apparently the corrections 

                  of the earlier, incorrect reports had not reached even all of 

                  those whose job it is to follow the news.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Reporters 

                  were also embarrassed on March 23 by an evaporating story about 

                  a &quot;chemical facility&quot; near the town of Najaf, Iraq, 

                  that was touted by U.S. military officials as a possible smoking 

                  gun to prove disputed claims about Saddam Hussein possessing 

                  banned chemical weapons. While journalists were not typically 

                  as credulous of this claim as they were with the Scud story, 

                  and generally remembered to attribute it to military sources, 

                  accounts still tended to be breathless and to extrapolate wildly 

                  from an unconfirmed report.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ABC's John 

                  McWethy promoted the story with this report: &quot;Amidst all 

                  the fighting, one important new discovery: U.S. officials say, 

                  up the road from Nasarijah, in a town called Najaf, they believe 

                  that they have captured a chemical weapons plant and perhaps 

                  more important, the commanding general of that facility. One 

                  U.S. official said he is a potential 'gold mine' about the weapons 

                  Saddam Hussein says he doesn't have.&quot;</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NBC's Tom 

                  Brokaw described the story thusly: &quot;Word tonight that U.S. 

                  forces may have found what U.N. inspectors spent months searching 

                  for, a facility suspected to be a chemical weapons plant, uncovered 

                  by ground troops on the way north to Baghdad.&quot; NBC Pentagon 

                  correspondent Jim Miklaszewski added what seemed to be corroborating 

                  details: &quot;This huge chemical complex... was constructed 

                  of sand-casted walls, in other words, meant to camouflage its 

                  appearance to blend in with the desert. Once inside, the soldiers 

                  found huge amounts of chemicals, stored chemicals. They apparently 

                  found no chemical weapons themselves, and now military officials 

                  here at the Pentagon say they have yet to determine exactly 

                  what these chemicals are or how they could have been used in 

                  weapons.&quot;</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Fox News 

                  Channel, less cautious than some of its competitors, treated 

                  the report of a chemical weapons factory as fact in a series 

                  of onscreen banners like &quot;Huge Chemical Weapons Factory 

                  Found in So. Iraq.&quot;</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some print 

                  outlets also hyped the story the next day, as when the Philadelphia 

                  Daily News (10/24/03) reported it as the &quot;biggest find 

                  of the Iraq war&quot; and &quot;a reversal of fortune for American 

                  and British forces at the end of the war's most discouraging 

                  day.&quot;</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As it turned 

                  out, however, the &quot;discovery&quot; seemed to be neither 

                  a big find nor a reversal of fortune, but simply a false alarm, 

                  and TV reporters began changing their stories. The Dow Jones 

                  news service reported (3/24/03), &quot;U.S. officials said Monday 

                  that no chemical weapons were found at a suspected site at Najaf 

                  in central Iraq, U.S. television networks reported. NBC News 

                  reported from the Pentagon that no chemicals at all were found 

                  at the site. CNN, also reporting from the Pentagon, said officials 

                  now believe the plant there was abandoned long ago by the Iraqis.&quot; 

                  On March 25, the New York Times reported that &quot;suggestions 

                  on Sunday that a chemical plant in Najaf might be a weapons 

                  site have turned out to be false.&quot;</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">U.S.-based 

                  journalists are generally quick to caution readers, when describing 

                  an allegation made by Iraq, that the information &quot;could 

                  not be independently confirmed.&quot; The fact is that information 

                  provided by any government should be treated with skepticism; 

                  reporters might try extending their critical approach to the 

                  U.S. military's statements.</font></p>
