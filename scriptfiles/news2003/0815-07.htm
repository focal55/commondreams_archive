- August 15 -  In interviews with 1,532 registered voters conducted July 22-24, 2003, and August 5-8, 2003, the Ipsos-Public Affairs/Cook Political Report Poll finds potential trouble for Bush's reelection effort among certain key groups of swing voters.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Key Swing Voter Groups Are Dissatisfied With The Current Direction Of The Country</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Among Hispanics, the difference between right direction and wrong track has gone from a net positive (+25) in late April to a net negative (-14) in early August, a shift of 39 points.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

* Among Non-college educated men, the difference between right direction and wrong track has gone from a net positive (+30) in late April to a net negative (-10) in early August, a shift of 40 points.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Overall Approval Of Bush's Handling Of His Job As President Has Declined Significantly Since A Peak In Late April</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* While still a net positive, overall job approval among Hispanics has dropped from +38 in late April to +10 in early August, a net drop of 28 points.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

* Among non-college educated men, overall approval has declined by a net 18 points, from +46 in late April to +28 in early August.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Approval Of Bush's Handling Of Foreign Affairs Has Dropped Substantially Among Hispanics; Non-college Educated Men Still Overwhelmingly Approve</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Among Hispanics, approval of Bush's handling of foreign affairs has declined from +43 in early April to a bare majority (+5) in early August, an overall decline of 38 points.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

* Non-college educated men still overwhelmingly approve of Bush's handling of foreign affairs, declining only 3 points since late April (from +57 to +54).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Key Swing Groups Have Declined Significantly In Their Approval Of Bush's Handling Of The Economy</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Hispanics have shifted from a majority (net difference of +14) approving of Bush's handling of the economy in late April to a dead heat between approve and disapprove (net difference of -2) in early August.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

* While a majority of non-college educated men still approve of Bush's handling of the economy (net difference of +7), their support has dipped significantly since late April (net difference of +22).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Attitudes About Bush Approval May Highlight Potential Trouble Among Groups Of Swing Voters</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Among Hispanics, approval of Bush's handling of foreign affairs and the economy has declined significantly.  A majority feel the direction of the country is off on the wrong track (a significant reversal from April).  This increasing frustration is reflected in their attitudes toward reelecting Bush.  Those who say they would definitely vote for someone else are in a dead heat with those who definitely would vote to reelect Bush, a decline of 11 points since late April.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

* Among non-college educated men, however, approval of Bush's handling of foreign affairs appears to be countering their increasingly negative views on the direction of the country and Bush's handling of the economy.  Those who say they would definitely vote to reelect Bush is unchanged compared to late April.  Those who definitely would vote for someone else have increased marginally.</font></p>
