- December 8 - Presidential Candidate Dennis Kucinich today released the following statement:</FONT><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Congressman Gephardt and Dr. Dean are said to differ fundamentally on how to reduce the deficit that the Bush administration has saddled us with. According to the Des Moines Register, Gephardt says he will increase taxes and spending, and that this will stimulate the economy.  Dean has suggested he would cut spending or 'limit the growth' of domestic programs.  </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;But both are in complete agreement with President Bush that the Pentagon's bloated $400 billion budget should continue untouched and that the U.S. occupation of Iraq, with a price tag already over $150 billion, should not be ended quickly.  Gephardt also voted for the latest spending of $87 billion on Iraq, while Dean, depending on his audience, both supported and opposed it.*</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Dr. Dean is promising to balance the budget, but he's refusing to cut Pentagon spending.  With a budget deficit that is approaching $500 billion, where will he get the money?  The only place he can get the money is from the very domestic programs that are already suffering because of the oversized military budget.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;If a president is unwilling to cut where the spending is greatest and the waste the most extreme, but promises to balance the budget and reduce the deficit, you can be sure there will be cuts where we can less afford them.  Today I introduced a bill that will lower taxes for most Americans while repealing tax cuts to the wealthiest few.  Unless Democrats have the courage to stand up to the current war economy and insist on a major shift in priorities, we will not put this country on solid footing or win next year's election.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;In addition to my tax reform bill, I have proposed a plan that would end the US occupation of Iraq in 90 days.  And I have committed to cutting 15 percent of the Pentagon's wasteful budget.&quot;</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">*Among Dr. Dean's comments supporting the $87 billion were his statements during televised presidential debates from New York and Phoenix.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Kucinich's plan to end the occupation of Iraq is available at <A HREF="http://www.kucinich.us/statements.htm#100903" TARGET="_new">http://www.kucinich.us/statements.htm#100903</A> </FONT></P><P></P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p></font><!-- #EndEditable --></td></tr>
