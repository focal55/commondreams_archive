- December 3 - TomPaine.com, in its Op Ad today in The New York Times, affirms the legacy of political dissent throughout American history and blasts recent Justice Department attacks on the environmental organization Greenpeace. The lawsuit filed against Greenpeace marks the first time in U.S. history that the government has prosecuted an entire organization for the free speech activities of its supporters. </FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;America has a proud legacy of political dissent and a dark tendency to repress it. Eliminate protest and you remove some of our finest moments: the Boston Tea Party, abolition, suffrage, civil rights and modern environmentalism,&quot; the ad reads.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Last year, two Greenpeace activists boarded a ship that was smuggling illegally harvested rainforest mahogany and unfurled a banner that called on President Bush to act. But the Justice Department, instead of going after the smugglers, went out of its way to file criminal charges against Greenpeace, citing an antiquated 1872 law. If convicted, it could devastate the group and send a chilling message.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The ad reminds readers that the Justice Department's efforts against Greenpeace aren't solitary. &quot;The Department of Justice is overreaching in other ways, too, monitoring dissent as they did under Cointelpro, a Cold War program launched by the FBI to infiltrate protest groups.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Greenpeace trial is scheduled for later this month. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">TomPaine.com says that Attorney General Ashcroft is on the wrong side of history. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;What John Ashcroft is missing is what Thomas Jefferson expressed so well when he wrote, 'I hold it that a little rebellion now and then is a good thing, and as necessary in the political world as storms in the physical.'&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">To view the ad visit <A HREF="http://www.tompaine.com/op_ads/opad2.cfm/ID/9523" TARGET="_new">http://www.tompaine.com/op_ads/opad2.cfm/ID/9523</A>.
