                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

                  - March 28 - Oklahoma is scheduled to execute Scott Hain on 

                  April 3 for a crime committed when Hain was 17 years old. The 

                  National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty Friday called 

                  on the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board to vote to recommend 

                  clemency for Hain when it convenes Monday.</font></p>

                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hain is 

                  scheduled to be executed for the murders of Michael William 

                  Houghton and Laura Lee Sanders in Tulsa. He had no prior record 

                  of committing violent offenses.</font></p>

                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NCADP Executive 

                  Director Steven W. Hawkins said Oklahoma officials should consider 

                  emerging public opinion in the United States when it hears Hain's 

                  case. He noted that so far this year, legislation to ban the 

                  execution of youthful offenders has been filed in at least ten 

                  states, with legislators in three states -- Florida, Nevada 

                  and South Dakota -- passing bans out of committee.</font></p>

                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He added 

                  that only one country besides the United States -- Iran -- executes 

                  people for crimes committed as minors. Within the past year 

                  alone, Pakistan, the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Philippines 

                  have moved away from the practice.</font></p>

                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Such 

                  executions not only violate international norms, they also offend 

                  human decency,&quot; Hawkins said. &quot;The mind of a youthful 

                  offender is by definition less developed than the mind of an 

                  adult. Minors do not handle social pressure, instinctual urges 

                  and other stresses the way that adults do. Youthful offenders 

                  therefore cannot be held to the same degree of culpability as 

                  adults, just as mentally retarded people cannot be held to the 

                  same degree of culpability. We now ban the execution of mentally 

                  retarded offenders. There can be little justification for applying 

                  a different standard when it comes to juveniles.&quot;</font></p>
