- November 5 - Conservationists warned today that the Bush administration is preparing to sacrifice scientific integrity for political expediency in the management of America's longest river.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Conservationists have obtained an Oct. 29 memo from Assistant Interior Secretary Craig Manson to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, removing the agency's Missouri River experts from the job of producing a new &quot;biological opinion&quot; on steps needed to prevent the extinction of three species in the Missouri River. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The task will instead be assigned to a new team of biologists inexperienced with the species or river in question.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It appears to us that political appointees at the Interior Department are putting tremendous pressure on federal scientists to reach politically expedient conclusions, regardless of their scientific validity,&quot; said Chad Smith, director of American Rivers' Nebraska Field Office. &quot;The subtext of this order is 'since you won?t give us the answer we want, we?ll ask someone else.'&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 2000, the Fish and Wildlife Service issued the current biological opinion, based on ten years of work, requiring modest efforts to restore some of the natural flow patterns on the Missouri River to halt its pronounced ecological decline and prevent the extinction of three species. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This basic requirement was reviewed and endorsed by an independent panel of scientists and by the National Academy of Sciences. A federal judge ruled this summer that the current biological opinion is legally binding.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;There is no justifiable reason for replacing a dozen experts with a decade of experience with a completely new bunch, particularly when distinguished outside scientists have repeatedly said the existing team is getting it right,&quot; said Tim Searchinger, attorney for Environmental Defense.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Senior Bush Administration officials have stated over the last couple of months that they vehemently oppose any flow changes despite the conclusion by the Corps of Engineers that these changes would also improve the economy along the river. The Corps of Engineers has therefore requested a new opinion from the Fish and Wildlife Service.   </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Last month, in an unannounced development, the administration prohibited Fish and Wildlife Service scientists from obtaining independent peer review prior to releasing a new opinion. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Conservationists expect that the forthcoming new opinion will omit any call for restoring the Missouri River ecostem with reforms in dam operations and will instead endorse the use of various mechanical and technical &quot;band aids&quot; that have been discredited in reputable scientific circles.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This action signals that the Bush administration intends to base management of the Missouri on politics rather than on sound science,&quot; said John Kostyack, senior species conservation counsel for the National Wildlife Federation. &quot;If politics do win out over science, we stand ready to defend the health of the Missouri River in court.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Assistant Secretary Manson has made a number of high-profile commitments to use of sound science to make endangered species decisions. In particular, he testified before the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources on October 3, 2001 that &quot;I agree with the view expressed by both the President and Secretary Norton that our natural resources public policies must be informed by sound science.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">That testimony is available at <a href="http://www.doi.gov/ocl/2001/mansonenr.htm" target="_NEW">http://www.doi.gov/ocl/2001/mansonenr.htm</a></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition, Assistant Secretary Manson testified before the House Resources Committee on March 20, 2002 that, &quot;Our data and scientific information must meet the highest possible ethical and professional standards.  At the outset, I want to say that improving our science has been one of Secretary Norton?s highest priorities, and it will be one of mine.&quot;</font></p>
