<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- June 30 -  Hundreds gathered in front of the U.S. Supreme Court

Monday for a noon rally protesting the 859 executions in the country

since death penalty statutes were upheld in 1976.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

The rally came in the midst of a 96-hour fast and vigil, which has

drawn activists from 16 states, plus Canada, Great Britain and Puerto

Rico. The fast and vigil commemorates the anniversary of both the 1972

Furman v. Georgia ruling, striking down capital punishment, and the

1976 Gregg v. Georgia ruling reinstating it.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I am a prime example that the death penalty system is broken, that it

is not fair and that it is not accurate,&quot; said Juan Melendez, who spent

17 years, eight months and one day on death row in Florida before being

fully exonerated. &quot;The death penalty must be abolished.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

Abe Bonowitz, organizer of the annual event, said, &quot;We are gathered

today to educate the public that the death penalty continues to be

arbitrary and capricious. It is a violation of human rights. It is a

political tool for politicians to mislead the public about how best to 

address crime. It is biased and it is a colossal waste of tax dollars.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

Besides Melendez and Bonowitz, Monday's rally speakers included

Washington Wizards basketball player Etam Thomas; musician Steve Earle;Marietta Jaeger-Lane, a leader of Murder Victims' Families for

Reconciliation; Larry Ruffin, a senior at Washington D.C.'s Anacostia

High School and member of the newly organized group Students Against

the Death Penalty; Richard Dieter, executive director of the Death

Penalty Information Center; Sue Gunawardena-Vaughn and Mona Cadena

of Amnesty International; Judy Coode of Pax Christi, a Catholic peace

group; and David Elliot, spokesman for the National Coalition to Abolish

the Death Penalty.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

 

Jaeger-Lane, whose seven-year-old daughter murdered in 1973, said that

death penalty proponents often try to justice capital punishment by saying

it represents &quot;justice&quot; for family members of murder victims. &quot;To say

that the death penalty is just retribution is an insult to the memoryof my little girl's life,&quot; she said.
