- October 14 - Open Debates -- a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization that was recently established to reform the presidential debate process -- has launched a new website: <a href="http://www.opendebates.org" target="_new">www.opendebates.org</a> </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Open Debates is initiating simultaneous campaigns to inform the public, the news media, and policy makers about the fundamental and irreparable problems with a bipartisan-controlled private corporation called the Commission on Presidential Debates. It is also promoting the creation of an alternative presidential debate sponsor --&shy; the nonpartisan Citizens&#146; Debate Commission --&shy; comprised of national civic organizations committed to maximizing voter education.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We want the Commission on Presidential Debates to be exposed for what it truly is: a tool of the national Republican and Democratic parties that undermines voter education,&quot; said George Farah, Executive Director of Open Debates.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Open Debates&#146; campaign to reform the presidential debates has just begun. &#147;We are committed to establishing presidential debates that serve the American people first,&#148; said Open Debates&#146; Organizing Director Chris Shaw.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Open Debates has supporters on the left, right, and center of the political spectrum. This is reflected by the composition of Open Debates&#146; board of directors: John B. Anderson, former Republican Congressman; Angela &#147;Bay&#148; Buchanan, president of The American Cause; Randall Robinson, founder of TransAfrica; Larry Noble, Executive Director of the Center for Responsive Politics; Jon Hanson, Harvard Law professor; Pat Choate, former Reform Party vice-presidential candidate; Paul Weyrich, founder of the Heritage Foundation; and Professor Jamin Raskin, author of Overruling Democracy.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Presidential debates were run by the civic-minded nonpartisan League of Women Voters until 1988, when the national Republican and Democratic parties seized control of the debates by establishing the bipartisan, corporate-funded, Commission on Presidential Debates. Co-chaired by the former heads of the Republican and Democratic parties, the Commission on Presidential Debates has sought to &quot;protect&quot; the major party candidates from challenging questions, difficult issues, and popular third party candidates. As a result, under the Commission on Presidential Debates&#146; control, the presidential debates have been reduced to &quot;glorified news conferences,&quot; where the candidates merely recite prepackaged soundbites and avoid discussing important issues.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Open Debates&#146; website will inform the public about the anti-democratic practices of the Commission on Presidential Debates, and the need for debate reform,&#148; said Farah.</font></p>
