                  10th, 2003, thousands of students from approximately 100 colleges 

                  and universities across the country will be participating in 

                  the Day of Action on the Higher Education Act Drug Provision, 

                  organized by Students for Sensible Drug Policy and the United 

                  States Student Association. Since its inception in 1998, the 

                  Higher Education Act (HEA) drug provision has denied need-based 

                  financial aid for higher education to nearly 100,000 students. 

                  Aid may be delayed or denied due to minor drug convictions such 

                  as possession of a single marijuana cigarette. </font></p>
