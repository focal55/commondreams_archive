                - March 19 - Representatives of the Washington, D.C.-based National 

                Latina/o Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Organization (LLEGO) 

                will travel to Tallahassee, Florida, on Thursday for visits with 

                state legislators and a rally supporting adoption by same-sex 

                couples. The events are presented by the Unity Coalition of Miami-Dade, 

                a grassroots advocacy group for Latina/o sexual minorities. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Florida is 

                one of only three states in the country which outlaw adoption 

                by sexual minorities. The Unity Coalition will present a petition 

                to state legislators, signed by about 2,000 people, in support 

                of adoption by gays, lesbians and bisexuals. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Thousands 

                of children in foster care in Florida cannot be adopted by their 

                caregivers simply because those foster parents are gay," said 

                Herb Sosa, Unity Coalition president. "These children have little 

                to no hope of being adopted. We are trying to secure a better 

                future for these kids." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While in Tallahassee, 

                the Unity Coalition will also lobby for more state funding of 

                HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment, a law against bias-related 

                harassment and discrimination in Florida schools, and increased 

                college and university funding for minorities. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Noemi Perez, 

                LLEGO's director of public affairs, and Laura Esquivel, director 

                of public policy and government relations, will attend Thursday's 

                Florida events. "The Unity Coalition of Miami-Dade is doing great 

                work," said Martmn Ornelas-Quintero, LLEGO executive director. 

                "We are happy to participate in the group's efforts to help Florida's 

                children." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The rally and 

                a press conference will take place at noon March 20 at Waller 

                Park on the Florida state capitol grounds. For more information, 

                the Unity Coalition can be contacted at 786-271-6982. A rally 

                was also held this morning in Miami. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Unity Coalition 

                of Miami-Dade was spawned last year from local organizing efforts 

                for LLEGO's biennial international conference in Miami. LLEGO 

                has since supported the coalition with funding and promotion.

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Unity Coalition 

                and LLEGO helped defeat a referendum in September that would have 

                stripped lesbians, gay men and bisexuals in Miami-Dade County 

                of protection from discrimination. The Unity Coalition also helped 

                attain unanimous passage by the Miami-Dade County School Board 

                on March 12 of a resolution endorsing dignity for all students. 

                Also this month, the Coalition convinced the Miami-Dade County 

                Commission to call for all bars, nightclubs, bathhouses and adult 

                stores to post multilingual signs warning about the dangers of 

                unprotected sex. </font>
