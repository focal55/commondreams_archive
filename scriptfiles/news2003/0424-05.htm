- April 24 - All nine Democratic 

presidential candidates this month pledged to defend poor children 

from the Bush Administration's budget war during the Children's 

Defense Fund's Presidential Candidates Forum on Children. While 

the candidates at the forum disagreed on the war overseas, all 

agreed this is not the time to cut essential services for children 

to pay for massive new tax cuts for the rich. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Six in 10 Americans believe that this is not the time for more 

tax cuts, according to an April 14th Associated Press poll. 

Meanwhile, the Bush Administration is planning more than 40 

principal events across the country in the next several days to 

sell its budget and tax plan, which the Congressional Budget Office 

last month found would have a negligible effect on the economy -- 

except for causing the budget deficit to swell over the next 

decade. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Children's Defense Fund President Marian Wright Edelman said 

millionaires didn't need the tax cut Congress gave them two years 

ago, and they don't need a new one now, especially when our nation 

is experiencing a surge in unemployed parents with more and more 

children falling into extreme poverty, and a million American 

children are homeless each year. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We must meet our children's needs during peacetime and wartime, 

during economic prosperity and downturn. How can we take food from 

children to give tax cuts to millionaires?&quot; asked Edelman. &quot;All 

the candidates that gathered with us agreed that it is immoral to 

subsidize massive new tax breaks for the rich on the backs of poor 

children.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts said there are two Americas -- 

the one that politicians talk about and the one where millions of 

children have no health care, are homeless, and lack proper 

nutrition. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It is long since time that we had a president who made real the 

words, Leave No Child Behind(r),&quot; said Kerry. &quot;This administration 

is laying out enormous plans for building roads, schools, hospitals 

and providing books in Iraq, and it's time for us to demand that 

they lay out a plan to do the same here in the United States of 

America.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont noted that we could provide health 

insurance for every child under the age of 18 in this country for 

$200 billion. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It seems to me like that is a better investment,&quot; said Dean. 

&quot;What are we doing voting for $350 billion in tax cuts for people 

that don't need them?&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sen. Bob Graham of Florida opposes a massive tax cut, which not 

only eliminates resources for children, but also leaves them with 

gigantic budget deficits that they will end up paying for in the 

future. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;President George Bush has decided that it is more important to 

give massive tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans than to invest in 

our children. That is wrong,&quot; said Graham. &quot;The question before 

us is what should be our priority? My priority will be our 

children.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri said that we must provide 

health insurance for everyone in America, but we must first pull 

back the President's tax plan. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We have to get rid of almost all of the Bush tax cuts, the one 

last year, and whatever he tries to put on the books this year,&quot; 

said Gephardt. &quot;We cannot have those tax cuts, most of which go to 

the wealthiest Americans in this country.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rep. Dennis Kucinich of Ohio blasted the President's plan to 

implement massive new tax breaks for the rich. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;I mean, let's face it. Poverty's a weapon of mass destruction. 

Homelessness is a weapon of mass destruction,&quot; said Kucinich. &quot;So 

my approach is to look to the heart of America, the social needs of 

America, and to set aside an agenda that calls for tax cuts and 

war.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut noted that we must help 

children at home have a better life by reordering our priorities, 

not financing trillion-dollar tax breaks on the backs of America's 

children. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;If we pull back this outrageously unfair and irresponsible tax 

cut program of President Bush, we could protect our security and 

provide a better life for our children,&quot; said Lieberman. &quot;(The 

President) somehow doesn't think it's a moral issue when -- as a 

result of that tax cut -- you can't afford to support better 

education for our kids, more child care for our kids and health 

care for every American.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rev. Al Sharpton of New York said he would like to see poverty 

and illiteracy toppled in this country. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It doesn't take a leap to pass Dodd-Miller, it doesn't take a 

leap to guarantee health care, it doesn't take a leap to 

immediately kill Bush's tax cuts and invest that in education,&quot; 

said Sharpton. &quot;We need to go on the offensive against an 

administration who will give tax cuts to the rich, cut aid to 

public education, cut aid to day care, turn around and use the 

rhetoric of Leave No Child Behind(r), while they leave the budget 

behind their own proposals of leaving no child behind.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Carol Moseley Braun of Illinois noted that charity begins at 

home, and if we're going to attend to our priorities, we should 

take care of America first and American children first. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The American people are a great people, this is a great 

country, and all we have to do is tap the resources we have to make 

certain that no American is left behind, that every community has 

good jobs in it, that people have hope that they can contribute to 

the whole community to the maximum extent of their ability, whether 

they're black, white, Hispanic, male, or female,&quot; said Braun. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">President George W. Bush said in his January 27, 2001 radio 

address that &quot;Children and parents who have had only bad choices 

need better choices. And it is my duty as president to help them.&quot; 

In remarks to the Nation's Governors State Dinner on February 23, 

2003, the president said, &quot;We share the responsibility for making 

sure every child learns and no child is left behind.&quot; </font></p>
