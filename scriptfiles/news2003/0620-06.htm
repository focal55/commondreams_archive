- June 20 - Statement of Rob Smith, Sierra Club Southwest Regional Director, on Aspen

                                   Fire.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Sierra Club would like to express our sympathies for the families who

have lost their homes in the Aspen Fire burning here in Arizona. We would

also like to thank the firefighters who are putting their lives on the line

to help protect those homes still in harm's way. The Aspen Fire is serving

as a wake-up call for communities across the parched Western landscape.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The fires burning in Arizona today are further evidence that we should befocusing fuel reduction efforts near communities, where homes and lives can

be threatened. The Bush Administration is instead pushing a plan throughCongress that would focus limited funds on logging miles from communities.

The Administration and the Forest Service should be doing everything

possible to help communities help themselves.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The forest health debate is about priorities.  We support thinning

overgrown forests next to communities, such as Summerhaven, to reduce

wildfire risk, but the Bush Administration is more interested in promoting

logging in the backwoods, including an old growth timber sale near the

Grand Canyon.  We need to protect our forest communities first.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Communities across the West are experiencing the same multi-year drought

that helps fuel wildfires. As Westerners, we know that the risk of

wildfires always exists, and also know that there are steps we can take to

help protect homes and lives in our communities. Homeowners have spent the

prolonged spring removing brush and debris from their properties, and

taking other precautions to create defensible space.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We are armed with this knowledge, and we should be doing everything in our

power to help reduce the risk to our communities.&quot;</font></p>
