- May  2 - As the Labor Department 

announced that unemployment rose to 6.0 percent in April, millions 

of unemployed Americans are bracing for the end of federal 

emergency jobless benefits for the second time in five months. In 

January, Congress re-authorized a program that offers 13 weeks of 

federal benefits. After May 31, no new workers will qualify for the 

added benefits. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As the deadline looms large, more than 1.9 million workers (or 

21.8 percent of all unemployed-the highest figure in a decade) were 

officially counted as unemployed and still looking for work after 

six months in April. And today's data reveal that jobless workers 

have been looking for work an average of 19.6 weeks, the longest 

duration in 19 years (January 1984). There are 580,000 more 

long-term unemployed Americans than when Congress passed the 

extension program in 2002. Since then, the federal program has 

helped more than 4.6 million get by in the persistently beleaguered 

labor market. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Over 2.8 million workers have completely run out of federal 

jobless benefits. During the last recession when President 

George H.W. Bush was in office, the federal program provided 26 

weeks of federal extended benefits at its peak, with workers in 

many states receiving 33 weeks. With long-term unemployment now 

just as severe as it was during the last recession (and still 

growing), the 13 weeks of benefits available today are just not 

enough for most families. The time has come for Congress and the 

President to expand the current program to provide no less in aid 

than what was available during the previous recession. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;For the last two years, stubbornly high long term unemployment 

has been the most consistent feature of the sputtering economy. 

Workers continue to bear the brunt of the prolonged slowdown, as 

the clock runs out on their unemployment benefits,&quot; said Maurice 

Emsellem, Director of Public Policy at the National Employment Law 

Project. &quot;At the same time, President Bush and Congressional 

leaders are talking non-stop about tax cuts, while remaining 

entirely silent when it comes to protecting and strengthening the 

federal extension of unemployment benefits.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To make matters worse, this week's round of labor reports 

revealed that the economy lost 48,000 more jobs in April, bringing 

the total private sector job loss over the last two years to 3.2 

million. &quot;America's workers deserve better,&quot; said Emsellem. &quot;They 

need jobs as soon as they can get them, but they need unemployment 

benefits now.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The National Employment Law Project has launched a new 

initiative calling attention to plight of the long-term jobless. 

The &quot;Laid Off &amp; Left Out&quot; initiative has just launched its official 

Web site: <a href="http://www.unemployedworkers.org" target="_new">http://www.unemployedworkers.org</a>. In the coming days, 

NELP will also announce the results of a groundbreaking national 

survey of unemployed workers. For more information, please contact
