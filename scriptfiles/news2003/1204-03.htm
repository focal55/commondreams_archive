-  
December 4 - For the second time in Ms. magazine's 31-year history, Ms. is bringing its annual Women of the Year awards event to the nation's capital. This special event brings women's movement leaders and activists together to honor truly outstanding women's achievements.</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Ever since 1982, when Ms. editors had enough of Time Magazine's Man of the Year cover, Ms. magazine has released its Women of the Year. In 2003, with women's leadership exploding nationally and globally, Ms. had added a new feature. Not only is the annual issue celebrating 10 outstanding Women of the Year, but also 50 women who made a difference in 2003.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;In case there are still some curmudgeons who think only men produce great achievements, even they will have to think again after the Ms. 2003 Women of the Year issue is released,&quot; said FMF President Eleanor Smeal.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Smeal, Ms. Editor-in-Chief, Elaine Lafferty, FMF Board Chair Peg Yorkin, and Ms. Co-Founding Editor Gloria Steinem will lead the awards breakfast for the 2003 Women of the Year at the National Press Club Ballroom on December 8 from 9-11 a.m.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;In a group, the Women of the Year are impressive in a way no single woman could be. They dramatize each other's uniqueness, shatter the stereotype of female sameness, and show the multiplicity of paths toward a shared goal,&quot; Steinem explained. &quot;Over the years, the only thing they have had in common has been a desire to help other women and to credit their community of support.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The 2003 Ms. Women of the Year come together from across the spectrum to further women's struggle for equality,&quot; Yorkin said. &quot;They are women who demand justice in everything they do and look forward to make sure that the future generations of women are not left behind.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The special 2003 Women of the Year issue will be unveiled at the December 8 event. The issue is packed with profiles of the Women of the Year plus the 50 women, many of whom you may not know, who also fought and won in 2003.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Co-founded by Gloria Steinem in 1972, Ms. quickly became a national and international forum for new ideas and issues, investigative journalism, fiction, the arts, political coverage, humor, women's health, and international women's news. As the source of many books, movies, television series, and prize-winning investigative articles, Ms. has been recognized as one of the most influential magazines in history.  On December 31, 2001, the Feminist Majority Foundation became the sole owner of Liberty Media for Women, the publisher of Ms. magazine.
