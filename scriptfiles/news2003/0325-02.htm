                - March 25 - According to newly released statistics from the U.S. 

                Department of Commerce, apparel imports from the Southeast Asian 

                country of Burma dropped by 27% between 2001 and 2002, from $411 

                to $303 million. The sharp decrease resulted from the almost-unprecedented 

                decision by 39 major U.S. retailers to forgo doing business with 

                the Burmese military junta, which is known for horrific human 

                rights abuses including torture, the use of rape as a weapon of 

                war, the recruitment of more child soldiers than any other country 

                in the world, and the use of forced labor and forced child labor 

                in the construction of apparel manufacturing zones. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“We believe 

                that the decision by so many powerful companies to refuse to import 

                goods from a country based on human rights concerns is probably 

                unprecedented,” says Aung Din, a former political prisoner and 

                torture survivor who now serves as Director of Policy at FBC.

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 39 companies 

                include Wal-Mart, Kenneth Cole, Tommy Hilfiger, Jones New York, 

                and Federated Department Stores, owner of Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s. 

                The Free Burma Coalition estimates that these companies sold $381 

                billion in goods last year, putting a huge chunk of the U.S. retail 

                market off-limits to goods made in Burma. Many companies acknowledge 

                that human rights conditions in Burma make doing business there 

                socially irresponsible: “what is going on there [in Burma] is 

                a violation of the philosophy and spirit of our vendor supplier 

                code of conduct,” said a Federated spokesperson in the Los Angeles 

                Times. Since January 2003, 4 more companies have announced a ban 

                on Burma products, including Saks Incorporated and Mothers Work, 

                the largest U.S. maternity-wear retailer. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“One of the 

                only major U.S. retailers still selling Burma products is May 

                Department Stores,” Aung Din says. “We don’t understand why May 

                won’t take a stand for human rights when so many other companies 

                are banning clothes from Burma.” May, which had $13.5 billion 

                in 2002 sales, owns 14 mega-chains including Lord & Taylor, Hechts, 

                Strawbridges, and Foley’s. </font>

                Nobel Peace Prize recipient Aung San Suu Kyi has called for companies 

                to avoid the country, saying that sanctions “send a strong economic 

                and political message” to the military regime. In its latest report 

                on human rights in Burma, the U.S. State Department stated: “Forced 

                labor, including forced child labor, has contributed materially 

                to the construction of industrial parks subsequently used largely 

                to produce manufactured exports including garments.”
