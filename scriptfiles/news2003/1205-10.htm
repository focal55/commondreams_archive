- December 5 - US-based rights groups will announce at a press conference on 10 December 2003 in Washington, DC that they are &#147;joining forces&#148; in a US Human Rights Network to address what they see as the &#147;alarming rate of human rights violations in the US&#148; -- saying that &#147;as the US indulges an increasingly unilateralist bent in both domestic and foreign policy, the cost to rights at home and abroad is mounting.&#148;</FONT><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The groups, which cover such diverse issues as criminal justice, civil rights, immigration and asylum concerns, and economic rights, will launch the US Human Rights Network amid growing concern domestically and internationally that the US sees itself as exempt from international human rights laws and standards. </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;The demonstrations that we are currently seeing against the US around the world are a reaction to the perception that the US &#150; and particularly the Bush administration &#150; thinks it is above international law &#150; laws that the rest of the world are required to abide by,&#148; said Cathy Albisi, of the US Human Rights Network. </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Speaking at the press conference will be Laila Al-Arian, daughter of Florida Professor Sami Al-Arian -- who has been imprisoned on &#147;terror&#148; charges since 20 February 2003 with no evidence having been produced against him.
