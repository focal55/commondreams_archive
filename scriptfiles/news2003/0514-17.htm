- May 14 - <P><LI>BEAU GROSSCUP, <A HREF="mailto:bgrosscup@csuchico.edu">bgrosscup@csuchico.edu</A><BR>

Author of <i>The Newest Explosions of Terrorism</i> and

professor of international relations at California State University in Chico,

Grosscup said on an Institute for Public Accuracy news release on April 3,

2003: &quot;The U.S. invasion of Iraq increases the likelihood of attacks

against the U.S.&quot; He said today: &quot;It would seem that this is the

first shot fired from Al-Qaeda or other anti-Saudi monarchy elements since the

invasion of Iraq, though it's curious that they have not claimed

responsibility.... Just as the U.S. government backed Saddam Hussein during the

height of his atrocities and the Taliban were deemed useful and politically

acceptable business partners if they would make pipeline deals, so too might

allegations of Saudi Arabia's ties to terrorist groups be used as a

justification for military action against the Saudi monarchy if it doesn't

co-operate with western oil interests in the future.&quot;

Director of the World Policy Institute's Arms Trade Resource

Center, Hartung said today: &quot;The fact that one of the targets in Saudi

Arabia was a U.S. private military corporation called Vinnell raises serious

questions about the role of 'executive mercenaries' and corporations that

profit from war and instability. This is the second time in eight years that

Vinnell's operations in Saudi Arabia have been the target of a terrorist

attack. In 1995 a car bomb blasted through an Army training program Vinnell was

involved with.&quot; Hartung wrote an article for the <i>Progressive</i>

magazine about Vinnell entitled &quot;Mercenaries Inc.: How a U.S. Company

Props Up the House of Saud.&quot;

Chatterjee is with CorpWatch and wrote the article

&quot;Vinnell Corporation: 'We Train People to Pull Triggers.'&quot; He said

today: &quot;[Vinnell] has been controlled in the past through a web of

interlocking ownership by a partnership that included James A. Baker III and

Frank Carlucci, former U.S. secretaries of state and defense under presidents

George [H.W.] Bush and Ronald Reagan respectively.... In an interview with <i>Newsweek</i>,

a former U.S. Army officer who now works for Vinnell described the company's

first recruitment as putting together 'a ragtag army of Vietnam veterans for a

paradoxical mission: to train Saudi Arabian troops to defend the very oil

fields that Henry Kissinger recently warned the U.S. might one day have to

invade.' The article quoted another Vinnell employee, also a former U.S. army

officer, as saying: 'We are not mercenaries because we are not pulling

triggers... We train people to pull triggers.'&quot;
