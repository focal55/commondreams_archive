                - April 1 - U.S. ground forces in Iraq are using cluster munitions 

                with a very high failure rate, creating immediate and long-term 

                dangers for civilians and friendly soldiers, Human Rights Watch 

                reported today. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While use of 

                the weapon has not yet been confirmed by official U.S. military 

                sources, it is evident from television images and stories from 

                reporters embedded with U.S. units that U.S. forces are using 

                artillery projectiles and rockets containing large numbers of 

                submunitions, or cluster munitions. When these submunitions fail 

                to explode on impact as designed, they become hazardous explosive 

                "duds"-functioning like volatile, indiscriminate antipersonnel 

                landmines. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Two U.S. Marines 

                were killed in separate incidents on March 27 and 28 after stepping 

                on unexploded cluster munitions delivered by artillery in southern 

                Iraq. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The United 

                States should not be using these weapons," said Steve Goose, executive 

                director of the Arms Division of Human Rights Watch. "Iraqi civilians 

                will be paying the price with their lives and limbs for many years."

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Human Rights 

                Watch has identified footage of the use of the Multiple Launch 

                Rocket System (MLRS) by artillery units of the 3rd Infantry Division. 

                This is a system that currently uses only submunition payloads. 

                The 1st Battalion of the 39th Field Artillery Regiment of the 

                division deploys at least eighteen MLRS launch units. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The standard 

                M26 warhead for the MLRS contains 644 M77 individual submunitions 

                (also called dual-purpose grenades). According to a Department 

                of Defense report submitted to the U.S. Congress in February 2000, 

                these submunitions have a failure rate of 16 percent. Thus, the 

                typical volley of twelve MLRS rockets would likely result in more 

                than 1,200 dud submunitions scattered randomly in a 120,000 to 

                240,000 square meter impact area. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Washington 

                Post reported on March 29 that the U.S. MLRS fired eighteen Army 

                Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) against suspected air defense 

                sites in support of a helicopter attack by units of the 101st 

                Airborne Division on March 28. The payload of an ATACMS is 300 

                or 950 M74 submunitions with a reported failure rate of two percent.

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Human Rights 

                Watch has also seen video of U.S. Marine artillery units supporting 

                the 3rd Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion using 155mm artillery 

                firing projectiles at Iraqi positions; an embedded reporter described 

                "hundreds of grenades" being fired at the Iraqis. These were apparently 

                the M483A1 and M864 projectiles whose submunitions (dual-purpose 

                grenades) have a 14 percent dud rate. The M483A1 projectile contains 

                eighty-eight dual-purpose grenades, and the M864 projectile contains 

                seventy-two dual-purpose grenades. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is not clear 

                whether air-dropped cluster bombs have been used in the air campaign. 

                Iraqi officials have repeatedly alleged use of cluster bombs by 

                U.S. and U.K. aircraft, but these reports have not been confirmed. 

                U.S. air forces used cluster bombs, notably the CBU-87 Combined 

                Effects Munition, extensively in the first Gulf War in 1991, in 

                Yugoslavia/Kosovo in 1999 and in Afghanistan in 2001 and 2002.

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At least eighty 

                U.S. casualties during the 1991 Gulf War were attributed to cluster 

                munition duds. More than 4,000 civilians were killed or injured 

                by cluster munition duds after the end of the war. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Human Rights 

                Watch has called for a global moratorium on use of cluster munitions 

                until the humanitarian problems caused by the weapons are addressed. 

                Short of that commitment, Human Rights Watch has urged the United 

                States and others that may deploy cluster munitions in Iraq to 

                prohibit the use of any cluster munitions in attacks on or near 

                populated areas and to suspend use of cluster munitions that have 

                been tested and identified as producing high dud rates. If cluster 

                munitions are used, it is crucial that the U.S. record, report, 

                track, and mark known or suspected cluster munition strike areas 

                and preserve the information so it can be disseminated quickly 

                in clearance efforts. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The United 

                States must rapidly provide extensive information and warnings 

                to civilian populations to protect them from cluster munition 

                duds," said Goose. "The United States now bears a special responsibility 

                to help clear these deadly remnants of war as quickly as possible."

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Vast numbers 

                of cluster munition duds will complicate the reconstruction of 

                Iraq as well as endangering civilians and peacekeepers, Goose
