- June 3 -  Sierra Club wished Ford Motor Company a happy 100th birthday today, announcing that former Sierra Club President Dr. Robert Cox will run for the company's board of directors in an attempt to improve Ford's environmental record.  The environmental group also released a new ad questioning Ford's commitment to innovation.  The ad points out that the Model T, Ford's first car, got 25 miles to the gallon, better gas mileage than the average Ford vehicle today.

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I want to help make Ford an innovative, technologically-advanced, 21st century company," said Cox.  "By making fuel economy a priority, Ford can recapture lost market share, keep pace with foreign competition, and help protect the environment."

</font>

<p></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Cox, who served as Sierra Club President from 1994-96, and again from 2000-01, would be a voice for innovative thinking and environmental responsibility on Ford's board.  He would urge the company to use fuel economy as an intergrating force in its overall business strategy; to recapture lost market share by aggressively marketing hybrid vehicles; and to stop blocking congressional action to address global warming. Cox will publicize his candidacy over the coming months by appearing on live radio talk shows, and by meeting with supporters across the country.

</font>

<p></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Sierra Club's new ad will run in the New York Times and Business Week, and is timed to coincide with Ford's 100th birthday on June 16th. Produced by Haddow Communications, the ad contrasts the technological advances made in some industries over the last century with Ford's step backwards on fuel economy.  It urges the company to make the next 100 years a true century of innovation.

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ford's recent environmental record has been deeply disappointing.  The average fuel economy of its new vehicles is at a twenty year low.  Last year Ford joined other automakers in a multi-million dollar lobbying effort that convinced Congress to reject higher fuel economy standards. And in April, Ford announced that it was breaking a promise to make a 25% improvement in the fuel economy of its SUVs by 2005.

</font>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The technology exists to allow Ford to achieve a fleet-wide average of 40 miles per gallon.  Better engines, transmissions, aerodynamics, and other technologies could be built into vehicles of all sizes while enhancing performance, safety, and affordability.  But Ford has largely left these innovative technologies on the shelf.  Five years after Toyota put the first hybrid on the market, Ford has yet to get into the game.

</font>

<p></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By using existing techology to make cars and trucks that go much further on a gallon of gas, Ford could save consumers money at the gas pump, help protect the environment, and cut our oil dependence.

</font>

<p></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"We all want to see Ford continue to create jobs for its workers and profits for its shareholders," continued Cox.  "To do that, it needs to embrace 21st century technology and innovation.  That's why I'm running for Ford's board."
