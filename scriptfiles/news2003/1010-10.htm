<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">S. YARMOUTH, MA - October 10 - The Program on Corporations, Law &amp; Democracy (POCLAD) today posted a  &#147;<a href="http://www.poclad.org/ModelLegalBrief.cfm" target="_new">Model Legal Brief to Eliminate Corporate Rights</a>&#148; to its website, making it available to help citizen groups create winning organizing strategies by stripping constitutional protections from corporations and preventing them from governing their communities. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

        Richard Grossman, co-founder of POCLAD, authored the brief with Thomas Linzey, Esq., president of the <a href="http://www.celdf.org/" target="_new">Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund</a>, (CELDF) a public interest law firm in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, and Dan Brannen, a Santa Fe attorney. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

        The Brief was created to support community leaders and citizens across the United States who are confronting the array of judicially bestowed constitutional rights wielded by corporations. The Brief not only challenges &#147;corporate personhood&#148; &#150; the theory that corporations possess the constitutional rights of people and therefore may use the Bill of Rights to get courts and police to deny people&#146;s fundamental rights, but also confronts the powers corporations wield under the Commerce and Contracts Clauses of the U.S. Constitution. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

        Grossman, of Milton Mills, New Hampshire, has written extensively on corporate and legal history.  He pointed out that, &#147;This brief is intended to assist communities challenging the U.S. government&#146;s gift of constitutional powers to property organized as corporations.  Accordingly, it is NOT about corporate responsibility, corporate ethics, corporate codes of conduct, good corporate &#145;citizenship,&#146; corporate crime, corporate reform, consumer protection, stakeholders, or fixing regulatory agencies.&#148; </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

         The Brief contains a history showing how federal courts gradually granted more Bill of Rights protections to corporations over the past 150 years.  It finds that &#147;corporations regularly and illegitimately deny the people their inalienable rights,&#148; and concludes that such denials &#147;are beyond the authority of the corporation to exercise&#133;beyond the authority of the Courts, or any other branches of government, to confer&#133;(and deny) the people their ability to govern themselves.&#148; </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

         The Brief outlines several cases to show that &#147;such assessments are not ivory tower academic theories, but frightening reality,&#148; including how: </font>
