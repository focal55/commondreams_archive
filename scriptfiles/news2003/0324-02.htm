                - March 24 - Co-op America, a national consumer education organization, 

                is reaching out to tens of thousands of consumers across the country 

                to ask retail giant Safeway to offer Fair Trade Certified Coffee 

                in their Safeway Select line. Currently, a worldwide slump in 

                coffee prices is resulting in joblessness and starvation for thousands 

                of coffee farmers, while corporate coffee giants make windfall 

                profits. Consumers will ask Safeway to help alleviate the impact 

                of the crisis by introducing Fair Trade Certified coffee into 

                their Safeway Select line, which guarantees coffee farmers a minimum 

                price of $1.26 per pound versus the pennies they receive on the 

                open market. Consumers can receive "The Fair Trade Solution," 

                a FREE action guide about the crisis and the positive role that 

                Safeway and other supermarkets can play by contacting Co-op America 

                at 1-800-58 GREEN or online at <a href="http://www.fairtradeaction.org" target="_new">www.fairtradeaction.org</a>. 

                The request from consumers for Safeway to introduce Fair Trade 

                Certified Coffee in the Safeway Select line is part of a larger 

                campaign of social justice and environmental groups, led by Co-op 

                America, that aims at encouraging more mainstream coffee roasters 

                to convert a percentage of their coffee to Fair Trade, which will 

                dramatically help grow the market for Fair Trade coffee, and provide 

                a living wage for thousands of farmers. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We are asking 

                consumers to let Safeway know every time they go to the supermarket 

                that they demand Fair Trade coffee," said Alisa Gravitz, Executive 

                Director of Co-op America. "Now is the time for corporate retailers 

                to put their considerable purchasing power to work for a brighter 

                future for coffee farmers." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Consumers are 

                being asked to use the power of their wallets when they are in 

                the supermarket in support of Fair Trade. In particular, Co-op 

                America is asking consumers to fill out consumer comment cards 

                the next time they are in Safeway supermarkets and ask for Fair 

                Trade Certified coffee to be introduced into the Safeway Select 

                line. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In conjunction 

                with the campaign, FREE copies of a consumer action guide "The 

                Fair Trade Solution" are available by calling Co-op America at 

                1-800-58-GREEN. The guide includes information about the coffee 

                crisis and Fair Trade as a solution, as well as action steps, 

                including postcards for consumers to use at the supermarket to 

                ask for Fair Trade Certified coffee, and a list of resources for 

                where to buy Fair Trade. For more information about Fair Trade 

                coffee consumers can also visit <a href="http://www.fairtradeaction.org" target="_new">www.fairtradeaction.org</a>.
