                - April 3 - From April 6-9, Derrick Span, national president of 

                the Community Action Partnership, will stay overnight in two of 

                America's poorest communities as a part of his A Conversation 

                with America National Poverty Tour. The trips will allow him to 

                get a personal perspective of the problems faced everyday by the 

                nation's poor and see what the Partnership's member Community 

                Action Agencies (CAAs) are doing to address and eliminate these 

                problems. Span's first stop will be in Cleveland, Mississippi, 

                where he will stay with a single mother and her four children. 

                He will participate in the family's daily activities, including 

                attending Head Start classes with the youngest daughter and going 

                to work at a hospice with the mother. Span will also visit the 

                school where the mother became a certified nursing assistant. 

                In addition to spending time with the family, Span will tour impoverished 

                areas in Bolivar County, Mississippi, and meet with families. 

                A special highlight of the tour will be stops at apartment complexes 

                and Head Start Centers managed by the Bolivar County Community 

                Action Agency. Span then heads to Rio Grande City, Texas, where 

                he will stay with a mason, his wife, and their extended family. 

                His day will begin early as he heads to work with the father, 

                followed by a tour of the "colonias," un-zoned, semi-rural communities. 

                Span will also visit programs operated by the Community Action 

                Council of South Texas, including health clinics; an adult day 

                care center; and Youthbuild, a GED and vocational skills training 

                program. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Partnership 

                chose to visit these two communities because they are two of the 

                most impoverished areas in the United States, according to recent 

                US Census Bureau figures. Cleveland, Mississippi, located in the 

                Mississippi Delta, grapples with a lack of affordable housing 

                and transportation, teen pregnancy, and unemployment. Rio Grande 

                City is located in Starr County, Texas, argued to be the poorest 

                county in America. There is a high demand for healthcare, and 

                affordable housing and adult education opportunities are limited. 

                Water quality is a concern because many of the colonias are without 

                wastewater systems. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These overnight 

                visits represent an unprecedented endeavor for the Partnership. 

                "We want to make poverty the focus of our nation because this 

                issue has been ignored for far too long," said Span. "We feel 

                these visits will help us reveal the faces of poverty and advocate 

                for national policies that will help low-income people change 

                their lives." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Key aspects 

                of the visits will be captured on video and shown at various functions. 

                "We wanted to document the challenges poor people face and put 

                it into perspective for the general public," noted Span. The footage 

                will also spotlight successful CAA programs and services. "The 

                Bolivar County CAA and CACST are perfect examples of how CAAs 

                are working to transform communities," said Span. "Bolivar County 

                is running Head Start programs to help low-income children get 

                an early opportunity to change their lives. And CACST's Youthbuild 

                gives troubled teens a second chance." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Span warned 

                that CAAs will need additional resources to continue providing 

                new and innovative programs for their communities. "It is critical 

                that our CAAs have access to as many resources as possible. We 

                hope these visits will open up more avenues for CAAs to tap into 

                additional funding resources and greater opportunities." Based 

                in Washington, DC, the Community Action Partnership is the national 

                association representing the interests of the 1,000 Community 

                Action Agencies (CAAs) organized to change people's lives, embody 

                the spirit of hope, improve communities, and make America a better 

                place to live. CAAs care about the entire community and are dedicated 

                to helping people help themselves and each other. For more information
