- November 17 - ADA President Emeritus Jim Jontz Speak Out Against FTAA.</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Ten 
years ago today, the U.S. House voted by a narrow margin to approve the North 
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). This week, tens of thousands of citizens 
are in Miami, Florida, to raise their collective voice against the expansion of 
NAFTA into the proposed Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA).</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The 
workers, farmers, environmentalists, religious leaders, students, retirees, and 
community activists who are here in Miami are not against trade. We're not against 
trade agreements. We are against agreements that are so heavy weighted, as NAFTA 
is, toward the interests of investors and corporations at the expense of everyone 
else.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">What exactly 
did NAFTA do? Indeed, it took down tariffs on various products traded among the 
signatory countries, but it did much more. NAFTA is fundamentally an investor's 
protection agreement, a collection of provisions to facilitate the flow of capital 
to where wages are lower and environmental protections weaker. NAFTA obligated 
the Mexican government to make changes in their intellectual property law, financial 
system, and currency rules, all to benefit investors. And NAFTA included strong 
protection against expropriation, even including protection for multinational 
companies against regulation that was &quot;tantamount to expropriation&quot; 
in its impact, allowing companies to file suit against governments to enforce 
these protections (Chapter 11).</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The 
results have been rather predictable: written to facilitate the flow of capital 
into Mexico, NAFTA has done just that. But absent protections in NAFTA for labor 
and the environment, workers in Mexico haven't received their share of benefits; 
they haven't become middle class consumers of U.S. products, and the jobs that 
were supposed to be created in the U.S. as a result don't exist. Instead, workers 
and the environment in both countries have suffered. Low priced grain flowing 
into Mexico from the U.S. has pushed campesinos off the land and into the labor 
markets -- in both Mexico and the U.S. This is not the &quot;win-win&quot; we 
were promised.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Today 
the Bush administration seeks to extend NAFTA through the hemisphere (except Cuba), 
and also to expand the coverage of the agreement beyond manufacturing and agriculture 
to the remainder of the economy. Under the FTAA, multinational corporations would 
be given new rights to invest offshore in &quot;services&quot; -- including education, 
health care, the public sector, postal delivery, construction, transportation, 
even water supply. These &quot;services&quot; provisions would further undermine 
the interests or workers, consumers, and the environment here and abroad.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">When 
NAFTA passed the House of Representatives ten years ago, lawmakers had serious 
reservations. In fact, the Congress would not have approved NAFTA absent the efforts 
of President Clinton. The Clinton Administration took extraordinary steps, even 
promising lawmakers help on public works projects in their districts, to find 
the votes they needed. As Bob Wages, then President of the Oil, Chemical, and 
Atomic Workers (OCAW) said, &quot;Clinton couldn't sell NAFTA, so he bought it.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">There 
is a lesson for us today. The President of the United States has enormous clout 
regarding the rules of international trade and the Congress.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The 
agenda the Bush administration is pushing this week in Miami would lock into international 
law big-time benefits for multinational corporations at the expense of us all. 
We can, and must, do better.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The 
good news is that, given the timetable for negotiating the FTAA, there's little 
chance it will be done by time George W. Bush leaves office in 2005.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">As 
the nine Democratic Presidential candidates crisscross the nation looking for 
support, we must secure their commitment now to oppose the FTAA and the remainder 
of the Bush trade agenda. The candidates need to make clear that, when elected, 
they won't put a few &quot;bells and whistles&quot; on the Bush FTAA and give 
it their blessing.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Democrats 
running for President cannot tell us that they support workers, the environment, 
public services, human rights, and family farmers, and then have any hesitation 
about how they stand on the FTAA. That's a painful lesson from ten years of NAFTA.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><I>Jim 
Jontz was the director of the Citizens Trade Campaign which led the fight against 
NAFTA in 1993, and today is President Emeritus of Americans for Democratic Action.</I></FONT></P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p></font><!-- #EndEditable --></td></tr>
