- October 1 - The polluter funded trust from which the Superfund program got its name is effectively bankrupt today, causing regular taxpayers to pay up to 317% more to clean up toxic waste sites next year than in 1995, the year Superfund's polluter pays fees expired, according to an analysis by U.S. PIRG. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A recent report by the General Accounting Office (GAO) confirmed that Superfund's trust fund would be essentially gone by September 30-- the end of fiscal year 2003-- leaving regular taxpayers to shoulder the financial burden for toxic waste cleanups. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The bankruptcy of the Superfund trust fund marks a dramatic shift in toxic waste cleanup policy. The Bush Administration is letting polluting industries off the hook again and leaving regular taxpayers to pay cleanup costs,&quot; said Julie Wolk, Environmental Health Advocate for U.S. PIRG.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1995, the year Superfund's polluter pays fees expired, taxpayers paid for only 18% of the Superfund program, or $300 million. Next year, American taxpayers will pay between $1.1 and $1.265 billion for the program, an increase of between 263% and 317%. Meanwhile, large polluting corporations enjoy a $4 million per day tax break as long as the Superfund polluter pays fees are not reinstated.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Former Presidents Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and Clinton all collected or supported reinstatement of the polluter pays fees, but the Bush administration has expressed its opposition to reinstating the fees.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;At the same time that taxpayers are paying more and polluters are paying less, the number of Superfund sites getting cleaned up has been cut in half,&quot; said Wolk. &quot;Under the Bush Administration, the one in four Americans, including more than 10 million children, who still lives within four miles of a Superfund toxic waste site will continue to be exposed to toxic chemicals,&quot; Wolk concluded.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Last year, the Bush Administration cleaned up only 42 Superfund toxic waste sites and expects to clean up approximately 40 sites this year. This is a more than 50% decrease from the late 1990's when EPA cleaned up an average of 87 sites per year. According to a congressionally requested study completed in 2001, the Bush administration has under-funded the Superfund program by between $1.2 and $1.8 billion from 2001-2004.</font></p>
