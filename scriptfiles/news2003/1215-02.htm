- December 15 - Last-ditch World Trade Organisation (WTO) negotiations are scheduled to take place in Geneva during the week of the 15th December, and appear to be &#150; yet again &#150; in deadlock.</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">But, argues Friends of the Earth International, no deal is still better than a bad deal when it comes to trying to revive negotiations that collapsed in Cancun (Mexico) in September.[1]</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Following the collapse of the trade talks, 15th December was slated by governments as the date for the final resolution of outstanding differences. Yet, following a series of closed-door meetings in Geneva, and despite a &#145;period of reflection&#146; by the European Union, very little seems to have changed. </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Indeed, at an informal Heads of Delegation meeting in Geneva last week it became clear that no new negotiating text is expected, as governments have so far refused to change their positions, especially on agriculture and investment liberalisation.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;This cannot be seen as just another missed deadline,&#148; said Ronnie Hall of Friends of the Earth International &#147;WTO negotiations have stalled again and again because they cannot deliver what people really need &#150; healthy, thriving local economies everywhere and  sustainable levels of natural resource use.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Now is the time for the EU and the US to realise that they must give up their corporate-driven market-opening agenda, exchanging it for a progressive approach to developing fair and sustainable economies that work for everyone,&#148; she added.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">According to Friends of the Earth International, now is the time for governments around the world to realise that the current WTO does not and cannot deliver fair and sustainable economies. What is needed is a real and far-reaching shift in the way governments approach the management of our economies at the national, regional and international levels [2].</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">There is no need to abandon a system of multilateral trade rules. But there is a pressing need to look at the current set of WTO trade-liberalisating rules, which favour rich countries, rich companies and rich people, at the expense of poor countries, poor communities and the environment. First steps in this direction could be taken by governments meeting in Geneva, who should agree to:</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">*          Accept an independent and comprehensive review of the last Uruguay Round of trade negotiations (and initiate discussion on this in the upcoming UNCTAD XI Ministerial in June 2004). [3]</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">*          Stop the expansion of the current WTO by rejecting any new issues outright.[4]</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">*          Move negotiations concerning the potential conflict between trade rules and multilateral environmental agreements to the less biased United Nations. [5]</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">*          Replace export-oriented agricultural policies with a focus on food sovereignty and sustainable agriculture.
