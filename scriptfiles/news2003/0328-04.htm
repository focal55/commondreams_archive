                NEW YORK - March 28 - International women's organizations, including 

                MADRE, Women of Color Resource Center, Center for Women's Global 

                Leadership, and the International Women's Human Rights Law Clinic, 

                today joined other women's organizations worldwide as they called 

                on the member states of the United Nations General Assembly to 

                enact an emergency application of UN Resolution 377 ("Uniting 

                for Peace") to stop the US-led bombing of Iraq and protect Iraqi 

                civilians. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Uniting for 

                Peace provides that in the event of a "threat to the peace or 

                act of aggression," which the Security Council does not counter, 

                the General Assembly "shall consider the matter immediately." 

                The Assembly can recommend collective measures, including the 

                use of armed forces, to member states to "maintain or restore 

                international peace and security." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This action 

                follows a recent call in New Delhi made by women's organizations 

                from over 35 countries condemning the Bush Administration's war 

                against Iraq and urging the General Assembly to challenge US aggression. 

                The organizations also condemn the Bush Administration's attempts 

                to undermine the United Nations, which have been reported in the 

                Chilean newspaper, La Tercera, and other sources. According to 

                those reports, the US has issued a warning to the 191 UN member 

                states, demanding that the General Assembly not convene an emergency 

                session to address the US attack on Iraq. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In their open 

                letter to the UN General Assembly, the group of organizations 

                stated, "The bribery and bullying that the Bush Administration 

                calls diplomacy reflects its brazen contempt for democracy both 

                in the US and abroad. Bush has claimed that the United Nations 

                would render itself irrelevant if it did not submit to his demands. 

                But as the decrepit state of the US Democratic Party reveals, 

                it is those who collude with illegitimate power that render themselves 

                irrelevant. Meanwhile, the resolve of many UN member states to 

                stand firm against the US, reinforced by the call to enact Uniting 

                for Peace, offer hope for a revitalized international system better 

                able to fulfill the United Nation's founding mission to 'save 

                succeeding generations from the scourge of war.'" </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The groups 

                first issued the call to enact Uniting for Peace on September 

                12, 2002, when Bush declared, in a speech at the United Nations, 

                his intent to escalate hostilities against Iraq. Since then, the 

                threat posed by his Administration to the people of Iraq, and 

                indeed, to the people of the world, has mushroomed. The world 

                now faces a nuclear-armed religious fundamentalist who, according 

                to journalists who have interviewed him extensively, believes 

                that he was placed in the White House by God to carry out a divine 

                mission. With Bush's doctrine of preventive war justifying an 

                attack against any country that he claims is a threat to present 

                or future US interests, the world is his target. The Bush Administration 

                is indeed a grave threat to international peace and security and 

                must be challenged by a multi-lateral effort aimed at protecting 

                the principles and practices of international cooperation and 

                the rule of law. The organizations made the following declarations 

                to the General Assembly: </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* "We therefore 

                reiterate our call on the United Nations General Assembly to convene 

                an emergency session to enact United Nations resolution 377, Uniting 

                for Peace to halt the US-led bombing and protect the human rights 

                of Iraqi civilians. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* "We condemn 

                the Bush Administration's plan to sideline UN relief agencies 

                and turn Iraq's reconstruction into a bonanza for US-based corporations. 

                We urge the General Assembly to address the issue of reconstruction 

                and to guarantee the social and economic rights of Iraqi women 

                and their families in the reconstruction process."
