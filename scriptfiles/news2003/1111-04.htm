  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON - November 11 -</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What: One thousand AIDS activists are expected to join in an angry march to the White House to protest Bush Administration policies on HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment and care in the U.S. and around the world.
  </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When: Monday, November 24, 2003 at noon to mark the beginning of World AIDS Day commemoration activities.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Where: Protestors from around the country will meet at McPherson Square, 15th &amp; K Sts NW and march to the office of the U.S. Trade Representative, 17th &amp; L Sts NW, and then on to the White House.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Why: Policy and funding decisions made by the Bush Administration are thwarting effective responses to AIDS, and jeopardizing the lives and health of people with HIV and people at highest risk of infection, according to activists. Reactionary conservatism trumps best practice in HIV prevention, Bush's Global AIDS Bill is not funded at the full amount signed into law this year, domestic care and prevention programs are flat funded while numbers of people living with HIV continue to rise, and U.S. trade policy blocks access to low cost generic medicines in poor countries.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Note: On November 24, the Coalition will also release a &quot;Year in
    Review: the AIDS Crisis and the Bush Administration,&quot; for 2003, illustrating the gap between &quot;compassionate&quot; rhetoric and the cruel realities of Bush Administration policies on HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment and care in the U.S. and around the globe. The &quot;Year in Review&quot; will include:</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">* A budget analysis with actual spending vs. White House announcements in Bush's domestic and global AIDS programs,<br>
    * A comprehensive assessment of White House Administration obstruction of effective science-based HIV prevention programs<br>
    * New evidence of pharmaceutical industry collusion with US trade negotiators to obstruct low-cost generic medicines access in heavily impacted countries.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The World AIDS Day Coalition is comprised of international and domestic AIDS service, prevention, and activist organizations,
