- December 4 - STATEMENT BY CARL POPE, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;In announcing a new air pollution trading program, the Bush administration is trying to sell the public a misguided policy--like a car with a nice paint job but no engine under the hood.  Clear standards and strong enforcement of the Clean Air Act are what has driven air pollution reductions for decades.  Now the Bush administration wants to replace that successful model with a program that sounds nice but in fact would continue to allow America's worst polluters to continue to release dangerous amounts of soot, smog, and mercury.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The trading program mentioned today offers little comfort in light of the administration's dismantling of the New Source Review provision of the Clean Air Act, a program which applies to oldest and worst polluting powerplants and refineries in the country.   Worse, the Bush administration even admitted today that it still plans to continue pursuing its broader goal of replacing much of the existing Clean Air Act with the weaker trading scheme favored by oil and coal companies and utilities.  The EPA's own numbers say that leaving the Clean Air Act alone would reduce power plant emissions nearly twice as fast as the Bush administration's broader proposal.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The provisions dealing with mercury are even more disturbing given the toxicity of that particular substance.  By tolerating significant amounts of mercury pollution under a trading program, the Bush administration is turning a blind eye to women and children who are the most vulnerable to the effects of mercury.  The EPA and the National Academy of Sciences estimate that approximately 60,000 newborn infants annually may be at risk for neurodevelopmental effects from in utero exposure to mercury.  The Bush administration's broader changes to the Clean Air Act would triple the amount of mercury allowed under the current law.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;There is a better way.  We have the technology to cut power plant emissions.  Requiring industry to use that technology would save lives, clean up the air, and keep a commitment made 30 years ago when the Clean Air Act was first created.&quot;</FONT></P><P></P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p></font><!-- #EndEditable --></td></tr>
