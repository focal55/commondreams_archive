<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Instead of setting an example, it is in the biggest companies that pay is growing fastest. Total compensation for CEOs in the S&amp;P 500 grew at a faster rate from 2001 to 2002 than it did for CEOs at companies outside the S&amp;P 500. The average increase in total compensation for S&amp;P 500 CEOs was 63.24 percent, compared to 51.02 percent for CEOs of non S&amp;P 500 companies. &#147;We look to the largest companies to lead the way in reform, but only a very few have made any attempt to rein in compensation,&#148; said Paul Hodgson, senior research associate at The Corporate Library and author of the report, 'What Really Happened to CEO Pay in 2002', published today, The analysis is based on a matched sample of 1,019 CEOs who were in the job for the full fiscal year in 2001 and in 2002. The average increase in total annual compensation &#150; including base salary and annual bonus &#150; was also higher in the S&amp;P 500 than in companies outside that group. The average rate of increase in total annual compensation was 26.65 percent for S&amp;P 500 CEOs and 23.28 percent for other CEOs. Over the same period, the S&amp;P 500 Index was down 23.3% and the S&amp;P 1500 Index was down 22.5%. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Given the relatively low increases seen for base salary, the growth rate for total annual compensation and total compensation shows a significant rise in incentive payments. Total compensation includes all long-term incentives &#150; restricted stock grants, profits from stock options and other long-term bonus payouts. But the economy&#146;s performance would not seem to justify such growth rates. Some analyses from earlier in the year suggested that the recovery in incentives was a result of particularly poor performance in 2001, it was pay bouncing back from a bad year. But, in a separate analysis of matched CEOs in the S&amp;P 500, Hodgson confirmed that 2002 also showed real growth over pay in 2000. Bonuses, restricted stock grants and profits from stock options were all higher in 2002 than in 2000. &#147;To confirm the overall impression of continuously climbing CEO compensation, the median increase in total compensation for this same matched group of CEOs was 90.83 percent between 2000 and 2002,&#148; commented Hodgson. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The survey also looks at compensation levels for a larger sample of CEOs who have been in their jobs for the full 2002 fiscal year. Average total compensation for CEOs in the S&amp;P 500 was nearly $6.4MM, and nearly $2.4MM for other CEOs. The highest total compensation for an S&amp;P 500 CEO was found at Tenet Healthcare, where CEO Jeffrey Barbakow received a total of $116,682,680 largely as a result of the exercise of 3MM stock options. Outside the S&amp;P 500, Dwight Schar, CEO of construction company NVR, earned the highest total compensation of $94,303,279, again largely due to profits from the exercise of options. &#147;While the returns on the exercise of stock options by NVR&#146;s CEO Dwight Schar could be considered excessive, there is little doubt that the company has performed extremely well over the long term, with a total stockholder return over five years of 926.93 compared to 11.76 for its construction industry peers. Even with the award of index-linked stock options, the rewards would have been extremely high. Schar made a profit of around $261 per share on the exercise of 333,333 options,&#148; said Hodgson. </font></p>
