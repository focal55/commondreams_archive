-  
November 6 - In a letter mailed today, Citizen Works founder Ralph Nader called on Attorney General John Ashcroft to include statistics on corporate crime in the FBI's annual &quot;Crime in America Report,&quot; an annual compendium of crime statistics that focuses only on street crimes such as murder, rape, robbery, and burglarly while entirely ignoring the growing epidemic of corporate crime.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Because the FBI does not collect data on corporate crime, both the American public and the law enforcement community lack good information on what has become a pressing national problem &#151; a corporate crime wave,&quot; wrote Nader and Citizen Works communications director Lee Drutman. &quot;Comprehensive data on corporate crime would help law enforcement officials to better analyze patterns and better direct resources. Information is also a powerful tool for public support of strong law enforcement, and the lack of it hampers your efforts to stay true to your tough words on corporate crime.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The letter notes that, &quot;Where the costs [of corporate crime] have been estimated, the numbers are staggering. Most credible estimates confirm that, in the aggregate, white-collar and corporate crimes cost the U.S. hundreds of billions of dollars annually &#151; far more than conventional categories of crime such as burglary and robbery &#151; and cause many preventable deaths, injuries, and disease.&quot;</font></p>
