lodged a formal complaint with the European Ombudsman objecting to the European 

Commission's repeated refusal to release documents relating to World Trade 

Organisation (WTO) negotiations on trade in services [1].

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The documents the European Union's executive Commission refuses to release relate 

to the various requests for liberalisation made to the European Union

(EU) by other 

countries and the equivalent requests made by the EU to other countries [2]. The 

various requests have all been made in the context of the WTO negotiations on trade 

in services (GATS).[3]</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Serious concerns at the manner in which the GATS round has been negotiated led 

earlier this year to a formal call by European and UK parliamentarians to the 

Commission to account for its actions before the European Parliament and to ensure 

that its negotiations were conducted in an open and transparent way with the 

involvement of the European Parliament [4].</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Friends of the Earth is also concerned to ensure that, in the face of EU calls for a sweeping expansion of WTO powers at the Cancun WTO Ministerial meeting in 

September this year, such questions of democratic legitimacy are answered fully and 

plainly.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Friends of the Earth Corporate Globalisation campaigner, Eve Mitchell

said: &quot;Given the sweeping powers of WTO agreements and the potential of GATS to affect 

much of our daily lives, it is vital that the process by which those agreements are 

reached is transparent and democratic. The GATS process has been neither. 

Parliamentarians and members of the public have simply not had access to key 

information.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Friends of the Earth's Legal Advisor, Phil Michaels said:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The fact that we have had to make this complaint shows how far the Commission still 

has to travel to meet its stated aim to give the 'fullest possible effect to the right of 

public access to documents' and to bring about greater openness in the work of the 

institutions.  The main reason given by the Commission for the refusal to release the 

documents is that doing so would harm the sovereignty of the EU and its member 

states. The Commission's argument holds no water either in fact or law and we 

strongly hope that the Ombudsman upholds our complaint.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NOTES</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">[1] The requests were made by Friends of the Earth England, Wales, Northern Ireland 

(EWNI) under &quot;Regulation 1049/2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, 

Council and Commission documents&quot;.  The Commission has repeatedly refused 

access to these documents on  the basis that to do so would 'undermine the protection 

of the public interest as regards international relations' (Regulation 4(1)(a)).  The 

request has been refused twice following which it is open to an applicant to commence 

proceedings before the Ombudsman by way of a formal complaint.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">[2] The documents requested consist of:

a) Requests made by the EU to other WTO members in the context of the WTO negotiations on trade in services in accordance with the Doha Development Agenda;

b) All Requests and supplementary Requests made by non-EU WTO members to the 

EU

c) The Draft Initial Offer by the EU to non-EU WTO members.</font></p>
