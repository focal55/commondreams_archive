                - March 20 - The House Budget Committee's proposal, as submitted 

                by Chairman Nussle, currently includes $92 billion in Medicaid 

                cuts and $2billion in SCHIP cuts. We expect a vote on the budget 

                sometime today, March 20. This resolution would require the Energy 

                and Commerce Committee to institute these Medicaid cuts as part 

                of a reconciliation bill. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Such devastating 

                cuts will create enormous hardship. Medicaid provides health insurance 

                to America's most vulnerable seniors, children, working families, 

                and people with disabilities. States need more, not less, federal 

                Medicaid funding to sustain their current Medicaid programs and 

                avoid instituting even greater cutbacks that add to the ranks 

                of the uninsured. </font>

                copied below is a letter signed by over 130 organizations opposing 

                these cuts to the Medicaid program in the House budget. This letter 

                was sent to the members of the Energy and Commerce and Budget 

                Committees. _________________ </font>

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The undersigned 

                organizations strongly oppose any cuts to the Medicaid program 

                as part of the fiscal year 2004 budget resolution. As you know, 

                the budget resolution reported by the House Budget Committee would 

                require an estimated $95 billion in cuts to Medicaid over the 

                next 10 years. Such cuts would irreparably harm the millions of 

                Americans now receiving essential health care coverage through 

                the Medicaid program. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Medicaid provides 

                health insurance to America's most vulnerable seniors, children, 

                pregnant women, working families, and people with disabilities. 

                Seniors receive prescription drug coverage and long-term care 

                services through Medicaid. Children obtain vital screening and 

                prevention services under Medicaid. Medicaid also provides the 

                crucial services such as personal care and therapy that people 

                with disabilities need. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Budget 

                Committee's resolution would require the Energy and Commerce Committee 

                to institute Medicaid cuts of an estimated $95 billion as part 

                of a reconciliation bill. Such devastating cuts will create enormous 

                hardship. These cuts would occur as states are facing the most 

                severe budget crisis since World War II. States need more, not 

                less, federal Medicaid funding to sustain their current Medicaid 

                programs and avoid instituting even greater cutbacks that add 

                to the ranks of the uninsured. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We urge you 

                to oppose any Medicaid cuts as part of the fiscal year 2004 budget 

                and to ensure the elimination of the reconciliation instructions 

                directing that the Energy and Commerce Committee to institute 

                these unacceptable cuts. We also ask you to oppose any cuts to 

                Medicaid in the final budget resolution conference report adopted 

                by Congress. </font>
