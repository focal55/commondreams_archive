- November 12 - Attorneys with  Earthjustice and the Center for Food Safety filed suit in federal  district court in Honolulu today asking the court to order the  U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to assess the environmental  and public health risks of, and better regulate, the open-air  testing of biopharmaceutical test crops in Hawaii and throughout  the United States. The attorneys represent a coalition that  includes Friends of the Earth, KAHEA, Pesticide Action Network  North America, and Center for Food Safety.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">   USDA has authorized corporations such as Monsanto, DuPont,  ProdiGene, and Dow to conduct hundreds of field tests of biopharm  crops genetically engineered to produce pharmaceuticals,  industrial chemicals, and other medical and industrial products,  including a blood clotting agent, a blood thinner, various blood  proteins, experimental animal vaccines, industrial enzymes,  antibodies, and a potent abortion-inducing compound once  considered for use as an AIDS drug.  Well over 4,000 field tests  of genetically engineered crops have been conducted in Hawaii,  more than anywhere else in the world, including more than two  dozen tests of biopharm crops.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">   None of these biopharm crops has been approved for human or  animal consumption, or even for general release into the  environment. Despite 12 years of open-air field testing, not a  single plant-produced biopharm drug has been approved by the FDA.   Yet USDA allows these tests to be conducted in open fields,  conceals the trials' locations from the public, and in most cases  refuses to disclose the substances being grown. Moreover, the  tests typically use food crops like corn and soybeans,  dramatically increasing the risk of contaminating the food or  livestock feed supply with powerful, biologically active  chemicals.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">   Farmers are kept in the dark about biopharm experiments taking  place in their vicinity, and other members of the public are  unaware that experimental drugs and chemicals could contaminate  their food. Yet neither USDA nor any other government agency has  prepared an Environmental Impact Statement or assessed the risk  to endangered species. USDA's regulation of field-testing is  inadequate to assure that biopharm crops do not contaminate soil  or food supplies, harm humans or wildlife, or cross-breed with  wild or other farmed plants. This lack of oversight violates the  National Environmental Policy Act and the Endangered Species Act.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> "The shroud of secrecy surrounding biopharming is  unacceptable," said Paul Achitoff of Earthjustice. "Members of  the public have the right to know about these potentially harmful  substances being grown in their backyards."</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">   Biopharm testing in Hawaii carries risks above and beyond  those of testing elsewhere. Hawaii has over 300 endangered  species - more than a third of all U.S. endangered species and  more per square mile than anywhere else on earth - and about 97  percent of all native species in Hawaii are found nowhere else.  Open-air biopharm field trials risk catastrophic impacts to these  species.  </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">   Hawaii also hosts a large seed corn industry, valued at $35  million annually and using about 3,000 acres, that ships seed all  over the world. Corn is the most popular biopharm crop, and corn  also disperses pollen over a wide area, where it may pass its  genetic material to seed corn. Last year the U.S. Environmental  Protection Agency fined Dow AgroSciences and Pioneer Hi-Bred  International for increasing the risk of cross-breeding by  failing to comply with permits to test non-biopharm genetically  engineered corn on Kaua`i and Moloka`i.  </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> "Open-air testing of genetically engineered plants in  vulnerable ecosystems presents unacceptable risks to Hawaii's  fragile biodiversity," said Cha Smith, executive director of  KAHEA.  "Pollen from plants that are engineered to produce  powerful chemicals will assuredly be carried by trade winds and  eaten by insects and birds. There is no way to prevent the spread  of genetic material to native plants and animals."</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">   A 2002 study by the National Academy of Sciences found the  environmental impacts of biopharm agriculture cannot be  predicted, and that the novel compounds being produced by these  plants may contaminate human and animal food supplies. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> "Despite the Starlink corn fiasco, regulation of biotech crops  remains way behind the science," said Skip Spitzer, program  coordinator at Pesticide Action Network North America. StarLink  is a transgenic corn variety that was approved only for animal  feed but found its way into the human food supply, prompting  hundreds of product recalls.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">   Other scientific reviews indicate that, despite USDA's  existing regulatory program, growing such crops could: </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">   (a) Spread new and unwanted compounds into the air, water,  soil, foods and beverages that could threaten public health; </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">   (b) Pose occupational safety hazards, since chemicals from  biopharm crops may cause harm to humans through inhalation,  unintended ingestion and skin contact; and</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">   (c) Persist in the environment and bioaccumulate in wildlife,  plants, and soil microorganisms leading to both acute and chronic  toxicity and major ecological disruption.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> USDA regulates biopharm agriculture under the Plant Protection  Act, which authorizes the agency to publish regulations "to  prevent the introduction of plant pests into the United States or  the dissemination of plant pests within the United States." Under those regulations, genetically engineered pharmaceutical- producing plant varieties are regulated as potential plant pests.  Permits for biopharm field tests are issued by USDA's Animal and  Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS). </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> "Until the USDA develops a system to contain these biopharm  'plant pests,' the utmost caution should be taken," said Joseph  Mendelson, legal director for Center for Food Safety. "The  existing regulatory system merely assumes that growing these  crops is harmless, even in places where they can contaminate the  environment and get into the food supply."</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">   The lawsuit filed today asks the court to require USDA to  develop an Environmental Impact Statement, to consult with the  Fish and Wildlife Service as required by the Endangered Species  Act, to fully consider the effects of growing biopharm crops on  listed species, and to develop regulations that adequately  protect public health and the environment.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">   <b>Mistakes on Record</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">   There have already been potentially dangerous slip-ups. Last  fall, for example, USDA had to quarantine and destroy 500,000  bushels of soybeans in Nebraska meant for human consumption that  had been contaminated with corn genetically engineered to produce  a pig vaccine. At about the same time, USDA ordered that 155  acres of corn in Iowa be pulled and burned because of potential  contamination from biopharm crops. The grower in both instances,  ProdiGene, is conducting open-air field tests in Hawaii.  </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> "Given the USDA's failure to adequately assess health and  environmental impacts and its careless handling of genetically  engineered pollution last year, there's no way the government can  claim biopharming is safe," said Larry Bohlen of Friends of the  Earth. "Researchers should focus instead on developing  fermentation production systems that are containable,  controllable and, unlike plant biopharming, are a proven means to  produce pharmaceuticals." </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">   <b>Secretive Testing</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">   In July 2003, Earthjustice, on behalf of Center for Food  Safety, filed a suit in First Circuit Court, State of Hawaii,  against the Hawaii Department of Agriculture seeking public  access to state records regarding biopharm field tests in Hawaii  that may contain important information about the kind of  substances being produced, how and where these substances are  being released, and what the responsible authorities are doing to  control them. The agency has refused to release any information,  in violation of the state open records law. See Center for Food  Safety v. Department of Agriculture, Civ. No. 03-1-1509 (2003).</font></p>
