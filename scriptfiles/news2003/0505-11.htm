- May 5 - None of America's 

elementary school teachers, police officers, licensed practical 

nurses, retail salespersons or janitors would qualify to purchase 

a median priced home based on median income, according to a 

compelling new study from the National Housing Conference (NHC) 

entitled Paycheck to Paycheck: Wages and the Cost of Housing in 

America. Compiled by NHC's research affiliate the Center for 

Housing Policy, findings for the nation as a whole reveal that 

the median annual salaries for each of these five occupations 

fall short of the nearly $50,000 necessary to qualify for the 

median priced home of $156,000, with the earnings of licensed 

practical nurses, retail sales persons and janitors lagging by 

substantial margins. Of particular concern, families dependent 

solely on the salary of a janitor or retail salesperson pay in 

excess of what is considered affordable for a two-bedroom 

apartment in all of the 60 individual metropolitan areas studied.

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While at the national level the data reveals that on average 

homeownership is out of reach for many working families, the 60 

metropolitan area findings offer insight into concerns within 

specific communities. For example, the data show that families 

dependent on a police officer's salary are priced out of almost 

half, or 28, of the 60 areas studied, while households dependent 

on one teacher's salary alone cannot afford to buy a home in 32 

localities. In addition, licensed practical nurses cannot afford 

to buy a home in all but three of the areas. Janitors and retail 

salespersons require more than double their salaries in many of 

the metropolitan areas.

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Although there is a growing understanding of the housing 

challenges we face as a nation, this new data prompts us to take 

an even closer look at the affordability concerns for working 

families, as well as the related social and financial 

implications for our communities," said NHC Executive Director 

Conrad Egan. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On the rental side, the data also indicates that in all but 

two of the 60 metropolitan areas studied, both janitor's and 

retail salesperson's are unable to rent a one-bedroom apartment 

based on the accepted standard of 30 percent of their income. 

Although it is out of both choice and necessity that many working 

families have more than one wage earner to keep them from serious 

housing stress, in some of the hottest West Coast markets, as 

well as metropolitan areas as diverse as Boston, Mass., Dallas, 

Tex., Washington, D.C., West Palm Beach, Fla., and Middlesex, N.J., 

typical rents require more than 30 percent of two such salaries.
