- May 13 - A national study released 

today found that in the absence of federal leadership, 19 states 

have acted to increase the nation's supply of wind, solar and other 

renewable energy resources, but that only five states account for 

80 percent of the projected gains. California and Nevada led the 

nation with grades of A- for committing to increase the amount of 

electricity generated from clean, renewable energy sources. 

However, 34 states received a failing grade for failing to tap-into 

the jobs, public health gains and reduced air and water pollution 

that homegrown renewable electricity could provide.

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Renewable electricity can provide future generations with safe 

and cost-effective domestic energy sources," said Jeff Deyette, UCS 

analyst and co-author of the new report, Plugging in Renewable 

Energy: Grading the States. "But only five states are carrying the 

ball for the entire nation. It is time for the federal government 

to enact a fair national standard to improve our country's energy 

security and environment." 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The nation's electricity generation is dominated by large 

fossil-fuel burning power plants that put public health and safety 

at risk. More than 90 percent of electricity generated in the 

United States comes from fossil fuel and nuclear power -- energy 

sources that also endanger our environment through mining, 

refining, waste disposal and vulnerable delivery systems. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The new UCS study assigns grades to each of the 50 states based 

on the individual states' commitment to renewable electricity 

through the projected results of renewable electricity standards 

for electric companies and dedicated renewable electricity funds. 

Current state renewable energy generation is also considered. The 

report finds that California, Nevada, Texas, Massachusetts and New 

Mexico account for nearly 80 percent of the nation's projected 

renewable gains. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"By neglecting renewable electricity, most states are missing 

out on jobs and economic development, cleaner air and water, and a 

more secure energy supply," Deyette said. "But the nation is the 

biggest loser, by leaving renewable electricity development to 

states and voluntary utility programs. Fortunately, the federal 

government has a chance to catch up with leading states as the 

Senate begins debating national energy legislation." 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">UCS projects that the 19 states that have enacted renewable 

electricity standards or funds will increase total U.S. renewable 

energy capacity by 113 percent by 2017. This increase will provide 

enough electricity for 10.4 million typical homes and eliminate as 

much carbon dioxide -- the main heat-trapping gas causing global 

warming -- as taking 7.4 million cars off the road. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The tremendous disparity in state programs and failing grades 

for 34 states illustrates the need for a national renewable 

electricity standard. By setting a minimum requirement on which 

state standards and voluntary programs could build, a national 

standard would prove more equitable and would lead to much higher, 

cost-effective levels of renewable electricity generation. Studies 

by the federal government and UCS have shown that a national 

standard of 20 percent by 2020 is feasible and affordable. Senators 

James Jeffords (I-VT) and Jeff Bingaman (D-NM) are expected to 

introduce amendments establishing a national renewable electricity 

standard as part of the energy bill. For a copy of the full report,
