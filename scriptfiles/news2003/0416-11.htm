                - April 16 - Today, Colorado Governor Bill Owens will disregard 

                the wishes of Colorado voters and sign a voucher bill that will 

                provide $5000 vouchers to qualifying students, even though the 

                voters have twice rejected attempts to divert public tax dollars 

                to private schools. The state is now fourth in the nation to divert 

                public funds to private schools via a voucher program. </font> 

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It 

                  is unfortunate that the governor and Legislature have such low 

                  regard for Colorado voters,&quot; said Ralph G. Neas, president 

                  of People For the American Way (PFAW). &quot;The voters said 

                  'no' in 1992. They said it again in 1998. Now legislators will 

                  have to hear it from the court.&quot; </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Voucher 

                  advocates have argued that last June's U.S. Supreme Court decision 

                  in the Cleveland voucher case would fuel a drive to create voucher 

                  programs in a number of states. Thus far however, most legislatures 

                  and governors have rejected voucher legislation. Efforts to 

                  pass voucher and tuition tax credit bills in the GOP-controlled 

                  Virginia Legislature failed earlier this year. In Utah, moderate 

                  Republicans joined with Democrats in the Legislature to defeat 

                  a bill that would have created tuition tax credits and tax-credit 

                  vouchers. </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Most 

                  state leaders have gotten the message that the vast majority 

                  of our children are educated by public schools and the vast 

                  majority of public schools do a good job of educating our children,&quot; 

                  said Nancy Keenan, PFAW education director. &quot;For those 

                  schools that are struggling, there is real evidence that vouchers 

                  are not the answer. Voucher programs only serve to divert resources 

                  away from proven reforms, such as reducing class sizes, that 

                  have a real impact on student achievement.&quot; </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Colorado 

                  law will be the first passed in the nation since the U.S. Supreme 

                  Court narrowly decided such programs do not violate the U.S. 

                  Constitution. However, Colorado's voucher bill must meet the 

                  stricter standards of the state constitution. People For the 

                  American Way Foundation expects to participate in a court challenge 

                  to the Colorado voucher law by Colorado citizens and others.

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Transferring 

                  public dollars to religious and private schools under this law 

                  is a clear violation of the standards established in Colorado's 

                  state constitution,&quot; said Elliot Mincberg, PFAW legal director. 

                  &quot;We are hopeful that the state supreme court will preserve 

                  these essential protections and reject this voucher law on these 

                  grounds.&quot; </font></p>
