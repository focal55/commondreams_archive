- July 23 - In a historic late night vote the United States House of Representatives passed a bipartisan amendment offered by Congressman C.L. &quot;Butch&quot; Otter (R-ID), Congressman Dennis J. Kucinich (D-OH) and Congressman Ron Paul (R-TX) to withhold funding for  &quot;sneak-and-peek&quot; searches under the USA PATRIOT Act. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">		The amendment passed 309-118 as part of the House's consideration of the FY '04 Commerce, Justice and State Appropriations bill. The passage of the amendment marks the first time either chamber of Congress has acted to roll back any provision of the law. The passage of the amendment by almost a three-to-one margin reflects a growing outrage over threats to constitutional free speech and due process rights imposed in haste in the fearful days after 9/11. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">		Today, Congressman Otter and Kucinich issued the following joint statement:</font></p>

<p>		<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The vote last night in the House is a historic step forward for the House, the US Constitution and the civil liberties of all Americans. </font></p>

<p>		<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Congress is joining the American people and coming to its senses. This is just the beginning of a crusade to which more and more of our colleagues are rallying. We are committed to restoring freedoms for which generations of American heroes have died. </font></p>

<p>		<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The USA PATRIOT Act was well intentioned, especially during a time of fear and uncertainty.  However, now that we have had a chance to step back and examine it objectively, the legislation deserves serious re-evaluation.  </font></p>

<p>		<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Notice with a warrant is a crucial check on the government's power. It forces authorities to operate in the open, and allows citizens to protect their Constitutional rights.   </font></p>

<p>		<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;American citizens, whom the government has pledged to protect from terrorist actions, now find themselves the victims of the very weapon designed to uproot their enemies. Being secure at the expense of our freedoms is no real security.  Last night, with passage of our amendment, we have begun the process of regaining the civil liberties that are the foundation of our nation.&quot;</font></p>
