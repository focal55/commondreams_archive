                - March 5 - Findings released today at the launch of Cover the 

                Uninsured Week indicate that an estimated 75 million people lacked 

                health insurance at some point during the past two years. The 

                study suggests that being uninsured is far more common than previously 

                thought, affecting roughly one in four Americans. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The findings 

                are shocking and show just how deeply lack of access to health 

                care touches all Americans," said Georges C. Benjamin, MD, FACP, 

                executive director of the American Public Health Association (APHA), 

                a national sponsor of Cover the Uninsured Week, which will be 

                held March 10-16, 2003. "The health and economic toll of this 

                epidemic of the uninsured is staggering for the individual, the 

                family and the community." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">People without 

                health insurance don't get routine preventive health services, 

                receive too little medical care too late, are sicker and die sooner, 

                and receive poorer care when they are hospitalized. Also, when 

                seeking care, they are often sicker and therefore more expensive 

                to treat, and they frequently turn to the nearest hospital emergency 

                room, which is an expensive and inefficient way to get care. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Furthermore, 

                the primary providers of care to the uninsured, such as public 

                hospitals, teaching hospitals, academic health centers and non-profit 

                community hospitals, incur heavy losses from high rates of uncompensated 

                care. In turn, these providers are forced to cut back on their 

                services to all patients or even close their facilities. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The widespread 

                lack of access to care is one of the major causes of racial and 

                ethnic health disparities," said Jay Glasser, PhD, MS, president 

                of APHA and chair of APHA's Universal Health Care Task Force. 

                "Lack of health insurance is a serious financial barrier for many 

                minority families contributing to lower health status." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The current 

                economic downturn, combined with double-digit inflation of health 

                care costs, make health insurance increasingly unaffordable. As 

                a result, the number of uninsured Americans is expected to rise.
