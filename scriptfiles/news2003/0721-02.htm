- July 21 -  EarthRights International (ERI) today announced that it has launched a &quot;No Torture for Profit&quot; campaign to combat the most egregious violations of human rights by corporations, and to fight back against the Justice Department's pattern of seeking immunity for such behavior. At the center of the effort is a petition at www.NoTortureForProfit.org designed to protect the Alien Tort Claims Act (&quot;ATCA&quot;), a critical law dating back to 1789 that provides victims with an avenue to stand up for their rights and seek justice.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The law is now under attack by organizations representing some of the world's most powerful corporations. The National Foreign Trade Council (NFTC), the US Chamber of Commerce, and other major business lobby groups are seeking to repeal or sharply limit the law.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;ATCA means an end to corporate impunity for brutal human rights abuses- and that's exactly why corporations don't like it,&quot; said Katie Redford, Co-director of ERI. &quot;It is no coincidence that NFTC member companies include some of those now being sued. These companies preach 'responsibility' while working behind the scenes to take away a significant disincentive to irresponsible behavior.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Justice Department</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The effort is also seeking to combat a pattern of hostility towards human rights by the US Justice Department. This includes the Justice Department's filing of a brief in US Court on behalf of Unocal, a California oil company complicit in egregious human rights abuses in Burma. The brief shockingly argues that human rights claims should not be brought in US courts because the application of human rights law interferes with US foreign policy. The brief also asserts that Unocal should be absolved of liability. &quot;Time and time again, the Justice Department has behaved more like the 'Injustice' Department,&quot; said Kate Greene, Outreach Associate for ERI. &quot;This now culminates in a David and Goliath kind of struggle where victims of human rights abuses are up against the Justice Department and the US business lobby who are trying to take away ATCA, the victims' &quot;slingshot&quot;.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">About ATCA</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ATCA stands for the Alien Tort Claims Act, a 1789 law that allows citizens of other countries to sue in US courts for human rights violations that take place overseas. The law is a slingshot for the &quot;Davids&quot; of the world - in some cases their only chance for a modicum of justice against powerful, &quot;Goliath&quot; abusers. ATCA is also a crucial instrument for holding US companies accountable to the most basic standards of human dignity under international law. The US business lobby and the Department of Justice now seek to repeal or weaken ATCA, which would roll back years of cases finding in favor of human rights abuse.</font></p>
