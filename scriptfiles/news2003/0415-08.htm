                ANGELES, CA - April 15 - The California office of the Council 

                on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR-CA) today called on GOP leaders 

                to repudiate recent Islamophobic remarks made by the former chairman 

                of that state's Republican Party. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At a pro-war 

                rally on Friday sponsored by the University of Southern California 

                (USC) College Republicans, Shawn Steel said: "The Islamic community 

                has a cancer growing inside it, which hates Jews, hates freedom 

                and hates western society...The disease of Islam must be rectified. 

                It's kill or be killed." He also blamed peace activists and the 

                Democratic Party for the Holocaust, the Ku Klux Klan and slavery. 

                During an April 8 rally at Loyola Marymount University, Steel 

                referred to Islam as a "dangerous" and "diseased religion." </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The Republican 

                Party can no longer remain silent in the face of the anti-Muslim 

                bigotry spewed by a minority of hate-mongers within its ranks. 

                Republican leaders and elected officials must repudiate this latest 

                smear of Islam and reassure Muslims in California that Steel's 

                Islamophobic views do not reflect those of the party. Such incidents 

                can only serve to divide our nation along religious lines, increase 

                discrimination against ordinary Muslims and harm America's image 

                worldwide," said CAIR-Southern California Executive Director Hussam 

                Ayloush. He added that other Republicans officials have recently 

                been involved in similar incidents around the nation. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Last month, 

                two Republican lawmakers staged a walkout during a Muslim prayer 

                opening a session of the Washington State House of Representatives. 

                One of those who left the floor said she refused to listen to 

                the Muslim prayer because it was "an issue of patriotism." That 

                legislator later apologized for her remarks and said she would 

                accept an invitation to visit a local Islamic center. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In January, 

                CAIR urged Republican leaders to repudiate anti-Islam paraphernalia 

                being sold at a right-wing conference kicked off by Vice President 

                Cheney. That request came after it was learned that bumper stickers 

                with text such as, "No Muslims -- No Terrorism," were being sold 

                from exhibition booths at the 30th annual Conservative Political 

                Action Conference in Washington, D.C. Another sticker offered 

                for sale at the conference replaced the letter "s" in "Islam" 

                with a Nazi swastika. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In December 

                of last year, public pressure forced a Republican group in North 

                Carolina to remove a link to anti-Islam rhetoric from its website 

                and apologize to Muslims in that state. The website of the Greensboro-based 

                Guilford County Republican Party had a link to a site called "Islam 

                Exposed" that stated: "This website was designed with 1 (sic) 

                objective in mind - to expose one of the greatest evils on our 

                planet - Islam." </font>

                Canada. Since its founding in 1994, CAIR has defended the civil 

                and religious rights of all Americans.
