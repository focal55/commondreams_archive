                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NEW YORK 

                  - April 16 - The U.S. Central Command should respond publicly 

                  to evidence that U.S. forces used cluster munitions in a populated 

                  area of Baghdad, Human Rights Watch urged today.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According 

                  to <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/0415-13.htm">a report in yesterday&#146;s Newsday</a>, a Central Command spokeswoman 

                  has anonymously confirmed that U.S. forces have hit urban areas 

                  of Baghdad with cluster munitions, stating that they were aimed 

                  at Iraqi artillery and missile systems located inside the city.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;U.S. 

                  commanders should never use cluster munitions in populated areas,&#148; 

                  said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch. 

                  &#147;These are wholly inappropriate weapons when civilians 

                  are around. The reported use of cluster munitions in Baghdad 

                  is a serious charge and the Pentagon must respond publicly to 

                  it.&#148; </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Newsday&#146;s 

                  reporter provided Human Rights Watch with a photograph he had 

                  taken inside a building in what he described as a clearly residential 

                  neighborhood well inside Baghdad. Human Rights Watch identified 

                  an unexploded cluster submunition in the photograph from either 

                  a ground-based Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) or an artillery 

                  projectile. The damage to the surrounding walls and floor were 

                  also consistent with a cluster munition strike. Human Rights 

                  Watch has previously reported that, according to The Pentagon&#146;s 

                  own data, these particular submunitions have an especially high 

                  failure rate. </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Human Rights 

                  Watch believes that the use of cluster munitions in populated 

                  areas may violate the prohibition of indiscriminate attacks 

                  contained in international humanitarian law. Despite the utility 

                  of cluster munitions in achieving certain military objectives, 

                  the wide dispersal pattern of their submunitions makes it very 

                  difficult to avoid civilians if they are in the area. Moreover, 

                  because of their high failure rate, cluster munitions leave 

                  large numbers of hazardous, explosive duds to terrorize civilians 

                  even after the attack is over. </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The U.S. 

                  Army and Marine Corps may be taking less care to avoid civilian 

                  casualties with surface-delivered cluster munitions than the 

                  U.S. Air Force with air-delivered cluster munitions, Human Rights 

                  Watch said. </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Human Rights 

                  Watch conducted detailed analyses of the U.S. Air Force&#146;s 

                  use of cluster bombs in the 1999 Yugoslavia war and the 2001-2002 

                  Afghanistan war. In Afghanistan, the U.S. Air Force used cluster 

                  bombs substantially less often in populated areas than they 

                  had in Yugoslavia, and therefore caused far fewer civilian deaths 

                  with cluster bombs. </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;It 

                  seemed that after Yugoslavia, U.S. commanders learned that cluster 

                  munitions cannot be safely used in populated areas,&#148; said 

                  Roth. &#147;The use of cluster munitions inside Baghdad represents 

                  a disturbing step backwards &#150; with deadly consequences.&#148; 

                  </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is not 

                  yet known if there were civilian casualties at the time of the 

                  strike, but Newsday reported on several deaths and injuries 

                  to children and others who encountered the explosive duds left 

                  by the cluster munitions which failed to detonate on initial 

                  impact as designed. The duds function as de facto antipersonnel 

                  landmines. </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This is 

                  the first confirmed instance of U.S. use of cluster munitions 

                  in Baghdad or other highly populated areas. There have been 

                  many unconfirmed allegations of use of both air-dropped and 

                  surface-delivered cluster munitions in urban areas by the United 

                  States and the United Kingdom. Most notably, some press accounts 

                  attributed the deaths of scores of civilians near the village 

                  of Hilla in central Iraq on April 1 to U.S. cluster bombs, but 

                  the facts have not been established. </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In light 

                  of its admission of use of cluster munitions, and the already 

                  documented deaths and injuries to children and other non-combatants, 

                  Human Rights Watch called on the United States to take responsibility 

                  with the utmost urgency for assuring:</font></p>

                <ul>

                  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">the provision 

                    of warnings and risk education to the civilian population;</font></li>

                  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">the clear 

                    demarcation of affected areas in order to effectively exclude

                  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">the rapid 

                    clearance of dangerous cluster munition duds.</font></li>

                  Pentagon is crowing about the Air Force sparing civilians by
