                - April 17 - Large-scale expansion of factory farming into developing 

                countries such as Mexico, India, China, and the Philippines is 

                bringing unanticipated dangers to environmental and human health, 

                according to the May/June 2003 edition of the Worldwatch Institute’s 

                magazine, World Watch. While increasing the production of meat, 

                the mass-producing facilities threaten the survival of indigenous 

                livestock and are contributing to groundwater pollution, the spread 

                of food-borne illnesses, and antibiotic resistance, writes researcher 

                Danielle Nierenberg in “Factory Farming in the Developing World.”

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“Factory farming 

                methods are creating a web of food safety, animal welfare, and 

                environmental problems around the world, as large agribusinesses 

                attempt to escape tighter environmental restrictions in the European 

                Union and the U.S. by moving their animal production operations 

                to less developed countries,” says Nierenberg. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nierenberg’s 

                investigation focuses particularly on the Philippines, one of 

                the emerging centers of large-scale livestock production and processing 

                in the developing world. In that country alone, annual production 

                of poultry has increased five-fold since 1980. This industrialization 

                of livestock production nearly wiped out the stock of native Filipino 

                chickens and forced most family farmers out of business or into 

                adopting factory farming methods themselves. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">International 

                regulations on factory farming and an improved process of zoning 

                farms in economically viable places with the least environmental 

                impact are only part of the solution, asserts Nierenberg. She 

                also argues that the lessons of factory farming should prevent 

                its continued expansion and should translate into the preservation 

                of prosperous family farms where raising healthy, humanely treated 

                animals is viewed as a form of affluence.
