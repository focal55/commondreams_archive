                - April 8 - A new report from The Commonwealth Fund reveals that 

                enactment of a Medicare drug benefit could save states up to $6.8 

                billion annually, and could even help many states avoid cuts in 

                Medicaid services. Medicaid prescription drug coverage for approximately 

                6 million "dual eligibles" -- low-income seniors and persons with 

                disabilities who are covered by both Medicaid and Medicare -- 

                accounts for nearly half of all Medicaid spending on prescription 

                drugs, including both federal and state shares of Medicaid prescription 

                costs. Varying portions of these costs would be picked up by Medicare 

                under current proposals in Congress. Seniors with low incomes 

                could also gain improved access to prescription drugs, with a 

                more uniform basic benefit set by Medicare. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"A Medicare 

                prescription drug benefit would improve access for needed drugs 

                to the most vulnerable seniors-those with low incomes, many of 

                whom are forced to forgo needed medications because they can't 

                afford them," said Karen Davis, president of The Commonwealth 

                Fund. "As an added benefit, states would get desperately needed 

                budget relief for Medicaid drug expenditures." </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the report, 

                State Medicaid Prescription Drug Expenditures for Medicare-Medicaid 

                Dual Eligibles, Stacy Berg Dale and James M. Verdier, both of 

                Mathematica Policy Research, Inc., estimate that Medicaid spent 

                $16 billion on prescription drug coverage in 2002 for the 6 million 

                low-income Medicare beneficiaries who also are enrolled in Medicaid. 

                This comes to more than $2,800 per year per beneficiary-ranging 

                from just under $2,000 a year per enrollee in New Mexico to nearly 

                $4,000 a year per enrollee in Connecticut. Current proposals in 

                Congress to cover prescription drugs under Medicare could provide 

                major fiscal relief to state Medicaid programs. The amount of 

                relief would depend in large measure on how much responsibility 

                remains with states for covering cost-sharing for low-income Medicare 

                beneficiaries, including premiums, deductibles, coinsurance, copays, 

                and gaps or "holes" in the drug benefit. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Completely 

                covering prescription drugs under Medicare would improve access 

                to drug coverage for dual eligibles and facilitate coordination 

                of their acute care services-hospital, physician, prescription 

                drugs, lab and x-ray-since only one payer would be responsible 

                for these services," said James Verdier, senior fellow at Mathematica 

                and co-author of the report. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Medicare prescription 

                drug coverage for dual eligibles could make basic coverage more 

                uniform, increasing access to coverage and smoothing state variations. 

                The savings to Medicaid could be used to avert benefit and eligibility 

                cutbacks as states grapple with current budget shortfalls. Each 

                $1 billion savings could help keep 1 million low-income adults 

                under age 65, or more than 1.5 million children on Medicaid or 

                CHIP rolls. </font>
