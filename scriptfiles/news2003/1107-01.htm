- November 7 - The United States Senate approved a measure that would prohibit 
the Department of Agriculture (USDA) from purchasing chickens for the school lunch 
program that have been treated with the cipro-like antibiotics known as fluoroquinolones. 
The amendment to the 2004 Agriculture appropriations bill, offered by Senator 
Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-NY), is the first time the Senate has addressed the 
overuse of medically important antibiotics in agriculture. The Agriculture bill 
passed last night. </FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Fluoroquinolones 
are doctors&#146; first choice in treating severe food poisoning in humans. The 
Food and Drug Administration has proposed to withdraw the use of fluoroquinolones 
in poultry because it contributes to increasing numbers of people becoming infected 
with bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;Children 
are at a greater risk to suffer from food poisoning and infections from antibiotic 
resistant bacteria,&#148; said Tamar Barlam, M.D., director of the antibiotic 
resistance project at the nonprofit Center for Science in the Public Interest 
(CSPI). &#147;Even McDonald&#146;s and Wendy&#146;s have forced their suppliers 
to phase out fluoroquinolones. There&#146;s no reason that school lunch program 
should lag behind the fast-food industry on this important public health issue.&#148; 
</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Several major 
chicken producers like Tyson, Gold Kist, and Perdue have committed to stop using 
fluoroquinolones in their chickens. Legislation offered by Representative Sherrod 
Brown (D-OH) would also prohibit USDA from buying fluoroquinolone-treated chicken 
for the school lunch program. </FONT></P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p></font><!-- #EndEditable --></td></tr>
