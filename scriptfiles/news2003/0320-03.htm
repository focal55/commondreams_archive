                CA - March 20 - Physicians for Social Responsibility (PSR), a 

                national organization of health care professionals and concerned 

                citizens, strongly opposes the United States preemptive war on 

                Iraq.   </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"President 

                Bush has not provided sufficient justification for this war, " 

                said Sacramento PSR member and Vietnam Veteran William Durston, 

                MD.  "As doctors, we have devoted our life's work to promoting 

                human health.  We live by the creed 'First, do no harm,' and we 

                believe simply that a war on Iraq will do more harm than good. 

                 There are better prescriptions for American security than to 

                invade Iraq now" states Dr. Durston. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PSR members 

                are concerned about the health and welfare of U.S. troops in the 

                Middle East.  Over 160,000 Gulf War veterans currently receive 

                disability payments, many of whom report chronic illness for unclear 

                reasons.  If Saddam Hussein does have biological and chemical 

                weapons, attacking Iraq invites him to use these agents on U.S. 

                soldiers. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"And what about 

                the civilians of Iraq, half of whom are children?" asks member 

                Harry Wang, MD.  "It is expected that there will be tens of thousands 

                of Iraqi combatant and civilian deaths.  16 million Iraqi civilians 

                are 100% dependent on food rations.  The oil-for-food program 

                has already stopped.  We can expect food shortages, malnutrition, 

                and starvation of civilians," says Dr. Wang.    </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PSR has a 40-year 

                tradition of speaking out against the dangers of nuclear war. 

                 In 1985, it shared the Nobel Peace Prize with the International 

                Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War.  PSR has demanded 

                that President Bush publicly commit to a "no first use" policy 

                on nuclear weapons.     </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sacramento 

                Area PSR members have actively participated in recent local and 

                Bay area anti-war protests and plan to join the Regional Peace 

                March in Sacramento on March 23.  "We must stop this war now," 

                says member Nathan Fairman, "and end the humanitarian catastrophe 

                in Iraq."
