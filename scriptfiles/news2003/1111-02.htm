  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON - November 11 - A campaign to end the Catholic bishop's ban on condoms is targeting the US bishops' meeting this week in Washington, DC, and today is running a Washington Post federal page ad with the tagline GOOD CATHOLICS USE CONDOMS. The multi-pronged public education campaign is asking members of Congress, AIDS advocates, and the public to protest blatantly false claims by Catholic cardinals and bishops that condoms do not prevent HIV transmission. Sponsored by Catholics for a Free Choice (CFFC), this week's campaign is part of a larger global campaign to end the Catholic bishops' ban on condoms-Condoms4Life at <a href="http://www.condoms4life.org/" target="_new">http://www.condoms4life.org</a>.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Using a mix of on-line action alerts, print advertising, Congressional information packets, and public sign-on letters, CFFC is seeking to stop the Catholic church hierarchy from further endangering people at risk of HIV/AIDS infection. Campaign materials cite Cardinal Alfonso Trujillo's claim on a recent BBC program that &quot;the AIDS virus is roughly 450 times smaller than the spermatozoon. The spermatozoon can easily pass through the 'net' that is formed by the condom.&quot; The World Health Organization immediately declared, &quot;These incorrect statements about condoms and HIV are dangerous when we are facing a global pandemic which has already killed more than 20 million people, and currently affects at least 42 million.&quot; WHO maintains &quot;consistent and correct&quot; use of condoms reduces transmission by 90 percent.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Frances Kissling, CFFC president, states in a Nov. 11 letter to Bishop Wilton D. Gregory, head of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops,</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;As Catholic organizations, we are bound by a moral and ethical framework that calls on us to address the global AIDS crisis with compassion, intensity, and above all, common sense. In this vein, we believe that the Catholic church should lift the ban on condoms as a moral and humanitarian matter. But, if not, the church should at the very least be clear that its objections to condoms as a means of HIV/AIDS prevention are ecclesiastical, not scientific. Accordingly, we call upon you and your fellow bishops at this important annual meeting to repudiate the incorrect information that has been circulated by officials of the Catholic church, and we strongly urge you to be scrupulously honest in describing the effectiveness of condoms in the future.&quot;</font></p>

Through discourse, education and advocacy, CFFC works in the United States and internationally to infuse these values into public policy, community life, feminist analysis, and Catholic social thinking and teaching. </i> </font></p>
