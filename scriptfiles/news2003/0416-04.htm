                - April 16 - A federal appeals court has delivered another blow 

                to the government&#146;s efforts to allow polluting Mexico-domiciled 

                trucks on U.S. roads without assessing and attempting to mitigate 

                the trucks&#146; environmental harm.</font> 

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On April 

                  10, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals denied the U.S. Department 

                  of Transportation&#146;s (DOT) petitions for a rehearing by 

                  the review court as well as review by the whole court of its 

                  January ruling. The appellate court had ruled that the Bush 

                  administration violated environmental law when it announced 

                  last November that it was opening U.S. highways to long-haul 

                  trucks from Mexico to comply with the North American Free Trade 

                  Agreement.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The court 

                  has told the government that it must complete an Environmental 

                  Impact Statement as required by the National Environmental Policy 

                  Act and a Conformity Statement as required by the Clean Air 

                  Act. The DOT is required to study the impact of increased air 

                  pollution on border-state communities and, where necessary, 

                  develop plans to lessen the anticipated harm, before it can 

                  move toward processing applications for cross-border trucking.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Places 

                  like Houston and Los Angeles already suffer from strangling 

                  smog,&quot; said Public Citizen President Joan Claybrook. &quot;The 

                  federal government should be obeying the laws designed to curtail 

                  pollution. We&#146;re pleased the court is not backing down.&quot;</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Plaintiffs 

                  in the lawsuit were Public Citizen; the Brotherhood of Teamsters 

                  Auto and Truck Drivers Local 70; the California Labor Federation; 

                  the California Trucking Association; the Environmental Law Foundation; 

                  and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. The Natural 

                  Resources Defense Council and the Planning and Conservation 

                  League were petitioners-intervenors. The lawsuit was filed in
