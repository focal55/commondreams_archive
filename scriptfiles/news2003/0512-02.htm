<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Several hundred parents, children, educators and advocates from 

around the country will come to Washington, D.C. Wednesday to urge 

lawmakers to reject President Bush's proposed 40 percent cut to the 

21st Century Community Learning Centers (21st CCLC) afterschool 

program for Fiscal Year 2004. Organized by the Afterschool 

Alliance, the "Afterschool Challenge" will kick off with a 

Breakfast of Champions at:

the National League of Cities, will also speak at the Breakfast. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After the Breakfast of Champions, activists will deliver paper 

light bulbs with messages about afterschool that were sent by 

children and parents from across the country. The messages were 

created last October at Lights On Afterschool! events. Actor and 

children's activist Arnold Schwarzenegger serves as National Chair 

of Lights On Afterschool!, the Afterschool Alliance's annual rally 

for afterschool, which is set for October 9 this year. 

Schwarzenegger, who is Honorary Chair of the Afterschool Alliance, 

is scheduled to testify about the need for afterschool programs 

before House and Senate Committees on Tuesday.

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">President Bush's budget proposal for Fiscal Year 2004 calls for 

a cut from the current $1 billion funding to just $600,000. That 

cut would deny afterschool programs to more than half a million 

children. In the No Child Left Behind Act, Congress authorized 

$1.75 billion for the 21st CCLC program for Fiscal Year 2004.

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As many as 15 million children in the United States leave school 

each afternoon without a safe place to go. Research shows that 

afterschool programs keep kids safe, help working families and 

improve academic achievement.

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Afterschool Alliance is a nonprofit public awareness and 

advocacy organization supported by a group of public, private, and 

nonprofit entities dedicated to ensuring that all children and 

youth have access to afterschool programs by 2010. More
