- October 1 - Congressman Dennis J. Kucinich (D-OH), leader of the opposition to the war against Iraq in the House, took to the House floor today to urge his colleagues to vote against the Administration's $87 billion supplemental request.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">        Kucinich stated: </font></p>

<p>        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It is time for the United States to get out of Iraq. It is time to get the United Nations in and the United States out. It is time to bring our troops home and end this sorry exercise in preemption and unilateralism.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This supplemental request will bring the current total cost for the war and occupation of Iraq to about $150 billion dollars and counting. America can ill afford to spend another $87 billion in support of a war that has no end, no exit, no logic, and no sense. It is time to come up with a plan to get the UN in and the US out. We must work with the world community towards this goal. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Today, the Administration will tell Congress that it was deceived by Saddam Hussein in to thinking Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. Let this Congress not be deceived by an Administration that took this nation into a war we did not have to fight. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Bring our troops home. Vote against the $87 billion. Get the UN in and the US out.&quot; </font></p>
