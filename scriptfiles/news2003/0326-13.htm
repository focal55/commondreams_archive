                - March 26 - The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission&#146;s (FERC) 

                response to the overwhelming evidence that the West Coast energy 

                crisis was caused by the willful manipulation by energy companies 

                is belated and weak. In November 2000, FERC concluded that West 

                Coast energy prices were not just and reasonable, but it has taken 

                the commission 28 months to conclude that corporate misdeeds were 

                the cause. The companies include AEP, BP, Duke, Dynegy, El Paso, 

                Enron, Mirant, Morgan Stanley, Reliant, Sempra and Williams.</font> 

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 2000 

                  and 2001, energy companies engaged in a year-long campaign of 

                  extortion of tens of millions of West Coast households and businesses. 

                  The companies responsible not only ought to be held accountable 

                  but should be prevented from manipulating the market again. 

                  It is unconscionable that FERC has not permanently revoked market-based 

                  rate authority for the companies that caused the crisis. Instead, 

                  FERC has only sought a refund of the ill-gotten gains. These 

                  corporate criminals set astronomical rates by manipulating the 

                  availability of energy in a deregulated market. They should 

                  not be allowed to do so again.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In its findings, 

                  FERC singled out Enron Energy Services (EES) as a major participant 

                  in some of the most egregious manipulation schemes, concluding 

                  that EES was one of the largest perpetrators of manipulation 

                  strategies in the California market. Thomas White was in charge 

                  of this Enron division until President Bush appointed him Secretary 

                  of the Army in May 2001. Public Citizen renews its call for 

                  White to appear before the U.S. Senate to respond to questions 

                  we believe he did not truthfully answer during his July 2002 

                  testimony.</font></p>
