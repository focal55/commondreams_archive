                RIDGE, TN - April 3 - Six women were arrested Sunday, March 30th 

                at the Y12 Nuclear Weapons Plant in Oak Ridge when they blockaded 

                traffic, symbolically shutting down the bomb plant for violating 

                the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Department 

                of Energy officials at the Y12 National Security Complex denied 

                entry to a Citizen Inspection Team which sought access to the 

                plant in order to assess US compliance with the Nuclear Nonproliferation 

                Treaty. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Using the 

                philosophy of President Bush, we decided that failure to cooperate 

                with inspectors was an admission of guilt," said Marcelle Good, 

                spokeswoman for the Oak Ridge Environmental Peace Alliance, "But 

                more than that, we have DOE's own documentation and numerous newspaper 

                articles to confirm that DOE is, in fact, building nuclear weapons 

                components at Y12 in violation of the 1969 Nuclear Nonproliferation 

                Treaty which obligates us to pursue complete disarmament 'at an 

                early date.'" </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hundreds of 

                citizens from around the country attended the rally for peace 

                in Oak Ridge on a cold and snowy Sunday, including large delegations 

                from Michigan, Kentucky, North Carolina, and Tennessee. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We came to 

                say the United States needs to lead the world away from the nuclear 

                abyss," said Kim Joy Bergier of Michigan, "and the way to start 

                is by complying with the nonproliferation treaty. If we move to 

                abolish our nuclear arsenal, other countries can be encouraged 

                to join us. Everyone wins when the bombs go away." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">OREPA organizers 

                said they were not surprised at the DOE's refusal to grant them 

                entry. "Clearly, they have plenty to hide," said Ralph Hutchison, 

                coordinator of OREPA. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The refusal 

                of DOE to grant access triggered an immediate petition, signed 

                by hundreds of demonstrators, to the United Nations. The petition 

                calls for a UN authorized team of inspectors to come to Y12 to 

                assess compliance with the Nonproliferation Treaty. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We believe 

                the United States has a responsibility to do what it asks other 

                nations to do. If weapons of mass destruction are bad for Iraq 

                and North Korea, they¹re bad for us. If inspections are in order 

                for other countries, they are in order here," said Good.
