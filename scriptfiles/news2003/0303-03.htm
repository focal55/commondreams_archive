                - March 3 - As the United Nations debates a second resolution 

                on Iraq, thousands of women from throughout the United States 

                will descend on Washington, DC on March 8, International Women's 

                Day, to say no to war. They will rally at 11 AM at Malcolm X Park 

                (16th Street, NW between W and Euclid) and march through the streets 

                of the Nation's capitol at 1 PM to encircle the White House for 

                peace. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This could 

                be the week that determines whether there will be war or peace," 

                said Medea Benjamin, co-founder of CodePink for Peace, the women's 

                anti-war group that has held a daily vigil in front of the White 

                House since November 2002. "We know that war will be devastating 

                for Iraqi women and children and will make our families less safe 

                here at home. That¹s why we're determined to stop this war." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The rally will 

                feature authors Alice Walker and Maxine Hong Kingston, Nobel Peace 

                Laureate Jody Williams, Congresswoman Lynn Woolsey, musician Michelle 

                Shocked, activist author Dr. Helen Caldicott, feminist theologian 

                Hyun Kyung, Pacifica Radio host Amy Goodman, and peace activists 

                Rania Masri, Starhawk, and Granny D, among others. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is the culmination 

                of a week of women's anti-war events called "Celebrating Women 

                as Global Peacemakers" being sponsored by peace groups and women's 

                groups, including Global Exchange, CodePink for Peace, National 

                Organization for Women, Women's International League for Peace

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"When the world 

                is on the brink of being consumed by global testosterone poisoning, 

                it's time for the women to rise up in a pre-emptive strike for 

                peace," said Jodie Evans, also a founder of CodePink. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We're determined 

                to stop this war because it is women and children, workers and 

                the poor who will bear the brunt of it here at home," said Michele 

                Tingling-Clemmons, local organizer for International Women's Day. 

                "Already our quality of life is being bulldozed to pay for this 

                unjust war, and we are coming together to say No War Against Iraq 

                in Our Names!" </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Other women's 

                anti-war events leading up to the March 8 rally include a day 

                of lobbying Congress and the Administration on Thursday, March 

                6; a teach-in called "For a Just Peace and Real Security, Listen 

                to Women for a Change" on Friday, March 7 at the Shiloh Baptist 

                Church, featuring poet and social justice activist Sonia Sanchez, 

                and a concert at the Lisner Auditorium at 8 PM on Friday night, 

                featuring Michelle Shocked, Elayne Boosler, Ulali, and others. 

                On Sunday, March 9, the women's events will conclude with a spiritual 

                program at 10 AM at the George Washington University Marvin Center

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Women have 

                played a key role in the burgeoning U.S. anti-war movement. The 

                CodePink Women's Peace Vigil has been a constant anti-war presence 

                in front of the White House since mid-November, and CodePink recently 

                sponsored the first all-women's peace delegation to Iraq. They 

                have also been responsible for some of the most high-profile anti-war 

                actions in Washington, DC, such as an anti-war Christmas caroling 

                event in front of Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld's house and 

                a wake up call to Democrats in front of Senator Tom Daschle's 

                house.
