                NY - April 9 - The Bush Administration has published a proposal 

                for public comment, which will cut the heart out of the Clean 

                Water Act (CWA) by changing the definition of protected waters. 

                Crucial waterbodies such as source springs, intermittent streams, 

                headwaters, and so-called "isolated wetlands" instantly became 

                at risk of losing federal protection. The proposed rule change 

                includes guidance (ANPRM and Joint Memorandum, 1-10-03) to EPA 

                and Army Corps staff to stop enforcing existing CWA provisions 

                without prior headquarters approval. The public comment period 

                is nearing its conclusion. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Waterbodies 

                rarely exist in isolation from other components of hydrological 

                systems, and even if they do, these water bodies make valuable 

                contributions to the water resources of communities and regions." 

                Said Sarah Meyland, Executive Director for Citizens Campaign for 

                the Environment (CCE). </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Administration’s 

                attempt to redefine the term "waters of the U.S." severely reduces 

                the number of water bodies that receive federal protection against 

                filling, dredging and pollution. According to the New York State 

                Department of Environmental Conservation there are numerous non-navigable 

                streams and isolated wetlands in New York that are not covered 

                under the state’s programs and depend upon Sections 404 and 401 

                of the CWA regulation for protection. Should the CWA jurisdictional 

                scope be diminished as proposed, those waters would become vulnerable 

                to alteration or degradation. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"These water 

                bodies should not be excluded from vital federal safeguards," 

                continued Meyland. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The CWA is 

                a fundamental federal law enacted by Congress after Cleveland’s 

                Cuyahoga River caught on fire and the Great Lake Erie was pronounced 

                dead. The CWA provides the best protection for our nation’s waters 

                against contamination. Signed into law in 1972 by Richard M. Nixon, 

                the CWA has protected all surface waters of the United States 

                for over thirty years and is responsible for greatly improved 

                water quality. However, much of our nation’s waters have yet to 

                achieve the CWA criteria of swimmable and fishable. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Clean water 

                is essential for life. By relaxing clean water regulations, the 

                Bush Administration is sending the clear message that the protection 

                of the nation’s water supply for drinking water, water-dependent 

                industries, and recreation is not important." Said Bill Cooke, 

                CCE Government Affairs Liaison. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Water is our 

                most important natural resource. With less federal protection 

                for water bodies, the Bush Administration is risking the nation’s 

                public and economic health in order to benefit polluters." Stated 

                Sarah J. Meyland, CCE Executive Director. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CCE opposes 

                the proposed changes and is actively encouraging the public to 

                weigh in on this unprecedented weakening of the CWA. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The people 

                of New York and the rest of the country need to understand that 

                redefining 'waters of U.S.' under the Bush Administration means 

                wetlands critical to the health of our drinking water and our 

                economy will lose legal protections against degradation under 

                the CWA. The time has come for the public to demand protection 

                against contamination and destruction of our water." Concluded 

                Meyland. </font>
