                - March 4 - Greens today urged Congress to repeal the provision 

                of the 'No Child Left Behind' Act that requires the 22,000 high 

                schools receiving federal funding to turn over the names, phone 

                numbers, and addresses of all students to military recruiters. 

                The act authorizes recruiters to make unsolicited calls, send 

                direct-mail recruitment literature, and visit students' homes 

                without the consent or knowledge of their parents. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This so-called 

                education reform bill is really about leaving no child behind 

                when we send our troops to invade another country," said Pete 

                Looker, a Green activist in Saratoga Springs, New York, whose 

                daughter attends high school. "Parents are aghast to learn that 

                schools are sending their children's contact information to military 

                recruiters. It's an invasion of students' right to privacy, it 

                interferes with parents' right to guide their children in career 

                choices, and it undermines local community control ofschools. 

                Some schools have recognized this, and their refusal to participate 

                is entirely justified." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greens say 

                that, at a minimum, school officials should only provide a student's 

                information to military recruiters when parents give their express 

                permission, rather than requiring parents and students to opt 

                out of theprogram. The military has already accepted such opt-in 

                lists from several school districts in New York. The federal law 

                does not provide for a cutoff of federal funding for noncompliance.

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Idaho Green 

                Party has drafted a form that assists high school students in 

                having their names removed from the list that the school is required 

                to give to military recruiters. The form, which has been reviewed 

                by two attorneys, can be accessed in PDF at <http://www.idahogreenparty.org><a href="http://www.idahogreenparty.org" target="_new">http://www.idahogreenparty.org</a>.</font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Students across 

                the U.S. have begun to protest the policy. The National Youth 

                and Student Peace Coalition (NYSPC) has announced a one-day student 

                strike on Wednesday, March 5, 2003 to protest the war on Iraq. 

                Students participating in 'Books Not Bombs!' will demand that 

                administrators stopsending student information to military recruiters 

                without consent from parents and students, as well as declare 

                opposition to the war and military research contracts, and support 

                for freezing or lowering tuition and fees. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Youth often 

                join the military because they can't afford college costs and 

                don't have real job opportunities in their communities," said 

                Ben Manski, Green Party Co-Chair and a law student at the University 

                of Wisconsin. Manski noted that more than half of high school 

                students enrolled in Junior ROTC are students of color. "Given 

                the Supreme Court's expected decision on affirmative action, the 

                military may soon become the only exit point for many youth."

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"As the U.S. 

                prepares to enter a war, the effect of the No Child Left Behind 

                Act is to pressure children from low-income backgrounds into enlisting 

                in order to send them to the Iraqi front," added J. Roy Cannon, 

                Delaware Green Party member and community-based Mental Health 

                Counselor. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The provision 

                was inserted after the Pentagon complained that 15% of U.S. high 

                schools are "problem schools" for recruiters. Some school districts, 

                including San Francisco and Portland, Oregon, had barred recruiters 

                on the grounds that the military discriminates against gays and 

                lesbians. In 1999, the Pentagon claimed that recruiters were denied 

                access to schools on 19,228 occasions. The sponsor of the provision, 

                Rep. David Vitter (R-Louisana)argued that schools "demonstrated 

                an anti-military attitude that I thought was offensive." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"While school 

                officials in Maine have warned teachers that children of military 

                personnel were upset by antiwar discussion in classes, many more 

                parents are upset that high schools are now required to participate 

                in the military recruitment of their children," said ex-Marine 

                and longtime Green Party organizer Howie Hawkins of Syracuse, 

                New York. "The increased militarism in our schools and from our 

                national leaders and the media is an attempt to condition us to 

                accept war. The new law undercuts the authority of school districts 

                to control what happens in the schools."
