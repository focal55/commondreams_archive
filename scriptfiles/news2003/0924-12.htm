- September 24 - If four factory-size dairy farms do not stop illegally dumping manure into Florida waterways in the next 60 days, a coalition of conservation groups today vowed to sue them in federal court. The coalition sent notice letters to NFC Management in DeSoto County, Peachey Dairy in Sarasota County, T.K. Dairy in Hardee County, and the Farren Dakin Dairy in Manatee County.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The dairy industry's national slogan is 'Got Milk?,'&quot; said Melanie Shepherdson, an attorney with NRDC (the Natural Resources Defense Council) one of the conservation groups threatening to sue. &quot;In Florida its slogan should be 'Got Poop?'&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The other conservation groups preparing to sue are the Environmental Coalition of Southwest Florida, Legal Environmental Assistance Foundation (LEAF) and ManaSota-88.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Florida Department of Environmental Protection inspected large dairies back in 1999 and notified them that they were required to apply for National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits. None of the dairies has complied, but the Florida agency has not taken enforcement action against them.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The conservation groups conducted ground and aerial inspections this summer near and over the four dairies and documented illegal manure discharges. They collected, for example, a water quality sample from a ditch entering Prairie Creek from the west side of the NFC Dairy property that had fecal coliform bacteria levels 40 times higher than the legal limit.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Prairie Creek is contaminated with cow manure, and it flows into drinking water supplies,&quot; said Glenn Compton of ManaSota-88. &quot;It could threaten the health of thousands of residents of Punta Gorda, and the state is sitting on its hands.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The four dairies named by the coalition today are representative of a bigger problem, said Scott Randolph, an attorney at LEAF. &quot;The state is allowing more than 50 factory dairies around the state to illegally contaminate surface and ground water, regardless of its effect on Florida residents who want to fish, swim and drink from these waterways. If the state isn't going to meet its responsibility to protect our citizens, we're going to have to do it ourselves.&quot;</font></p>
