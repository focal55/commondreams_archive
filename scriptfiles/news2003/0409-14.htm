                - April 9 - President Bush today announced the nomination of Alabama 

                Attorney General William Pryor to the U.S. Court of Appeals for 

                the 11th Circuit. People For the American Way President Ralph 

                G. Neas called Pryor&#146;s nomination &#147;extremely troubling&#148; 

                and said it was &#147;an unfortunate continuation of this administration&#146;s 

                efforts to pack the appeals courts with divisive far-right nominees.&#148;</font> 

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Neas noted 

                  that Pryor is one of the nation&#146;s most aggressive advocates 

                  for a states&#146; rights approach to the Constitution. As Attorney 

                  General and as a leader in the Federalist Society, Pryor has 

                  successfully urged the Supreme Court to roll back the clock 

                  on federal protections against age discrimination and discrimination 

                  against people with disabilities. In another case, he urged 

                  the Court to limit disparate impact analysis, a foundation of 

                  civil rights enforcement, in order to defend Alabama&#146;s 

                  refusal to offer drivers license exams in any language other 

                  than English. Pryor has recently filed an amicus brief in a 

                  pending case before the Supreme Court involving the state of 

                  Nevada that would leave state employees with no real recourse 

                  for violations of the Family &amp; Medical Leave Act.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a March 

                  2001 speech, Pryor praised the recent series of Supreme Court 

                  states&#146; rights rulings as &#147;a breakthrough in the restoration 

                  of dual sovereignty and enumerated powers.&#148; And he has 

                  called for the Court to expand its states&#146; rights rulings 

                  in other areas.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pryor hopes 

                  that Bush administration Supreme Court appointments will further 

                  the states&#146; rights cause. &#147;Most of the important federalism 

                  decisions of the last decade were reached by a 5 to 4 vote,&#148; 

                  Pryor says. &#147;A single appointment to the Court by the Bush 

                  administration could decide the fate of federalism. If all goes 

                  well, that future will be bright.&#148;</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pryor is 

                  a fervent opponent of reproductive rights for women. &#147;I 

                  will never forget Jan. 22, 1973, the day seven members of our 

                  highest court ripped the Constitution and ripped out the life 

                  of millions of unborn children,&quot; he told a rally in 1997.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pryor considers 

                  much of the Supreme Court case law preserving the separation 

                  of church and state to be &#147;errors.&#148; At a public rally 

                  on behalf of a judge who was sued for praying and displaying 

                  the 10 Commandments in court, Pryor announced, &#147;God has 

                  chosen, through his son Jesus Christ, this time and this place 

                  for all Christians...to save our country and save our courts.&#148; 

                  In 1997 Pryor stated, &#147;The matters about life and death 

                  and freedom and religion are not being decided in our country 

                  anymore by the people and their elected representatives. They 

                  are being decided in court, and I think there is something wrong 

                  with that.&#148;</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Neas said 

                  the Bush administration&#146;s efforts to pack the federal appeals 

                  courts with far-right ideologues would have a devastating impact 

                  on civil rights, reproductive rights, religious liberty, environmental 

                  protection, consumer and worker rights, and much more. He called 

                  on Senators to fulfill their constitutional obligation to review 

                  judicial nominees carefully and to reject those who are not 

                  committed to preserving Americans&#146; rights, liberties, and 

                  legal protections.</font></p>
