                - March 11 - In a letter delivered yesterday to President Bush, 

                U.S. war veterans questioned the wisdom of invading Iraq now and 

                sought a meeting with the White House to discuss their concerns. 

                Initiated by the Washington-based veterans' group Veterans for 

                Common Sense, the letter was e-mailed to veterans this weekend 

                and quickly gathered nearly 1,000 signatories, including high-ranking 

                officers and Kris Kristofferson. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The letter 

                (see below) "strongly question[s] the need for war at this time," 

                noting signatories are "not convinced that coercive containment 

                has failed, or that war has become necessary." It argues that 

                unlike 1991's desert campaign to liberate Kuwait, invading Iraq 

                now would likely entail "protracted siege warfare, chaotic street-to-street 

                fighting in Baghdad, and Iraqi civil conflict," raising fears 

                of "casualties not witnessed since Vietnam." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Citing UN predictions 

                of massive Iraqi casualties, including 1.26 million children under 

                age five at particular risk, it states "excessive civilian casualties 

                like those predicted by the UN pose a grave risk to our national 

                security, making the U.S. more of a target of retaliatory attacks 

                by terrorists." Its signatories describe themselves as "patriotic 

                citizens and veterans who respect the office of the President," 

                requesting a meeting at his "earliest possible convenience." </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dear Mr. President: 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We, the undersigned 

                veterans who have served our country in World War II, Korea, Vietnam, 

                the 1991 Gulf War and other military conflicts, respectfully request 

                an opportunity to meet with you about the threat of war between 

                the United States and Iraq. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mr. President, 

                we are patriotic citizens and veterans who respect the office 

                of the President and the ethics and values binding us together 

                as Americans. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As such, we 

                feel duty-bound to share with you our serious concerns regarding 

                issues of national security, the appropriate use of our military 

                strength, and the health and welfare of our active duty soldiers, 

                sailors, airmen and marines. Those of us who are veterans of the 

                1991 Gulf War can offer particular insight into the ongoing troubles 

                in the Middle East, and the likely consequences of another war 

                in that volatile region. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A dozen years 

                ago, we helped liberate Kuwait from Iraqi occupation, and in the 

                course of combat operations came face to face with brutality and 

                the consequences of modern warfare. We learned how unpredictable 

                the nature of war can be. And we learned that war-related losses 

                are not simply experienced on the battlefield. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Following the 

                1991 Gulf War, we collectively failed to prevent Saddam Hussein's 

                violent repression of a popular uprising and the unprecedented 

                refugee flight that ensued. As a result, tens of thousands of 

                innocent civilians died. In addition to those deaths, the war 

                and immediate post-war conditions resulted in the excess deaths 

                of 46,900 children under the age of five, according to the New 

                England Journal of Medicine (September 24, 1992). </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Over the long 

                term, the 1991 Gulf War has had a lasting, detrimental impact 

                on the health of countless people in the region, and on the health 

                of American men and women who served there. Twelve years after 

                the conflict, over 164,000 American Gulf War veterans are now 

                considered disabled by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. 

                That number increases daily. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The possibility 

                of large-scale war between the U.S. and Iraq looms before us once 

                again. For this urgent reason we would like to meet with you to 

                discuss steps the United States and its allies can take to protect 

                U.S. soldiers, allied forces, and Iraqi civilians from known and 

                suspected hazards that would result from military operations. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We understand 

                the risks that come with war and that there are times when such 

                risks are necessary. However, we strongly question the need for 

                a war at this time. Despite Secretary of State Colin Powell's 

                report to the Security Council and the testimony of others in 

                the administration, we are not convinced that coercive containment 

                has failed, or that war has become necessary. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Our own intelligence 

                agencies have consistently noted both the absence of an imminent 

                threat from Iraq and reliable evidence of cooperation between 

                Iraq and Al Qaeda. Again, we question whether this is the right 

                time and the right war. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Further, we 

                believe the risks involved in going to war, under the unclear 

                and shifting circumstances that confront us today, are far greater 

                than those faced in 1991. Instead of a desert war to liberate 

                Kuwait, combat would likely involve protracted siege warfare, 

                chaotic street-to-street fighting in Baghdad, and Iraqi civil 

                conflict. If that occurs, we fear our own nation and Iraq would 

                both suffer casualties not witnessed since Vietnam. We fear the 

                resulting carnage and humanitarian consequences would further 

                devastate Iraqi society and inflame an already volatile Middle 

                East, and increase terrorism against U.S. citizens. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Our concerns 

                about the potential human and material costs of a military conflict 

                in Iraq are well substantiated. In the event of a war, the UN 

                warns that 1.26 million children under the age of 5 in Iraq will 

                be at risk of death. Within the initial weeks of conflict, the 

                World Health Organization estimates 500,000 Iraqis would need 

                immediate medical attention. Ten million Iraqis would need immediate 

                humanitarian assistance and over 2 million Iraqis would be made 

                homeless. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The scale of 

                the crisis would be so large that the international community 

                would be unable to prevent widespread suffering. For these reasons 

                and more, it remains in our nation's best interest to avoid another 

                war. The risk of excessive civilian casualties like those predicted 

                by the UN pose a grave risk to our national security, making the 

                U.S. more of a target of retaliatory attacks by terrorists. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mr. President, 

                as our Commander-in-Chief, we recognize the immense responsibility 

                you have to protect our homeland and keep our nation secure. As 

                veterans who honorably served our nation in its wars, we believe 

                that our perspectives, knowledge and expertise can aid you at 

                this crucial time, as you continue to deliberate on whether or 

                not to commit our nation to war. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We therefore
