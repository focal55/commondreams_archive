- June 2 - Seven of the eight people facing serious execution

dates in June are African American or Latino, demonstrating unfair

bias in the way the death penalty is applied, the National Coalition to 

Abolish the Death Penalty said today.

 </font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Between June 5 and June 27, eight people face serious execution

dates in the states of Indiana, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas

and Utah. (A ninth person, Troy Kell of Utah, also has an execution

date pending but is expected to receive a stay.) Of the eight people

with serious dates, six are African American, one is Latino and one

is white.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The eight inmates facing execution, their scheduled dates and their

ethnicity are as follows:

 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Kenneth Charm of Oklahoma, June 5. Charm is black.

Kia Johnson of Texas, June 11. Johnson is black.

Joseph Trueblood of Indiana, June 13. Trueblood is white.

Earnest Martin of Ohio, June 18. Martin is black.

Abu-Ali Abdur'Rahman of Tennessee, also June 18. Abdur'Rahman is black.

Lewis Williams of Ohio, June 24. Williams is black.

Jerome Campbell of Ohio, June 27. Campbell is black.

Roberto Arguelles of Utah, June 27. Arguelles is Latino.

 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The death penalty is biased in two ways when it comes to race,"

said Steven W. Hawkins, executive director of the National Coalition

to Abolish the Death Penalty. "First, blacks make up 43 percent of 

death row population, but only 13 percent of the U.S. population

generally. Second, and more significantly, the race of the victim

often determines who lives and who dies. Of those executed since

1976, 81 percent were convicted of killing white victims. 19 percent

were convicted of killing minority victims."

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hawkins noted that a number of the executions scheduled in June

dramatically portray problems with the way the death penalty is

applied:

 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">****Abdur'Rahman of Tennessee faces execution despite the fact

that he is possibly innocent, received grossly ineffective legal

representation at trial, was the victim of prosecutorial 

misconduct and may well be substantially mentally ill. In

petitioning for a review of Abdur'Rahman's conviction and

sentence before the U.S. Supreme Court, six former state and 

federal prosecutors in Tennessee wrote that the prosecutor's

behavior "fell far short of the standards of our state court

system and, indeed, below what we understand the federal 

constitutional minimum standards to be."

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">****Campbell of Ohio faces execution despite evidence of

innocence. Campbell's innocence claim, which is supported by recent

DNA testing, moved the Ohio Adult Parole Board to vote

for clemency. Gov. Bob Taft will make the final decision, assuming

that further appeals are unsuccessful.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">****Arguelles of Utah faces execution, after waiving his appeals,

despite serious questions regarding his mental competency.

Given a choice between lethal injection and firing squad, Arguelles 

chose the firing squad and has demanded that his execution proceed

without a hood being placed over his head. Arguelles has demonstrated

wildly irrational behavior during his court appearances, and in

1998 attempted suicide.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hawkins also pointed out that three additional people facing

execution -- Charm of Oklahoma, and Martin and Williams of Ohio --

have strong claims of mental retardation. The U.S. Supreme Court has 

ruled that executing people with mental retardation is unconstitutional,

but several states either have refused to implement guidelines to

adhere to the Court's ruling or are denying the reality that there are 

people on death row with mental retardation. 

 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"There are many reasons to oppose the death penalty," Hawkins said.

"Innocent people are sent to death row. People with mental retardation

and mental illness face death sentences, despite their lessened 

culpability. People with incompetent lawyers or unethical prosecutors

get death. Bias permeates the death penalty system. The executions

that are scheduled in June vividly demonstrate why it is time to 

abolish the death penalty."

 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hawkins said NCADP is urging its membership to contact the governors

and parole boards of Indiana, Ohio, Oklahoma, Texas, Tennessee and

Utah and request that the death sentences be commuted. To 

contact these state officials through NCADP's new Legislative

Action Center, please visit <a href="http://www.ncadp.org%20" target="_new">www.ncadp.org
