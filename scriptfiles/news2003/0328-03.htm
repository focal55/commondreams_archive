                YORK - March 28 - Reverend Jesse Jackson, United Methodist Bishop 

                C. Joseph Sprague and Pax Christi USA National Coordinator Dave 

                Robinson met with United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan 

                Thursday morning to urge the U.N. to support a call for the delivery 

                and facilitation of humanitarian aid. In a private meeting with 

                the Secretary General, the three interfaith leaders discussed 

                the looming humanitarian catastrophe facing the Iraqi people as 

                a result of the U.S.-led war against Iraq. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Annan informed 

                the group of religious leaders that "five million Iraqis are without 

                safe water and sanitation right now. Ten million need food and 

                one million children are chronically malnourished." As the war 

                intensifies, the devastation to the civilian population of Iraq 

                is expected to deepen and spread. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Due to what 

                they see as a state of paralysis in international diplomacy, the 

                three religious leaders approached Annan with the offer that religious 

                organizations and NGOs could step forward to broker a cease-fire 

                and respond to the growing humanitarian crisis in Iraq. They proposed 

                that a coalition of religious leaders and NGOs could work together 

                to avert further destruction and limit the damage to both the 

                environment and the infrastructure of Iraq. Jackson also emphasized 

                the role that religious leaders could play in seeing that both 

                sides treat POWs according to the rules of the Geneva Convention 

                and protect noncombatants. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"From the beginning, 

                the Catholic church has stated that this war lacks justification 

                across the board," said Robinson. "At this point, we need to shift 

                our analysis to how this war is now being waged. We demand reports 

                on the use by U.S. forces of depleted uranium, cluster bombs and 

                the number of civilian casualties." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During the 

                meeting, the Secretary General thanked the leaders for the role 

                that religious organizations have played in trying to stop the 

                war against Iraq. Annan thanked Robinson for the efforts of his 

                organization, Pax Christi USA, in attempting to bring Pope John 

                Paul II to the U.N. to make an appeal to the conscience of the 

                nations of the Security Council. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The meeting 

                at the U.N. occurred just 15 hours after Robinson and Sprague 

                were released from police custody following a nonviolent action 

                in Washington D.C. on Wednesday. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"It's of the 

                utmost importance that those of us who wish to stop this war use 

                every tool at our disposal," said Robinson. "We need to be in 

                the streets and in the halls of power." </font>
