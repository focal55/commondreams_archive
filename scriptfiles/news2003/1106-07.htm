- November 6 - Today, the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) -- a private, bipartisan corporation created by the Republican and Democratic parties -- announced the locations for the so-called presidential debates it expects to sponsor in 2004.  <a href="http://www.opendebates.org" target="_new">Open Debates</a>, a nonpartisan organization committed to informative presidential debates, is promoting an alternative. &quot;The CPD won't be hosting real presidential debates that educate voters, regardless of where they're located,&quot; said Open Debates' Executive Director George Farah. The CPD represents the interests of the national Republican and Democratic parties, not the American people. Despite its stated commitment to &quot;providing the best possible information to viewers and listeners,&quot; the CPD exists to secretly award control of the presidential debates to the Democratic and Republican candidates, at the expense of voter education. Presidential debates were run by the nonpartisan League of Women Voters until 1988, when the national Republican and Democratic parties seized control of the debates by establishing the bipartisan, corporate-funded CPD.  Co-chaired by the former heads of the Republican and Democratic parties, the CPD shields the major party candidates from challenging questions, difficult issues, and popular third party and independent candidates. Under the CPD's control, presidential debates have devolved into artificial news conferences, where the major party candidates merely recite prepackaged soundbites and avoid discussing many important issues. &quot;Presidential debates should consist of popular candidates addressing important issues in an unscripted manner,&quot; said Farah. &quot;But, the counterfeit debates hosted by the bipartisan CPD fail to address issues the American people want addressed, and fail to include the candidates the American people want included.&quot;</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Open Debates is working to establish a non-partisan Citizens' Debate Commission comprised of national civic leaders. The Citizens' Debate Commission will sponsor real presidential debates that are rigorous, fair, and inclusive of important issues and popular candidates. &quot;We are committed to establishing presidential debates that employ engaging formats and encourage authentic debate,&quot; said Open Debates' Organizing Director Chris Shaw.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Open Debates' board of directors consists of diverse civic leaders,
including: John B. Anderson, former Republican Congressman; Angela &quot;Bay&quot; Buchanan, president of The American Cause; Randall Robinson, founder of TransAfrica Forum; Larry Noble, Executive Director of the Center for Responsive Politics; Jon Hanson, Harvard Law professor; Pat Choate, former Reform Party vice-presidential candidate; Paul Weyrich, founder of the Heritage Foundation; and Professor Jamin Raskin, author of 'Overruling Democracy'. </font></p>
