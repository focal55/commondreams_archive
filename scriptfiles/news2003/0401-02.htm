                - April 1 - Amnesty International is extremely concerned at the 

                increasing number of incidents in the conflict in Iraq which have 

                led to civilian deaths and casualties. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"United States 

                authorities must conduct an independent and thorough investigation 

                into an attack yesterday on a civilian vehicle that resulted in 

                the deaths of seven women and children," Amnesty International 

                said today. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Anyone suspected 

                of unlawfully killing civilians must be brought to justice." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Amnesty International 

                pointed out that US and UK forces must take all necessary precautions 

                to protect civilians, regardless of any violations by Iraqi forces. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The duty to 

                protect one's own soldiers cannot justify any violation of international 

                humanitarian law. The military must implement measures that will 

                safeguard the lives of civilians and other non-combatants and 

                ensure that incidents like this are never repeated." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to 

                the Washington Post, on 31 March soldiers with the US Army's 3rd 

                Infantry Division opened fire on an unidentified four-wheel drive 

                vehicle as it was approaching a US checkpoint near al-Najaf. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The newspaper 

                reported that an officer initially ordered the soldiers to fire 

                a warning shot, but as the vehicle came closer to the checkpoint, 

                the officer ordered the soldiers to stop the vehicle. It is unclear 

                whether the soldiers had fired a warning shot before one or more 

                of the Bradley Fighting Vehicles opened fire with 25mm cannons, 

                killing up to 10 of the 15 passengers in the civilian vehicle. 

                The victims are said to include five children and several women. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The US Department 

                of Defense reportedly stated that the shooting occurred after 

                the driver of the vehicle had ignored shouted warnings and warning 

                shots, which does not appear to be consistent with the version 

                of the incident reported by the Washington Post. </font>
