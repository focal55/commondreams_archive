- December 8 - As an organization dedicated to educating the public about the importance of the civil justice system, we believe it is imperative to correct the record when we see stories that feed into a false and dangerous perception that the system is overflowing with frivolous lawsuits.  Such is the December 15, 2003 Newsweek cover story, <I>Lawsuit Hell</I>. </FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The entire article is data-starved, based almost exclusively on incompletely-described anecdotes, and a rehash of widely-discredited arguments that date back as far as the 1980s. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The article fails to discuss statistics on litigation, which actually show overall that tort litigation is decreasing in this country.  It contains no actual data to support its theory that Americans today are &#147;sue-happy&#148; - in fact, the data shows the exact opposite is true.  It cites a number of wild exaggerations, largely discredited, about costs of the legal system and &#147;defensive&#148; medicine.  It relies on cases that were thrown out or never filed as evidence that the system is out of control.  It repeatedly calls juries overly sympathetic, emotional, and unable to handle complex issues, even though close observers of the jury system, including judges, believe the opposite.  And it mentions almost nothing about the critical benefits of our civil justice system. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">With corporate interests already dominating the executive and legislative branches of government, our civil courts exist as one of the few places left in America where individual citizens can successfully confront powerful industries and institutions, force changes in their dangerous or unethical behavior and seek justice.  The power and authority of civil jurors, who cannot be wined, dined and bought-off by corporate lobbyists, represents a tremendous threat to the corporate power structure in this country.  This is why there has been such a sustained attack on civil juries in recent years, and why an endless number of corporate-backed front groups have been created to generate fear, alarm and contempt for the rights of injured Americans to hold accountable companies that cause injuries.  Newsweek Magazine has now sadly joined this effort, doing a tremendous disservice to the important debate around civil justice issues. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">A full critique of the Newsweek article can be found at <A HREF="http://centerjd.org/Newsweekrel.pdf%20" TARGET="_new">http://centerjd.org/Newsweekrel.pdf </A></FONT></P><P></P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p></font><!-- #EndEditable --></td></tr>
