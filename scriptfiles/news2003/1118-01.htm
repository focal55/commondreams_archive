<td valign="top" align="left" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Columbus, Georgia - November 18 -</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> Mass convergence and civil disobedience action at Fort Benning, Georgia, Nov. 22-23</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Thousands will take direct action this weekend to close what they call a terrorist training camp on U.S. soil -- the School of the Americas, renamed Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation (SOA/WHISC), a combat-training school for Latin American soldiers. On Nov. 22-23, thousands will gather at the gates of Ft. Benning, Ga., site of the school, to expose a double standard. SOA grads continue to be implicated in egregious acts designed to terrorize and coerce civilian populations throughout Latin America. Hundreds of thousands of Latin Americans have been tortured, raped, assassinated, &quot;disappeared&quot; and massacred by SOA graduates.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The gathering will culminate Sunday with a solemn &quot;funeral&quot; procession to the gates of Ft. Benning. Many will negotiate a barbed-wire fence to enter the base in an act of nonviolent civil disobedience. Since protests against SOA-WHISC began over ten years ago, 170 people served or are now serving federal prison sentences for civil disobedience.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The weekend will feature music and speakers from Latin and North America, including Pete Seeger; Sister Helen Prejean; Kathy Kelly of Voices in the Wilderness; and Bob King, V.P. of the United Auto Workers International.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">SOA graduates return to their countries to utilize their training domestically and are consistently cited for atrocities against their own people. Critics say President Bush used this same argument against Saddam Hussein to leverage an invasion of Iraq, while ignoring U.S. culpability in gross human rights violations throughout Latin America.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">There has never been an impact-assessment of the training offered at the school. SOA-trained soldiers have committed atrocities both as soldiers and as renegades, forming paramilitaries, death squads and drug trafficking operations. Last month the Mexican Secretary of Defense revealed that SOA-trained ex-soldiers, once part of an elite Mexican army division, are now working as highly-trained hired assassins for the Gulf Cartel.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">SOA Watch organizers are working in solidarity and coordinating with organizers of the protests to oppose the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) in Miami (Nov. 19-21). Critics of the SOA/WHISC assert that the school's underlying purpose is to make way for U.S. corporate interests.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Destructive free-trade policies and repressive militarism are two sides of the same coin,&quot; said Fr. Roy Bourgeois, founder of SOA Watch.</FONT></P><P></P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p></font><!-- #EndEditable --></td></tr>
