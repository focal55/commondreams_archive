                YORK - April 9 - U.S. and coalition forces must not allow a security 

                vacuum to develop in areas of Iraq under their occupation, Human 

                Rights Watch said today. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Human Rights 

                Watch is deeply concerned about reports of widespread looting 

                and lawlessness in areas outside of Iraqi government control. 

                Human Rights Watch is also concerned about the potential for violent 

                reprisals by Iraqi civilians against those suspected of supporting 

                the government of Saddam Hussein. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The responsibility 

                of U.S. and coalition forces doesn't end when they defeat opposing 

                troops," said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights 

                Watch. "Occupying forces are responsible for protecting civilians, 

                not just during combat but in the aftermath of fighting." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Press accounts 

                from Basra and other communities in southern Iraq speak of banditry 

                and looting of government buildings and other institutions such 

                as hotels, universities and hospitals. In some cities, civilians 

                have been ransacking government offices and removing important 

                documents related to the government's security apparatus. Such 

                documents are crucial for establishing accountability for human 

                rights violations in Iraq. Documents procured by Human Rights 

                Watch after the 1991 war were instrumental in establishing the 

                details of the Anfal campaign against Iraq's Kurds and the role 

                of Ali Hassan al-Majid, also known as "Chemical Ali," in conducting 

                that campaign on behalf of the Iraqi government. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">U.S. and U.K. 

                forces have at times stood by as the looting has occurred. In 

                Basra, for instance, Britain has publicly stated that it allowed 

                looting of Ba'ath party buildings as a means of showing that the 

                party had lost control of the city. Civilians in Qalat Sukkar, 

                150 miles southeast of Baghdad, asked U.S. forces to provide security 

                from armed groups plaguing them in the absence of regular Iraqi 

                police officers who disappeared when the city fell to American 

                forces, the New York Times reported on April 8. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Under international 

                humanitarian law, military commanders must prevent and where necessary 

                suppress serious violations involving the local population under 

                their control or subject to their authority. Furthermore, occupying 

                forces have an immediate duty to take all feasible steps to prevent 

                acts of violent reprisal. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The responsibility 

                for protecting civilians extends to the conduct of any local Iraqi 

                armed groups acting under authority of or in conjunction with 

                U.S. forces. That duty exists for the benefit of individuals allied 

                with the Iraqi government who have laid down their arms as well 

                as opponents of the government. Human Rights Watch has outlined 

                these duties previously in a policy paper (<a href="http://www.hrw.org/backgrounder/arms/iraq0202003.htm" target="_new">http://www.hrw.org/backgrounder/arms/iraq0202003.htm</a>) 

                and a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell and other 

                U.S. allies (<a href="http://www.hrw.org/press/2003/03/us031903ltr.htm" target="_new">http://www.hrw.org/press/2003/03/us031903ltr.htm</a>).

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Based on conduct 

                during the 1991 uprising following the conclusion of the war over 

                Kuwait, when brutal reprisals took place against those suspected 

                of supporting the Iraqi government, Human Rights Watch is particularly 

                concerned about the possibility of mass retaliatory violence and 

                lawlessness in the Shi'a heartland, including the cities of Basra, 

                Najaf and Karbala. Human Rights Watch has also highlighted the 

                northern city of Kirkuk as a potential flashpoint, in anticipation 

                of the return of more than 100,000 ethnic Kurds who had been forcefully 

                expelled by the Iraqi government (<a href="http://hrw.org/press/2003/03/iraq032703.htm" target="_new">http://hrw.org/press/2003/03/iraq032703.htm</a>).

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"U.S. and coalition 

                forces must immediately prepare to provide basic security and 

                humanitarian protection to civilians in Iraq," Roth said. "International 

                law does not permit armed troops to leave civilians to the mercy 

                of bandits and looters." </font>
