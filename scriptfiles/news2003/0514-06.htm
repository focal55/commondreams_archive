- May 14 - The version of the Bush 

Administration's tax cut bill this week adopted by the Senate 

Finance Committee -- scaled back from the initial Administration 

proposal -- sacrifices protections for millions of children in to 

pay for massive new tax breaks tilted toward America's 189,795 

millionaires, according to a state-by-state analysis today released 

by the Children's Defense Fund. The cost of the Senate's tax break 

package is more than enough to provide full health coverage and 

Head Start's comprehensive preschool services for all the children 

in America who need it -- 9.2 million children without health 

insurance and 1.8 million who need Head Start but do not receive 

it, even though they are eligible. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Children's Defense Fund President Marian Wright Edelman said 

such greed is shameful in the face of the unmet needs of America's 

poor children, noting that the Administration and Congress have 

made budget choices that starve and freeze children's protections 

while heaping more money on millionaires. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"It is a question of our priorities: a few millionaires or 

millions of children without health coverage," said Edelman. "We 

must reject billions in giveaways to the rich masquerading as 

economic stimulus. For the cost of the massive new tax breaks, we 

could provide health insurance for all our children and provide 

Head Start to every eligible child who needs it to succeed in 

school." 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Senate Finance Committee's tax cut bill provides over 

$64,000 to the average millionaire and $233 to the average 

middle-income American, according to the Urban Institute-Brookings 

Tax Policy Center. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Children's Defense Fund last month found that the number of 

Black children living in extreme poverty is at its highest level in 

23 years and earlier this year reported that long-term unemployment 

is spreading fastest in families with young children. The Bush 

Administration claims its plan to dismantle, eliminate, cut and 

freeze essential protections for children to pay for massive new 

tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans will spur the economy. Ten 

Nobel Prize winning economists noted that Bush Administration's tax 

plan "is not the answer" to the recent surge in joblessness.
