- September 14 - Campaigners have urged States Parties to the treaty 

that prohibits antipersonnel mines to do their utmost to stop use, production and stockpiling of the weapon in the Asia-Pacific region.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We've made headway in other parts of the world, but Asia is lagging behind 

in tackling the landmine problem,&quot; said Jody Williams, who received the 

1997 Nobel Peace Prize together with the International Campaign to Ban 

Landmines (ICBL).</font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The campaign is in Bangkok for the Fifth Meeting of States Parties to the 

Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and 

Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction (or Mine Ban 

Treaty).</font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An ICBL delegation of 250 plus campaigners, deminers, researchers and 

landmine survivors from 70 countries will be lobbying States Parties this 

week to renew their financial and political commitment to build a mine-free 

world.</font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The event, hosted by the Thai government and convened under the auspices of 

the United Nations, is the fifth annual meeting on the implementationof 

the 1997 treaty and the last formal gathering before a major treaty 

milestone, the Review Conference, scheduled for December 2004 in Nairobi, 

Kenya.</font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We call on States Parties to go all-out to promote the Mine Ban Treaty in 

this mine-ravaged region, &quot; said Tun Channareth, Cambodian landmine 

survivor and ICBL Ambassador. &quot;More can, and should, be done,&quot; he added.</font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There has been an overall reduction worldwide of government use of 

landmines, according to the ICBL's fifth annual report, Landmine Monitor 

Report 2003, which was released on 9 September. Since May 2002, at least 6 

governments have used antipersonnel mines, down from 9 and 13 in 2001 and 

2000 respectively. Similarly, fewer armed opposition groups are now laying 

mines: 11 groups compared with at least 14 in the last reporting period.</font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Landmines still being laid in Asia.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

A disproportionate number of users are in Asia. The campaign has fingered 

the governments of India, Pakistan, Nepal and Myanmar (Burma) for using 

antipersonnel mines and rebel groups in Burma, India, Nepal and the 

Philippines.</font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">More than a third of Asian countries are mine-polluted, including some of 

the most mine-contaminated countries in the world, such as Afghanistan and Cambodia. Last year, 14 of the 15 mine-affected countries 

in the region suffered casualties due to mines and unexploded ordnance.</font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Reports indicate that since May 2002 at least 3,000 people in Asia fell 

victim to the weapon, although the actual number is likely to be at least 

double this.  25 percent of the reported casualties were children.</font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite the enormous mine problem in the region, less than half its member 

countries have banned landmines. In Asia there are 17 States Parties to the 

treaty and a further five signatories. The following Asian countries have 

joined the treaty: Afghanistan, Australia, Bangladesh, Brunei (a signatory) 

Cambodia, Cook Islands (a signatory) Fiji, Indonesia (a signatory), Japan, 

Kiribati, Marshall Islands (a signatory), Malaysia, Maldives, Nauru, New 

Zealand, Niue, Philippines, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Thailand, Timor-Leste 

and Vanuatu (a signatory).</font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 18 non-States Parties in Asia are: Bhutan, Burma/Myanmar, China, India, 

Korea (North), Korea (South), Laos, Micronesia, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, 

Palau, Papua New Guinea, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vietnam.</font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Landmine production and stockpiling concerns.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

The ICBL remains concerned about ongoing mine production, particularly in 

Asia. Nepal recently admitted that it has produced antipersonnel mines, an 

addition to the list of mainly Asian producers, which includes China, 

India, Myanmar, North Korea, South Korea, Pakistan, Singapore and Vietnam. 

(Other, non-Asian producers are: Cuba, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Russia and the 

United States.)</font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Asia is home to great numbers of antipersonnel mines: China keeps the 

world's largest stock of some 110 million antipersonnel mines and India and 

Pakistan, with the fifth and sixth largest stockpiles, hold an estimated 6 

million and 4-5 million respectively.</font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite this gloomy picture, the campaign pointed to some positive 

developments in Asia, including:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">   a.. Recent accessions by Afghanistan, a heavily mined country, and 

Timor-Leste;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

   b.. An apparent cessation of mine use in Sri Lanka by the government and 

the LTTE;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

   c.. Humanitarian mine clearance underway in States Parties Afghanistan, 

Cambodia and Thailand and in non-States Parties Laos, Sri Lanka and Vietnam;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

   d.. Moratoria on exports, or statements to that effect by all producers, 

except Myanmar and North Korea;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

   e.. The drying up of trade in Asia and worldwide;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

   f.. Japan and Thailand completely destroying their stockpiled mines;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

   g.. States Parties in the region contributing generously to mine action: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Japan's contribution in 2002 totalled US$49.4million, Australia donated 

US$8.7 million and New Zealand's support is valued at more than NZ$3 million.</font></p>
