                24- Amnesty International today condemned the unlawful killing 

                by unidentified gunmen of 24 civilians in Nadimarg village in 

                the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir. The dead included 11 women 

                and two children and were all members of the Kashmiri Pandit community.

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to 

                reports, around midnight on 23 March, approximate 15 men wearing 

                army fatigues and carrying automatic weapons disarmed police officers 

                at a nearby police station before ordering villagers out of their 

                homes. When the villagers where gathered outside, the armed men 

                fired on them indiscriminately killing 24 people before escaping 

                into nearby forest. So far no one has claimed responsibility for 

                the killings. This comes in the wake of the Government of Jammu 

                and Kashmir's calling on the Pandit community to return to the 

                Kashmir Valley after a decade and its attempts to restore the 

                rule of law across the state. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"All sides 

                must safeguard the lives of civilians in Jammu and Kashmir," Amnesty 

                International said. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"International 

                humanitarian law prohibits deliberate attacks on civilians and 

                those not taking direct part in hostilities. It is as yet unclear 

                who is responsible, but we wholeheartedly condemn this attack."

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The killing 

                of innocent civilians should never be used to score a political 

                point or undermine a political process," the international human 

                rights organization continued. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Amnesty International 

                urged the authorities to take measures to prevent further abuses 

                against civilians and to ensure that the killings in Nadimarg 

                are comprehensively and transparently investigated with a view 

                to identifying the perpetrators and holding them to account. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"In the past, 

                all too often the unlawful killing of civilians were left uninvestigated 

                and those responsible remain punished," Amnesty International 

                said. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As an example, 

                the organization referred to the massacre at Chitthisinghpora 

                in which 36 Sikh civilians were deliberately killed in March 2000, 

                which has still not been subjected to scrutiny. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An early consequence 

                of the rise of militancy in Jammu and Kashmir was the migration 

                of large numbers of the Hindu Pandit community from the Kashmir 

                Valley. The Pandits were regarded by some as having strong links 

                to the rest of India because they were Hindu and because they 

                held a large percentage of government posts. Sections of the press 

                called for the community to leave the Valley and anti-Pandit demonstrations 

                took place in Srinagar. Several prominent members of the Pandit 

                community, such as leading academics, were allegedly killed by 

                militants. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1991 about 

                150,000 Kashmiri Pandits migrated from the Kashmir Valley. Those 

                who were wealthy or had relatives in New Delhi moved there while 

                the rest were relocated in camps around Jammu and New Delhi. A 

                decade later, thousands of the migrants still live in camps around 

                Jammu. According to government figures in April 2001, about 32,000 

                Kashmiri migrant families have been registered with relief organizations.
