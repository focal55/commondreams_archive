"Are Children Left Behind?: Children's Environmental Health 

Under the Bush Administration" 

-- Coalition Letter and Report Release 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Children's Environmental Health Network and over 40 partner 

groups -- medical, civil rights, faith, public health, and 

environmental -- call on President Bush to reverse 3 recent 

decisions: amending the "Executive Order on Children's 

Environmental Health and Safety" to exempt OMB and its decisions, 

withdrawing $1 million from 2003 funds for the National Children's 

Study, and supporting broad Department of Defense exemptions from 

environmental health regulations. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These decisions are part of a broader context of Administration 

actions, detailed in CEHN's new report. As a candidate, George W. 

Bush issued a strong statement detailing how he would safeguard 

children's health. CEHN will issue its second report on how the 

Bush administration is adhering to his promises, with an overview 

of the most important positive and negative actions taken. The 

report also identifies emerging high priority Federal issues in 

protecting children's environmental health. Embargoed copies are 

available upon request.

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHY: 

As Mother's Day approaches, how comfortable can parents be that 

Federal policies are providing a healthy environment, free from 

toxicants, for their children? The Children's Environmental Health 

Network compares Candidate George Bush's promises with the reality 

of how well his administration is protecting our children from 

environmental dangers such as air pollutants, unsafe pesticide and 

chemical residues, and heavy metals. This report succeeds the 

Network's July 2001 report, Bush administration "Six Month 

Check-Up: A Follow Up Of Campaign Promises" and builds on Bush 

statements from 2000.
