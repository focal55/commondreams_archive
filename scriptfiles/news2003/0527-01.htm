- May 27 - The Administration's increased rhetoric and aggressive approach towards Iran is a dangerous and misguided policy which could further destabilize the region and further isolate the United States from the international community, Congressman Dennis J. Kucinich stated today.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today, Kucinich, Ranking Member of the Government Reform Subcommittee on National Security, Emerging Threats and International Relations, issued the following statement:

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The increased rhetoric and the aggressive approach that this Administration is threatening towards Iran is a dangerous and misguided policy that will destabilize the region and further isolate the United States from the international community. 	

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The rhetoric and posturing by this Administration serves only to validate impressions in the region that the United States is empire building. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"It is disturbing that as the nation is just beginning to learn that it was misled in the build-up to war in Iraq, that this Administration is seeking to continue its dangerous policy in the region with an aggressive posture towards Iran.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The Middle East region is at a critical juncture. Now more than ever, it is critical that the United States work with our friends and allies in the region to root out terrorists cells and implement a peaceful solution to Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Now is not the time for a continuation of this Administration's misguided policy of preemptive and unilateral war."
