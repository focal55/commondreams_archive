                - April 2 - Amnesty International is deeply concerned about the 

                high toll of civilian casualties and the use of cluster bombs 

                in US military attacks in heavily populated areas. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On 1 April, 

                at least 33 civilians including many children were reportedly 

                killed and around 300 injured in US attacks on the town of al-Hilla. 

                Amnesty International is particularly disturbed by reports that 

                cluster bombs were used in the attacks and may have been responsible 

                for some of the civilian deaths. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The use of 

                cluster bombs in an attack on a civilian area of al-Hilla constitutes 

                an indiscriminate attack and a grave violation of international 

                humanitarian law," Amnesty International emphasized today. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"If the US 

                is serious about protecting civilians, it must publicly commit 

                to a moratorium on the use of cluster weapons. Using cluster munitions 

                will lead to indiscriminate killing and injuring of civilians," 

                the organization added. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to 

                reports, the type of cluster bomblets used in al-Hilla was BLU97 

                A/B. Each cannister contains 202 small bomblets -- BLU97 -- the 

                size of a soft drink can. These cluster bomblets scatter over 

                a large area approximately the size of two football fields. At 

                least 5% of these 'dud' bomblets do not explode upon impact, turning 

                them into de facto anti-personnel mines because they continue 

                to pose a threat to people, including civilians, who come into 

                contact with them. </font> 

                <p></p>
