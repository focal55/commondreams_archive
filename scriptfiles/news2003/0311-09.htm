                - March 11 - Today, the US Campaign to Ban Landmines (USCBL) criticized 

                the US military for officially and specifically acknowledging 

                for the first time that it plans to use antipersonnel mines in 

                Iraq. At a Pentagon briefing on Wednesday a senior defense official 

                told reporters that US forces "might deny access to [a chemical 

                weapons site] by using self-destructing small mines." Reportedly, 

                the US has some 90,000 landmines already stockpiled in the region. 

                The last time the US used antipersonnel mines was in the 1991 

                Persian Gulf War. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The use of 

                antipersonnel landmines would endanger Iraqi civilians, US troops, 

                future peacekeepers and deminers," said Dan Smith, retired US 

                Army Colonel. "Use of this indiscriminate weapon in Iraq would 

                more than likely lead to civilian and US troop casualties, as 

                it did during the 1991 Persian Gulf War," said Smith. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Members of 

                Congress from both parties recently sent a letter to President 

                Bush urging him to prohibit US troops from using antipersonnel 

                mines in Iraq. The January letter states: "The United States military, 

                unquestionably the strongest in the world, can defend itself and 

                its interests without the aid of this indiscriminate menace." 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A recent US 

                General Accounting Office (GAO) report on the use and effects 

                of landmines during the Persian Gulf War stated that some US commanders 

                were reluctant to use mines "because of their impact on US troop 

                mobility, safety concerns, and fratricide potential." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Any US use 

                of antipersonnel mines would run counter to and serve to undermine 

                the complete rejection of the weapon by most of the rest of the 

                world. One hundred forty-six nations have signed the 1997 Mine 

                Ban Treaty, but not the United States or Iraq. All NATO countries 

                except the United States have embraced the ban. Allied forces 

                such as the UK, which has already positioned 25,000 troops in 

                the region, will be in violation of the treaty if they assist 

                US troops in mine-deployment operations. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"To use antipersonnel 

                mines in Iraq would further isolate the US, given that nearly 

                all of our allies have outlawed this weapon of terror," said Gina 

                Coplon-Newfield, Coordinator of the USCBL. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Moreover, the 

                US Air Force air-dropped Gator mines being discussed are unlikely 

                to be effective in denying access to a facility. They cannot be 

                dropped with a high degree of precision, won't have the density 

                of a true barrier minefield, and, being on the surface, are easily 

                spotted, avoided, or cleared by an enemy. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Though President 

                Clinton did not sign the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty, he did issue a 

                Presidential Decision Directive that instructed the Pentagon to 

                move toward joining the treaty by 2006 if suitable alternatives 

                were developed. The Bush Administration has not yet finished its 

                formal review of US landmine policies. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"No Landmine 

                in use today, even a self-destructing landmine, is smart enough 

                to differentiate between a soldier and an innocent civilian," 

                said Jerry White, Co-Founder and Executive Director of Landmine 

                Survivors Network. "Use of antipersonnel mines by the US in Iraq 

                would reverse a decade of US pledges to eliminate these weapons." 

                = = The US Campaign to Ban Landmines is a coalition of approximately 

                500 veterans, medical, human rights, religious, and humanitarian 

                organizations as well as thousands of individuals nationwide advocating 

                for the US government to join the Mine Ban Treaty and to increase 

                support for demining and landmine victim assistance. The USCBL 

                is coordinated by Physicians for Human Rights, which shared the 

                1997 Nobel Peace Prize for its role in founding the International 

                Campaign to Ban Landmines. </font>
