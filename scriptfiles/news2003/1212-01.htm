<td valign="top" align="left" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">MILAN, ITALY- December 12 - The Kyoto process has continued its forward motion at the UN Climate Change Conference.  Despite the Bush Administration's efforts, multi-lateralism is clearly alive and well, said WWF today.</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">At the conference, decisions were made on the final building blocks of the Kyoto Protocol. WWF welcomes the conclusion of final rules for the use of forest carbon sequestration 'sinks' projects in the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM).  The rules recognize that sinks projects can have significant environmental and socio-economic impacts and contain some steps to address these. However, WWF is concerned that the rules do not adequately address issues such as the potential use of large-scale commercial plantations, GMOs and alien invasive species, and will monitor project implementation closely.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In a further positive development, a majority of the 188 parties to the UN Framework Convention for Climate Change rejected attempts by the US delegation to propose an alternative approaches to the Kyoto Protocol. The Bush administration's calls for more scientific research and investment in new technologies were based solely on technology, were dismissed as unrealistic and as an excuse for delaying emission cuts.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The Bush proposals are a mandate to keep polluters in business. They are not only woolly, economically unviable and unscientific but the US has no proof that they would deliver any CO2 reductions at all,&quot; said Jennifer Morgan, Director of the WWF Climate Change Programme. &quot;This meeting strongly reconfirmed that the only international approach to tackling global warming is the Kyoto Protocol.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WWF believes that Russia, the other major power that has so far failed to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, is still on track to join the world's only international agreement on climate change.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The latest word from Moscow is that the Russian ratification process is still under consideration and is most likely to happen sometime after the presidential elections in March 2004,&quot; said Alexey Kokorin, head of WWF-Russia's Climate Change Programme. &quot;The Kyoto Protocol is built on solid foundations. The house is now ready for 120 countries to move in. All we need is for Russia to put the key in the door.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WWF calls on countries to implement their commitments under Kyoto to reduce domestic CO2 emissions now to avoid dangerous climate change. The conservation organization welcomed pledges in Milan by Germany, the Philippines, the UK and others to keep average global temperature rise to below 2 degrees Celsius. WWF believes that if temperatures rise above this threshold, the world will suffer from increased flooding, droughts and glacial meltdown.</FONT></P><P></P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p></FONT><!-- #EndEditable --></td></tr>
