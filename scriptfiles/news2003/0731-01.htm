<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- July 31 - Many experts agree that obesity is one of the most pressing health problems facing the

country. Over the last twenty years, obesity rates have doubled in adults and children

and tripled in teens. Two-thirds of Americans are now overweight or obese.

Yet some food industry groups question whether obesity rates are increasing and

instead, claim that the rising rates are due to a change in the definition for obesity (Body

Mass Index). For anyone else who is skeptical, here are some other signs that obesity

rates are going up.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1&#149; Because of safety concerns, the Federal Aviation Administration has instructed

airlines to add ten pounds to approved passenger weights.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2&#149; When administering vaccines and drawing blood, doctors now need longer

needles to penetrate thicker layers of fat on Americans&#146; bodies</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3&#149; Almost 25% of women in their 50's are too large to have their body fat measured

with a traditional skinfold caliper, an instrument developed in the 1950&#146;s</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.4&#149; Liposuction is the most commonly performed cosmetic surgical procedure in the

U.S., increasing 118% between 1997 and 2001.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">    5&#149; Over the last decade, diabetes rates rose 60% in the U.S.5 (Over half of diabetes

cases are due to overweight, poor diet and physical inactivity.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">   6&#149; Today&#146;s size 10 was sold as a women&#146;s size 14 in the 1940's</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.7&#149; The Gap, Limited Too and Target are selling plus-sized clothes for youth</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.8&#149; Plus-size boutique Lane Bryant is expected to increase its number of stores from

650 to 1,000 over five years. Catherine's Plus Sizes is projected to increase from

470 to 700 stores. The plus-size clothing market generates $23 billion in sales a

year, accounting for a quarter of women&#146;s clothing sales</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">9&#149; Nike changed the size scale for its women&#146;s fitness apparel. A small sports bra

use to fit a woman with a 33-inch to 35-inch bust. Now it fits a 35- to 37-inch

bust.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">10&#149; One of the reasons that the Boston Red Sox decided to rebuild the legendary

Fenway Park was that the seats were too narrow for today&#146;s baseball fans. The

seats in the new ballpark are four inches wider</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">11&#149; More benches and bigger seats have been installed in Seattle&#146;s Puget Sound

ferries to accommodate wider riders.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">12&#149; 

Despite the rising obesity rates and the tremendous impact</font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">they are having on

Americans&#146; health and health-care costs, federal and state governments still are

doing little to address the problem. To reduce obesity, federal, state and local

governments need to mount campaigns to promote healthy eating and physical

activity, require calorie labeling in fast food and other chain restaurants, decrease

the availability of junk food in schools, make walking and biking safer and more

convenient by building bike lanes, sidewalks and trails, increase physical education

in schools, restrict junk-food advertising and marketing aimed at children, and put

into place other policies and programs that help to make it easier for Americans to

eat better and be more physically active.
