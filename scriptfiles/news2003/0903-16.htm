-  

September 3 - WHAT:    On Thursday, September 4 &shy; the day that controversial new FCC media

ownership rules go into effect &shy; free speech advocates and media consumers will protest at media outlets in half a dozen cities. They hope to encourage Congress, which is considering legislation to overturn the FCC decision, and counter the new pro-consolidation advertising campaign that was launched this week by CBS, NBC and Fox television.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">'The media companies' new slogan is &quot;America says don't get between me and my TV.&quot; Well we say, &quot;Don't let the media companies hijack our democracy,&quot; said Andrea Buffa, who works with Global Exchange and Media Alliance, two of the groups organizing the protests. &quot;Literally a handful of large corporations already dominate 80% of what the American public sees and hears. Congress needs to overturn the new FCC rules now, before these companies get even more control over the public debate.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite an outpouring of opposition from across the political spectrum, including half a million people who filed public comments with the FCC, the Commission&sup1;s Republican majority voted on June 2 to radically deregulate the media and allow huge media corporations to own even more television stations and local newspapers, endangering media diversity.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Protests against the new media ownership rules are planned in Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Pittsburgh, Charlotte, and Washington, DC. In San Francisco, activists will protest at KPIX-TV (owned by Viacom), KGO-TV (owned by Disney), and the San Francisco bureau of Fox News Channel (owned by Rupert Murdoch&sup1;s NewsCorp).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If the new FCC media rules are not reversed, many people believe we will see more deals like the expected NBC purchase of media giant Vivendi Universal Entertainment (reported by AP on Sept. 2). The result of further media consolidation will likely be &quot;more sensationalism, commercialism, crassness, violence, homogenization &shy; and noticeably less serious coverage of news and local events,&quot; testified dissenting FCC commissioner Jonathan Adelstein.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The national day of protest against the new FCC rules and the media monopoly is being organized by the Charlotte Fellowship of Reconciliation, CodePink: Women for Peace, Democracy Rising, Free Press, Global Exchange, Media Alliance, Prometheus Radio Project, Reclaim the Media, United for Peace and Justice, and others.
