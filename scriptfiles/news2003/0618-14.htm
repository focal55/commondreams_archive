- June 18 - A congressional panel today voted for deep cuts in funding for additions to National Parks, Forests and Wildlife Refuges, state parks and recreational facilities, and forest conservation on private land. The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF), the popular federal program that funds land purchases for National Parks, National Wildlife Refuges and National Forests, is slated to be cut by more than 50 percent in 2004. In addition, the bill abandons Congress' commitment to the Conservation Trust Fund, and cuts support for the Forest Legacy public-private forest conservation effort by over 25 percent.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Congress is taking a sharp right turn away from our country's commitment to conservation,&quot; said Bonnie Galvin, Director of Appropriations and Budget programs at The Wilderness Society. &quot;Only by continuing to invest in protecting America's natural heritage can we hope to pass that legacy on to future generations undamaged.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Perennially popular with lawmakers of both parties, the LWCF is authorized to receive up to $900 million annually to purchase additional acreage to complete national parks, forests and wildlife refuges, and to fund state and local parks and recreational facilities. The FY 2004 Interior Appropriations bill that passed the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee today includes just $198 million for LWCF, down over 50 percent ($213 million) from 2003, and almost 65 percent ($346 million) from 2001.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Within LWCF, federal land acquisition is down over 75 percent from recent years, reduced from over $450 million in 2001 to $100 million in this bill. LWCF federal land acquisition funds have been used in the past to preserve such crown jewels as Everglades National Park, Rocky Mountain National Park, and the Appalachian Trail.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- The Forest Legacy program has provided vital support for conservation efforts on private forest lands, enlisting voluntary cooperation from hundreds of private landowners to manage their forested acreage for habitat, wildlife, and watershed protection. The FY 2004 Interior Appropriations bill includes only approximately $50 million for Forest Legacy, down over 25 percent from FY 2003.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;These cuts didn't have to happen,&quot; said Galvin. &quot;Just three years ago, in 2000, Congress created a new funding mechanism called the Conservation Trust Fund to make sure that America would always reserve enough money to address its most pressing conservation, wildlife and recreation needs.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But the FY 2004 Interior Appropriations bill does not maintain the Conservation Trust Fund (CTF) mechanism, and walks away from Congress' commitment to honor America's conservation, wildlife and recreation needs. The FY 2004 Interior Appropriations bill appears to be over $500 million below its $1,560 million CTF dedicated funding level for FY 2004.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;In good times and in bad, in war and in peace, Americans have steadfastly protected the unequaled places that make this country special,&quot; said William H. Meadows, President of The Wilderness Society. &quot;America's investment has paid extraordinary dividends: we have nurtured National Parks, Forests and Wildlife Refuges and other public lands that are the envy of the world. Now is the time to be building on that investment, not walking away from it.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During the 2000 Presidential campaign, candidate George W. Bush promised repeatedly to &quot;fully fund&quot; the LWCF, and the Administration has claimed credit in the past two years for securing full funding. However, in reality the Administration has been seeking less and less money for the land acquisition portion of LWCF each year, while redefining the fund and redirecting monies to other purposes.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since 2001, the LWCF's appropriation has been cut, while additional programs have been pushed under the LWCF umbrella. The result has been the appearance of full funding, but a cut of about $350 million for federal land acquisition in the bill compared to 2001.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Congress is letting the Bush Administration get away with its smoke and mirrors game on LWCF,&quot; said Galvin. &quot;Instead of appropriating the funds we need to protect our most important wildlife habitat and most spectacular landscapes for all Americans, Congress is playing along with the Bush Administration's shell game.&quot;</font></p>
