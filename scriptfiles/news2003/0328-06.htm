                - March 28 - Today, at a press conference on Capitol Hill, Congressman 

                Dennis J. Kucinich (D-OH), who leads opposition to the war in 

                Iraq, issued the following statement: </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">“This Administration 

                has never made its case for war against Iraq. It is an unjustified 

                war, which the Administration continues to misrepresent and exaggerate. 

                The most recent example is the Administration's characterization 

                of international coalition support for this war. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">“This morning, 

                President Bush once again exaggerated the extent of support for 

                the war stating that the coalition of countries supporting this 

                war is larger than the 1991 Gulf War. What Bush failed to mention 

                was that back in 1991, all of the 34 coalition members offered 

                military force, by contributing troops on the ground, aircraft, 

                ships or medics. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">“This war involves 

                the troops of only the U.S., Britain, Australia, Poland and Albania. 

                Not even the three members of the Security Council that support 

                the war, Spain, Italy, and Bulgaria are committing military support. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">“This Bush 

                Administration has been adding coalition member to their list 

                based on statements of “moral” support. As the Washington Post 

                reported last week, if this type of criteria was used back in 

                1991, the size of the coalition would likely have topped 100 countries. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">“Further, the 

                total cost of the Gulf War to the United States was around $4 

                billion dollars. This time, the President has come to Congress 

                requesting a $75 billion bill, all of which will be paid by U. 

                S. taxpayers. Clearly, military and economic support from countries 

                is far more important than statements of “well-wishes”. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">“This war must 

                end now. It was unjust when it started last week, and is still 

                unjust today. The U.S. should get out now and try to save the 

                lives of American troops and Iraqi citizens. Most importantly, 

                ending the war now and resuming weapons inspections could salvage 

                world opinion of the United States, which has been deteriorating 

                since the talk of war began. After all, the greatest threat to 

                the United States at this time is terrorism, which is breeding 

                from this war.”
