- May 22 - Today Bluewater Network wrote Ford CEO William Ford Jr., asking him to turn his environmental rhetoric into industry leadership. In his letter, Russell Long, Executive Director of Bluewater Network, wrote that Ford’s actions have fallen far short of his highly publicized statements that Ford Motor Company is committed to environmental protection. Bluewater Network informed Mr. Ford that it will launch a nationwide consume boycott of Ford products if Mr. Ford does not commit to build clean cars and promote legislation to protect the planet from auto-related global warming pollution.

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bluewater Network’s letter highlights the dire consequences of America’s inefficient, fossil-fuel dependent cars, trucks, and SUV’s. Hospitalizations and deaths from pollution-related illness strike tens of thousands of Americans annually. The world’s climate scientists have prescribed a massive reduction, if not a total elimination, of greenhouse gas emissions to avert catastrophic global warming. And America’s dependence on imported oil jeopardizes political and economic security more than ever.

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“By reneging on his pledge to improve SUV fuel mileage, and by personally lobbying Congress not to increase fuel mileage standards, Mr. Ford exposed his company’s Matrix-like strategy. First, he convinced the nation that he was an environmentalist, and then fought like a tiger against any regulation to protect the environment,” said Long. “It’s tough to say where the propaganda ends and the reality begins, but one thing is for sure – he can’t have it both ways.”

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a national campaign timed to coincide with Ford’s 100th anniversary, Bluewater Network will urge consumers not to purchase Ford vehicles until the company:

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">¨       Commits to only produce vehicles with zero tailpipe greenhouse gas emissions by 2017, starting with their hydrogen-powered internal combustion vehicle by 2007;

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">¨       Immediately agrees to honor its pledge to increase SUV fuel economy 25 percent;

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">¨       Vigorously lobbies for national and international standards to double fuel economy; 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">¨       Actively supports California’s new greenhouse gas law (AB 1493) by refusing to participate in any industry legal challenges against it.



 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“Ford has the technology, but lacks the commitment to lead the automobile industry to protect America’s children and future generations. They have developed a clean, affordable hydrogen car that uses a conventional combustion engine, but consumers shouldn’t hold their breath -- Ford won’t sell it,” said Long.



 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bluewater Network launched itself to the forefront of clean automobile policy when it conceived, drafted, and sponsored Assembly Bill 1493 -- California’s landmark law to minimize greenhouse gas emissions from the passenger vehicles. While the campaign to pass AB 1493 progressed, Mr. Ford did not respond to Bluewater’s invitation to discuss the legislation. Instead, Ford Motor Company, through the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, actively opposed the historic greenhouse gas legislation.
