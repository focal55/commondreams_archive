                - April 15 - According to a whistleblower and back up documents, 

                another potential espionage incident involving a Chinese national 

                occurred under the watch of the Lawrence Livermore Counter-Intelligence 

                Chief who is now under investigation. Documents detailing the 

                incident are mysteriously missing from official files. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A whistleblower 

                from the Lawrence Livermore National Lab (LLNL) came to POGO over 

                a year ago with concerns of security problems at Livermore. One 

                of his allegations involved what he believed was a potential espionage 

                case involving a Chinese national who was an employee at the lab. 

                When he raised questions about why nothing was being done to pursue 

                this case, and other concerns of the security force, he was forced 

                to resign. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now that questions 

                are being raised about the reliability of the recently resigned 

                Counter-Intelligence Chief at Livermore, William Cleveland, for 

                being sexually involved with an alleged Chinese double agent, 

                this case has taken on new relevance. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mark Danielson 

                was a member of the SWAT team at Livermore in 1998. According 

                to a July 8, 1998 Incident Report #980708-05, during a random 

                check at the South Gate of the trunk of a vehicle belonging to 

                an employee who was a Chinese national, the officers found a Kodak 

                camera and a Sony tape recorder under a blanket. They also found 

                a briefcase containing a laptop computer, belonging to another 

                Livermore employee. According to Danielson, this computer was 

                later determined to contain classified information. All three 

                of these items are prohibited from being brought into the lab. 

                The security officers were ordered by higher-ups to give the items 

                back to the detained employee, and allow him to enter the facility. 

                According to Danielson, he was miffed by this action. When he 

                complained about the handling of the case, DOE Security Czar Eugene 

                Habiger, wrote “a check of that database showed no identical or 

                similar incident for the entire period during which Mr. Danielson 

                was employed.” William Cleveland was responsible for investigating 

                such incidences at Livermore at the time. </font>

                see the Department of Energy and the University of California 

                explain this one,” said POGO Senior Investigator Peter Stockton.

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">William Cleveland, 

                a former FBI official in San Francisco, was the lead agent on 

                a number of Chinese espionage investigations, including “Tiger 

                Trap” in the 1980s which involved the transfer of classified information 

                on the neutron bomb to China. In 1993, he left the Bureau to become 

                the Chief of Counter-Intelligence at Lawrence Livermore National 

                Lab, which is operated by the University of California. According 

                to published reports, he became intimate with an alleged FBI double 

                agent, and has been stripped of his clearance and access to the 

                lab.
