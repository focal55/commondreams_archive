- August 12 - Citing indications that global

warming may be accelerating, Greens in the U.S. and

around the world have called for the Kyoto Accords to

be renegotiated.  </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greens are demanding that the U.S. lead the world in

measures to curtail global warming, with stronger

curbs on greenhouse gas emissions, elimination of

tradeable pollution credits, and increased efforts to

reduce fossil fuel dependence and convert to clean,

renewable energy such as solar and wind energy.  The<a href="http://www.global.greens.org.au/charter.htm" target="_new"> Global Green Charter </a>  

endorsed by Greens around the world, has called for

similar wide-ranging measures, including carbon taxes

on fossil fuel use.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to The New York Times (August 12), Utah Gov.

Michael Leavitt, President Bush's nominee for EPA

chief, opposed the Kyoto treaty; many Greens are

urging Democrats to filibuster Leavitt's confirmation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Scientists from the U.K.-based Institute for Public

Policy Research, the World Meteorological

Organization, and the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel

on Climate Change claim that manmade global climate

change seems to be proceeding much faster than earlier expected,&quot; said Lorna Salzman, a New York Green and candidate for the national party's presidential nomination.  &quot;We've begun to see the result -- extreme weather around the world, especially the record-breaking deadly heatwave in Europe, with depleted water resources, forest fires, rapidly melting Alpine glaciers, and an agricultural crisis.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greens note that the effect will be further aggravated

by rapid melting of the Arctic permafrost, by the

possible collapse of the western Antarctic ice shelf,

and by policies like President Bush's 'Healthy

Forests' proposal, which would allow timber companies

to mow down millions of acres of public forestlands.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This isn't a local environmental problem that can be

cleaned up next week, but the global ecological and

political crisis of the 21st century,&quot; said Jake

Schneider, treasurer of the Green Party of the United

States.  &quot;But it's hardly on the table for Democratic

and Republican candidates or in media coverage of the

2004 election.  If we judge from the Clinton and Bush administrations and the 2004 campaigns, it will make minimal difference to the advancement of climate change whether a Democrat or Republican is elected.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In November 2000, under pressure from the energy

industry, President Clinton's delegation at the Hague conference obstructed enactment of the Kyoto Accord's minimal steps to scale back global warming. In March 2001, President Bush withdrew from Kyoto entirely after pledging as a candidate to support the agreement.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Kyoto agreement undermined its own goals by

allowing 'horse-trading' of pollution credits by

industry, which will inadequately slow greenhouse gas

emissions -- but even Kyoto's modest measures were

unacceptable to oil companies,&quot; said Mark Dunlea,

chair of the Green Party of New York State.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greens sharply criticized the Senate's bipartisan

defeat in July of a Title 49 amendment to require

automakers to produce a fleet average of 40 miles per

gallon by 2015.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;There's no way to begin addressing global warming --

or security for America -- without changing fuel

consumption, which means imposing fuel efficiency

rules on the auto industry,&quot; said Alan Muller,

Executive Director of Green Delaware, a

community-based organization working on environment

and public health issues, and Green Party member.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 

While Congress surrenders to energy, oil, and car

lobbies, Bush policy on global warming is informed by industry-funded think tanks like the George C. Marshall Institute and the Competitive Enterprise Institute, as well as the American Petroleum Institute.  As a result, the Bush Administration has deluded Americans into thinking that there's no scientific consensus that manmade greenhouse gases are aggravating climate change.  It's a failure of environmental policy and democracy.  Greens will make this a major theme of our local and national campaigns in 2004.&quot;</font></p>
