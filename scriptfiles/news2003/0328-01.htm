                - March 28 - As U.S. and coalition forces prepare an assault on 

                the northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk, U.S. forces have a responsibility 

                to prevent the eruption of inter-ethnic violence, Human Rights 

                Watch said today. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Human Rights 

                Watch said widespread reprisal killings, retaliatory forced displacement, 

                and other acts of violence against resettled families are possible 

                once tens of thousands of forcibly displaced people return to 

                reclaim their homes. Oil-rich Kirkuk, currently under Iraqi government 

                control, has been the target of U.S. aerial bombing for the last 

                several days. U.S. paratroopers have landed in Iraqi Kurdistan 

                and it is likely that U.S. and coalition ground forces will enter 

                the city in the near future. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Kirkuk is 

                a disaster waiting to happen," said Hania Mufti, London director 

                for the Middle East and North Africa Division, now based in Arbil. 

                "If a plan for the gradual and orderly return of these displaced 

                civilians is not drawn up soon and implemented before the ground 

                offensive begins, there is a real possibility that the city will 

                erupt into inter-ethnic violence." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since the 1991 

                Gulf War, the Iraqi government has systematically expelled an 

                estimated 120,000 Kurds, Turkomans, and Assyrians from Kirkuk 

                and other towns and villages in this oil-rich region. Most have 

                settled in the Kurdish-controlled northern provinces. Meanwhile, 

                the Iraqi government has resettled Arab families in their place 

                in an attempt to reduce the political power and presence of ethnic 

                minorities, a process known as "Arabization." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Those who were 

                displaced were forced to abandon their homes, were stripped of 

                most of their possessions, and were deprived of any means of livelihood. 

                Scores of expelled Kurds and Turkomans interviewed by Human Rights 

                Watch during a September 2002 mission to Iraqi Kurdistan described 

                the relentless pressure by the state to drive them from their 

                homes by making their daily lives intolerable. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Human Rights 

                Watch researchers now based in Iraqi Kurdistan said the United 

                States has not prepared for returning displaced residents of Kirkuk. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We have found 

                no evidence that U.S. political and military leaders have prepared 

                for the consequences of a massive influx of returnees with grievances 

                against those who forced them from their homes, as well as those 

                who now live in their homes," said Mufti. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During talks 

                in Ankara in March 2003, U.S., Turkish and Iraqi opposition officials 

                discussed the idea of creating a coalition commission to oversee 

                issues relating to the northern front, including the orderly return 

                of internally displaced people to Kirkuk. To date, however, no 

                such commission has been established. Kurdish officials told Human 

                Rights Watch that they were uncertain as to the role of their 

                armed forces during any eventual ground offensive on Kirkuk. Both 

                Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) leader Mas'ud Barzani and Patriotic 

                Union of Kurdistan (PUK) leader Jalal Talabani have agreed to 

                commit their Pesh Merga forces only with U.S. approval and under 

                its command. Until now, the United States has not asked for such 

                participation, but that position could change in the light of 

                Turkey's refusal to grant access to U.S. forces through its territory. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"It is paramount 

                that the United States immediately address the consequences of 

                a future assault on Kirkuk," said Mufti. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Human Rights 

                Watch urged the United States to make concrete plans for the gradual 

                and orderly return of forcibly displaced residents, for the control 

                of mass population flows, for the removal of land mines and unexploded 

                ordinance, and for the implementation of security measures to 

                deal with any outbreaks of violence. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In recent days, 

                Human Rights Watch researchers have met with representatives of 

                the Iraqi opposition, including the PUK, KDP, the Iraqi Turkoman 

                Front, and the Iraqi National Congress, to discuss what preparations 

                have been made to regulate the return of displaced families to 

                Kirkuk. Kurdish officials have expressed serious concern about 

                the potential for inter-ethnic violence in the city, but said 

                there was very little they could do to stop a large-scale return 

                since displaced families had every right to reclaim their homes 

                as soon as possible. Some also said that "a significant number" 

                of Arab families settled in Kirkuk had already left and that they 

                hoped their departure would mitigate any violence. However, more 

                recent information indicates that the Iraqi government has forcibly 

                returned some of these Arab families to Kirkuk and to a number 

                of villages in the province that were also included in the "Arabization" 

                process. </font>

                including their right to choose a place of residence, and to move 

                to a place of safety either inside or outside Iraq. </font>

                from the moment they establish effective control over them. In 

                order to do so, they need to devote enough personnel to ensure 

                public safety, grant protection to all noncombatants, and prevent 

                the occurrence of acts of reprisal or revenge. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Human Rights 

                Watch called upon the U.S. government and its coalition partners 

                to undertake, as a matter of urgency, the following measures to 

                prevent the possibility of inter-ethnic violence in Kirkuk: </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">. Call publicly

                to Kirkuk and other affected areas. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">. Establish 

                a commission of coalition partners to address matters relating 

                to the return of the former residents of Kirkuk, including the 

                control of population flows, the clearance of land mines and unexploded 

                ordinance, and the prevention of inter-ethnic strife. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">. Make every 

                effort to secure government buildings in Kirkuk that could contain 

                Iraqi government documents pertaining to the "Arabization" policy, 

                including property deeds and nationality registration records. 

                Such documentation will be essential for a speedy and fair resolution 

                of all claims on homes and property, for family tracing and reunification 

                efforts and for future accountability for crimes committed by 

                Iraqi officials. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Human Rights 

                Watch also called upon the Kurdish authorities to go beyond making 

                general appeals to returning families that no reprisals be carried 

                out against Arab families settled by the Iraqi government in Kirkuk. 

                The Kurdish authorities should: </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">. Develop a 

                plan, to be made public as soon as possible, for the gradual and 

                orderly return of displaced families to Kirkuk. For example, organizing 

                the return of groups of displaced civilians according to the districts 

                from which they were expelled. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">. Continue 

                to compile records establishing the ethnicity and place of origin 

                of displaced civilians, including duplicates of nationality correction 

                forms, confiscated expulsion orders, and ration cards. </font>
