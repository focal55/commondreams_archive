- October 2 - Washington Lobbyist, Administration Cronies To Use $87 billion For War Profiteering.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Congressman Dennis J. Kucinich (D-OH), leader of the opposition to the war against Iraq in the House, again today took to the House floor to urge his colleagues to vote against the Administration's $87 billion supplemental request.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This spring, after combat began in Iraq, the Bush Administration came before Congress and asked us to support the troops and then turned around and cut veterans benefits by $25 billion.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Today, while we are being told to vote for $87 billion to support the troops we find that those who will benefit from this money are the army of lobbyists who have ties to this Administration. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Yesterday's The Hill newspaper points out, 'the President's right-hand-man quits his job just before the bombs start falling and sets up shop in the office of the biggest GOP lobbyist shop in town and starts selling his services to clients who want a piece of the big Iraqi reconstruction contract pie, the pie his old bosses are in charge of slicing up.'</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Today's Washington Post states, 'getting the right to distribute Procter and Gamble products in Iraq would be a gold mine stated one of the partners at New Bridge that did not want to be named. One well stocked 7-eleven could knock out 30 Iraqi stores. A Wal-Mart could take over the country.'</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;What we see is a hostile take over by those with influence on this Administration. Let us support the troops, not Administration cronies and Washington lobbyists. We should support the troops, not war profiteering.&quot;</font></p>
