<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NEW YORK - June 18 - Today, The Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) filed an amended complaint in a federal civil rights lawsuit that charges the U.S. with violating the rights of post 9/11 INS detainees.  The new papers incorporate disturbing information brought to light in a report issued on June 2 by the Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Justice.   </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report - entitled &quot;The September 11 Detainees: A Review of the Treatment of Aliens Held on Immigration Charges in Connection with the Investigation of the September 11 Attacks&quot; - provides a wealth of details on how the government's secret round up of hundreds of Muslim and Arab non-citizens after September 11 and confirms many of the allegations in the CCR lawsuit, Turkmen v. Ashcroft.  On Wednesday of last week, Judge John Gleeson of the Federal District Court in Brooklyn granted CCR's motion to amend its complaint paving the way for today's filing.

</p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Inspector General Report describes in scathing detail how the Department of Justice applied a blanket policy of denying bond to September 11 detainees and a &quot;hold until cleared policy&quot; under which detainees remained in dangerous and horrific detention conditions until they were cleared by the FBI.  The Report describes how decisions were often made on the basis of flimsy evidence; how the government adopted a policy of detaining all September 11 detainees without regard to whether they posed a danger or a flight risk; how detainees were arbitrarily forced into the extremely restrictive solitary confinement; how detention routinely extended far beyond the time necessary for their deportation solely for criminal investigative purposes; and how many of the detainees - especially those in the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn -- were mistreated.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">	CCR Senior staff attorney, Nancy Chang, stated: &quot;The Inspector General's report depicts a Department of Justice that turned its back on the Constitution by locking up hundreds of innocent men of the same ethnicity and religion as the September 11 suicide bombers for the weeks and months it took the FBI to clear them of terrorism.  Through the Turkmen suit, CCR hopes to hold the Justice Department accountable for this unacceptable conduct and to ensure against future resort to the disgraceful practice of preventive detention.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Added CCR Deputy Legal Director Barbara Olshansky, &quot;The OIG Report confirms what the Turkmen plaintiffs told CCR lawyers and what we and they guessed:  that the policies and practices of FBI and INS officials expressly targeted people based on their race, ethnicity, national origin and religion, deliberately denied these individuals access to the courts to challenge their detention and mistreatment, and willfully prevented them from going home while they waited to be &quot;proven innocent&quot; in the eyes of the federal government.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CCR brought the civil rights class action suit on behalf of non-citizens without terrorist ties who were arrested shortly after the September 11 attacks and held for extended periods of time at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan and/or the Passaic County Jail in New Jersey on minor immigration violations.  The suit seeks a court order declaring the Justice Department's mistreatment of these September 11 detainees to be unconstitutional, and requiring the government to conform its policies to the Constitution's requirements.  The suit also seeks money damages on behalf of the plaintiffs. CCR attorneys Rachel Meeropol, Shane Kadidal, Jennifer Green and board Vice-President and Georgetown Law School Professor David Cole are also on the case.</font></p>
