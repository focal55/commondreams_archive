                - March 12 - From its tent encampment across the road from the 

                Canal Hotel UN Compound - beginning at 6:30AM, Wednesday, March 

                12 - the Iraq Peace Team (IPT), with deep regret, bid farewell 

                to departing United Nations staff. While weapons inspectors and 

                UN senior staff remain in Baghdad, the vast majority of international 

                staff were involuntarily evacuated by the UN from Iraq on Wednesday.

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Team posted 

                signs saying, "Farewell UN. Please advise: Who will protect Iraq's 

                children?" As UN vehicles departed, the Team lined the road bearing 

                enlarged photos of Iraqi children and civilians. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite the 

                UN personnel's involuntary departure, twenty IPT members asserted 

                their intent to remain in Iraq for the duration of hostilities. 

                The UN departure signals the imminent escalation of the military 

                attack on the Iraqi people. It is such an attach that Voices in 

                the Wilderness, IPT's Chicago-based parent organization, has been 

                working since 1996 to avert. </font>

                in the Wilderness co-founder, Kathy Kelly, declared, "We are shocked 

                by the involuntary evacuation of UN workers here in Iraq. It is 

                deeply disturbing to everyone everywhere who honors the UN Charter 

                - a Charter which pledges to eliminate the scourge of war." </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Kelly explained, 

                "The Iraqi people have been dependent on the international community 

                during these long years of sanctions, siege and bombing. It was 

                a forced dependency, but nevertheless they are now more abandoned 

                than ever. We dread the coming carnage." </font>

                and long-time UNICEF volunteer, Cynthia Banas, of Vernon, New 

                York said, "We believe that we are our brothers' and sisters' 

                keepers, and we choose to stay. Many of us come from faith-based 

                backgrounds that urge works of mercy rather than works of war."
