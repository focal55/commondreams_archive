                - April 3 - U.S. Greens have adopted a proposal to urge the United 

                Nations to invoke Resolution 377 ('Uniting for Peace') in response 

                to the invasion of Iraq by the United States. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">'Uniting for 

                Peace' allows the U.N. General Assembly to circumvent the veto 

                of the Security Council and take action when a permanent member 

                of the Security Council, in this case the U.S., commits an unprovoked 

                act of military aggression. </font>

                currently pressing U.N. member nations to head off an emergency 

                General Assembly session on the war, with one U.S. official claiming 

                the session will "divide U.N. members." A communication from the 

                U.S. to U.N. representatives around the world, published April 

                1 by Greenpeace, calls any attempt by the General Assembly to 

                meet and discuss the invasion "unhelpful and directed against 

                the United States" and "harmful to the U.N." </font>

                the national Coordinating Committee of the Green Party of the

                in Europe and other nations and Greens and other peaceloving people 

                around the world in support of 'Uniting for Peace.' Excerpts from
