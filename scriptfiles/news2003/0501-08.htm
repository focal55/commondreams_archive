- May 1 - The Board of Directors of the 

Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law today announced the 

appointment of Tom Gerety as executive director. Mr. Gerety will 

complete a nine-year tenure as president of Amherst College at the 

end of June. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This is urgent work: When faced with external threats, the 

American republic has always had to struggle to maintain a 

democracy that is open and energetic, reflecting the diverse voices 

and interests of our nation," said Mr. Gerety. "The Brennan Center 

for Justice fights to uphold America's ideals of equality, liberty, 

and generosity to all. It's a great time to join in this good 

work." 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Brennan Center is a new type of public interest institution, 

incorporating elements of a public interest law firm, a think tank, 

and an advocacy organization. Founded in 1995, the Center brings 

together thinkers and advocates in pursuit of a vision of inclusive 

and effective democracy. Growing from a staff of two to a staff of 

40 in less than eight years, the Center engages in three programs: 

Criminal Justice, Democracy, and Poverty. Notable successes 

include: a 2001 Supreme Court decision striking down a law that 

barred legal aid lawyers from challenging welfare laws; and the 

Center's involvement in the enactment and legal defense of the 

McCain-Feingold law, the first comprehensive federal campaign 

finance reform in a generation. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Center's current initiatives include: 

-- Expanding access to good jobs for working families by 

supporting initiatives such as living wage laws. 

-- Removing voting bans to enable ex-offenders to participate in 

the democratic process. 

-- Ensuring that community voices are heard in policymaking 

affecting the criminal justice system. 

-- Supporting campaign finance reform to control the influence 

of money on politics. 

-- Strengthening civil legal aid to increase access to justice 

for low-income individuals and families. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Said William J. Brennan, III, chair of the Brennan Center Board, 

"With his experience as a legal scholar, a social justice advocate, 

and president of a premier liberal arts college, Tom Gerety 

possesses all the talents needed to advance the Center's mission. 

The entire Brennan Center community - the Brennan family, my 

father's former clerks, the NYU faculty, and our Board - could not 

be more pleased with his appointment." 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As Amherst president, Mr. Gerety improved the diversity of the 

college's student body so that now approximately 35 percent of the 

first-year class is composed of students of color. In the past 

year, he organized private colleges in a "friend of the court" 

brief supporting the affirmative action policies of the University 

of Michigan. Mr. Gerety strengthened Amherst's financial 

resources, nearly tripling the endowment to almost a billion 

dollars. He continued to teach as a professor of philosophy 

throughout his presidency, including a first-year seminar called 

"Inner City America" in which he asked students to work at social 

service agencies. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Said Mr. Gerety, "We're in this fight with lots of others. We 

need strong allies and friends. So it's essential to work closely 

with others who care about these issues - about civil rights, about 

the poor and their advocates, about the promise of democracy. I 

look forward to working with the Center's great staff, with the 

Board, and with the NYU faculty at the Law School and throughout 

the University. Particularly important colleagues are the many 

experienced and devoted people around the country - in advocacy 

groups, service agencies, and foundations - who stand shoulder to 

shoulder with us in all that we do." 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mr. Gerety has received a university-wide academic appointment; 

he will be the Brennan Center for Justice Professor at NYU. Said 

Richard L. Revesz, Dean of NYU Law School, "Tom Gerety will be a 

spectacular leader for the Brennan Center. He will be able to 

capture the synergies available to the Center from its relationship 

with NYU School of Law, bringing together the best academics, 

policy analysts, and litigators to address our nation's pressing 

social problems." 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From 1989 to 1994, Mr. Gerety was president of Trinity College, 

a liberal arts college located in Hartford, Connecticut. While 

there, he turned the college decisively towards its inner city 

environment and developed the strategic plans for magnet schools 

and other city/suburban collaborations that Trinity maintains 

today. From 1986 to 1989, Mr. Gerety was Dean of the College of 

Law at the University of Cincinnati. Earlier, he was a law 

professor at the University of Pittsburgh, and a visiting professor 

of constitutional law and jurisprudence at Stanford Law School. 

Mr. Gerety has a J.D. from Yale Law School. He also holds 

doctorate and masters degrees in philosophy from Yale. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since 1989, Mr. Gerety has served on the Board of the 

International Rescue Committee, and last year he joined the Board 

of Save the Children. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mr. Gerety succeeds E. Joshua Rosenkranz, who was one of the 

Brennan Center's founders in 1995 and is responsible for building 

the Center to its present form. The Center's mission is to develop 

and implement an innovative, nonpartisan agenda of scholarship, 

public education, and legal action that promotes equality and human 

dignity, while safeguarding fundamental freedoms. For more
