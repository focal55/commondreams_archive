<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">OAKLAND, 

                CA - March 31 - While labor activists nationwide celebrate the 

                76th birthday of United Farm Workers founder Cesar Chavez, many 

                are concerned that a USDA sponsored Trade Ministerial and Agriculture 

                Expo in Sacramento undermines the work to which Chavez dedicated 

                his life.</font> 

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Ministerial 

                  and Expo, to be held June 23-25, brings together ministers from 

                  180 nations to showcase controversial agricultural technologies 

                  - including genetic engineering, irradiation and pesticides 

                  - and to discuss and promote trade liberalization policies. 

                  Environmental, labor, farming and social justice organizations 

                  share a critique of this agenda, which favors large agribusiness 

                  and multinational corporations at the expense of farm workers 

                  and small scale farmers.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We 

                  have come to a point where farm workers have achieved tremendous 

                  victories - collective bargaining, higher wages - but there 

                  is still so much more to be done,&quot; said Tracy Lerman, senior 

                  organizer with Public Citizen's Oakland, Calif. office. &quot;By 

                  sponsoring this trade show, the USDA is turning its back on 

                  farm workers and on the achievements that Cesar Chavez spent 

                  three decades fighting for.&quot;</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Agricultural 

                  trade liberalization is chief among the concerns surrounding 

                  this ministerial. These policies have allowed large corporate 

                  farming interests to move their operations overseas, where labor 

                  and environmental protections are minimal and wages are lower. 

                  While domestic jobs are lost, farmers overseas are forced to 

                  give up their land and work on large corporate farms that focus 

                  on export cash crops rather than food crops. Moreover, as developing 

                  countries are coerced to eliminate these protections in order 

                  to attract foreign investors, farm workers compete for decreasing 

                  wages and increasingly dangerous jobs.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Many 

                  of these agricultural technologies that corporate agribusiness 

                  and the USDA claim 'will feed the world,' are killing the farm 

                  workers that grow our food. What's more, the free trade polices 

                  advanced by the USDA, which essentially hand over control of 

                  the food system to multinational corporations, are contingent 

                  on the full-scale acceptance of these technologies,&quot; said 

                  Ellen Hickey, program coordinator with Pesticide Action Network. 

                  &quot;Farm workers will be among the hardest hit if the goals 

                  of this Ministerial are achieved.&quot;</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Farm workers 

                  have long been threatened by exposure to pesticides, one of 

                  the many technologies championed by the USDA and corporate farming 

                  interests. Pesticide-related illnesses, including cancer and 

                  birth defects, threaten farm workers more than any other sector 

                  of society, and were the reason for a 36-day fast endured by 

                  Chavez in 1988. NGOs fear that continued trade liberalization 

                  will allow corporate farms to move operations to countries where 

                  the most toxic pesticides, like DDT, are still being used.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The selection 

                  of Sacramento as the location of this ministerial highlights 

                  the frustration many feel towards the USDA for putting corporate 

                  farm interests before farm workers and small-scale farmers. 

                  Sacramento was the destination of the 343 mile march, beginning 

                  in Fresno that UFW members participated in a year after Chavez's 

                  death, on his 67th birthday. </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Organization, 

                  farmers, and concerned citizens plan to ensure that this ministerial 

                  will provide an opportunity educate the public about these issues, 

                  and to organize for policies that promote fair trade, ecologically 

                  friendly agriculture, strong labor and environmental regulations, 

                  and food security for all. </font></p>
