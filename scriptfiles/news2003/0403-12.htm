                YORK - April 3 - Although the invasion of Iraq is being fought 

                under the name &quot;Operation Iraqi Freedom,&quot; it has constricted 

                the range of expression sanctioned by media outlets within the 

                U.S. Starting before the war began, several national and local 

                media figures have had their work jeopardized, either explicitly 

                or implicitly because of the critical views they expressed on 

                the war.</font> 

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* MSNBC 

                  canceled Phil Donahue's talkshow after an internal memo (leaked 

                  to the All Your TV website, 2/25/03) argued that he would be 

                  a &quot;difficult public face for NBC in a time of war.... He 

                  seems to delight in presenting guests who are anti-war, anti-Bush 

                  and skeptical of the administration's motives.&quot; The report 

                  warned that the Donahue show could be &quot;a home for the liberal 

                  anti-war agenda at the same time that our competitors are waving 

                  the flag at every opportunity.&quot;</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An email 

                  from a network executive, also <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views03/0226-11.htm">leaked 

                  to All Your TV</a> (3/5/03), suggested that it would be &quot;unlikely&quot; 

                  that Donahue could be used by MSNBC to &quot;reinvent itself&quot; 

                  and &quot;cross-pollinate our programming&quot; with the &quot;anticipated 

                  larger audience who will tune in during a time of war&quot; 

                  by linking pundits to war coverage, &quot;particularly given 

                  his public stance on the advisability of the war effort.&quot;</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Brent 

                  Flynn, a reporter for the Lewisville (Texas) Leader, was told 

                  he could no longer write a column for the paper in which he 

                  had expressed anti-war views. &quot;I was told that because 

                  I had attended an anti-war rally, I had violated the newspaper's 

                  ethics policy that prohibits members of the editorial staff 

                  from participating in any political activity other than voting,&quot; 

                  Flynn wrote in a note on his personal website. &quot;I am convinced 

                  that if my column was supportive of the war and it was a pro-war 

                  rally that I attended, they would not have dared to cancel my 

                  column.... The fact that the column was cancelled just days 

                  before the start of the U.S. invasion of Iraq raises serious 

                  questions about the motives for the cancellation.&quot; Although 

                  Flynn was ostensibly sanctioned for compromising the paper's 

                  &quot;objectivity,&quot; he continues to serve as a news reporter 

                  for the paper, while losing the part of his job where he was 

                  expected to express opinions.</font></p>

                  a reporter and columnist for Michigan's Huron Daily Tribune, 

                  quit the paper after allegedly being told that an anti-war column 

                  he had written would not run because it might upset readers 

                  (WJRT-TV, 3/28/03).</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* The website 

                  <a href="http://www.YellowTimes.org" target="_new">YellowTimes.org</a>, 

                  which featured original anti-war reporting and commentary, was 

                  shut down by its Web hosting company on March 24, after it posted 

                  images of U.S. POWs and Iraqi civilian victims of the war. Orlando-based 

                  Vortech Hosting told Yellow Times in an e-mail, &quot;Your account 

                  has been suspended because [of] inappropriate graphic material.&quot; 

                  Later, the company clarified: &quot;As 'NO' TV station in the 

                  U.S. is allowing any dead U.S. soldiers or POWs to be displayed 

                  and we will not either.&quot; As of April 3, the site was still 

                  down.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* The Qatar-based 

                  Al-Jazeera news network's attempts to set up an English-language 

                  website were foiled by unidentified U.S.-based hackers who <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/0401-05.htm">launched 

                  a denial-of-service attac</a>k. Al-Jazeera is expected to try 

                  to relaunch its site in mid-April. The station's reporters also 

                  had their press credentials revoked by the New York Stock Exchange, 

                  and were unable to obtain alternative credentials at the NASDAQ 

                  exchange: &quot;In light of Al-Jazeera's recent conduct during 

                  the war, in which they have broadcast footage of US POWs in 

                  alleged violation of the Geneva Convention, they are not welcome 

                  to broadcast from our facility at this time,&quot; a NASDAQ 

                  spokesperson told the Los Angeles Times (3/26/03).</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Veteran 

                  war correspondent Peter Arnett was <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views03/0401-10.htm">fired 

                  by NBC</a> as a result of an interview that he gave to Iraqi 

                  TV in which he said that war planners had &quot;misjudged the 

                  determination of the Iraqi forces&quot; and that there was &quot;a 

                  growing challenge to President Bush about the conduct of the 

                  war.&quot; After initially defending Arnett, NBC released a 

                  statement saying that &quot;it was wrong for Mr. Arnett to grant 

                  an interview to state-controlled Iraqi TV-- especially at a 

                  time of war-- and it was wrong for him to discuss his personal 

                  observations and opinions in that interview.&quot;</font></p>
