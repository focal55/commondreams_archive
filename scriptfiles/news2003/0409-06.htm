                April 9 - Amnesty International is deeply concerned about the 

                mounting toll of civilian casualties in Iraq and the reported 

                use of cluster bombs by US forces in heavily populated areas. 

                Despite repeated assurances from US and UK authorities that they 

                would do everything possible to protect the Iraqi people, since 

                20 March hundreds of civilians have reportedly been killed. Some 

                have been victims of cluster bombs; some have died in attacks 

                in disputed circumstances. The attacks in the vicinity of civilian 

                targets continue and are likely to escalate as fighting moves 

                into Baghdad. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We urge all 

                the warring parties to make the safety of the Iraqi civilians 

                a top priority," Amnesty International said. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The attack 

                at al-Hilla's hospital on 1 April was an example of indiscriminate 

                killing of civilians and a grave violation of international humanitarian 

                law," Amnesty International emphasized. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The bodies 

                of the men, women and children -- both dead and alive -- brought 

                to the hospital were punctured with shards of shrapnel from cluster 

                bombs. Two lorry-loads of dead civilians, including women in flowered 

                dresses, were seen outside the hospital. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Injured survivors 

                reported how the explosives fell "like grapes" from the sky, and 

                how bomblets bounced through the windows and doors of their homes 

                before exploding. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Both Amnesty 

                International and Landmine Action, a UK-based non-governmental 

                organization, have confirmed that pictures from al-Hilla show 

                unexploded BLU97 -- a cluster submunition, and that this is the 

                same air-dropped weapon that caused severe humanitarian problems 

                in Afghanistan and Kosovo in the past. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The devastating 

                consequences of using cluster bombs in civilian areas are utterly 

                predictable. If, as accounts suggest, US forces dropped cluster 

                bombs in residential areas of al-Hilla, even if they were directed 

                at military targets, this would be a grave breach of international 

                humanitarian law," Amnesty International said. "An independent 

                and thorough investigation must be held and those found responsible 

                for any violations of the laws of war should be brought to justice. 

                The US and UK authorities should order an immediate halt to the 

                further use of cluster bombs. " </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Iraqi civilians 

                have also been placed at greater risk of being killed or injured 

                by US and UK forces as a result of tactics used by the Iraqi military 

                that violate international humanitarian law, such as perfidious 

                attacks. Amnesty International is also concerned about reports 

                that Iraq has been locating military forces and weaponry in close 

                proximity to civilians in order to shield them from attack. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"International 

                humanitarian law requires both defenders and attackers to take 

                measures necessary to protect civilians," the organization said. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"All parties 

                to the conflict in Iraq have a responsibility to ensure that the 

                humanitarian needs of the civilian population are fully met. We 

                call on all parties to the conflict to facilitate access and the 

                operations of humanitarian organizations, without delay," Amnesty 

                International continued. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Amnesty International 

                calls for: - an immediate moratorium on the use of cluster bombs 

                by US/UK forces and on other inherently indiscriminate weapons; 

                - an immediate end to unlawful tactics by Iraqi forces that endanger 

                civilians; - prompt and impartial investigations into civilian 

                deaths, and the use of the International Humanitarian Fact-Finding 

                Commission to investigate incidents of alleged serious violations 

                of international humanitarian law.
