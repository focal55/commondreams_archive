- June 13 -  Ritu Sharma, Co-Founder and Executive Director, of Women's Edge, will be visiting Afghanistan June 16-23. Sharma's mission will be to observe and monitor the on-the-ground situation of the Afghan women with the U.S. aid money they are receiving.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It critical that U.S. government funding for Afghan women be used to provide a range of services such as literacy programs, maternal health services, counseling and job skills training,&quot; said Sharma. &quot;One major reason we went to war with Afghanistan was because of the Taliban's treatment of Afghan women. Since the war ended, not much as improved for the women since the rebuilding began - this needs to change.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sharma's efforts have resulted in several substantial advancements for Afghanistan and its women and girls, including:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- In 2002, Women's Edge collaborated with the developers of the Afghanistan Freedom Support Act to ensure that several sections pertaining to women's issues were included in the bill. The new Act, which President Bush signed on December 2002, calls for multi-year humanitarian, reconstruction, enterprise development and peacekeeping funding for the people of Afghanistan.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- In 2002/2003, Women's Edge successfully advocated for $7.5 million for Afghan Ministry of Women's Affairs (MOWA).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- In 2003, Women's Edge worked with several key Hill offices to introduce the Access for Afghan Women Act. It requires that a percentage of U.S. humanitarian and development funds go directly to local organizations led by women.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sharma will meet and partner with several local Afghan non-governmental organizations (NGO) so that Women's Edge can better monitor the on-ground-situation and U.S. programs to benefit women.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sima Wali, CEO of Refugee Women in Development (RefWID) Inc, will accompany Sharma. Wali, a native of Afghanistan, helped create the first MOWA, whose mission is to restore the rights of Afghan women and girls by improving their legal, economic, political and social status throughout the country.</font></p>
