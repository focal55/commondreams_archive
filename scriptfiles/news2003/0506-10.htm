- May 6 - EPA Administrator 

Christie Whitman today announced that 100,000 new homes have 

earned the EPA ENERGY STAR designation, saving Americans more 

than $26 million in energy costs annually. Whitman made her 

announcement at a meeting of the National Association of Home 

Builders. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"As we look back over the past years of our ENERGY STAR 

partnership, the record is truly impressive," said Administrator 

Whitman. "At the start of our partnership, just 55 homes in the 

United States qualified for the Energy Star designation. Today, 

less than a decade later, I'm pleased to announce that there are 

now 100,000 Energy Star homes in America. That's more houses 

than there are in Atlanta, Georgia -- population 416,000. That's 

quite an accomplishment." 

</font>

<p></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The home building industry is a powerful engine for economic 

growth, accounting for more than four million jobs and 

representing 13 percent of America's Gross National Product. 

America's builders, as business leaders, are on the forefront of 

energy efficiency, combining good business practices with 

environmental stewardship under ENERGY STAR. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ENERGY STAR qualified homes incorporate savings in design and 

construction and use 30 percent less energy for heating, cooling 

and water heating than a standard home. Homeowners can expect to 

save about $200 -$400 annually on their utility bills. In order 

for a home to earn the ENERGY STAR designation, it must be 

certified to ensure that the home meets EPA's strict guidelines 

for energy efficiency. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ENERGY STAR homes also help to ensure increased comfort for 

the families who live in them. The tight construction helps keep 

unwanted drafts, dust, pollen, and moisture from entering the 

home. Added insulation and efficient heating and cooling 

equipment also helps keep these ENERGY STAR homes warmer in 

winter and cooler in summer. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Last year alone Americans, with the help of ENERGY STAR, saved 

more than $7 billion on their energy bills, saved enough energy 

to power 15 million homes, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions 

equivalent to taking 14 million cars off the road. 

</font>
