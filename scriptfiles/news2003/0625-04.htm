- June 25 - California Sen. Dianne Feinstein has confirmed that she will question Karen Tandy, nominated to be the administrator of the federal Drug Enforcement Administration, about the appropriateness of the DEA's raids on medical marijuana patients and caregivers in California. Until now, neither Sen. Feinstein nor California's other senator, Barbara Boxer, has publicly addressed the DEA's actions against seriously ill Californians.</font>

<p>   Tandy's nomination will be heard by the Senate Judiciary Committee this afternoon. Due to a conflicting hearing on intelligence matters, Feinstein does not expect to attend the hearing in person, but will submit the questions to Tandy in writing. Feinstein will also ask Tandy whether she will support research that could lead to the reclassification of marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act, ending the federal ban on medical use.</p>

<p>   Suzanne Pfeil, a disabled patient with post-polio syndrome who was threatened at gunpoint by DEA agents last September during the agency's raid on the Wo/Men's Alliance for Medical Marijuana in Santa Cruz, expressed gratitude for Feinstein's commitment. &quot;I am relieved that one of my U.S. senators is willing to ask whether I should have to live in fear of my own government,&quot; Pfeil said.</p>

<p>   Pfeil, along with MPP Director of Government Relations Steve Fox, will speak at a 1 p.m. press conference in front of the Dirksen Senate Office Building (on the Constitution Avenue side, near the corner of Constitution and First St. NE). Pfeil and Fox will attend Tandy's hearing and will be available to the media afterward.</p>

<p>   &quot;The DEA's cruel and pointless attacks on the sick have sparked outrage throughout California and across the nation,&quot; Fox said. &quot;We are grateful that Senator Feinstein seems prepared to question Karen Tandy about whether she will continue such actions. People fighting disabling and often terminal illnesses should not have to live in terror of their own government.&quot;</p>

<p>   With 12,000 members nationwide, the Marijuana Policy Project is the largest marijuana policy reform organization in the United States. MPP works to minimize the harm associated with marijuana -- both the consumption of marijuana and the laws that are intended to prohibit such use. MPP believes that the greatest harm associated with marijuana is imprisonment. To this end, MPP focuses on removing criminal penalties for marijuana use, with a particular emphasis on making marijuana medically available to seriously ill people who have the approval of their doctors.</p>
