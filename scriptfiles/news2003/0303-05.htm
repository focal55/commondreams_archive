                - March 3 - News Advisory: </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHAT: On Tuesday, 

                March 4, the Southern California office of the Council on American-Islamic 

                Relations (CAIR-LA), along with other civil rights and religious 

                organizations, will hold a noon news conference in Anaheim to 

                call for an FBI investigation of recent bias-related attacks on 

                Muslims in California and New Jersey. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Washington-based 

                Islamic civil rights and advocacy group reports that a Muslim 

                teenager was severely beaten February 22 in Yorba Linda, Calif., 

                by a group of some 20 attackers using baseball bats and golf clubs. 

                The assailants, at least two of whom were reported to be white 

                supremacists, allegedly shouted racial slurs such as "F--k the 

                Arabs," "you Arab pieces of s--t," and "camel jockeys." The 18-year-old 

                victim sustained multiple head injuries and stab wounds. He underwent 

                reconstructive surgery on March 1 during which metal plates were 

                used to repair facial bone fractures. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Irvington, 

                N.J., a Muslim father of six was assaulted Feb. 21 by two men 

                who accused him of being a terrorist. The Star-Ledger newspaper 

                reported that the attackers said, "You have to go back to your 

                country," as they knocked the victim to the ground, kicking and 

                injuring him in his head, abdomen and groin. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Santa Clara, 

                Calif., a Muslim woman wearing Islamic attire was assaulted Feb. 

                28 in the laundry room of her apartment building. She was punched 

                in the face and suffered a split lip and bruises. Every item in 

                the woman's laundry was later found to be torn and stabbed by 

                a sharp object. The attack is being investigated as a possible 

                bias-related incident. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We believe 

                this recent increase in attacks on American Muslims is a direct 

                result of the barrage of pro-war and anti-Islam rhetoric coming 

                from right-wing and evangelical leaders," said CAIR-LA Executive 

                Director Hussam Ayloush. "The FBI needs to take these incidents 

                seriously to help provide a sense of security for ordinary American 

                Muslims," said Ayloush. He added that government officials, elected 

                representatives and political commentators should also cool down 

                their rhetoric and acknowledge that harsh words can lead to violent 

                actions. </font>
