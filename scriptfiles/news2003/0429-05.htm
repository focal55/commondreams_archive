<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- April 29 - The Travis County Commissioners Court Tuesday

became the first major elected body in the state of Texas to call

for a moratorium on executions. Three of the five commissioners

voted for a moratorium, with one commissioner abstaining and one

voting against. Travis County includes most of Austin, the Texas capital.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

The vote comes as unprecedented media scrutiny has focused on Texas'

death penalty system, which has accounted for 302 of the 848 executions

conducted in the United States in the past quarter century. Eleven

daily newspapers in Texas have called for a moratorium on executions,

including the conservative Dallas Morning News and every major

metropolitan newspaper in the state. Even smaller newspapers in 

Victoria, Bryan-College Station, Abilene, Corpus Christi and

Wichita Falls have joined the call.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Texas' death penalty system is broken in almost every way

imaginable,&quot; said Steven W. Hawkins, executive director of the

National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty. &quot;Stories abound

about sleeping lawyers, ineffective lawyers, racial bias, cases of

innocence, faulty and fraudulent lab technicians and forensic

scientists and people on death row with severe mental retardation

and mental illness. Today's vote was the right thing to do.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

Hawkins commended Texas moratorium proponents, including the

Texas Moratorium Network and Stand Down Texas, for their leadership

in achieving passage of the resolution. Thus far, more than 80 

elected bodies across the United States have passed moratorium

resolutions, ranging from city councils in large cities such as

New York City, Los Angeles and Atlanta, to smaller cities such as

Macon, Georgia and Nashville, Tennessee. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

In Texas, legislation calling for a moratorium is pending in the

Texas Legislature. During the last session of the Texas Legislature,

moratorium resolutions were passed by both House and Senate 

committees. To learn more about pending legislation and to lobby
