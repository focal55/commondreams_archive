                HANOVER, NJ - April 22 - Kraft&#146;s continued use of genetically 

                engineered ingredients was a major topic of concern today among 

                investors inside Kraft&#146;s annual shareholders meeting. </font> 

                <p> </p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Kraft shareholders, 

                  including actor Chevy Chase and his wife Jayni Chase, spoke 

                  out at the meeting raising concerns about the public health, 

                  environmental, and financial risks posed by genetically engineered 

                  ingredients. </font></p>

                <p> </p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Chevy Chase 

                  raised the issue of biopharm crops&#151;food crops genetically 

                  engineered to produce prescription drugs and industrial chemicals&#151;and 

                  the risks they pose if they were to contaminate Kraft products. 

                  In November, disaster was narrowly averted when the USDA found 

                  500,000 bushels of soybeans headed for the food supply to be 

                  contaminated with biopharm corn. </font></p>

                <p> </p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mr. Chase 

                  stated, &#147;I don&#146;t want my family to accidentally ingest 

                  a pig vaccine when they eat an Oreo, or inadvertently eat a 

                  heart medicine when they pour a bowl of Alpha-Bits.&#148; He 

                  also asked Kraft executives, &#147;Given the serious risks posed 

                  by biopharm crops and other genetically engineered crops, is 

                  Kraft seriously considering removing genetically engineered 

                  ingredients from its foods? And, if not, would you please consider 

                  doing so?&#148;</font></p>

                <p> </p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Concerns 

                  about the financial risks genetically engineered foods pose 

                  to investors were also raised. Wendy Wendlandt, a representative 

                  of Green Century Capital Management, asked during the meeting 

                  if there are financial benefits to the company and shareholders 

                  associated with the continued use of genetically engineered 

                  ingredients. Ms. Wendlandt also stated, &#147;continued use 

                  of genetically engineered foods exposes investors to unnecessary 

                  financial risk. Another incident like the StarLink contamination 

                  could have devastating impacts on Kraft&#146;s bottom line and 

                  share value.&#148; </font></p>

                <p> </p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The financial 

                  risks of genetically engineered foods became evident with contamination 

                  of the food supply by StarLink in 2000, which is estimated to 

                  have cost the food industry billions of dollars. StarLink is 

                  a variety of genetically engineered corn that was not approved 

                  for human consumption because of concerns that it might trigger 

                  allergic reactions. StarLink was first discovered in Kraft&#146;s 

                  Taco Bell brand taco shells. </font></p>

                <p> </p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Kraft was 

                  also called to task on addressing the issue of genetically engineered 

                  foods with Altria&#146;s new Social Responsibility program. 

                  &#147;Many students at top universities are saying that they 

                  will not work for Kraft because of its use of genetically engineered 

                  ingredients,&#148; stated Rebecca O&#146;Malley, program director 

                  for ecopledge.com. &#147;If Kraft and Altria want to be seen 

                  as socially responsible companies, the issue of genetically 

                  engineered foods must be addressed.&#148; </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Last week, 

                  a report was released entitled, &#147;Risky Business: Financial 

                  Risks that Genetically Engineered Foods Pose to Kraft Foods, 

                  Inc. and Shareholders.&#148; The report reveals that Kraft&#146;s 

                  use of genetically engineered ingredients poses risk of product 

                  recalls and liability lawsuits, loss of competitive advantage, 

                  consumer rejection of Kraft&#146;s products, and damage to reputation 

                  resulting from increased controversy surrounding these foods. 

                  </font></p>

                <p> </p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report 

                  also makes the case that genetically engineered foods do not 

                  offer financial benefits to Kraft or marketable benefits to 

                  consumers. Genetically engineered crops may even cost more to 

                  produce than non-genetically engineered counterparts. </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Continued 

                  use of genetically engineered ingredients is a no-win situation 

                  for Kraft and its shareholders,&#148; stated Kate Madigan, advocate 

                  for the state Public Interest Research Groups and author of 

                  the report. &#147;Many food companies have already removed these 

                  ingredients from their products to protect consumers and investors. 

                  Kraft should do the same.&#148;</font></p>
