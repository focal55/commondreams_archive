- October 20 - Despite growing opposition by the American public, lawmakers are repeating the mistake they made before the Iraq war began: giving President Bush a green light for a muddled and unwinnable policy. Victories in Congress and the U.N. will be hollow ones without a fundamental change of course.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Contributions from countries meeting this week at the October 23-24 International Donors Conference in Madrid will lag far behind Iraq&#146;s needs.  While making some concessions for international support, the U.S. continues to dominate the military, economic and political reconstruction of Iraq, alienating many Iraqis and other nations.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Facing deep budget cuts, deficits and unmet needs at home, Americans are angry about reported war profiteering by U.S. corporations in Iraq. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chair Richard Lugar (R-IN) himself predicts that U.S. forces might be in Iraq for eight years or more. Everyday, more soldiers and civilians are dying. As they did during the long-drawn out Vietnam War, a growing number of U.S. soldiers in Iraq are speaking out in the face of Washington's intelligence failures and rosy PR:</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;In the beginning I was into this; we all were,&#148; Specialist Juan Castillo told the New York Times while home on furlough. No longer. &#147;We haven't found anything, no weapons of mass destruction, no Saddam, no nothing. And the people there hate us... We&#146;re conquerors to them. It wasn't supposed to be like that.&#148;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Major countries in the United Nations Security Council &#151; Russia, Germany, France &#151; say they won't commit more money or troops to Iraq because the new U.N. resolution does not spell out a strong enough role for the United Nations nor a quick enough pace in transferring responsibilities to the Iraqi people. These are serious reservations.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Peter Lems, AFSC National Representative for Iraq, says, &#147;The central question remains: will Iraq be defined by military occupation and foreign control, or the emergence of a civil society guided by the Iraqi people? The United Nations &#151; not the United States &#151; should oversee the transition to Iraqi self-governance or the seeds of discontent will continue to be sown.&#148;</font></p>
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
The AFSC is calling for:</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot;        fairness, openness and accountability in budgeting and contracts and an end to war profiteering by U.S. corporations</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot;        a realistic plan to bring U.S. troops home and stop the mounting casualties </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot;        a plan that puts reconstruction and the transition to Iraqi self-governance under clear U.N. oversight.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot;        repeal of the tax cuts for the wealthiest 1 percent of U.S. taxpayers to help pay for costs in Iraq and fund education, health care, public safety and other essential services at home.</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The American Friends Service Committee, an international peace and social justice organization and co-recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize for humanitarian service during World Wars I and II, is backed by more than 85 years of worldwide experience rebuilding communities ravaged by war or natural disaster &#150; including Iraq.
