- November 12 - Granite Staters for Medical Marijuana
(GSMM) has changed U.S. Rep. Dick Gephardt's (D-MO) grade in its presidential candidate voter guide from a &quot;B-&quot; to a &quot;?&quot; after his campaign reneged on a commitment to provide a letter clarifying his position on medical marijuana -- the latest in a series of twists and turns that has concerned medical marijuana patients and supporters.
    </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In 1998, Gephardt voted for a House resolution condemning state medical marijuana laws. On July 20, 2003, he told GSMM member Linda Macia that he supports &quot;states' rights&quot; on medical marijuana -- an apparent shift in position. But three days later he missed a House vote on an amendment to the Commerce-Justice-State appropriations bill that would have put that stand into effect by barring the Department of Justice, including the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), from spending any money to raid or arrest medical marijuana patients in the states with medical marijuana laws.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> On October 1, Gephardt's New Hampshire press secretary, Kathy Roeder, told GSMM Campaign Coordinator Aaron Houston that Gephardt's congressional office would send a letter detailing Gephardt's support for the amendment. She reiterated the promise in an October 16 e-mail to Houston with the subject line, &quot;letter from Gephardt.&quot; She wrote that Sean Kennedy, Gephardt's congressional office legislative director and associate counsel, is &quot;a little behind but hasn't forgotten. He'll be getting us something next week he thinks.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> This week, Roeder suddenly backtracked, claiming that no letter was planned and saying, &quot;You can say we have a verbal agreement&quot; that Rep. Gephardt would have voted for the amendment.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> &quot;If the campaign makes a verbal agreement, then why can't they commit Gephardt's support for the amendment to paper?&quot; asked GSMM's Houston. &quot;If this is really his position, why is he afraid to put it in writing? Does he want to be able to deny it and go back to his old position if that becomes politically convenient? This about-face makes us wonder if we can trust anything he has said. Gephardt has made statements about supporting `states' rights' on the medical marijuana issue, but he has avoided specifics. Seriously ill people who use medical marijuana need to if know they will face attacks by rifle- wielding DEA agents under a Gephardt administration, and they need a president who stands by his commitments.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Based in Manchester, New Hampshire, Granite Staters for Medical Marijuana is a grassroots coalition of patients and activists. GSMM is organizing during the New Hampshire presidential primary campaign to raise awareness of the need for federal action to protect medical marijuana patients.
