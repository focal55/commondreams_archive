                - March 13 - Following is a revised version of a statement released 

                yesterday by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities on House 

                budget cuts: </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The budget 

                that House Budget Committee Chairman Jim Nussle unveiled today 

                contains deep and widespread cuts in basic domestic programs such 

                as Medicare, Medicaid, veterans programs, student loans, school 

                lunches, child care, food stamps, cash assistance for the elderly 

                and disabled poor, and many other programs. (See the appendix 

                for an explanation of the calculations used in the paper.) The 

                budget would require Congressional committees to cut "mandatory" 

                programs by $470 billion over the next ten years. If enacted, 

                these would represent the deepest cuts in such programs in U.S. 

                history. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The cuts are 

                reminiscent of those proposed by former House Speaker Newt Gingrich 

                in 1995 and included in the Contract with America budget legislation 

                that President Clinton vetoed that year. While Chairman Nussle 

                did not provide the specific amounts by which each program would 

                be cut, his budget assumes cuts of a given percentage in all mandatory 

                programs except Social Security and military retirement, and provides 

                a figure to each Congressional committee that specifies how much 

                that committee must cut mandatory programs in its jurisdiction. 

                For example, the House Ways and Means Committee, which has jurisdiction 

                over Medicare and various other, much smaller programs, would 

                have to cut programs within its jurisdiction by $262 billion over 

                ten years. The House Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees 

                Medicaid, would have to produce cuts of $111 billion, </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If the committees 

                cut all programs within their jurisdictions by the same percentage, 

                the cuts would include: -- $214 billion in Medicare reductions 

                over ten years (the budget also provides $400 billion for a Medicare 

                prescription drug benefit); -- $93 billion in Medicaid, the basic 

                health insurance program for low-income families, children, and 

                elderly and disabled people; -- $15 billion in veterans programs; 

                -- $12 billion in food stamps; and -- $7 billion in farm programs. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Deep cuts in 

                Medicare and Medicaid would be unavoidable, as the Ways and Means 

                Committee and the Energy and Commerce Committee would have no 

                other way to come up with the reductions they would be required 

                to make. The Nussle budget also would cut "discretionary" or non-entitlement 

                programs (other than defense spending) well below the President's 

                request. Non-defense discretionary programs would be cut $200 

                billion over ten years below the Congressional Budget Office baseline, 

                which equals the 2003 levels for these programs, adjusted for 

                inflation. These cuts could affect a wide variety of programs 

                from education programs to environmental protection programs to 

                programs for poor children. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While requiring 

                deep cuts in domestic programs, the budget makes room for most 

                of the President's large tax-cut package, including $1.4 trillion 

                in tax cuts. The tax cuts in the President's "growth" package 

                alone, all of which are included in the Nussle budget, would cost 

                $725 billion over ten years and would, according to the Tax Policy 

                Center, result in tax reductions averaging $90,000 each in 2003 

                for those Americans who have incomes of more than $1 million. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Class warfare 

                turns out to be alive," Center director Robert Greenstein commented. 

                "It is a centerpiece of the Nussle budget, with deep budget cuts 

                that could harshly affect the poor, the vulnerable, and many middle-class 

                Americans, alongside lavish tax cuts for the nation's richest 

                individuals. With this budget, we would be marching down the path 

                toward a new Gilded Age." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The Nussle 

                budget serves one very useful purpose." Greenstein added. "It 

                shows that these large tax cuts aren't free, and that at bottom, 

                the issue is one of national priorities. This ought to trigger 

                a national debate. Are tax cuts averaging $90,000 a year for millionaires 

                so high a priority that we should cut health care programs, increase 

                the ranks of the uninsured, reduce the cost or limit the availability 

                of student loans, and increase hardship among the disabled, poor 

                children, and others to free up room for massive tax cuts?" </font>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">APPENDIX: Calculating 

                selected budget cuts in the House Budget Committee's plan </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The budget 

                resolution presented by Chairman Nussle to the House Budget Committee 

                on March 12, 2003, assumes cuts in almost all entitlement programs. 

                The Chairman indicated that he assumed entitlement programs would 

                be reduced proportionally; he said this was the basis on which 

                the figures for each budget "function"" and each "reconciliation 

                target"" were derived. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At markup, 

                the Chairman distributed a table showing the "reconciliation targets" 

                for each committee -- i.e., the amounts by which each committee 

                is required to reduce entitlement programs, relative to current 

                law. He also distributed a table showing the resulting level of 

                "mandatory" spending in each budget function. These tables show 

                -- </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- A $15 billion, 

                ten-year reduction in veterans benefits (such as compensation, 

                pensions, and education benefits). The reconciliation table shows 

                that the Veterans Affairs Committee is required to cut programs 

                within its jurisdiction by $15.1 billion. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- A $214 billion, 

                ten-year reduction in Medicare payments. In this case, the text 

                of the budget resolution includes a special provision "reserving" 

                $400 billion over ten years to pay for a prescription drug benefit, 

                the amount requested by the President. The table of mandatory 

                spending shows a total, ten-year level of spending in Function 

                570 (Medicare) that is $186 billion above the amount CBO says 

                will be spent under current law. Because the net increase is $186 

                billion, the function total must consist of $400 billion in increases 

                for prescription drugs and $214 billion in decreases for Medicare 

                payments generally. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In addition, 

                the total, ten-year level for mandatory spending in Function 570 

                is $215 billion below the President's level, as estimated by CBO, 

                consistent with the conclusion that the budget plan calls for 

                Medicare cuts of that magnitude, outside of a prescription drug 

                benefit. Moreover, the reconciliation table shows the Ways and 

                Means Committee is reduce entitlements $262 billion over ten years. 

                Because Social Security is off budget for purposes of budget resolutions, 

                Medicare is by far the largest remaining program under the that 

                Committee's jurisdiction; it would be implausible for the Ways 

                and Means Committee to cut entitlements under its jurisdiction 

                by $262 billion unless a substantial portion of that amount was 

                derived from reductions in Medicare. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- A $12 billion, 

                ten-year reduction in Food Stamp benefits and a $7 billion reduction 

                in farm programs. The reconciliation table shows that the Agriculture 

                Committee is required to cut programs within its jurisdiction 

                by $19 billion. At the same time, the table of mandatory spending 

                shows a total, ten-year level of spending in Function 350 (the 

                budget function devoted to farm programs such as price supports 

                and crop insurance) that is $7 billion below the amount CBO says 

                will be spent under current law; payments to farmers must be cut 

                by $7 billion. The Agriculture Committee therefore must cut entitlement 

                programs outside of Function 350 by the remaining $12 billion. 

                But the Agriculture Committee has jurisdiction over only one major 

                program outside of function 350 -- Food Stamps, which is in Function 

                600 (Income Security). Thus, a $12 billion cut must be assumed 

                in Food Stamps. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- A $93 billion, 

                ten-year reduction in Medicaid. The table of mandatory spending 

                shows a total, ten-year level of spending in Function 550 (Health) 

                that is $101 billion below the amount CBO says will be spent under 

                current law; that is, payments for health entitlements other than 

                Medicare(1) must be cut $101 billion. The health function contains 

                a number of entitlements: Medicaid, the State Children's Health 

                Insurance Program, health insurance subsidies for federal employees, 

                etc. Medicaid constitutes about 93 percent of the entitlement 

                spending in this function, and so its proportionate share of the 

                $101 billion cut is $93 billion. </font>
