-  
December 10 - While much of the rest of the world embraces the principles of International Human Rights Day on its 55th anniversary, in stark defiance, Texas and Georgia plan to commemorate the day with two executions. </FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Executing a human being on International Human Rights Day is the ultimate and most profound irony,&quot; said Sue Gunawardena- Vaughn, Director of Amnesty International USA's Program to Abolish the Death Penalty. &quot;Instead of celebrating the leadership role the US played in helping to write the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, our country will commemorate this occasion with two state- sponsored executions-the ultimate violation of human rights.&quot; In sharp contrast to the 112 countries around the world that have eliminated the use of the death penalty in law or in practice, the US has executed nearly 900 individuals since capital punishment was reinstated in 1976. Over the last ten years, Oklahoma, North Carolina, and Virginia have all executed prisoners on December 10th. Furthermore, the US is one of only a handful of countries in the world that actively executes juvenile offenders. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;It is indeed tragic that while the US proudly proclaims its role as a champion of human rights overseas, it simultaneously denies basic human rights protections to its own citizens,&quot; said Gunawardena-Vaughn.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">If Texas and Georgia go through with the executions Kevin Lee Zimmerman and Eddie Crawford today, it will further cement the US's dubious distinction as leading the world in state-sanctioned execution. Of the 885 executions conducted in the US since 1977, Texas contributed 313 to that total, killing 24 inmates this year alone. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The increased recognition of fundamental, international human rights is driving the abolition of the death penalty worldwide, and more than half the world's nations have abandoned this outdated mode of punishment. Other nations, specifically Sweden and Trinidad and Tobago, have employed International Human Rights Day as an opportunity to speak out against the death penalty and to commute death sentences to life imprisonment. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Background on Executions</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Kevin Zimmerman and Eddie Crawford are scheduled to be killed on December 10 in Texas and Georgia respectively.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Kevin Zimmerman is facing execution for a crime that appears to have been less than capital murder, with evidence that his mental impairment rendered him unable to conform his conduct to the law. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Eddie Crawford is a Vietnam veteran who, according to his appeal lawyers, returned from that war as an alcoholic suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. He was convicted of the murder of his niece.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">For more information please see: USA: A lethal ideology: More state killing on Human Rights Day as 900th execution looms http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGAMR511492003</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Background on International Human Rights Day</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">International Human Rights Day is a celebration of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) by the United Nations General Assembly in 1948. Not only was the US one the of the original signers of this precedent setting, universal recognition of the rights of every human being on the planet, but the United States proudly stewarded UDHR through the writing process and more than 1,500 votes to finalize the language.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">When it was completed, the UDHR and the signing nations pledged a &quot;recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world.&quot; In addition to championing the idea that &quot;all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights,&quot; the UDHR promises freedom from discrimination based on race, sex, religion, national origin, political opinion or property. It also forbids slavery, torture, and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment. </FONT></P><P></P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p></font><!-- #EndEditable --></td></tr>
