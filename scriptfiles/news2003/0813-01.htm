- August 13 - The Interfaith Alliance has learned that Daniel Pipes, an outspoken critic of Islam, will be seated as a Director of the U.S. Institute of Peace through a Presidential Recess Appointment. After languishing in the Senate Health Education Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee for several months, the Senate Committee indefinitely postponed a vote on the nomination of Daniel Pipes six weeks ago.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Sidestepping Congress is a familiar tactic of the White House, especially when the White House does not get its way,&quot; said the Rev. Dr. C. Welton Gaddy, president of The Interfaith Alliance. &quot;Ultimately, by disregarding the counsel and labor of many Senators, Muslims and other community groups, the president is doing by appointment that which he has been unable to accomplish through the legislative process. The public's outrage over Dr. Pipes' nomination is an indication of the need to reassess his ability to serve, not an invitation to bypass the process.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On May 15, The Interfaith Alliance, at the invitation of the Senate HELP committee staff, brought together a diverse panel of religious leaders from the Jewish, Christian, Muslim and Sikh communities, to raise concerns and serious objections over the nomination of Dr. Pipes. While the panelists' individual messages were derived from their own unique faith perspectives, they agreed that Dr. Pipes' nomination sends a chilling message to all Muslim Americans.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Interfaith Alliance also submitted a letter to all 100 members of the Senate raising concerns over Dr. Daniel Pipes' nomination to the United States Institute of Peace:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;As has been made clear by his own remarks, Daniel Pipes - an outspoken nominee who clearly harbors inherent biases against Muslim Americans - is hardly an appropriate fit for the United States Institute of Peace...&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;As Americans who have witnessed hate crimes against Muslims and Sikhs in a post- September 11 world, and as people of faith and good will who fear backlash against these communities in a time of international unrest, we believe this nomination by the president is ill-advised and antithetical to the very purpose of the organization that Dr. Pipes has been nominated to serve.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Full text of the letter can be found <a href="http://www.interfaithalliance.org/Issues/Issues.cfm?ID=4843&c=12" target="_new">here</a>. </font></p>
