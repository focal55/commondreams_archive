                - March 18 - The League of Women Voters announced today that it 

                is opposed to oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. 

                "The League is especially concerned that the Budget Resolution 

                is being used in the attempt to open the Refuge to drilling," 

                stated Kay J. Maxwell, President of the League of Women Voters 

                of the United States. "This is bad policy and bad procedure," 

                she said. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The need for 

                energy security does not justify oil drilling in this pristine 

                environment. This irreplaceable natural resource must be protected 

                for the benefit of future generations. Experts agree that the 

                best way to increase energy security is through energy efficiency," 

                noted Maxwell. Modest fuel efficiency improvements for motor vehicles 

                alone would save approximately five times the amount of oil estimated 

                to be under the Arctic Refuge. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"U.S. Senators 

                should not cloak drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge 

                as energy policy. This is a significant policy issue that must 

                be openly debated, not slipped into an unrelated bill," concluded 

                Maxwell. </font>
