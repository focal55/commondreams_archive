<p>Greens:Computer Voting Systems Must Ensure Democracy and Accuracy, Not Manipulate Elections;<br>

- May 21 - Greens warn that computerized voting programs and files, 

if implemented without public scrutiny and auditability, may allow greater 

vote fraud, engineered miscounts, and disqualification of legitimate votes 

in elections across the country.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Instead, many Greens urge technology that promotes democratic access and



accuracy in voting and the maintenance of voter rolls, noting that 

touchscreens (Direct Recording Electronic voting) assist people with 

impaired vision and other disabilities and those not fluent in English.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Touchscreens, for instance, can eliminate voided ballots that now happen 

when citizens accidentally overvote in a race," testified Santa Monica Mayor 

pro tem Kevin McKeown during a California Secretary of State hearing on 

voting technology.  "Other options available don't prevent overvoting with 

such simple certainty."

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Touchscreens also facilitate ballot counting in Proportional Representation 

and Instant Runoff Voting, which the Green Party strongly supports.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some Greens have called for scannable ballots, enabling quick counts while 

preserving a paper record of votes, and for placing election software in the 

public domain.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Congress' "Help America Vote Act," requiring states to implement 

computerized voter files by the 2004 election, presents a choice between



technologies that increase democratic accountability and those that allow 

state authorities to manipulate elections.  If the latter, fraud will be



difficult to detect, since bias could easily be built into computer programs 

that would only be accessible to state authorities.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"As many states switch to computerized systems, we risk more purges of 

legitimate voters," said Jim Maceda, Treasurer Green Party of New York 

State.  "The Florida experience in 2000 shows us that African Americans and 

other ethnic groups may be especially vulnerable."

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Before the 2000 election, the Florida Secretary of State's office ordered a 

purge of 94,000 voters, supposedly convicted felons, though most were not 

guilty of any crime," said Maceda.  "Over half of those purged were African 

American or Latino.  The state's computerized files facilitated the 

manipulation of voter rolls."

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greens insist that, in order for elections to be fair, every step must be 

subject to public scrutiny, and state laws must promote, not restrict, the 

right of people to vote.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Legislatures in many states have passed laws barring convicted felons who 

have served their sentences from voting as a way of silencing African 

Americans, Latinos, and others who are arrested and convicted in 

disproportionate numbers," said Badili Jones, Georgia Green and co-chair of 

the Green Party of the United States.  "Democrats and Republicans in such 

states acted in concert to keep legitimate voters -- felons who served their 

sentences as well people with the same name as felons -- from voting, just 

as they passed prohibitive ballot access laws restricting third parties and 

independents.  Al Gore and his fellow Democrats offered no public protest 

against these policies in the weeks following the election.  Nor did any



Senate Democrats stand up in support of the Black Caucus' challenge to 

Bush's engineered victory."

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Chief Justice William Rehnquist, speaking for the majority of judges in the 

Supreme Court decision upholding the manipulated Florida vote in 2000, 

declared that there exists no constitutional right to vote in a national



election.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The long U.S. tradition of 'one citizen, one vote,' which generations of 

Americans fought and died for, is in dire jeopardy," said J. Roy Cannon,



Delaware Green delegate to the party's central committee.  "It'll take 

enormous public vigilance to ensure that the 2000 debacle isn't repeated."
