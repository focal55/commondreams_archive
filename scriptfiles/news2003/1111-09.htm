<td valign="top" align="left" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">SAN FRANCISCO - November 11 - Rainforest Action Network (RAN) applauds FleetBoston Financial Corporation for facilitating the sale of 147,500 acres of endangered temperate rainforest to The Nature Conservancy. Located in southern Chile, the Valdivian Coastal Range is part of a system that is one of only five temperate rainforests on Earth.  RAN led the U.S. campaign to convince FleetBoston to embrace the opportunity to transform a logging bankruptcy into forest conservation.  After months of direct talks, public pressure and a protest at FleetBoston Headquarters on October 8, 2003, RAN demonstrated to Fleet that it was faced with a decision that would be remembered for generations.
  </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Following the bankruptcy of Bosques SA, the Chilean logging company operating the Valdivian property, FleetBoston, its primary creditor through the Woodland Development Corporation, became its most influential decision maker. In June 2003, RAN responded to a request for action from The Coastal Range Conservation Coalition (CCCC), a Chilean association of 15 organizations working to protect the land. RAN helped make Fleet aware that it controlled the fate of one of the most imperiled ecosystems on Earth and encouraged it to abandon plans to sell off the biologically rich forest for conversion to an ecologically bankrupt single-species tree farm. At the same time, U.S. coalition partner Forest Ethics worked to secure the pivotal Chilean Supreme Court ruling that protected critical endangered species habitat on the property. FleetBoston finally agreed on a solution whereby The Nature Conservancy would purchase the debt secured by the property and acquire it at a public auction in Santiago, Chile. The acquisition will permanently protect some of the most endangered temperate rainforests in world.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> &quot;We applaud FleetBoston for using this unique transaction to make a long term environmental investment. While Bank of America continues to lag behind other major banks on basic environmental standards, FleetBoston's decision demonstrates the type of leadership that we hope will result in a comprehensive environmental policy for both banks as they prepare to merge.&quot; said Ilyse Hogue, director of Rainforest Action Network's Global Finance Campaign.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> &quot;The days of barbaric practices such as destroying rainforests to make way
  for environmentally-catastrophic tree farms are numbered,&quot; said Aaron
  Sanger, Chile Program Director for ForestEthics. &quot;FleetBoston showed great
  foresight in severing its ties with a project that would have devastated
Chile's Valdivian rainforest.&quot;</font></p>
