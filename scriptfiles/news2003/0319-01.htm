                - March 18 - George W. Bush's March 17 speech has been boiled 

                down to one blunt statement: "Saddam Hussein and his sons must 

                leave Iraq within 48 hours. Their refusal to do so will result 

                in military conflict, commenced at a time of our choosing." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Headlines the 

                next morning focused on this message: "President Tells Hussein 

                to Leave Iraq Within 48 Hours or Face Invasion" (Washington Post); 

                "Bush Gives Ultimatum to Hussein: Leave in 48 Hours or Face War" 

                (Ft. Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel); "President Gives the Iraqi Dictator 

                One Last Deadline" (San Antonio Express-News). </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One story, 

                however, at the bottom of an inside page in the New York Times, 

                had a different message: "Allies Will Move In, Even if Saddam 

                Hussein Moves Out" was the headline over a page A16 story by Times 

                military correspondent Michael Gordon. "Even if Saddam Hussein 

                leaves Iraq within 48 hours, as President Bush demanded, allied 

                forces plan to move north into Iraqi territory, American officials 

                said today," the article began. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Gordon pointed 

                to a little-noted line in Bush's speech: "It is not too late for 

                the Iraqi military to act with honor and protect your country 

                by permitting the peaceful entry of coalition forces to eliminate 

                weapons of mass destruction." While in the context of the speech, 

                this seemed to refer to what Bush hoped Iraqi commanders would 

                do in the event that his ultimatum was rejected, Gordon reports 

                that this was actually a signal that regardless of what Hussein 

                chooses, the U.S. would still, in Gordon's words, "enter Iraq 

                to search for hidden weapons of mass destruction and help stabilize 

                the nation so that a new and more democratic regime could take 

                over." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Even if the 

                Iraqi military were to overthrow Hussein, Gordon wrote, "a military 

                intervention seems very likely." He quoted Colin Powell's statement 

                on March 17 to the effect that "the only way for Iraq to avoid 

                an attack is for Mr. Hussein to leave the country and 'allow this 

                matter to be resolved through the peaceful entry of force.'" </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In other words, 

                there is nothing that Iraq can do to avoid invasion and occupation; 

                its only choice is whether or not to surrender. Why dress up this 

                straightforward policy with a claim that Saddam Hussein's refusal 

                to step down within a 48-hour deadline "will result in military 

                conflict"? Presumably because the White House knew that the media 

                would find the drama of the ultimatum irresistible, and would 

                therefore frame the upcoming war not as a choice that Washington 

                was making, but as a final test for Saddam Hussein. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Media have 

                by and large failed to challenge this spin campaign, and continue 

                to frame the story as a "defiant" Saddam Hussein spurning the 

                last chance for peace. "Saddam Sneers Back: Hell No, I Won't Go" 

                was the New York Daily News' front-page headline on March 19. 

                The cable news channel MSNBC actually had a "DEADLINE" clock in 

                the lower-right hand corner of its screen at all times, ticking 

                away the seconds until the meaningless deadline passes. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Even the Times 

                itself did not seem to have grasped its own correspondent's report: 

                "War Imminent as Hussein Rejects Ultimatum" was the paper's lead 

                headline (3/19/03), with an accompanying story beginning, "The 

                White House said today that Saddam Hussein was making his 'final 

                mistake' by rejecting an ultimatum ordering him to leave Iraq 

                or face war."
