                - March 6 - The following is a statement by Tom Kiernan, president 

                of the National Parks Conservation Association, on the Yellowstone 

                Protection Act: </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The bipartisan 

                Yellowstone Protection Act introduced today by representatives 

                Rush Holt and Christopher Shays and senators Lincoln Chafee and 

                Harry Reid would save Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks 

                from the threats looming over them as a result of the Bush administration's 

                decision to increase snowmobile use in both parks. By phasing 

                out snowmobiles use there, the law backs the viewpoint expressed 

                by the American people and protects the parks. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In contrast 

                the Bush administration, by imposing snowmobiles on the parks, 

                is ignoring not only common sense methods for protecting the parks 

                but also the administration's own studies and the expressed will 

                of the American people. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Recently, National 

                Park Service and Environmental Protection Agency studies confirmed 

                that eliminating snowmobile use in the parks would best protect 

                park wildlife, visitors, and staff. During the public comment 

                period on snowmobile use in the parks, the American people last 

                year flooded the Park Service with a record 350,000 comments, 

                80 percent them supporting the phase out. The Bush administration 

                is ignoring the will of the people and the results of its own 

                studies at the behest of its corporate supports in the snowmobile 

                industry. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The millions 

                of tax dollars spent on forcing snowmobiles on these parks could 

                be better spent implementing the original Park Service snowcoach 

                plan that would have protected Yellowstone and Grant Teton's wildlife, 

                air, visitors, and employees and provided environmentally friendly 

                access for all. Senators Reid and Chafee and representatives Holt 

                and Shays, by introducing the Yellowstone Protection Act, have 

                produced a common-sense law that offers the parks the best safeguards 

                and preserves the congressional legacy of protecting national 

                parks for all Americans. </font>
