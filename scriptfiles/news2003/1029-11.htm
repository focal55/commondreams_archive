- October 29 - &quot;We are incensed,&quot; said Thomas H. Corey, national president of Vietnam Veterans of America (VVA), &quot;by the information we continue to receive about the harsh conditions and substandard treatment accorded sick and injured U.S. soldiers at Fort Stewart, Georgia, and elsewhere.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;In 1968, Vietnam veterans had to compete with rats and other vermin for living space in VA hospitals around the country as they sought care for their injuries,&quot; Corey said. &quot;After the 1968 Tet Offensive, the system was ill-prepared for the heavy casualties, the overcrowding, shortage of nurses and physical therapists. This resulted in unavailable treatment.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;That situation was intolerable then and the current situation is unconscionable now, &quot; Corey said. &quot;At a time when our political leaders hail the bravery of our young men and women in uniform, at a time when Americans stand on street corners and wave flags proclaiming their support for the troops, these same troops are housed in substandard facilities and don't receive proper care.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Corey dispatched a representative to investigate and report on conditions at Fort Stewart and other bases. VVA has observed that Reservists and active-duty personnel being treated for wounds and diseases have been housed in facilities that lack adequate indoor plumbing and air-conditioning.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;How is it that Congress can write a check for $87 billion to continue funding the war in Iraq and Afghanistan, but when those who fight that war need medical care, they are treated as second-class citizens?&quot; Corey asked. &quot;How can this administration argue that an additional $1.3 billion for veterans health care is not related to the war effort? Our warnings that the VA and the military medical centers were unprepared for the casualties they are receiving -- warnings that we have been sounding for more than a year -- have been brushed aside. The disastrous conditions at Fort Stewart and elsewhere are the result of a lack of proper funding and planning for such contingencies.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We demand immediate answers from the Department of Defense, the Department of the Army, the Surgeon General of the Army, and officials at Fort Stewart. We want to know: What has been done to remediate a critical situation? What will be done to avoid similar situations in the future?&quot;</font></p>
