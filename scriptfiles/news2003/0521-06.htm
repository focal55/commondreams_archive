- May 21 - As the Federal Communications Commission prepares to announce sweeping changes to regulations governing how many media outlets a single company can own, a new study shows a dramatic decrease in children’s TV programming following a rise in media consolidation.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The study, released today by Children Now, a child research and action organization, examined the impact of media consolidation among major television stations in Los Angeles—the nation’s second largest city and media market—before and after the purchase of independent stations by media giants that already owned stations in the city.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The study counted the number of children’s series each station broadcast, the number of hours devoted to children’s programming and how often the same shows were repeated across different stations. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The findings reveal major changes in the wake of recent consolidation. Among them:

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">--The overall number of children’s shows decreased by almost half (47 percent) over the past five years, from a total of 88 programs per week across all stations in 1998, to just 47 shows in 2003.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">--The largest decrease in programming for children occurred at stations that are part of so-called “duopolies,” where one company owns two broadcast stations in the same media market. For example, in 1998, KCOP (an independently-owned UPN affiliate) and KTTV (Fox-owned and operated) aired 14 and 21 shows geared toward children, respectively. By 2003, after Fox’s parent company, News Corporation, had purchased KCOP, it was airing just four children’s series and KTTV was airing just seven, representing a 71 percent decrease in such programming on KCOP and a 67 percent decrease at KTTV. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">--After KCBS’ parent corporation, Viacom, purchased the independent KCAL, children’s programming fell from 26 hours per week (18 shows) in 1998 to three hours (four shows) in 2003, a decrease of 89 percent. KCBS maintained a program lineup of three hours (six shows) weekly in both years, the minimum amount required under FCC guidelines.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The remaining three stations that are not part of a duopoly made far fewer changes in their children’s TV lineup, averaging a 12 percent reduction in program hours. This finding led researchers to conclude that there is a strong link between concentration of ownership and the reduction in children’s programming. Experts fear Los Angeles may be a bellwether for the rest of the country.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“Our research demonstrates that the FCC is moving far too fast and with far too few facts to make changes that encourage further concentration among media owners,” said Patti Miller, director of Children Now’s Children & the Media program. “The impact on programming for children and their communities clearly has not been properly evaluated.”

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Overall, the study found young viewers lost three hours of kids’ TV on Saturdays, four hours on Sundays and 90 Minutes each weekday since 1998.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The findings come at a time when the FCC seems likely to relax or eliminate several rules that prevent such media concentration throughout the nation. Under current law, News Corporation and Viacom each will have to sell one of their Los Angeles stations before their broadcast licenses can be renewed—unless that law is changed in the meantime by the FCC, which both companies have been lobbying for as part of the current review.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Such rules originally were enacted to ensure a diversity of voices on the airwaves and to prevent a small number of companies from controlling news and entertainment content. Recently, those regulations have come under pressure from large media corporations with clout in Washington and from deregulation-minded officials, who have cited reducing costs as the principal reason for eliminating them.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Other findings from Children Now’s report support the conclusion that ownership changes may have had a negative impact on children’s programming. Despite claims by proponents of deregulation that cable and satellite television provide alternatives to the major broadcast networks and therefore enhance the diversity of programming available, the study found the number of the same shows repeated between cable and broadcast channels increased almost fourfold between 1998 and 2003.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many children’s series on stations owned by large media corporations, such as Disney and Viacom, were found to be repeats of shows that also aired on jointly-owned cable channels. This year, for example:

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">--100 percent of KCBS’ children’s programming is also broadcast on Viacom-owned Nickelodeon;

--78 percent of KABC’s kids’ shows are also broadcast on one or more Disney-owned cable channels; 

--58 percent of kids’ series on KTLA, a WB affiliate, are also broadcast on the AOL-Time Warner-owned Cartoon Network; and

--All of General Electric-owned KNBC’s children’s lineup is provided by Discovery Kids channel, which is owned by other major media companies.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“All these repeated series reduce the number of original kids’ shows,” Miller said. “This must be considered before allowing the media giants to own even more stations.”

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the report, Children Now urged the FCC to adopt new rules guaranteeing a minimum amount of original programming for children. The FCC has set a June 2 deadline for announcing rule changes. Members of the public can still get involved by sending a letter to the agency at www.childrennow.org

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The study examined one week of the seven primary commercial broadcast stations in 1998 and 2003 and did not include cable stations, except to verify the source of repeated programs from a broadcast station’s cable corporate sibling.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Children’s programs were defined by reviewing a station’s required FCC filing for children’s educational programming, as well as including shows listed in TV Guide as having a TV-Y or TV-Y7 rating, or other descriptors such as “children,” “cartoon,” “teenager” or “educational.”
