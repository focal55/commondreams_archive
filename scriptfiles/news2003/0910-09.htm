-  

September 10 - On September 7, 2003, George W. Bush spoke to the nation about the &quot;war on terror,&quot; and particularly about the new &quot;terror front,&quot; Iraq. It is 

obvious that Bush is still listening to former corporation heads, military 

planners, and advisers who have oil tankers named after them.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">         But not to ordinary people.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">         The Bush administration is not listening to the thousands of 

people who lost their jobs last month, or the hundreds of thousands who 

have lost their pensions as more and more money is taken from the people's 

economy and put into the war economy.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">         Bush is about to ask Congress for an additional $87 billion to 

fight against and kill people in Iraq. That request alone accounts for 

twenty percent of all federally funded programs for the people. Spread out 

over the five months we've been in occupation of Iraq, it works out to be 

about $402,000 a minute-and that's not counting the cost of the invasion, 

with its &quot;extra&quot; budgetary request of nearly $75 billion. The 

administration is not listening to teachers, or students and their parents, 

who would tell him what they could accomplish with all that money. Or to 

graduates with student loans. Or to people struggling with staggering 

housing costs. Or to people without medical insurance-ordinary people.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">         Nor is the administration listening to New Yorkers, who bore, and 

continue to bear, the brunt of the September 11 attacks. The New York City 

Council joined dozens of other cities across the nation and voted against 

the invasion of Iraq last March 13, reflecting New York City polls that 

counted nearly 75 percent of the people against the invasion. &quot;We of all 

cities,&quot; said City Councilmember Alan Gerson, &quot;must uphold the preciousness 

and sanctity of human life.&quot; Since that day, New York has led the economic 

decline, left to fall with less and less support from the federal 

government. This week, a New York Times poll showed that now, after the 

invasion of Iraq, more New Yorkers are afraid of a terrorist attack than 

they were the year before. A new national poll shows that more people think 

that the invasion of Iraq has increased the risk of terror, rather than 

decreased it.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">         Well, ordinary people would say, it makes sense to be more afraid. 

If you send hundreds of thousands of troops into a place, bombing and 

shooting, destroying cities and buildings and lives, collapsing a 

government and bringing massive internal chaos-and then delay and delay in 

restoring order and power and clean water and medicine-ordinarily, people 

will get upset with you. If the administration had listened to those in the 

peace movement who had gone to Iraq and talked to the ordinary people 

there, it would have known that.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">         In fact, we were not suffering any terrorist attacks in Iraq 

before the invasion (or in Afghanistan either, for that matter). Now we 

are. And under the constant threat of the terrifying situation the invasion 

has created, &quot;coalition&quot; troops (who are most often ordinary people under 

the command of their officers or of fear) fire upon buildings and crowds, 

killing civilians. And that gets more people upset, and wanting to drive 

the United States out. Troops parade Iraqi arrestees blindfolded or naked 

into the streets, or they pat down the women, searching for weapons, and 

mortally insult the families, creating lethal hostility.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">         And what is the administration's solution to this? Hire the 

Mukhabarat, the Iraqi secret police, to find out who is behind these lethal 

attacks. But wait-wasn't that one of the ex post facto justifications for 

the invasion: To end that kind of tyranny? And, ordinary people might 

continue to ask, where are the weapons of mass destruction that we went to 

war to destroy? In the mind of those advisers, maybe. By the way, is there 

a rule that says that we can go over there and kill their civilians, but 

they can't come over here and kill our civilians? Maybe we could ask the 

administration about that-if only it were listening to ordinary people.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">         Now the administration wants to go to the United Nations to ask 

for help. Ordinary people urged Bush to do that before he went to war. But 

when it was clear that 11 of the 15 members of the Security Council would 

not authorize an illegal invasion, the Bush administration never brought it 

to a vote, and the killing commenced.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">         And continues-more U.S. dead than before &quot;major hostilities 

ended,&quot; according to Bush. And, since no one is keeping count of the Iraqis 

who are dying during and since the invasion, who knows how many of them? 

Does the administration want the United Nations to legitimate the U.S. 

occupation? Bush wants U.N. members to supply troops (more ordinary people), but put under U.S. command. That way, not so many ordinary Americans will be killing and dying, because ordinary people from other 

countries will. That ought to &quot;mend the fences&quot; among our allies after Bush 

did not listen to them before the war, right? How much U.S. pressure and 

money will have to be employed (and how many more ordinary people will have 

to be unemployed) before other governments agree to that? But the 

administration is not listening to the kind of questions ordinary people 

would ask.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">         Here is something else they probably won't listen to. The Iraqis 

never attacked us-not on September 11 or any other time. We attacked them: 

in the first Gulf War, then in twelve years of bombing and sanctions that 

human rights observers called &quot;genocidal,&quot; and now with this invasion and 

occupation. And yet those in the peace movement who go over to Iraq find an 

astonishing wellspring of good will toward the U.S. people.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">         Ordinary people know that making and keeping friends is hard work. 

And when you hurt a friend, you say you're sorry, and try to make it up to 

them. In the case of Iraq, that would mean a program of reparations for all 

our attacks. It would mean funding a nonviolent international body, chosen 

by Iraqis, to help Iraqis reconstruct the people's economy so devastated by 

invasions, sanctions and bombing. It would mean returning the 

reconstruction effort to ordinary Iraqis, not to White House crony 

corporations and the Vichy-style occupation government in Iraq. And of 

course, it would mean an end to the occupation. All that would cost a lot 

less than the ongoing war and occupation, and reclaim for us the friendship 

we used to have with the Iraqi people.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">         The War Resisters League believes that such a program, with the 

help of the entire international community, is the way to overcome terror. 

Really, ordinary people would tell the administration, the way to make sure 

there is no &quot;terror front&quot; in Iraq is to treat ordinary people with dignity 

and even humility; make them your friends.</font></p>
