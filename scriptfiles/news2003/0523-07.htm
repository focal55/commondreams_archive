- May 23 - Governor John 

Rowland's response to the latest child abuse tragedy in Connecticut 

shows he has learned nothing from the harm he caused to children 

when he set off a foster-care panic eight years ago, a national 

child advocacy group said Friday. </font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Responding to the death of Al-Lex Daniels, Rowland demanded that 

child welfare workers rush to tear even more children from their 

parents -- setting off the second foster- care panic since he took 

office. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The State Senate will only compound the tragedy if it passes 

"sibling confiscation" legislation already approved by the House of 

Representatives, according to Richard Wexler, executive director of 

the National Coalition for Child Protection Reform. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The most likely consequence of the Governor's foolish rhetoric 

and a sibling confiscation law can be summed up in three words: 

More dead children," Wexler said. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1995, after the death of Emily Hernandez, Governor Rowland, 

then newly in office, "confused child removal with child safety," 

Wexler said. "Then, as now, he demanded the removal of huge 

numbers of additional children in the name of 'erring on the side 

of child safety.' But experience across the nation and right in 

Connecticut shows that those are the most dangerous words in child 

welfare - because they make children less safe." 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Wexler says Rowland's approach backfired. "The foster care 

population skyrocketed. But instead of making children safer, 

child abuse fatalities actually increased. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"That's because the real reason children 'known to the system' 

sometimes die is that underprepared, undertrained caseworkers are 

desperately overwhelmed. So they make bad mistakes in both 

directions. They leave some children in dangerous homes even as 

they take many more from homes that are safe or could be made safe 

with the right kinds of help. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Governor Rowland's foster-care panic overwhelmed workers even 

more. So they made more mistakes, and more children wound up 

dead." 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Wexler said that since Connecticut is a small state, some might 

argue that the increase in fatalities after Rowland's first panic 

might be coincidence. "But exactly the same thing happened in much 

larger jurisdictions," Wexler said. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Cases like the Emily Hernandez case set off foster care panics 

in Illinois in 1993, New York City in 1996 and Florida in 1999. In 

all three cases, huge increases in the number of children taken 

from their parents were followed by increases in child abuse 

fatalities. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"There is one crucial difference between these other places and 

Connecticut," Wexler said. "The other places all learned from 

their mistakes. Illinois and New York City reversed course and 

embraced safe, proven programs for keeping families together. As 

a result, their foster care populations plummeted. At the same 

time, child safety improved. Florida is now promising to do the 

same. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"In contrast, Governor Rowland has chosen to react to the latest 

tragedy by repeating his mistakes. This time he has no excuse for 

the harm his approach will do to children," Wexler said. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Wexler said children will be harmed in many ways. "Some will be 

harmed by the devastating emotional trauma of being needlessly 

removed from everyone loving and familiar. Others will be harmed 

when they are abused in foster care itself. The more a foster care 

system is overloaded, the more dangerous it becomes, as workers are 

tempted to overcrowd foster homes and lower standards for foster 

parents. And still other children, truly in danger in their own 

homes, will be overlooked because workers will be too overwhelmed 

to find them." 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Wexler said the legislature will compound the damage if it 

passes a bill to require that, if DCF takes away one child, it must 

take all the child's siblings. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"There are conditions in a home, often due to a family's 

poverty, that may be dangerous to a two-year-old but not a 

17-year-old," Wexler said. "While the best solution would be to 

improve the living conditions for everyone, at a minimum there is 

no need to remove the child for whom there is no danger," Wexler 

said.
