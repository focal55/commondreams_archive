- December 11 - Conservationists hailed today's report from the National Research Council, which concludes that U.S. Army Corps of Engineers attempts to justify a $1.2 billion renovation of the navigation infrastructure on the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers are still not credible. </FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Army Corps has long asserted that longer locks are necessary to ease shipping congestion on these rivers even though traffic has been stagnant or declining for the past 20 years.  The project is opposed by conservationists because it would destroy valuable wetlands, increase sedimentation in the river, and harm fish.  </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The National Research Council has made it clear that the Corps' revised study is simply not credible,&quot; said Melissa Samet, Senior Director of Water Resources, &quot;Bureaucrats behaving badly should not be rewarded with $1.2 billion tax dollars to build a destructive project that's not needed.&quot;  </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Army Corps resumed its march towards longer locks in 2002 after a whistleblower scandal briefly brought the project to a screeching halt. In 2000, Army Corps economist Donald Sweeney accused his superiors of deliberately manipulating studies to support building longer locks. The Army Inspector General and the National Research Council subsequently verified Sweeney's accusations. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The National Research Council report identifies a number of disturbing flaws in the revised study and shows that it is no more credible than the study that was stopped three years ago.  The flaws include:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">*The Corps continues to use two discredited economic models -- the Tow Cost model that was previously rejected by both the Corps and the National Research Council; and the ESSENCE model that was rejected by the National Research Council in 2001.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">*The Corps continues to forecast increases in grain exports that are wholly inconsistent with the relatively steady export levels over the past 20 years.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">*The Corps refuses to implement an efficient system for managing waterway traffic prior to evaluating the benefits of any lock expansion.  The National Research Council concludes that &quot;it is not possible&quot; to evaluate such benefits unless an efficient system for managing waterway traffic is in place.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">*The Corps has not yet properly factored in the ecological and restoration needs of the river in its revised study -- despite the fact that the Corps is rapidly moving to complete the study. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Conservationists have long called on the Cops to institute small-scale measures that would bring immediate relief for the congestion problems without further degrading the river.  </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Such small-scale measures include: congestion fees; excess lockage time charges; scheduling the arrival of barges at locks; construction of mooring buoys; use of helper boats; and greater cooperation between tow operators.  By keeping tows away from riverbanks, such small-scale measures will also reduce bank erosion and tree mortality. </FONT></P><P></P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p></font><!-- #EndEditable --></td></tr>
