                - March 27 - According to POGO sources, the Pentagon’s Defense 

                Acquisition Board has approved production of additional F-22s 

                but has postponed addressing the on-going avionics problems plaguing 

                the system. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The decision 

                echoes another disastrous procurement story. On the B-1 bomber, 

                crippling avionics problems that were not fixed before production 

                and eventually made the bomber unusable (see POGO’s Fighting with

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“The eyes and 

                ears of the plane do not work yet. It is irresponsible to spend 

                billions on a plane that may never work. For every single pie 

                in the sky F-22 the Pentagon can buy four tried and true F-16s,” 

                said Danielle Brian, Executive Director of POGO. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The General 

                Accounting Office has issued two reports in recent weeks documenting 

                uncontrolled cost overruns and technical difficulties in the program 

                (see March 13th POGO Alert “GAO Report Says F-22 Costs Soaring 

                Out of Control” <a href="http://www.pogo.org/p/defense/da-030301-f22.html" target="_new">http://www.pogo.org/p/defense/da-030301-f22.html</a>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In its most 

                recent report, the GAO recommended that the Secretary of Defense 

                “reconsider the decision to increase the annual production rate 

                of the F/A-22” in order to “minimize the risks of producing large 

                quantities of aircraft that may require costly modifications.” 

                According to the GAO, increasing the F/A-22 production rate “is 

                a high-risk strategy that could serve to further increase production 

                costs.” <a href="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d03431.pdf" target="_new">http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d03431.pdf</a>
