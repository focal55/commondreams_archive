                - April 8 - The four-and-a-half-year war in the Democratic Republic 

                of Congo has taken more lives than any other since World War II 

                and is the deadliest documented conflict in African history, says 

                the International Rescue Committee. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A mortality 

                study released today by the IRC estimates that since August 1998, 

                when the war erupted, through November 2002 when the survey was 

                completed, at least 3.3 million people died in excess of what 

                would normally be expected during this time. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This is a 

                humanitarian catastrophe of horrid and shocking proportions," 

                says George Rupp, president of the IRC. "The worst mortality projections 

                in the event of a lengthy war in Iraq, and the death toll from 

                all the recent wars in the Balkans don't even come close. Yet 

                the crisis has received scant attention from international donors 

                and the media." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Improved access 

                and security in 2002 enabled the IRC to measure mortality among 

                9.3 million people in 10 districts in the war-decimated east, 

                and 31.2 million in 10 western districts, greatly expanding on 

                two previous IRC studies in eastern provinces conducted in 2000 

                and 2001. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to 

                the IRC's findings, an estimated 30,000 excess deaths have occurred 

                every month in this ongoing-conflict. The vast majority, some 

                85 percent, have been from easily treatable diseases and malnutrition, 

                linked to displacement and the collapse of much of the country's 

                health system and economy. With poor or no access to basic health 

                care, the smallest children have died at disproportionately high 

                rates. In three of the ten health zones IRC teams visited in the 

                east, more than half the children were dead before the age of 

                two. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But the IRC's 

                research found some cause for hope. While people continued to 

                die at an extraordinary rate, death from violence in the east 

                dropped by 90 percent compared to the previous three years of 

                the war, and overall mortality also declined significantly. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The IRC believes 

                a number of positive developments have contributed to greater 

                stability and the decline in excess mortality. Peace talks in 

                South Africa have led to the withdrawal of most foreign forces, 

                as well as a framework for implementing a peace accord and developing 

                a government of reconciliation. And some 5,500 UN observers have 

                taken up position in the country. This environment of improved 

                security enabled humanitarian aid organizations like the IRC to 

                expand emergency health services and infrastructure support programs, 

                particularly in previously inaccessible areas. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, the 

                peace process is in danger. There are new outbreaks of fighting 

                in northeastern Ituri, and Uganda has reoccupied areas of the 

                province. Meanwhile, Rwanda, which withdrew its forces last October, 

                is threatening to reinvade, and militias that perpetrated the 

                1994 genocide in Rwanda, still lurk in the forests of eastern 

                Congo. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Unless there 

                is rapid and bold international investment in strengthening this 

                peace process, all that has been gained in Congo could be lost," 

                said George Rupp. "We hope the findings in this report compel 

                the international community to take action." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The International 

                Rescue Committee urges a diplomatic and humanitarian response 

                in proportion to the magnitude of this crisis: </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- The fighting 

                must come to an end. The IRC supports and encourages rapid implementation 

                of the peace accords. Regional governments must end their backing 

                of militia groups, and support the formation of a transitional 

                government. The international community needs to demand and verify 

                the departure of all foreign troops and insist that armed groups 

                and militias cease attacks on civilian populations. And it is 

                vital that the mandate and resources of the UN peacekeeping mission 

                be enhanced to ensure compliance of all parties in the conflict. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Humanitarian 

                needs must be met. With the world's attention on the Middle East, 

                a war with the highest mortality in more than half a century goes 

                largely unnoticed. We urge donor nations to provide emergency 

                assistance and reconstruction support at a level proportional 

                to need. We urge warring parties to agree to an immediate ceasefire 

                and permit the safe delivery of humanitarian aid. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- The root 

                causes of war must be addressed. Local and ethnic conflicts threaten 

                to undo any peace accord in the region. The IRC believes the facilitators 

                of the Congolese peace process should increase support to local 

                initiatives to resolve ongoing disputes. In addition, exploitation 

                of Congo's natural resources by local and regional actors continues 

                to fuel violence. The international community should document 

                violations and impose punitive measures on those involved in illegal 

                exploitation. Finally, the IRC urges increased international resolve 

                to find viable solutions to the security concerns of Congo, Rwanda 

                and Uganda. The disarmament and demobilization of Rwandan Hutu 

                fighters in Congo should be a priority. </font>
