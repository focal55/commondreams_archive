- September 8 - Writing in the Sept. 8 issue of Navy Times, Dr. Michael Rankin, a retired Navy captain and Vietnam combat veteran, calls continued justifications for the military's gay ban &quot;insulting to our service men and women.&quot; Captain Rankin's op-ed, titled Our Country is Better, and Our Sailors are Braver Than That, was written in response to an Aug. 4 op-ed in the same paper by retired Navy Capt. R.A. Bowling. Capt. Bowling called on advocates for lifting the military's gay ban to pursue such matters through Congress rather than the court system.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In his response, Capt. Rankin points to the 1993 Senate hearings on gays in the military, noting that those hearings &quot;were among the most biased in recent memory.&quot; The resulting ban on service by lesbian, gay and bisexual Americans is, Rankin writes, &quot;an injustice that cannot stand forever as a permanent stain on our national life and character. We are too great a people to be bound by old myths and prejudices. Sooner or later, whether by court ruling or congressional mandate, this discrimination will end. On that day, America once again will have lived up to its promise -- and we will all be the better for it.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Supreme Court's recent decision in Lawrence v. Texas, overturning state sodomy laws, has provided new opportunity for challenging the military's gay ban in court. Rankin writes that &quot;Perhaps the Supreme Court's July ruling in Lawrence v. Texas, which assured Americans they have the right to privacy in their most intimate relationships, will be the vehicle for allowing homosexuals to serve openly. If so, I have no doubt that all branches of the military will adapt to this new challenge as they have adapted to similar challenges in the past.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Speaking with Servicemembers Legal Defense Network (SLDN), where Rankin serves on the organization's honorary board, he noted that &quot;All the old arguments, including unit cohesion and bad effects on morale, have been disproven. What we are left with -- the only remaining 'justification' -- is prejudice. It took many painful years to bring African Americans and women into full citizenship in our country. Let's not let it take years more to do the same for gay and lesbian Americans who want to serve their country in her armed forces.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Capt. Rankin currently serves as Clinical Professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at George Washington School of Medicine. He is a Vietnam combat veteran. Capt. Rankin is a life member of the Vietnam Veterans of America and the Disabled Veterans of America, as well as a member of the Alexander Hamilton Chapter of the American Legion.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Capt. Rankin's op-ed also follows a National Law Journal article by Admiral John D. Hutson, president of Franklin Pierce Law Center and a retired Judge Advocate General of the Navy. Regarding the Lawrence impact on &quot;Don't Ask, Don't Tell,&quot; Admiral Hutson wrote that &quot;It would be a great tragedy if we didn't take advantage of this second chance to correct a flawed policy. Military personnel in 2003 have reached a level of maturity and tolerance that undermines the earlier 'unit cohesion' arguments.&quot;</font></p>
