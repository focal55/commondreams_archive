                - March 4 - Bolivian water officials are calling on the World 

                Bank to include in this week’s international water conference 

                a discussion of the privatization disaster in Cochabamba, the 

                Bank’s most notorious failure in its push for privatization. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Bank, convening 

                an international conference on water issues today in Washington, 

                D.C., has conspicuously left off the list of discussion topics 

                the failure of water privatization in Cochabamba, Bolivia, which 

                occurred as part of the Bank’s worldwide push for water privatization. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a letter 

                sent last week to World Bank officials, Cochabamba water officials 

                demanded that the forum take up the devastating impact of water 

                privatization. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We think this 

                is a critical opportunity for water officials to look at the real 

                experience of privatization in Cochabamba, " the letter said. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Three years 

                ago, under direct pressure from the World Bank, the government 

                leased the public water system of its third largest city to a 

                subsidiary of the San Francisco-based Bechtel Corporation. When 

                Bechtel charged poor consumers rates far beyond what they could 

                afford, citizens rebelled and forced Bechtel to return the water 

                system to public hands. A 17-year-old boy was killed and more 

                than a hundred others were injured in the anti-Bechtel protests. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The World 

                Bank believes in water privatization as a matter of theology," 

                said Jim Shultz, executive director of The Democracy Center, based 

                in Cochabamba. "Bank officials forced that theology onto Bolivia 

                by directly threatening to withhold up to $600 million in debt 

                relief if the government didn’t privatize the water. Now Bank 

                officials would like to keep the Bolivian water fiasco from coming 

                up at their Washington cheerleading session for privatization. 

                After the international attention Cochabamba received, it’s a 

                glaring omission." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The Bank is 

                no doubt wary of including the whole story because it’s such a 

                delicate time for proponents of water privatization," added Sara 

                Grusky, a water policy analyst with Public Citizen. "With the 

                recent failure of projects in cities as far apart as Manila, Buenos 

                Aires and Atlanta, putting a happy face on water privatization 

                at this conference will depend a great deal on what is left out. 

                Far from providing access to clean and affordable water, privatization 

                has meant rapid increases in consumer water rates, public health 

                crises, job losses, secret deals and weak regulation. " </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The World Bank 

                has invited water officials from all over the world to the three-day 

                conference on "Water and Development." Featured topics include 

                "Beyond the Public-Private Debate" and "New Approaches to Private 

                Sector Participation" (Click here to view a full program). The 

                director of Cochabamba’s new public water company, Gonzalo Ugalde, 

                was invited less than two weeks before the session was to open 

                – and only as an observer. There is no scheduled forum for talking 

                about the Bank policy of forced privatization or notable failures 

                such as in Cochabamba. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The World Bank’s 

                water conference comes just weeks after the announcement by a 

                secret World Bank trade tribunal that it would not allow the public 

                or media to participate in or even witness proceedings in which 

                Bechtel is suing the government and people of Bolivia for $25 

                million. The panel, whose chair was appointed by World Bank President 

                James Wolfensohn, rejected an international citizens petition 

                calling for an opening of the case, endorsed by more than 300 

                citizens groups from more than 43 countries. (Click here to view 

                a release issued by the petitioners at the time of the decision.)

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The World 

                Bank is not only imposing its ideas and programs on us, it is 

                also preventing the people affected from participating in a case 

                that directly affects our lives," said Oscar Olivera, a leader 

                of the coalition of Bolivian peasants, workers and others that 

                formed in opposition to Bechtel. "This is profoundly undemocratic." 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bechtel's legal 

                action is being heard by the International Center for the Settlement 

                of Investment Disputes (ICSID), a tribunal administered by the 

                World Bank that holds all of its meetings in secret. Bechtel is 

                suing Bolivia for the profits it claims it would have made from 

                the water privatization scheme had the rate hike protests not 

                led to its unplanned departure from the city of Cochabamba in 

                April 2000.
