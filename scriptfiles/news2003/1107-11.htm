KY - November 7 - A federal court in Kentucky ruled today that food giant Tyson 
is responsible for pollution at factory farms. The Sierra Club and local residents 
sued Tyson for failing to report hazardous releases of ammonia from four animal 
factories under its supervision, located in Webster, McClean, and Hopkins counties. 
Animal factories are huge chicken production operations that pack tens of thousands 
of chickens into closed buildings. When people breathe ammonia, the toxic gas 
can cause respiratory problems, and in some cases can be fatal.</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;This 
decision is a huge victory for Kentuckians,&#148; said Aloma Dew, Conservation 
Organizer for the Sierra Club. &#147;Tyson is finally being held accountable for 
the mess created by its giant animal factories.&#148; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Under 
both the Superfund law and Community-Right-to-Know laws, which form the basis 
of the Sierra Club lawsuit, polluters that emit more than 100 pounds of ammonia 
per day must report those releases to the federal government and the local community 
emergency coordinator. The legislation was enacted so that governments and members 
of the public could learn what hazards they face from potential toxic substance 
releases.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Tyson 
had argued that it was not responsible for pollution from its factory farms because 
the operations are run by people who raise chickens for Tyson under contract. 
Federal Court Judge Joseph McKinley saw through Tyson&#146;s arguments, ruling 
that Tyson is &#147;clearly in a position of responsibility and power with respect 
to each facility . . . and has the capacity to prevent and abate the alleged environmental 
damage.&#148; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;This 
court confirmed that Tyson is not above the law,&#148; explained Sierra Club attorney 
Barclay Rogers. &#147;Tyson must pay for the problems it causes.&#148;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;Giant, 
corporate-owned factory farms are polluting our air and water, and are displacing 
local family farms. Today, the court dealt a blow to corporate agriculture that 
has crept into Kentucky, threatening the way of life of our family farmers who 
believe in good-neighbor practices and care about the land and the law,&#148; 
said Dew.</FONT></P><P></P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p></font><!-- #EndEditable --></td></tr>
