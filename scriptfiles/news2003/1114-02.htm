- November 14 - Today&#146;s deal on energy legislation is an appalling abomination, 
written by a few Republicans working with energy industry executives behind closed 
doors. The undemocratic process in which this energy bill was crafted does not 
benefit consumers or the environment; in fact, both are likely to become the victims 
of an energy plan that will reward corporate polluters at taxpayer expense, with 
the following consequences:</FONT><UL><LI><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">With 
the repeal of the Public Utility Holding Company Act (PUHCA), expect a consolidation 
of the utility industry, as huge corporations buy local utilities and use ratepayer 
assets to finance risky investments. This likely will lead to more Enron-style 
scandals, higher electricity bills and more blackouts. Assets of the 179 largest 
investor-owned utilities in the United States were estimated to be worth $600 
billion in 1996 &#150; closer to a trillion dollars today. Electric utility industry 
revenues constitute between 3 and 4 percent of the gross domestic product, larger 
than telecommunications, natural gas pipelines, and airline revenues combined. 
PUHCA&#146;s repeal will allow, for the first time since 1935, the ownership of 
this huge and essential public service by investment banks, oil companies, insurance 
companies, electric equipment companies and others with potentially huge conflicts 
of interest. </FONT></LI><LI><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The 
bill will hand out an estimated $20 billion in tax breaks, most to the oil, gas 
and nuclear industries, enabling further pollution of the air, land and water. 
As a result of the attempt to revive the declining and uneconomical nuclear industry, 
the public will face a growing nuclear waste problem and increased shipments of 
radioactive waste through their communities. </FONT></LI><LI><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Environmental 
laws, such as the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking Water Act, 
will be gutted through exemptions or extensions of cleanup deadlines. Public lands 
in the Rocky Mountain states will be opened to drilling at the expense of wildlife 
habitat and federally protected lands. The coalbed methane industry will continue 
to pollute groundwater, rivers and streams, bolstered by tax breaks and permit 
exemptions. Consumers will be left paying billions of dollars for the cleanup 
of groundwater contaminated with MTBE because the producers will be immunized 
from lawsuits. Residents in areas such as Houston, Atlanta and Los Angeles likely 
will face an increased incidence of asthma because of exemptions to the Clean 
Air Act. </FONT></LI></UL><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Congress 
should consider the implications of a bill that was written under the guise of 
energy independence and sustainability but in reality demonstrates alarmingly 
little concern for safe, renewable energy policies that will benefit us all. Congress 
must reject this deal, which was produced under pressure from Vice President Dick 
Cheney, and instead develop an energy plan that will address the real needs of 
consumers and the environment.</FONT><P></P><P></P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p></font><!-- #EndEditable --></td></tr>
