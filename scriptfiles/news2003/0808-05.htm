-  

August 8 - Today, in a momentous decision, United States District Court Judge John D. Bates denied a preliminary injunction request that would have barred the San Diego Zoo and Lowry Park Zoo from immediately importing eleven wild African elephants from their homes in Swaziland and incarcerating them in restrictive 2.5 acre enclosures in the U.S. The plaintiffs in the case (Born Free USA, Born Free Foundation, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, The Elephant Alliance, Animal Protection Institute, Animal Welfare Institute, In Defense of Animals, San Diego Animal Advocates, Animal Legal Defense Fund, the Elephant Sanctuary, and others) decry the ruling.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At a preliminary injunction hearing on August 6, lawyers for the zoos arrogantly warned the judge against playing &quot;Russian roulette&quot; with the lives of these elephants. &quot;It&#146;s the height of hypocrisy for the zoos&#146; hired henchmen to create a situation where elephants&#146; lives are unnecessarily in peril and then blame a U.S. judge if they die,&quot; said Adam Roberts of Animal Welfare Institute, the lead plaintiff in the case. &quot;If the zoos had acted in good faith from the start, this situation would not be as desperate as they are now claiming it is today.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Ted Reilly&#146;s, a part of Swaziland&#146;s Tourism Department with management responsibilities under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Flora and Fauna (CITES) which regulates international trade in wild animals, threats to kill these eleven elephants if they are not exported to the two zoos in the United States worked,&quot; said Nicole Pacquette of the Animal Protection Institute. &quot;First the FWS issued the zoos their import permits for these elephants and now a federal judge has allowed the importation to move forward all because Mr. Reilly is threatening to kill these animals &#150; this is not justice it&#146;s extortion.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It&#146;s amazing to me how the zoo representatives speak out of both sides of their mouths,&quot; said Jane Cartmill of San Diego Animal Advocates. &quot;On the one hand they say they care about these elephants and their conservation in the wild; on the other they say, give us the elephants we bought for a measly $12,000 each or we don&#146;t care if Mr. Reilly kills them.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;What&#146;s worse,&quot; Roberts added, &quot;is that the zoos want to shift the blame to everyone else: Reilly, the judge, animal protection organizations. They should take responsibility for the miserable situation they&#146;ve created as a result of their own astounding avarice.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It&#146;s been international trade policy by extortion,&quot; added Debbie Leahy of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. &quot;The judge clearly felt backed into a corner and didn&#146;t want blood on his hands. What is most disturbing, perhaps, is that only recently did we learn that two of the captured elephants are pregnant. It seems that the zoos are trying to get a neat two-for-one deal. What kind of people fight to transport pregnant elephants 9,000 miles by plane? It&#146;s repulsive.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Even if there is a justifiable need to remove these elephants from Swaziland, there are destinations in the wild in Southern Africa that are willing to provide humane homes rather than 2.5 acre enclosures in the California and Florida zoos. The Shamwari Reserve in South Africa&#146;s Eastern Cape has nearly 7,700 acres for elephants and a willingness to take the elephants. The Ngome Game Reserve in South Africa&#146;s KwaZulu-Natal Province also is willing to take the elephants as part of a burgeoning community-based ecotourism project. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;In the end,&quot; said Suzanne Roy of In Defense of Animals, &quot;the San Diego Zoo does not want these elephants to save their lives &#150; they could go elsewhere. They want them for captive breeding programs in the hopes of creating more elephants for exhibition despite the fact that breeding elephants in captivity is a dismal failure and the zoo already had elephants they could have tried to breed, but who were evicted to make room for these new ones. Zoos want new wild, young elephants, because those animals bring in the visitors and their wallets. This was never about conservation. It&#146;s always been about money and profits.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Joyce Tischler of the Animal Legal Defense Fund added, &quot;Conservation is not about building captive animal displays &#150; it is not about taking elephants from the wild and breaking up families. Conservation is about preserving habitat and animals. African elephants breed well in the wild and poorly in captivity. It is wrong to take elephants from their natural environments where they thrive and put them in a captive situation where they suffer from mental and health problems, where they stop reproducing due to stress and suffer from lack of exercise and boredom and domination by humans.&quot;</font></p>
