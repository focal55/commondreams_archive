- June 12 -  The Sierra Club today sharply criticized the Senate for opening the door to damaging drilling along the United States' coastlines. The Senate today failed to pass an amendment offered by Bob Graham (D-FL) that would have removed a harmful section of the Energy Bill calling for a needless inventory of oil and gas reserves in the Outer Continental Shelf. The move takes the U.S. closer to lifting a moratorium on dangerous off-shore drilling up and down much of the East and West coasts. This inventory will do nothing to decrease America's dependence on oil but will place coastal communities and marine life in harms way.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Allowing this inventory to go forward puts marine life and America's coasts at risk, opens the door to destructive off-shore drilling, and does nothing to decrease our oil dependence,&quot; said Carl Pope, Executive Director of Sierra Club.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By calling for an inventory of oil and gas reserves in the Outer Continental Shelf, the Senate energy bill would allow harmful, physically damaging technologies off our coastlines that will harm marine life and the surrounding habitat. This inventory takes the U.S. a step closer to opening currently protected coastlines to oil and gas drilling.  What's more, the inventory is unnecessary since a study has already been completed that estimates the oil and gas reserves on the Outer Continental Shelf.  Senator Graham introduced an amendment to strip this harmful provision out of the bill which failed by a vote of 44-54.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Unfortunately, this energy bill is still so full of giveaways to outdated polluting industries that we strongly urge the Senate to reject it,&quot; said Pope.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Every American deserves a safe, clean and affordable energy future. Fortunately, the technologies exist to get us there. But the Bush Administration and Congressional leadership are taking us down the wrong path with a destructive, expensive, and polluting energy bill. There's a better way. We can reduce our dependence on foreign oil. We can cut pollution. We can produce more of our electricity with clean, renewable energy like wind and solar power. At the same time, we can protect our special places and ensure that corporations do their part to protect our health and safety.</font></p>
