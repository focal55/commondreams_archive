                - April 17 - Amnesty International expressed concern today at 

                the continuing violence in the northern city of Mosul. At least 

                three people were killed and 12 injured, including two children, 

                during an incident yesterday in which US forces exchanged gunfire 

                during a demonstration near the governor's building. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Coming only 

                one day after 10 people were killed and 16 wounded in a similar 

                incident, these latest killings raise real concerns about the 

                protection of civilian lives and of their right to freedom of 

                expression and assembly. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The response 

                to demonstrations and public disorder on the part of coalition 

                troops has been shockingly inadequate and there are concerns that 

                the US forces may have used excessive force.The first taste of 

                the Coalition's approach to law and order will not have inspired 

                confidence in the Iraqi people," Amnesty International said. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"US authorities 

                should conduct an impartial, independent and thorough investigation 

                into the incidents to establish whether troops responded with 

                excessive use of force." </font>

                calls on the USA and the UK to deploy forces in sufficient numbers 

                and with the right training and equipment to restore law and order, 

                until Iraqi police forces can operate effectively. An effective 

                and fair vetting procedure for members of the Iraqi police forces 

                should be set up urgently, so as to reduce the chance of restoring 

                to their duties officials who may have been involved in human 

                rights violations. In exercising or supervising policing functions, 

                the USA and the UK must ensure that the rights of freedom of expression 

                and assembly are not arbitrarily restricted. </font>

                The Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by the Law 

                Enforcement Officials - including police and soldiers - require 

                that use of force and firearms should be a last resort, and used 

                "only if other means remain ineffective or without any promise 

                of achieving the desired result". (Principle 4) whenever force 

                or firearms are used this should be proportionate to the seriousness 

                of the offence and the legitimate objective to be achieved; and 

                minimize damage and injury. </font>
