                ashallal@cox.net Founder of Iraqi-Americans for Peaceful Alternatives, 

                Shallal said today: "People are happy not just because Saddam 

                is out, but also because they anticipate the end of 12 years of 

                economic sanctions and the bombing.... When I was a kid in Iraq, 

                we had coups and I would go out and jump in the street because 

                it was the coolest thing. It's like D.C. when the Redskins win 

                the Super Bowl. The problem is what comes after." </font>

                DANNY MULLER, vitw@vitw.org, <a href="http://www.iraqpeaceteam.org" target="_new">www.iraqpeaceteam.org</a> 

                They are coordinators of the Iraq Peace Team. Mostofi has been 

                in contact with members of the group still in Baghdad as well 

                as some who have left Iraq. Muller said: "For 12 years, the U.S. 

                government has repeatedly moved the goal posts for lifting the 

                economic sanctions, maintaining a situation of crushing poverty 

                no matter what Iraq did. These sanctions impoverished the people 

                and laid siege to the country, killing hundreds of thousands of 

                innocents and setting the stage for the current invasion. The 

                U.S. declared the end of the Gulf War in 1991, but that war never 

                ended. The economic strangulation of Iraq for 12 years has now 

                facilitated, after three weeks of bombing, the cessation of Iraqi 

                economic activity, the destruction of civilian infrastructure, 

                and a hostile situation where even the Red Cross has had to shut 

                down, causing further devastation to the Iraqi people. We cannot 

                allow the goal posts to continually be moved in order to secure 

                a U.S. occupation in the name of democracy." </font>

                rcdreyfuss@msn.com, <a href="http://www.prospect.org/authors/dreyfuss-r.html" target="_new">www.prospect.org/authors/dreyfuss-r.html</a> 

                Available for a limited number of interviews, Dreyfuss is author 

                of several articles on the future of Iraq for The American Prospect 

                magazine, including "Tinker, Banker, NeoCon, Spy: Ahmed Chalabi's 

                Long and Winding Road from (and to?) Baghdad," which documents, 

                among other things, Chalabi's being "sentenced to 22 years of 

                hard labor for embezzlement, fraud..." in 1989 by Jordan. Dreyfuss 

                is also author of a forthcoming article on Jay Garner, the retired 

                general and former president of weapons maker SY Technology who 

                is now slated to be the "civilian" head of Iraq. The article notes 

                Garner's ties to the Israeli military and his signing of a letter 

                in 2000 praising Israel's treatment of Palestinians. </font>

                The Corries are the parents of Rachel Corrie, who on March 16 

                was killed by an Israeli army bulldozer while she was trying to 

                prevent the demolition of a Palestinian home in the Gaza Strip. 

                Rachel was a volunteer with the International Solidarity Movement, 

                a group of Palestinian and international activists who use nonviolent, 

                direct-action methods of resistance to confront the Israeli occupation. 

                Today is Rachel's birthday and a bill has been introduced in Congress 

                regarding her death. The Corries said today: "Rachel wanted to 

                bring attention to the plight of the Palestinian people in the 

                Occupied Territories, a people she felt were largely invisible 

                to most Americans.... We continue to have grave concern for the 

                safety of Palestinians and for the international volunteers in 

                the Gaza Strip and West Bank." Another ISM volunteer, Brian Avery, 

                was shot in the face on Saturday by Israeli forces.
