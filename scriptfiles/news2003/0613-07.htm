On Saturday, the groups will host a 1 PM community rally to protest Ford's policies.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The inflatable dinosaur will be across from the Ford World HQ on Michigan Avenue with a banner that says, 'I love guzzling gas.' &quot;The best way for Ford Motor Company to avoid extinction is by making a commitment to producing more efficient vehicles,&quot; said Michael Brune, RAN Executive Director. &quot;Ford's financial crisis and environmental impact are inextricably linked. If Bill Ford Jr. hopes to save his company, he must make a commitment to make cleaner and more efficient cars and trucks.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There exists widespread support for a new generation of clean, efficient vehicles that could end America&sup1;s oil addiction. A poll conducted in 2001 found that 74 percent of Michigan voters, and 79 percent of UAW households, favor stricter fuel efficiency standards for both cars and trucks. The poll was conducted by Lake, Snell, Perry and Associates, a nationally known opinion research firm based in Washington, D.C.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ford has tried to position itself as an environmental leader while repeatedly breaking its commitments to produce cleaner and more efficient cars and trucks. The National Academy of Sciences concluded that current off-the-shelf technology could significantly boost fuel efficiency. Other studies have found that a jump to 40 mpg is easily achievable, and that a jump to 60 mpg is can be made with full hybrid engines.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;At the end of its first century, Ford has become the face of American oil addiction,&quot; said Jason Mark of human rights group Global Exchange. &quot;Unless the company does everything it can to break the American oil addiction, Ford won&sup1;t make it into the next.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rainforest Action Network is known for its &quot;market campaigns&quot;which have motivated major companies, including Burger King, Home Depot and Kinko's to adopt policies to protect the world&sup1;s rainforests and the rights of their traditional inhabitants through education, grassroots organizing and nonviolent direct action.</font></p>
