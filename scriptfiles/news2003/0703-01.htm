plans to open up Indonesian protected areas to mining companies, 

largely foreign multinationals. 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Parliamentarians were due to make a decision on this issue today and 

demonstrators are urging legislators not to allow mining in protected 

areas.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Besides our increasing numbers in Jakarta, we are joined by an 

upsurge of opposition from regional government and civil society 

elements including indigenous people's organisations throughout our 

archipelago&quot; said in the parliamentary forecourt Ms Siti Maimunah  from 

the Indonesian Mining Advocacy Network . </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;All of this should be enough to halt the government's search for 

loopholes to avoid protecting our forests and water catchments from 

destructive mining&quot; she added. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The protestors include contingents from Yogyakarta Province and civil 

society groups, academics and lawyers. Several thousand members of 

the public also signed postcards addressed to Indonesian government 

representatives expressing their opposition to mining in protected 

areas.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Mining in protected areas is a crime, say lawyers.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At a press conference held on July 2 in Jakarta a panel of 

environmental law experts and activists declared that Indonesian government plans to open up protected areas for mining were illegal.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Indonesian government has established a clear ban on open-cut 

mining in protected forests through the Forestry Law No.41 of 1999. 

Regardless of public outcry, the government is now searching for a 

loophole, and is attempting to use section 19 of the Forestry Law as a 

legal basis for changing the status of areas from protected forest to 

areas eligible for mining.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lawyer Ahmad Santosa of the Indonesian Center for Environmental 

Law explained that the process undertaken so far by the Indonesian 

government and House of Repsresentatives had no valid legal basis 

due to an absence of necessary government regulations.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The House of Representatives as the legislative body has an obligation 

to monitor the executive branch of government, and ensure compliance 

with the Forestry Law no.41 of 1999,&quot; stated Ahmad. In his opinion, 

threats from mining companies to take Indonesia to an international 

arbitration court over curtailing existing mining leases is no source for 

concern, because the government has the ultimate right to act in 

accordance with the public interest. Moreover, the international 

community has an obligation to protect Indonesian forests, described 

as &quot;lungs of the world&quot;.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to Chalid Muhammad of the Indonesian Mining Advocacy 

Network, the government is hell-bent on overturning protected forest 

status before the coming national elections in 2004. &quot;They're stubbornly trying to sell off Eastern Indonesia despite steadfast opposition, for 

example the Central Sulawesi government and House of 

Representatives have strongly rejected Rio Tinto and Newcrest's plans 

to mine protected areas&quot; he said. This is evidence that Jakarta's 

portrayal of regional opinion is not a true representation of their 

positions. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Australian embassy target of mining protest.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Scores of activists from student environment groups throughout 

Jakarta joined a coalition of environmental community groups who 

protested yesterday morning (2 July 2003) at the Australian Embassy in 

Jakarta. &quot;No to mining in protected forests!&quot; shouted Ms. Alien from 

Friends of the Earth Indonesia / WALHI. Protest banners and placards 

featuring kangaroos and the Australian flag were paraded in front of thefortified embassy fence, under the guard of a heavy security and police 

contingent.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Speakers addressing the crowd emphasised the extent of the threat 

with 11.4 million hectares of protected areas under mining leases. &quot;The 

granting of these mining permits opens the floodgates for 150 mines to 

wipe out our forests and mineral resources&quot; said M. Ridha Saleh, 

WALHI's Deputy Director. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The hour-long action was concluded with a theatrical performance by 

student environment groups, satirising the sell-off of Indonesia's forests 

to foreign mining interests. In the performance, the Indonesian people 

were represented as forest-based communities being marginalised and 

evicted by the government at the behest of lobbying by Australian, US 

and UK embassies.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Student environmentalist Mr Hardani explained his reasons for co- organising the demonstration: &quot;What will happen if we lose all our 

protected forests and are only left with poverty-inducing natural disasters?&quot; he asked.</font></p>
