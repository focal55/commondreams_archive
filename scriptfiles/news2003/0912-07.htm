The meeting will be held at 2 p.m. this afternoon at the Hyatt Regency in the Chetumal Room. This meeting exposes the corporate interests that drive US trade policy and the risks to communities at home and abroad from the WTO agenda.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Wal-Mart box stores drive suburban sprawl that is destroying the American landscape and reducing our quality of life.  The Bush agenda on trade in services increases risks to communities by making it harder to set smart growth standards to control 'Sprawl-Mart' development,&quot; said Daniel Seligman, director of the Sierra Club's Responsible Trade Program.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Wal-Mart has moved into Mexico with its' superstores, displacing thousands of small, locally-owned retail shops. The U.S. trade agenda fails to look first at the potential consequences of its trade policy on the poor in the U.S. and abroad&quot; noted Marceline White, director of the Women's Edge Coalition's Global Trade Program.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Workers and communities in the U.S. and around the world have seen the impact of companies like Wal-Mart, which has undermined working conditions, standards of living, and the basic human rights of workers,&quot; said Carin Zelenko, Director of Corporate and Strategic Initiatives for the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.  &quot;It's clear who is setting the trade policies here in Cancun - multinational corporations, not working families.&quot;</font></p>
