- May 5 - The following is a 

statement of Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids Kids Executive Director 

William V. Corr: 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By raising Georgia's cigarette tax by only 25 cents to 37 cents 

a pack, the Georgia Legislature has taken a small step forward, but 

fallen far short of the cigarette tax increase proposed by Gov. 

Perdue - and far short of what is best for Georgia and its kids. 

Higher cigarette taxes are a proven way to reduce smoking among 

both kids and adults, save lives and save millions of taxpayer 

dollars by reducing smoking-caused health care costs. Georgia 

would see even greater benefits if it raised the cigarette tax to 

87 cents - the amount recommended by public health advocates - or 

if they adopted Gov. Perdue's original proposal to raise the 

cigarette tax to 58 cents a pack. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By increasing the cigarette tax by 75 cents rather than 25 

cents, Georgia would have raised an additional $278 million 

annually in new revenues, prevented some 62,300 more kids from 

becoming smokers, saved 28,800 more residents from smoking-caused 

deaths, and produced $1 billion more in long-term health care 

savings. We urge Georgia's leaders to further increase the 

cigarette tax at the earliest opportunity. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With Georgia's new 25-cent increase, the state moves from having 

the 47th highest cigarette tax among the states to 33rd. Not only 

do 32-states maintain a higher tax, Georgia's ranking is likely to 

fall again later this year as other states increase their cigarette 

taxes. One prominent Merrill Lynch tobacco analyst estimates that 

21 states will raise their cigarette taxes this year, and that the 

national average will rise from 67 cents to 82 cents. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Georgia's increased tax on smokeless and other tobacco products 

is also a step forward, but more can be done to make this tax more 

proportionate to the cigarette tax. A parallel increase for other 

tobacco products discourages those who quit smoking or refrain from 

starting from using other tobacco products. Georgia has increased 

its smokeless and cigar tax to 10 percent of the sale price, but a 

17 percent tax would have made the price increases on other tobacco 

products match the price increases of cigarettes. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of death in 

Georgia, taking the lives of over 10,000 Georgians every year. 

More than 20,000 Georgia kids become regular daily smokers each 

year, and one-third of them will die a premature death from tobacco 

use. The state's annual tobacco-caused healthcare costs are $1.75 

billion. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Southern states in general, and tobacco producing states in 

particular, continue to have cigarette taxes that lag behind the 

rest of the nation. Excluding Georgia, the average tobacco tax 

among major tobacco producing states is only 7.5 cents per pack - 

almost 60 cents per pack less than the average among states. North 

Carolina, Kentucky and Virginia have rates of only five, three, and 

2.5 cents per pack respectively. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Tobacco states would obtain enormous benefits from raising their 

tobacco tax rates to the average. Studies show cigarette tax 

increases do not harm southern state economies. Revenue from a 

significant tax increase would far exceed the revenue currently 

being gained by low tax states through cross border sales. In 

addition, a tax increase will have little to no negative impact on 

tobacco farming communities.
