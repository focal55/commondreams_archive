- May 15 - Concerned Women for America 

(CWA) President Sandy Rios called on the Senate to pass the 

Hyde/Lantos global AIDS bill today without amendment, adding any 

delay would bring more death to Africa. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Men, women and children are dying in Africa; this is no time 

for political games" said Rios. "The House bill is already a 

compromise bill; it passed with overwhelming support. To delay the 

lifesaving assistance this bill provides would be to fiddle while 

Rome burns." 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since the House passed the Hyde/Lantos bill, an estimated 

112,000 people have died from AIDS; an estimated 182,000 have 

become infected; and an estimated 26,600 babies have been born with 

the virus. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Senator Majority Leader Bill Frist will bring the Hyde/Lantos 

bill to the floor today, May 15 -- and we expect the Senate to pass 

it today," said Michael Schwartz, CWA's vice president for 

government relations. "Any senator who tries to offer an amendment 

to this bill is choosing to create a huge delay -- not only in the 

Senate's deliberation today, but in a future conference committee. 

In the battle against AIDS, every delay equals death." 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CWA is thankful for President Bush's call to this mission and 

for the House's swift efforts to produce a bi-partisan Global AIDS 

bill that will save lives. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We know that some traditional AIDS activists and their allies 

in the Senate will want the bill killed because it contains the 

Pitts amendment, which reserves just one-third of prevention funds 

for abstinence programs," said Schwartz. "But abstinence was a key 

part of AIDS prevention in the only country in the world to lower 

HIV/AIDS rates, Uganda. These people need to face the reality of 

what works, and care more about the dying men, women and children 

of Africa than their failing pet projects."
