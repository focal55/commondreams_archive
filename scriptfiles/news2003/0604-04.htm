- June 4 - The Pew Oceans Commission released its recommendations for protecting and restoring U.S. coastlines and ocean environments. World Wildlife Fund (WWF) has marine experts who are available to discuss the recommendations of the Pew Oceans Commission and the plan's implications for U.S. policy.

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DAVID SANDALOW is executive vice president of WWF. Before coming to WWF, he served as Assistant Secretary of State for Oceans, Environment and Science. In this capacity, he helped manage U.S. diplomacy on a broad range of environmental and science issues.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Kudos to the Pew Commission," Sandalow said. "Its thorough and thoughtful report helps chart a course toward saving our oceans. The Commission's recommendations provide an invaluable guide for U.S. oceans policy and many ideas that can be used in saving oceans around the world."

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WILLIAM EICHBAUM is vice president of WWF's Endangered Spaces Program. Eichbaum has worked on marine matters for over twenty years beginning with the effort to restore the Chesapeake Bay during the 1980s and chaired a National Academy of Sciences committee which issued a major report in 1996 recommending strategies for improving the governance of the US marine waters.

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SCOTT BURNS is director of WWF's Marine Conservation Program. Burns is a former professor at the University of Maryland Law School where he was a faculty member of the university's coastal and environmental policy program.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The Pew report is the most forward-looking statement to date concerning the threats to America's seas and coasts," Burns said. "The same problems are undermining the integrity of marine ecosystems around the world. WWF will work to extend the ideas and proposed solutions in the Pew report to international waters in order to better protect the web of life in the global oceans."
