- September 17 - President Bush has just announced his support of an Air Force proposal to lease 100 Boeing 767 tanker aircraft  http://chicagobusiness.com/cgi-bin/news.pl?id=10097 - apparently rejecting a compromise plan offered by Senators John Warner and Carl Levin to reduce the scope of the lease and exposure to taxpayers.</font>

<p> </p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;This is the most obscene example of corporate welfare in recent memory,&#146;&#146; said POGO&#146;s Executive Director Danielle Brian. &#147;My head is spinning. First, the excuse for this plan was as a post 9/11 bailout for an already prosperous defense contractor, then it was billed as a national security issue. Now, the President is apparently supporting the plan as a jobs program.&#148;</font></p>

<p> </p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The tanker lease plan, which POGO has been investigating for the past 18 months, would cost the taxpayers $5.7 billion more than an outright purchase of the aircraft, according to the Congressional Budget Office. However, a Sept. 4, 2003 compromise of Senators Warner and Levin would scale back the number of aircraft to be leased from 100 to 25. But only after the following are completed: an analysis of alternatives to the leasing deal including consideration of other types of planes, a corrosion study of the current tanker fleet, and a GAO study of pricing data produced by the Institute for Defense Analysis. IDA said the tankers should cost $10 million less than the Air Force has agreed to pay Boeing.</font></p>

<p> </p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">President Bush&#146;s statement in support of the 100 tanker lease is obviously a response to months of behind-the-scenes lobbying by Boeing executives and a concerted effort by the company to contribute large sums to the campaign funds of key Senate and House leaders.</font></p>

<p> </p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;This is the latest desperate effort by the politically-connected Boeing Company, one of the most profitable companies in the U.S.,&#148; Brian said. &#147;This issue will come down to a litmus test for the Senate. A vote for this proposal is a vote against the taxpayer.&#148;</font></p>
