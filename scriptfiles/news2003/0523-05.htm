- May 23 - The National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty

today called upon Virginia Gov. Mark Warner to commute the death

sentence of Percy Walton, who is scheduled for execution Wednesday,

May 28. Walton, a black man, is scheduled to be executed despite

ample evidence of mental illness and mental retardation. In 1999,

a psychiatrist, a neuropsychologist, and a neurologist assessed

Walton's mental health, and found that he suffers from severe

chronic schizophrenia.

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While awaiting trial, Walton expressed his belief that he could not

be seen if he had his eyes closed. He also claimed he was Jesus Christ

and said that he looked forward to his execution because then he would 

be able to return to life and resurrect his dead family members.

One court-appointed psychologist considered Walton "imminently

dangerous to himself and others," and recommended that the state

move him to a secure psychiatric hospital.  

 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The execution of Percy Walton would represent a gross violation

of human rights," said Steven W. Hawkins, NCADP executive director.

"Governor Warner should consider Walton's diminished moral 

culpability as a result of his mental illness." 

 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Walton's attorneys have also brought forth evidence of mental

retardation, and have cited his IQ at 66, well below the standard

benchmark of 70. In 2002, the U.S. Supreme Court banned the

execution of people with mental retardation in Atkins v. Virginia.

Hawkins said Virginia now has a responsibility to evaluate inmates'

mental retardation claims. "Virginia must review each and every

mental retardation claim in light of the Atkins decision," he said.  

 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hawkins noted that in the past, Virginia governors have recognized

the issue of diminished moral culpability and considered it as a

factor in clemency decisions. In 1999, Virginia Gov. James Gilmore, a 

Republican, commuted Calvin Swann's death sentence on account of

his schizophrenia. "The tragic history of this case is similar to

Swann's, and Governor Warner should follow that precedent by using 

his executive authority to grant clemency to Percy Walton," Hawkins said. 

 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As a child, Walton was neat, polite, and popular, but began struggling

with his emotions and mental stability in his mid-teens. He stopped

bathing, attending school, and playing sports, and began talking to 

himself. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In October 1997, Walton pled guilty to the murders of Jessie and Elizabeth

Kendrick and Archie Moore in Danville. At his sentencing trial, his

state-appointed lawyer did not offer any evidence of mental illness

or mental retardation, despite the fact that Walton had repeatedly

misidentified his family members, expressed his opinion that he

would be released on bail, and referred to himself as a 

millionaire and a superhero.

 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hawkins said NCADP is urging its membership to contact Gov. Warner

through NCADP's new Legislative Action Center. To visit the

Legislative Action Center, go to <a href="http://www.ncadp.org" target="_new">www.ncadp.org</a></font>
