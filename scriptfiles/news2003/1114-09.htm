- November 14 -Commercial Alert sent a letter today to the &#147;Freedom to Advertise 
Coalition,&#148; regarding their opposition to disclosure of embedded advertising 
on television. </FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><BR>The 
&quot;Freedom To Advertise Coalition&quot; is composed of the American Advertising 
Federation, American Association of Advertising Agencies, Association of National 
Advertisers, Direct Marketing Association, Magazine Publishers of America, and 
Point-of-Purchase Advertising International.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><BR>The 
letter follows.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Dear 
Mr. Nirenberg and Ms. Farthing:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Today, 
the New York Times reported on letters that the &#147;Freedom to Advertise Coalition&#148; 
sent to the FCC and FTC about our request that TV stations disclose the ads they 
sneak into their programming. You called our request &#147;impractical,&#148; 
&#147;dangerous,&#148; &#147;extreme,&#148; &#147;radical,&#148; and that it &#147;borders 
on the ludicrous,&#148; and that it would make programming &#147;virtually unwatchable.&#148;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Your 
letter makes our point better than we ever could. Embedded advertising is now 
so common that it seems TV networks want to turn television into an infomercial-delivery 
mechanism.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">If 
a little honesty will ruin television that does not say much for television, does 
it?</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">You can complain 
all you want, but the law is the law. Since 1927, listeners have had the right 
to know who is trying to persuade or influence them. In a democracy, that is an 
important right. Maybe ad agencies don&#146;t care very much about democracy. 
We do.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">You resort 
to a high-sounding defense of product placement as &#147;art.&#148; You claim 
that for broadcasters to level with their audiences on these stealth ads would 
&#147;pose a threat to artistic freedom.&#148; You portray the ad agencies that 
arrange these stealth ads as the &#147;'front line' in the protection of our Constitutional 
rights.&#148; You say that people who expect a little honesty in the media &#147;seek 
to extinguish the free speech rights of those who wish to communicate via these 
means.&#148; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Nice 
try. But infomercials are advertisements. American Idol was an advertisement for 
Coca-Cola. The Restaurant was an advertisement for Coors. When a corporation pays 
money to have its product shown on television in an attractive setting, that&#146;s 
an advertisement.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">You 
say that you stand for &#147;freedom.&#148; But freedom would mean the freedom 
not to drink or show a Coke. It would mean the freedom to drink something else 
&#150; some water perhaps -- or nothing at all, if the actor and director so desired. 
Do they have this freedom?</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">We 
understand that many in the advertising industry have a tough time looking themselves 
in the mirror. We know this because they have said so themselves. We understand 
why they might like to think of themselves as &#147;artists,&#148; and why you, 
their lawyer, would choose to portray them this way. We have no doubt either that 
many bring great skill and creativity to their work.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">But 
an ad is an ad, and dishonesty is dishonesty; and ads must be disclosed as ads. 
No amount of legal fancy dancing can change that.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Sincerely,</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Gary
