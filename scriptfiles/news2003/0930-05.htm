- September 30 - Commercial Alert today requested the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Trade Commission to require prominent disclosure of embedded advertising on television, including product placement, product integration, plot placement, title placement, paid spokespersons and virtual advertising.  Increasingly, programs with these embedded ads resemble infomercials.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Commercial Alert&#146;s petition to the FCC contains a request for a rule-making to require conspicuous and concurrent disclosure of embedded ads on TV, a complaint against TV networks for failure to comply with federal sponsorship identification requirements, and a request for investigation of current product placement practices on TV. Commercial Alert also asked the FTC to investigate TV product placement practices, and to issue new guidelines for disclosure of TV product placement.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Embedded advertising is the new reality of television, and it is time for the Commission to address it.  TV networks and stations regularly send programs into American living rooms that are packed with product placements and other veiled commercial pitches.  But they pretend that these are just ordinary programming rather than paid ads.  This is an affront to basic honesty,&#148; wrote Commercial Alert in its petition to the FCC.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;To prevent stealth advertising, and ensure that viewers are fully aware of the efforts of advertisers to embed ads in programming, the Commission should require TV networks and stations to prominently disclose to viewers that their product placements are ads.  In addition, product placements should be identified when they occur.&#148;</font></p>
