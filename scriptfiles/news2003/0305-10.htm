                - March 5 - A delegation led by Green Members of European Parliaments 

                brings an appeal to the U.N., to the U.S. government, and to the 

                American people: Stop the invasion!"We welcome the delegation 

                organized by European Greens to the United States, and we thank 

                them for their hard efforts, organizing work, and influence in 

                their respective legislatures in order to avert the impending 

                invasion of Iraq," said Annie Goeke, co-chair of the International 

                Committee of the Green Party of the United States. "Those of us 

                in the U.S. who oppose the war need all the help we can get in 

                trying to stop George W. Bush's war for oil and empire!" </font>

                D.C. on Tuesday, March 4 by Goeke and Dean Myerson, political

                from 11 member states of the European Union traveled to New York 

                and Washington in a last-ditch attempt to get the message to the

                and must be prevented. </font>

                from nearly 20 countries, the European delegation visited U.N. 

                General Secretary Kofi Annan, Chief Weapons Inspector Hans Blix, 

                U.N. ambassadors from various countries, and members of Congress. 

                On Monday evening, Daniel Cohn-Bendit, co-leader of the Green 

                Party caucus in the European Parliament debated Richard Perle, 

                a Bush Administration foreign policy advisor, in an event hosted

                of the U.N. Charter says, 'All members shall settle their international 

                disputes by peaceful means,'" said Jo Chamberlain, a California 

                Green and member of the national steering committee of the Green 

                Party of the United States. "The U.N.'s mission is not to rubberstamp 

                military aggression, but to prevent war. Greens are holding out 

                hope that the war can be prevented." </font>

                Thursday morning, the European Green officials will meet with 

                organizers of the American peace movement and anti-war demonstrations. 

                The press conference is scheduled for 11:00 a.m. at the European 

                Commission, 2300 M Street, N.W. Some of the visiting Greens will 

                join the peace vigil in front of the White House, along with Green 

                Party member Medea Benjamin of Code Pink, Women for Peace, and

                Lavender Green Caucus delegate to the party's national committee. 

                "But Europe and the rest of the world have begun to see a similar 

                movement taking hold in the U.S. The Green Party is the political 

                face of that movement." </font>

                Organization estimates that 100,000 Iraqi civilians may be wounded 

                and another 400,000 hit by disease after water, sewage and food 

                supplies are bombed, and that 3.6 million Iraqis will likely need 

                emergency shelter. Greens, along with other opponents of the war 

                throughout the world, argue that a 'preemptive' invasion of Iraq 

                would constitute an international crime against humanity and a 

                violation of the Geneva Conventions. Green Party members in the 

                U.S. have participated in the numerous rallies, demonstrations, 

                acts of civil disobedience, and other actions in protest of the 

                President's war plans. </font>
