- June 6 - Today, the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) asked   Federal Judge John Gleeson for leave to add claims, defendants and new facts to a federal lawsuit charging the U.S. with violating the civil rights of post 9/11 INS detainees.  The request comes in the wake of the release of a scathing report detailing the Department of Justice’s mistreatment of non-citizens detained on immigration charges after the September 11 attacks.  The report, which was released on June 2 by the Inspector General of the Justice Department (OIG), confirms and goes beyond the allegations made in the CCR lawsuit. (Turkmen v. Ashcroft.)

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jeffrey Fogel, Legal Director of the Center for Constitutional Rights, said: “The OIG report confirms that hundreds of people's lives were destroyed by the Justice Department. The government may assert that this was simply another instance of collateral damage in its war against terrorism.  That is unacceptable, for as the report amply demonstrates, the government mistreated hundreds of routine immigration violators with no connection to terrorism.”

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In April of 2002 CCR brought the civil rights class action suit on behalf of non-citizens without terrorist ties who were arrested shortly after the September 11 terrorist attacks and held for extended periods of time at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan and/or the Passaic County Jail in New Jersey on minor immigration violations.  The suit seeks a court order declaring the Justice Department’s mistreatment of these September 11 detainees – holding them in detention until cleared by the FBI of terrorist ties without due process of law and subjecting them to harmful and restrictive prison conditions – to be unconstitutional, and requiring the government to conform its policies to the Constitution’s requirements.  The suit also seeks money damages on behalf of the plaintiffs.

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report of the Inspector General, entitled “The September 11 Detainees:  A Review of the Treatment of Aliens Held on Immigration Charges in Connection with the Investigation of the September 11 Attacks,” provides a wealth of previously unknown details that substantiate CCR’s allegation that a class of male Arab and/or Muslim nationals from South Asian and Middle Eastern countries having no ties to terrorism were wrongfully arrested and detained as individuals “of interest” to the government’s terrorism investigation and subjected to an array of unconstitutional policies.  As the Report describes, the FBI pursued terrorism leads that were often the product of racial and ethnic stereotyping and it arrested persons encountered by chance who were found in violation of the immigration laws.  Detainees “of interest” – a loose category that included detainees for whom the FBI did not state whether or not it in fact had an interest  – were categorically denied bond, without regard to evidence of danger or flight risk, and held without bond until the FBI cleared them of any connection to terrorism.  Virtually everyone detained – including all of the Plaintiffs – was in fact cleared of any terrorist connections.  This “clearance” process dragged on for an average of 80 days and as long as 244 days.

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CCR Senior Staff Attorney Nancy Chang, stated: “The Inspector General presents a disturbing roadmap of how the Department of Justice –whose duty is to defend the laws – brushed aside the Constitution after the September 11 attacks by holding hundreds of Muslim men having no terrorist ties in prolonged detention under a “hold until cleared” policy.  The Center hopes that, through the Turkmen suit, the Justice Department’s actions will be examined in greater detail and that the court will order policy changes that guard against future resort to the disgraceful practice of preventive detention.”

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CCR Deputy Legal Director Barbara Olshansky added that she was dismayed that in responding to the OIG Report Ashcroft expressed regret for the extra cost associated with these lengthy detentions.  He made no mention of the cost to the civil liberties of the people detained.
