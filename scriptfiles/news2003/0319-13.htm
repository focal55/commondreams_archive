                - March 19 - Following is a letter from Ralph Nader to President 

                Bush on the use of cluster bombs and landmines in Iraq: </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dear President 

                Bush: </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In your March 

                17 address declaring your intention, assuming Saddam's unwillingness 

                to go into exile, to take the nation to war with Iraq, you directed 

                comments to the Iraqi people. You stated, "If we must begin a 

                military campaign, it will be directed against the lawless men 

                who rule your country and not against you." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The way the 

                U.S. military under your command and the U.S. allies conduct the 

                war will test the sincerity of this claim. U.S. military officials 

                have already conceded that the war will inevitably take a substantial 

                number of civilian lives. While there is little doubt of the brutal 

                dictator Saddam's willingness to sacrifice his people's lives, 

                your decisions over military tactics will be a major determinant 

                of the extent of the civilian carnage. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Having determined 

                to proceed with a war that violates international law on use of 

                force and without a constitutionally required Congressional declaration 

                of war, it is now incumbent on you to conduct the war according 

                to international humanitarian and human rights law, and to take 

                all possible measures to avoid loss of civilian life, especially 

                the lives of children. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among other 

                steps, you must renounce the use of cluster bombs and landmines 

                in the coming conflict. These are weapons that take a devastating 

                toll on civilians, and continue to kill and maim long after the 

                military hostilities in which they are used have ended. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Landmines have 

                been subjected to an international treaty, which the United States 

                has refused to sign, which bars their use. These weapons are also 

                arguably barred by international customary law, since those deploying 

                them are inherently unable to discriminate in application, especially 

                over time, between combatants and civilians. These weapons are 

                indisputably particularly gruesome in their impact, with civilians 

                including children the vast majority of victims. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cluster bombs 

                deploy numerous bomblets, a significant number of which fail to 

                explode. The unexploded bomblets then function as de facto anti-personnel 

                mines, again with the greatest toll among civilians, including 

                children. According to Human Rights Watch, "more than 1,600 Kuwaiti 

                and Iraqi civilians have been killed, and another 2,500 injured, 

                by the estimated 1.2 million cluster bomb duds left following 

                the 1991 Persian Gulf War, which saw the most extensive use of 

                cluster bombs in history." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mr. President, 

                given your decision in the name of the American people to embark 

                on a discretionary war of choice against Iraq, the very least 

                that you owe the Iraqi people is a commitment not to use weaponry 

                that poses special dangers to civilians, during military conflict 

                and in the period after hostilities have ceased. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Before the 

                bombing begins, you should publicly detail the specific commitments 

                the United States will make to spare the loss of life in the course 

                of the war-invasion against Iraq, and the steps our nation will 

                take to protect Iraqi populations after the war from the chaos, 

                anarchy and grave humanitarian crisis likely to ensue. First on 

                the list should be a public pledge not to use landmines or cluster 

                bombs, indiscriminate weapons that steal limbs, senses and lives 

                from innocents even more effectively than from combatants. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sincerely, 

                Ralph Nader
