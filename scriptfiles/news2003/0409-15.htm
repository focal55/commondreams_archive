                - April 9 - U.S. military officials should order a chaplain in 

                Iraq to stop offering food and fresh water for bathing to soldiers 

                in exchange for being baptized and listening to his sermons, Americans 

                United for Separation of Church and State told the Army today.</font> 

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Americans 

                  United has asked the Army to rein in the activities of Chaplain 

                  Josh Llano at Camp Bushmaster in Iraq. On April 4, the Miami 

                  Herald reported that Llano bragged about enticing soldiers to 

                  become baptized by offering them clean water in his baptismal 

                  font.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;It&#146;s 

                  simple,&#148; Llano said. &#147;They want water. I have it, 

                  as long as they agree to get baptized.&#148;</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The newspaper 

                  reported that before going through the hour-long baptism, the 

                  soldiers must agree to listen to Llano, who calls himself a 

                  &#147;Southern Baptist evangelist,&#148; deliver a 90-minute 

                  sermon. Llano admitted that some of the soldiers might just 

                  want the opportunity to take a bath but added, &#147;Regardless 

                  of their motives, I get the chance to take them closer to the 

                  Lord.&#148;</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Llano also 

                  added that if portable showers are installed in the area, he 

                  plans to bribe soldiers with scarce fruit and juice boxes.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Chaplain 

                  Llano&#146;s actions are unconstitutional and unacceptable,&#148; 

                  said the Rev. Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans 

                  United. &#147;Our soldiers in Iraq have suffered enough hardships 

                  without having religious coercion piled on. It&#146;s time for 

                  Llano to be shipped back home.&#148;</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In an April 

                  9 letter to Army officials, AU Legal Director Ayesha Khan and 

                  Litigation Counsel Ilana R. Fisher asked that Llano immediately 

                  be told to cease and desist.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The AU legal 

                  team noted that chaplains are supposed to provide a variety 

                  of religious services to soldiers, not engage in proselytism.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Especially 

                  at this time, it is imperative to be sensitive to the physical, 

                  emotional and spiritual needs of all our soldiers regardless 

                  of faith,&#148; observes the letter. &#147;In fact, that is 

                  one of the requirements of the job description of an army chaplain. 

                  According to the U.S. Army Chaplain Corps, a chaplain is required 

                  to be &#145;[s]ensitive to religious pluralism and able to provide 

                  for the free exercise of religion by all military personnel, 

                  their family members and civilians who work for the Army.&#146; 

                  Chaplain Llano's actions do not exemplify this commitment to 

                  religious pluralism and are therefore not in the best interest 

                  of our troops.&#148;</font></p>
