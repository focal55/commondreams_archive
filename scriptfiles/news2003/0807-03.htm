Starting on Monday, August 18, he'll take his uniquely optimistic message of grassroots politics to audiences across the country with a 25-city tour.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Click <a href="http://www.jimhightower.com/road/" target="_new">here</a> to view Hightower's upcoming tour schedule, which includes stops in New York, Boston, Washington DC, San Francisco, Seattle, Portland, Los Angeles, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Philadelphia and Austin, Texas .</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In every town, Hightower will be collaborating with local grassroots activist groups to raise awareness on key issues, plus he'll be teaming with TrueMajority and GOTV organizers to channel energy from the crowds into direct political action.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This book is a rallying cry to take our country back from the corporate and political kleptocrats that are squeezing the heart out of our America -- small businesses, middle-class workers, family farmers, and other enterprising, grassroots folks,&quot; Hightower says.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;My hope is that THIEVES IN HIGH PLACES will awaken readers not only to what we're losing in America, but more importantly, to the phenomenal future we have if we only reassert our democratic values and focus on our grassroots strength,&quot; he says. &quot;My basic message is one of hope, that individual citizens can make a difference.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">America is at an historic divide between rulers and rulees&#139;and the rulees are restless.  Hightower&sup1;s THIEVES IN HIGH PLACES is an epistle to the American people about vision and choices.  The question Jim Hightower is asking is: What kind of country do you want America to be? Not only for you, but for your children&#138;and theirs?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In THIEVES IN HIGH PLACES Hightower takes on the Bushites, the Wobblycrats, and the corporate Kleptocrats, digging up behind-the scenes dirt that the corporate media overlooks&#139;like BushCo&sup1;s &quot;Friday Night Massacres&quot;, what&sup1;s happened to our food, and the Bush plan for empire. Hightower exposes invasions of privacy, the military budget (and where the money is going), sprawl, deregulation, and how Wal-Mart has reshaped the American business landscape (not for the better) and shows us how a small yet powerful elite in our country have taken control of the small farmers, main street businesses, consumers, the working class and the poor.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But it is not all bad news, THIEVES IN HIGH PLACES highlights the grassroots organizations that are making a difference in this country, standing up to corporations, fighting to keep libraries open and taking on Wal-Mart. Drawing on his Rolling Thunder Down-Home Democracy Tour, Hightower continues to tap into the thriving activist networks that are our country&sup1;s grassroots muscle, and his book tells their uplifting stories of retaking control of their communities and how to turn our complaining into positive reforms.</font></p>
