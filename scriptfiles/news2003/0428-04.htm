- April 28 - A newly-formed 

group, calling itself Arab-American Republicans Against Bush 

(AARAB.org), will deliver a message to President Bush at his 

Dearborn, Mich. appearance today. Photo ops and hollow words are 

not enough to garner the community's support in his 2004 

re-election bid. Arab-Americans gave critical votes and 

financial support to George W. Bush in key electoral states in 

2000. Next time around, community leaders say their 

disappointment in the president's handling of critical domestic 

and foreign policy issues will lead them in another direction. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We were lied to, plain and simple,&quot; said AARAB.org founder 

Khalid Turaani. &quot;In 2000, Bush came to us with promises of 

inclusion, integrity and responsibility in policies of particular 

concern to Arab-Americans. Over the past two years, we've been 

treated to ethnic profiling, detention without trial, INS 

dragnets, the closing of our community institutions and a foreign 

policy that seems designed to keep America at perpetual war with 

the Arab world. Arab-Americans deserve better. All Americans 

deserve better,&quot; he said. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Key to the group's opposition to Bush's reelection is the 

overwhelming influence being exerted by neo-conservatives and 

Christian-rightists. The president's unwillingness to distance 

himself publicly from their racist agenda has led many former 

Bush supporters within the Arab-American community to doubt the 

president's contention that his war on terrorism is not a war on 

Islam. &quot;When Franklin Graham, a man who calls Islam an &quot;evil and 

wicked&quot; religion, is invited to offer the Good Friday prayer 

service at the Pentagon, that tells us how Islam is viewed by 

this Administration,&quot; Turaani added. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Shock waves were sent throughout the Arab-American community 

when Bush recently nominated Daniel Pipes to the board of the 

U.S. Institute of Peace (USIP), a federal taxpayer-funded 

institution created by Congress to promote the peaceful 

resolution of international conflicts. Pipes advocates that 

Israel &quot;raze&quot; Palestinian villages, and in a post-9/11 interview 

he said, &quot;What we need to do is snarl, not be nice. What we need 

to do is inspire fear, not affection.&quot; He openly supports the 

profiling of Arabs and Muslims and has refused to condemn the 

internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II. Bush's 

selection of Pipes for USIP's board signaled a victory for those 

pushing the U.S. toward an unending, and wholly contrived, clash 

of civilizations with the Arab and Muslim worlds. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AARAB.org also notes the president's trampling of America's 

democracy as a key factor in their opposition. &quot;In the name of 

democracy, Bush waged a war of aggression that the majority of 

Americans did not support. In the name of security, he stripped 

us of our civil liberties and constitutional rights. He has made 

Americans less free, less safe and more resented around the 

world. America cannot afford to risk the damage he and his 

cronies could do with another four years in office. AARAB.org 

pledges to mobilize against Bush's reelection on behalf of all 

Americans and in support of true American values. I came to 

Dearborn in 2000 to campaign for President Bush. Today, I come 

with the many voices of AARAB.org to right that wrong,&quot; Turaani 

concluded. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>AARAB.org is a grassroots initiative begun by Arab-American 

Republicans committed to mobilizing against the re-election of 

George W. Bush. AARAB.org will work with a broad coalition of 

groups who want a better choice for all Americans in 2004. </i></font></p>
