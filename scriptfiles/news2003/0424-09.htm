Mesler is a former editor at the <I>Korea Economic 

Journal</I> and writes on Korea for a number of outlets. He said today: "The 

apparent stall in talks between the United States and North Korea threatens to 

undermine the tremendous progress towards a peaceful solution on the Korean 

peninsula, progress that had netted South Korean President Kim Dae-Jung a Nobel 

Peace Prize. It's easy to cast all the blame at North Korea; but the truth is 

the Bush administration has never been happy with the historic 1994 agreement 

the Clinton administration had reached with the North Koreans that led to the 

dismantling of the North Korean nuclear weapons program. While we've heard a 

constant refrain of North Korean violations, most of which have later proved 

untrue or exaggerated, there has been little mention of the many U.S. violations 

that began as soon as the Bush administration took office, including the failure 

to complete the building of two light-water reactors and to move to a full 

normalization of the relationship. It is hard now to see how Pyongyang will give 

up the nuclear card so long as the administration refuses even to guarantee that 

it will not attack North Korea. This administration's hard-line position ... 

will harden the North Korean regime's attitude toward the outside world, denying 

the North Korean people the chance for a better life that peaceful engagement 

with the West -- and rapprochement with South Korea -- would ultimately 

bring...."

<LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CHERYL RUBENBERG, <A HREF="mailto:mrubenberg@pol.net">mrubenberg@pol.net</A><BR>

Author of the forthcoming <I>The Palestinians in Search of a 

Just Peace</I> and several other books on the conflict, including <I>Palestinian 

Women</I>, Rubenberg lived in the occupied territories from 1997 to 1999. She 

said today: "I don't think people in the U.S. generally understand the 

situation. Not only is Israel not committed to peace, it does a lot of things to 

block peace. The settlements, road building on occupied territory have made a 

real peace virtually impossible. The West Bank has been sliced up into some 64 

cantons, so contrary to what Bush says, a 'viable state' has been gutted by 

Israel. It is no longer that Palestinian towns surround Israeli settlements; 

now, Israeli roads, settlements and infrastructure surround Palestinian towns. 

There is not only resentment among Palestinians against Israel, but Palestinians 

are also angry at the Palestinian Authority, which has been very corrupt. 

Mahmoud Abbas has a multimillion-dollar mansion in Gaza, one of the poorest 

places on earth. Clearly, his appointment as Prime Minister is the result of the 

Palestinian Authority capitulating to the U.S. and Israel, which are now 

choosing leaders for the Palestinians -- and all the while Bush is talking about 

democracy in the region. Abbas has hardly been a popular figure, pulling about 3 

percent in opinion polls, as opposed to about 30 percent for Arafat -- though 

the Palestinians are skeptical of all leaders.... There is open talk of 

'transfer' of Palestinians in the Israeli press -- that is ethnic cleansing of 

Palestinians. Even if that does not occur, the dire economic situation and the 

sheer difficulty of ordinary life forced on Palestinians by Israel are causing 

many of them to leave...."
