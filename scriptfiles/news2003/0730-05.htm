- July 29 - The Senate today gave the Bush Administration and auto industry increased power to hold up progress on fuel economy standards. The Sierra Club criticized the Senate for doing nothing to save consumers money at the pump, reduce America's oil dependence and reduce global warming pollution. Instead, Senators passed a sham amendment proposed by Senators Carl Levin (D-MI) and Kit Bond (R-MO).</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Senate voted for the irresponsible Levin-Bond amendment, allowing the Bush Administration to deepen our oil dependence. The Senate failed to pass an amendment to significantly improve the fuel economy of cars and light trucks introduced by Senator Richard Durbin (D-IL).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;In handing our nation's energy security over to the auto industry, the Senate bowed to the pressure of the Bush Administration working in cahoots with the auto industry,&quot; said Daniel F. Becker, Director of Sierra Club's Global Warming and Energy Program.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Levin-Bond amendment leaves the fuel economy and safety issue to the Department of Transportation's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) without providing them with a target for oil savings. NHTSA has failed to effectively implement fuel economy regulations and enforce auto safety standards for the last 25 years. Indeed, average fuel economy of 2002 model year vehicles is the lowest since 1980. The Administration's close ties to the auto-industry, including Chief of Staff Andrew Card's previous position as chief lobbyist for General Motors, are further indications that NHTSA will do little to increase CAFE standards. The Bush Administration's recent announcement of a small 1.5 mpg increase in light truck fuel economy standards shows that it is not serious about cutting our oil use.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Senate ignored a chance to make real progress in reducing our oil dependence, saving consumers money, and cutting global warming pollution,&quot; said Gary Skulnik, Washington Representative on Sierra Club's Global Warming and Energy Program.  &quot;The American people demand better from our Senators than this irresponsible vote to elevate the auto industry's short-term interests over Americans' safety and energy security.&quot;
