                FLORIDA - February 1 - In mourning the tragedy of the Columbia 

                shuttle, the Global Network Against Weapons &amp; Nuclear Power 

                In Space stresses that it came as NASA has been moving to greatly 

                expand its program to use nuclear power in space and underscores 

                why deadly atomic materials must not be used in space operations.

                <p></p>

                <p>In what it calls <b>Project Prometheus</b> , NASA seeks to 

                  broaden its $1 billion <b>Nuclear Systems Initiative</b> begun 

                  last year and include development of a nuclear-propelled rocket.</p>

                <p>Moreover, NASA is planning for additional nuclear-powered space 

                  probe launches and to put atomic power to other space uses, 

                  noted Global Network Coordinator Bruce Gagnon.</p>

                <p>“While Columbia did not appear to have a nuclear payload on-board, 

                  consider the consequences if a rocket powered by a nuclear reactor 

                  came down in pieces over Texas or elsewhere on earth,” said 

                  Professor Karl Grossman, professor of journalism at the State 

                  University of New York and author of <i>“The Wrong Stuff: The 

                  Space Program’s Nuclear Threat To Our Planet,”</i> narrator 

                  of <i>“Nukes In Space”</i> television documentaries and a Global 

                  Network board member.</p>

                <p>In coming months—in May and June -- NASA intends to launch 

                  from Florida two rockets both carrying rovers to land on Mars, 

                  rovers that are equipped with plutonium-powered heaters. The 

                  Global Network has been conducting demonstrations to protest 

                  these launches.</p>

                <p>Gagnon points out that NASA’s own Environmental Impact Statement 

                  (EIS) says that “the overall chance of an accident occurring” 

                  for each launch “is about 1 in 30” and&nbsp;&quot;the overall 

                  chance of any accident that releases radioactive materials to 

                  the environment is about one in 230. &quot;People offsite in 

                  the downwind direction...could inhale small quantities of radio 

                  nuclides&quot; the NASA EIS says.</p>

                <p>“These are high odds for disaster which could impact—as NASA 

                  admits—on people as far as 60 miles from the Kennedy Space Center 

                  in Florida,” said Gagnon.</p>

                <p>“These and other NASA space shots involving materials must 

                  be cancelled in the wake of the Columbia disaster and safe space 

                  energy systems be used instead,” stressed Gagnon.</p>

                <p>Said Grossman: “Space exploration is dangerous but to include 

                  nuclear poisons in the equation makes any accident far, far 

                  more deadly—and it is unnecessary. In recent years there have 

                  been breakthroughs in energizing space systems safely especially 

                  through the use of solar technologies. But NASA under Director 

                  Sean O'Keefe is partnering with nuclear interests to heavily 

                  nuclearize U.S. space operations. The Columbia disaster must 

                  show us the awful folly of this atomic space path.”</p>

                <p>In recent years Congress has cut funding for the space program 

                  (in particular funding for shuttle maintenance) and NASA has 

                  turned to the Pentagon for&nbsp;financing of many of its missions. 

                  NASA’s O’Keefe said upon taking the helm of the space agency 

                  that all future missions will be dual use – with the military 

                  now in control of the space program.</p>

                <p>Loring Wirbel, a technical editor and Global Network board 

                  member based in Colorado, stressed that “the shuttle accident 

                  occurring on re-entry, which is always been touted as much safer 

                  than launch, should serve as proof that NASA's planned nuclear 

                  propulsion program is far too dangerous to be considered.”</p>

                <p>Also, “the hazards involved in aggressive space use also suggest 

                  that broader military use of space for first strike warfare 

                  or weapons in space is a dangerous game,” said Wirbel.</p>
