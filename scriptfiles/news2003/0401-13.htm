                - April 1 - The Bush administration recently added a new tool 

                to its anti-environmental kit that could significantly change 

                the way the government assesses and regulates environmental threats. 

                The tool is a biased form of cost-benefit analysis that makes 

                regulations appear less worthwhile by lowering the hypothetical 

                monetary value of human life. Senior citizens are particularly 

                at risk under this new approach, since many of the techniques 

                can be used specifically to discount the life of the elderly when 

                regulating some of the greatest threats to their health, such 

                as air pollution. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Recently the 

                administration has used this analysis in new air pollution control 

                rules and proposed legislation that cater to industrial polluters 

                at the expense of public health. Last fall, the Environmental 

                Protection Agency featured this "alternative" analysis in its 

                support documentation for the administration's air pollution legislation 

                for power plants (<a href="http://www.nrdc.org/air/pollution/fclearsk.asp" target="_new">click 

                here</a> for NRDC's view of this legislation), and in its final 

                rule for off-road engines like the ones used in snowmobiles. Both 

                of these proposals would not adequately protect the public from 

                soot, smog and other dangerous pollutants. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This novel 

                approach was so tilted that the level of benefits calculated under 

                this method was more than 90 percent less than under the usual 

                EPA method, falling from the previously accepted standard value 

                of $6.1 million per life saved to less than half a million dollars 

                for many fatalities. What is more unsettling is that most of the 

                reduction in benefits was due to lowering the estimate of the 

                value of saving a human life, not to a change in the estimate 

                of the number of lives that would be saved. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To lower the 

                estimate for the value of lives saved under these proposals, the 

                White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) had EPA reduce 

                its established value through a series of steps. One of the most 

                startling steps was to count the value of saving the lives of 

                Americans over 70-years old as worth only 63 percent of the standard 

                value assigned to people under 70 -- a percentage based on a flawed 

                concept and an unsuitable study. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The main administration 

                proponent for this kind of slanted analysis is John Graham, head 

                of the OMB office that reviews regulations (see this profile from 

                the Spring 2003 issue of NRDC's OnEarth Magazine). In October 

                2001, Graham recommended that the National Academy of Sciences 

                consider using a related calculus, called Quality Adjusted Life 

                Years (QALY), when evaluating air pollution policies. The theory 

                behind QALY is that the value of saving someone's life should 

                be adjusted downward the older and more infirm he or she gets. 

                But the theory behind QALY conflicts with more valid empirical 

                studies that show that as people get older they do not value their 

                lives any less than they did when they were younger. In any case, 

                it is objectionable on its face if one believes in equal protection 

                for all members of society. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">More recently, 

                Graham and OMB have proposed fundamental changes to the guidelines 

                that agencies follow when conducting their reviews of the costs 

                and benefits of regulations. One of the more notable recommended 

                changes would have agencies shift from the standard statistical 

                measure for the value of a life to a different concept, the Value 

                of a Statistical Life-Year (VSLY). Like QALY, the concept of VSLY 

                is biased against the elderly because it lowers the value of saving 

                a life based largely on the numbers of years a person has left 

                to live. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Seniors are 

                not the only people whose lives would be cheapened by the Bush 

                administration's new approach. Other administration techniques 

                could apply to everyone. They include selectively excluding studies 

                that heighten the estimate of people's willingness to pay for 

                protection (in this case wage-risk studies) and discounting the 

                value of saving people from cancer and other kinds of illnesses 

                that are not immediately fatal. The administration also is only 

                considering alternative techniques that would lower the value 

                of life instead of approaches that might raise the standard estimate, 

                such as shifting from assessments based on a current "willingness 

                to pay" for safeguards to approaches based on a "willingness-to-accept" 

                harms or risks. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The blatant 

                one-sidedness of the administration's approach reveals its intention 

                to only use methods that ratchet down the value of life to reduce 

                the perceived benefits of regulation, and thereby minimize the 

                steps industry must take to clean up pollution. Although the EPA 

                claims that it ultimately did not use this biased approach in 

                setting its standard for off-road engines, nothing prevents it 

                from doing so in the future. Indeed the presence of this alternative 

                analysis, however distorted, becomes a convenient hook for legal 

                and legislative action hostile to environment protection. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The implications 

                of discounting lives are quite significant. If, for example, the 

                government decided the value of life is now worth less than a 

                tenth of what is used to be, policymakers could decide to allow 

                10 times as many deaths from environmental pollution -- claiming 

                the "benefits" were unchanged -- to keep costs down for industry. 

                Such a review procedure could block federal agencies from adopting 

                meaningful standards for a range of pollutants, and even set the 

                stage for agencies to weaken effective environmental protections 

                that are already in place. </font>
