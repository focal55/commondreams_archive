                - April 3 - Franciscans International (FI) today, delivered a 

                statement before the UN Commission on Human Rights, urging the 

                Government of Indonesia to: “stop at once” all efforts to create 

                paramilitary groups in Papua, open a political dialogue on history 

                of Papuan integration, restore the national and international 

                legal standards, safeguard freedom of expression and constructively 

                join in peace efforts. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The statement, 

                delivered by Br. Theo van den Broek OFM, a Franciscan friar from 

                Indonesia and Director of the Office for Justice and Peace for 

                the Diocese of Jayapura, detailed the Papuan people’s “collective 

                memory of 40 years of oppression and denial of their human rights, 

                dignity and fundamental freedoms by the Government of Indonesia,” 

                including: </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Denial their 

                right of self-determination since the 1960s, </font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Racial 

                and ethnic discrimination, their treatment as a ‘primitive’ people, 

                Exploitation and expropriation of ancestral lands through the 

                imposition of development policies, Detention, torture and extrajudicial 

                killings for political beliefs and opinions expressed, and Absence 

                of justice for victims of abuses and impunity. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Additionally, 

                  FI called attention to the “disturbing role” of the military 

                  in Papua, citing the ineffective control of civilian authorities, 

                  the organizing and training of paramilitary groups and the combination 

                  of economic interests with military objectives. </font> </p>

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1969, West 

                Papua officially became a province of Indonesia. Since then, Papuans 

                have had their natural resources and wealth extracted by Indonesians 

                and transnational corporations, with very few of the proceeds 

                benefiting local people. </font>
