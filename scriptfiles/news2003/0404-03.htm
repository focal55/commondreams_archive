                NY - April 4 - Citing Henry David Thoreau and General Alexander 

                Haig, a group opposing the war in Iraq has launched a petition 

                drive to enlist support for persons who choose to withhold federal 

                income taxes in protest against the war. Called &quot;An Appeal 

                to Conscience,&quot; the petition states that the signatories, 

                &quot;believing that war tax refusal under the present circumstances 

                is fully justified on moral and ethical grounds, publicly declare 

                our encouragement of, and willingness to lend support to, those 

                persons of conscience who choose to take this step.&quot;</font> 

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A partial 

                  list of signatories to the Appeal to Conscience includes: Joan 

                  Baez; Fr. Daniel Berrigan, SJ; Noam Chomsky; Rev. William Sloane 

                  Coffin; Dave Dellinger and Elizabeth Peterson; Shelley and James 

                  Douglass; Daniel Ellsberg; Bishop Thomas J. Gumbleton; Elizabeth

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The Appeal 

                  was inspired by a similar declaration circulated during the 

                  Vietnam War in support of young men refusing to serve in the 

                  military. Entitled &quot;Call to Resist Illegitimate Authority,&quot; 

                  it noted that &quot;an ever growing number of young American 

                  men are finding that the American war in Vietnam so outrages 

                  their deepest moral and religious sense that they cannot contribute 

                  to it in any way.&quot; Four of the Call&sup1;s signatories, 

                  including then Yale University chaplain Rev. William Sloane 

                  Coffin and famed baby doctor Benjamin Spock, were indicted for 

                  &quot;conspiracy&quot; to violate the draft laws by President 

                  Johnson&sup1;s Justice Department. Following a much-publicized 

                  trial, two of the four were subsequently acquitted by a federal 

                  appeals court, and the cases of the other two were dropped.

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Declaring 

                  that citizens have &quot;a moral duty to speak out against, 

                  and avoid cooperation with&quot; the war in Iraq, the Appeal 

                  states that &quot;refusal to pay taxes used to finance unjust 

                  wars, along with refusal by soldiers to </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">fight 

                  in them, is a direct and potentially effective form of citizen 

                  non-cooperation,&quot; and that &quot;war tax refusal has a 

                  long and honorable tradition among religious and secular opponents 

                  of war.&quot;</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The Appeal 

                  also states that &quot;the U.S. government&sup1;s ability to 

                  threaten and coerce other nations is a direct result of the 

                  unprecedented size of our military arsenal, which is far larger 

                  than that of all our allies and 'enemies' combined. The maintenance 

                  of this arsenal depends upon the willingness of the American 

                  people, through their federal tax payments, to finance it.&quot;</font></p>

                  century American writer and philosopher Henry David Thoreau 

                  was jailed for refusing to pay a federal tax that was to be 

                  used to finance the Mexican-American War of 1846-48, which Thoreau 

                  and others believed to be an unwarranted act of aggression on 

                  the part of the U.S. In his famous essay, &quot;On the Duty 

                  of Civil Disobedience,&quot; Thoreau wrote: &quot;If a thousand 

                  [people] were not to pay their tax bills this year, that would 

                  not be a violent and bloody measure, as it would be to pay them 

                  and enable the state to commit violence and shed innocent blood.&quot;</font></p>

                  1982, General Alexander Haig, then Secretary of State under
