- November 20 - As seniors read the fine print, the outrage grows over a prescription deal that undermines Medicare, keeps drug prices high, and pumps billions into the pockets of drug companies and HMOs.  A grassroots movement led by the Institute for America&#146;s Future (IAF), Alliance for Retired Americans, USAction and countless other defenders of Medicare is growing.</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">1.

New State Reports on Medicare Deal</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Reports Available for Release by State Groups</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Institute for America's Future just released new reports showing the local impact of the Republican Medicare prescription drug deal.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The reports have been released to the press in many states, and activists continue to use these reports to lead the public debate in their communities.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The reports feature state-specific data highlighting beneficiary out-of-pocket costs (including rising drug prices, premiums, deductibles) and the impact of program privatization. The report also provides a look at methods proven to reduce drug costs currently being employed by government agencies and state and city governments around the country.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Click here for state reports.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">More about the reports:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The state-specific reports highlight several ways in which the legislation would force Medicare beneficiaries to pay more for prescriptions and doctor visits than they do today. The report also shows how the legislation is damaging Medicare's guaranteed benefit by subsidizing HMOs to pull healthy and wealthy beneficiaries out of Medicare.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Key is the point that the current compromise would guarantee the drug industry hundreds of billions of dollars in new taxpayer-supplied profits because of changes to the law that would prohibit Medicare from negotiating lower drug prices for Medicare beneficiaries. The reports also examine the pattern of influence that the drug industry has exerted on American politicians -- with contributions exceeding some $650 million, about 80% of which went to Republicans.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In contrast to the approach being considered by Congress, which will cost Medicare beneficiaries more, there are many proven ways that Medicare could lower drug costs. The report looks at examples of successful measures, used by the Veterans Administration and various states around the nation, to bring prescription costs down by using the buying power of beneficiaries to negotiate lower prescription prices with the drug industry. Republican leaders in Congress have rejected this proven approach.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Some supporters of the deal claim that though the legislation is not perfect -- it is better than nothing. This analysis makes the case that the deal does more harm than good by damaging the Medicare system and costing seniors more.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">3.

Sources say that Newt Gingrich was in the building at the time.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">No One Shows at HMO Rally in AZ</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">This Week: &quot;Senior Voices for Medicare Choices,&quot; an HMO-funded sham senior group, tried their hand at a rally in AZ with a high-priced telecast of President Bush. Proving their empty suit status -- no one showed up.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Seniors Arrested in AZ</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">July &amp; August: Seniors were arrested twice while trying to meet with Sen.

Katherine Harris (R-FL) nervous. Falsely asserting that &quot;Congressional rules&quot; prohibit written materials in town hall meetings, Harris staff and security confiscated written notes, questions, and fact-sheets from seniors; Harris then refused direct questions. Protest and ridicule by the media followed.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Hastert Calls Police on Seniors in IL</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">July: Seniors tried to deliver House Speaker Hastert (R-IL) a letter in Batavia, IL.

The group also called on Governor McGreevey to urge Senators Corzine and Lautenberg to vote no on the Medicare prescription drug bill.
