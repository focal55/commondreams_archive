<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NEW YORK - August 14 - Statement of Elizabeth Griffin - author of the Amnesty International's report on Afghanistan &quot;Re-establishing the rule of law&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is commonly assumed that the situation in Afghanistan has greatly improved since the removal of the Taleban regime. However, more than a year and a half after the international intervention, to say that democracy has been restored and that the Afghan people, including women, are being afforded their human rights could not be further from the truth. Afghanistan is still on the critical list and its recovery is being hampered by the failure of the international community to provide long-term political and financial support. </font>

</p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The US-led military intervention in Afghanistan was followed in November 2001 by the UN-brokered Bonn Agreement, which provided for the formation of the Afghan Transitional Administration (ATA). The ATA, headed by President Karzai, was intended as a first step towards the establishment of a 'broad-based, gender sensitive, multi-ethnic and fully representative government'. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Bonn Agreement was accompanied by an international commitment to assist in the development of democracy, the rule of law and human rights. At the centre of the transitional process was a planned programme of judicial reconstruction, aimed at restoring stability through the re-establishment of the rule of law. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ensuring respect for the rule of law is an essential foundation for security, democracy and development in any society that is recovering from violent conflict. Recent events in Iraq have demonstrated that in the wake of the collapse of a prior regime, the rapid re-establishment of an effective policing agency, an independent judiciary and a functioning prison system are essential for security, combating crime and protecting human rights. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The chaos caused by international military interventions that result in the collapse of state structures needs to be met with an immediate programme of assistance to establish and develop a criminal justice system. In the short term, building the capacity of the police, courts and prisons is an immediate priority necessary to prevent the spread of anarchy and lawlessness, of the kind most recently seen in Iraq. In the long-term, a fair and effective criminal justice system will come to form the basis of a democratic society. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The perils of failing to support the swift re-establishment of criminal justice institutions are well known to the international community. If the dangers were not fully understood before, they became apparent in 1999 in the aftermath of the NATO led-military intervention that led to the withdrawal of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia from Kosovo. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The failure of the international community to rapidly commit to the establishment of the police, courts and prisons meant there were no effective means to prevent or sanction widespread bloodletting by the 'liberated' Kosovo Albanians against their former oppressors, the Serbs. Furthermore, long-term delays in supporting the development of the judicial system gave rise to a huge escalation in organised crime. As a result, Kosovo is now a base from, and through which organised criminal gangs traffic human beings, drugs and arms. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Afghanistan is doing no better. I was recently commissioned to compile a report for Amnesty International on the development of the criminal justice system. In Afghanistan I observed a collapsed system in crisis, neglected by the international community. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The unwillingness of the international community to extend the mandate of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) to areas outside of Kabul is undermining the rule of law. In the absence of proper security, powerful warlords and 'commanders', disloyal to the ATA, control men and territory through the use of private armies. They prevent the police and judiciary from acting independently by using threats or other forms of intimidation. As a result, serious crime is committed with impunity and the drug trade is flourishing like never before. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Afghan police have not been provided with the equipment necessary to investigate crime and they routinely resort to torture. The courts, which have been established only in some regions, lack basic facilities such as premises, legal texts, furniture and stationery. The judiciary is largely untrained and many judges have been appointed on the basis of their political affiliations even thought do not hold the necessary legal qualifications. As a consequence, people are being convicted despite a lack of proper evidence after grossly unfair trials. Corruption is widespread among poorly paid judges . </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Afghan women, still too scared to walk the streets without the burkha, continue to be subjected to extreme forms of discrimination. In some areas, the police randomly pick up girls and women from the street and subject them to forced virginity tests. Girls and young women are also imprisoned for 'running away' from forced marriage or abusive spouses. Victims of domestic violence and rape kill themselves rather than going to seek assistance from the male dominated criminal justice system. Informal justice systems order girls to be given away as a means of compensation in criminal cases. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, what shocked me the most about Afghanistan was not the stories told by girls imprisoned for 'running away' from abuse or breaking male imposed codes. Neither was it the deplorable state of squalid Afghan jails, or the stories of torture told by their inhabitants. What shocked me the most was the fact that despite the many promises by the foreign governments who intervened that this time around they would not abandon Afghanistan and that they would commit for the long-term , these governments are failing to keep these promises. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a speech in October 2002, Jack Straw stated that 'Afghanistan's development needs will be huge. The cost of re-building Bosnia was $5 billion. Afghanistan has four times Bosnia's population&quot; but we have to bear the cost, because if we do not the price we will pay will be far greater'. However, in the end, at the Tokyo International Conference on Reconstruction Assistance in Afghanistan half a billion dollars less was pledged by the international community for Afghanistan that it was for Bosnia. In addition, in the current financial year less that half of the necessary $27 million dollars required for reform of the criminal justice system has been pledged and of the pledged funds less that a quarter have actually been dispersed. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jack Straw was right. The price that the international community is paying for failing to live up to its promises to assist Afghanistan is extremely high. Ironically, in neglecting Afghanistan the most important goal behind the international intervention &quot; the eradication of &quot;terrorist threats&quot; &quot; is being completely undermined: Continued lawlessness, de facto rule by powerful warlords and the inability of the police and courts to detect and combat serious crime mean that Afghanistan continues to offer a perfect environment in which &quot;terrorists&quot; and other organised criminal gangs can operate. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The international military interventions in Kosovo, Afghanistan and Iraq provide a number of important lessons. Above all, they demonstrate that the removal of a regime by military force cannot in itself bring about democracy, respect for the rule of law or eradicate international &quot;terrorist threats&quot;.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

These goals can only be achieved through the provision of long-term international assistance aimed at supporting the re-establishment of the rule of law.</font></p>
