                - March 6 - The U.S. Conference of Mayors, through its HIV/AIDS 

                Prevention Grants Program, has awarded grants totaling more than 

                $600,000 to eleven community-based organizations and health departments 

                throughout the country. Though priorities change from year to 

                year, the awards go to local programs that seek to assist groups 

                that are at high risk of HIV infection. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The U.S. Conference 

                of Mayors is proud to award these grants to community-based organizations 

                that are helping to fight the AIDS epidemic in America by promoting 

                local HIV prevention efforts," said Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino, 

                President of the U.S. Conference of Mayors. "Finding a cure is 

                important but education and prevention efforts are critical in 

                helping to diminish the spread of this global disease." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The three categories 

                of award winners include new programs already in effect, new programs 

                scheduled to begin very soon; and previously existing programs 

                will continue successful and-ongoing efforts. Eight of the eleven 

                organizations plan to conduct HIV prevention programs for gay/bisexual 

                men of color, variously targeting African American, Hispanic, 

                and Asian men. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since 1985 

                USCM, in cooperation with the Centers for Disease Control and 

                Prevention, has given almost $12.6 million in HIV/AIDS prevention 

                grants to community-based organizations and local health departments. 

                Since 1992, USCM has taken the lead in issues affecting gay/bisexual 

                men of color, funding a national HIV prevention needs assessment 

                as well as 39 local HIV prevention projects to date. Also, USCM 

                has since 1995 funded 17 local programs for Native Americans, 

                a neglected group whose unique needs are inadequately addressed 

                in many areas. Other priorities have included HIV prevention needs 

                assessments and prevention programs for high-risk women. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Another 

                round of HIV prevention grants will be awarded late this year.
