<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

-  September 3 - Three in four Americans oppose the Bush administration&#146;s proposal to eliminate several million employees&#146; right to overtime pay, and opposition is overwhelming regardless of political affiliation, race, income or geographic region, according to a new national survey conducted by the independent polling firm Hart Research. The survey was conducted among 862 adults from August 26 to 31, 2003 and was commissioned by the AFL-CIO. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

The survey, conducted to examine public attitudes toward the issue of overtime pay, also finds that support for the proposal could be a political liability for members of Congress. Seventy-four percent of Americans say they would be less likely to vote for a congressional candidate who supports the administration&#146;s overtime proposal. Overall, 55 percent say they would be much less likely to vote for such a candidate for Congress, as do an extraordinary 67 percent of working people who report that they are eligible for overtime pay. </font>

</p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Business groups are pushing hard for the Bush proposal, which does not require congressional approval, while average voters are flooding members of Congress with demands to block it. The U.S. Senate may vote this week on an amendment by Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) to block the proposals that would cut overtime pay. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By 17 to one, the public believes that federal laws governing overtime should be changed to cover more employees (52 percent) rather than fewer employees (three percent), while 38 percent support current coverage. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Opposition to the Bush administration&#146;s proposal is very broad, including Republicans (73 percent opposed) as well as Democrats (81 percent opposed). Opposition is even stronger in households with incomes of more than $50,000 (82 percent) than it is in low-income households (73 percent). The survey conservatively described the Bush proposal as eliminating overtime pay for &#147;several million&#148; employees instead of the estimated eight million that the nonpartisan Economic Policy Institute projects could be affected. </font></p>
