                - April 9 - Three citizens groups and federal regulators have 

                reached a settlement with Alcoa over allegations that the aluminum 

                giant illegally released more then one million tons of air pollution 

                from its Rockdale, Texas, facility over the past 17 years.</font> 

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Under terms 

                  submitted Tuesday for approval in federal district court, Alcoa 

                  will be required to reduce immediately its emissions of harmful 

                  pollutants from the Rockdale smelter. The company must make 

                  even larger pollution reductions over the next few years.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The settlement 

                  requires Alcoa to pay the U.S. Treasury a $1.5 million fine. 

                  Alcoa also must spend $2.5 million on two environmental mitigation 

                  projects in Central Texas: a land purchase project and a project 

                  to reduce emissions from school buses.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The lawsuit 

                  against Alcoa by the citizens groups &#150; and related allegations 

                  subsequently lodged against Alcoa by the U.S. Environmental 

                  Protection Agency (EPA) and the Texas Commission on Environmental 

                  Quality (TCEQ) &#150; were prompted when Neighbors for Neighbors 

                  uncovered extensive evidence that Alcoa had been violating the 

                  Clean Air Act.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Billie Woods, 

                  Neighbors for Neighbors president, said, &quot;The bottom line 

                  for us was to make Alcoa reduce some of its air pollution now, 

                  not just promise to do so five or 10 years down the road.&quot;</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Neighbors 

                  for Neighbors and two national organizations, Environmental 

                  Defense and Public Citizen, filed suit against Alcoa in federal 

                  district court in Austin in 2001. The suit alleged that in the 

                  mid-1980s, Alcoa essentially rebuilt its three power generating 

                  units at the Rockdale plant without installing any new air pollution 

                  control equipment or obtaining a required Clean Air Act permit. 

                  Had Alcoa followed the law then, Texas would have been spared 

                  more than one million tons of excess pollution.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For years, 

                  Alcoa&#146;s Rockdale plant has been the state&#146;s largest 

                  &quot;grandfathered&quot; polluter, spewing more than 100,000 

                  tons of air emissions annually. Grandfathered polluters generally 

                  are exempt from post-1971 Clean Air Act standards.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Working 

                  from the Neighbors group&#146;s findings, the EPA and TCEQ cited 

                  Alcoa for violating the &quot;new source review&quot; provisions 

                  of the Clean Air Act. Under new source review, a grandfathered 

                  plant is no longer exempted from having to install modern pollution 

                  controls if it overhauls its facilities and emits more pollution 

                  than it did before. The Bush administration has proposed that 

                  new source review be largely eliminated.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jim Marston, 

                  Texas director for Environmental Defense, said, &quot;This settlement 

                  shows that new source review is a valuable tool in cleaning 

                  our air and keeping polluters in check. It enabled a small band 

                  of citizens to stand up to a big polluter and win.&quot;</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The settlement 

                  requires that Alcoa take interim measures to reduce air pollution 

                  from its Rockdale plant until it either installs new pollution 

                  control equipment on its three power units or builds new units 

                  with modern pollution controls. A third option available through 

                  the settlement calls for Alcoa to shut down the three units 

                  and rely on electricity from other sources, such as a fourth, 

                  less-polluting Rockdale power unit owned and operated by Texas 

                  Utilities.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The deadline 

                  for Alcoa to choose one of the three options likely will be 

                  sometime in the summer of 2004, Woods said. If Alcoa chooses 

                  to shut down its three units, it would be required to do so 

                  by the end of 2006.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The interim 

                  measures required of Alcoa include reducing in June its emissions 

                  of sulfur dioxide (SO2) from the three power-generating units 

                  by some 7,000 to 8,000 tons annually (the plant currently emits 

                  more than 60,000 tons of SO2 each year). Other interim measures 

                  involve immediate reductions in nitrogen oxide and particulate 

                  matter emitted by the three units.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Over the 

                  long-term, the settlement will require Alcoa to reduce its emissions 

                  of SO2 by about 95 percent and reduce nitrogen oxide and particulate 

                  matter by about 90 percent.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Woods said 

                  her group would have preferred that the settlement require Alcoa 

                  to make larger reductions sooner and to pay a fine more in line 

                  with the profits it made by violating the law.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;But 

                  given current efforts to weaken the Clean Air Act, the settlement 

                  is the best we could probably hope for,&quot; she said.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The settlement 

                  requires Alcoa to spend $1.75 million to fund the purchase of 

                  threatened lands in Bastrop and Lee counties, with the land 

                  being held by the Pines and Prairies Land Trust and the Trust 

                  for Public Land. Alcoa also must spend $750,000 to fund a school 

                  bus emission reduction program in Central Texas.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Kelly Haragan, 

                  staff attorney for Public Citizen&#146;s Texas office, said, 

                  &quot;Alcoa has long been one of Texas&#146; biggest air polluters. 

                  This settlement not only means cleaner air for Texans to breathe, 

                  but is a great testament to what ordinary citizens can accomplish.&quot;</font></p>
