</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Federal Trade Commission action to establish a national &quot;do not call&quot; list, for which telemarketers can be fined $11,000 per violation for disregarding, and the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee's unanimous vote to stop spam are demonstrations of a larger populist movement to stop the invisible hand of corporate commerce from draining people's energy, time, attention, and rights, said Court.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;There is a growing popular consciousness that corporations steal more than our money, but also our privacy and right to have commercial-free space,&quot; said Court, who is also the executive director of the Santa Monica-based Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. &quot;Politicians can no longer ignore the invisible hand of the corporation in our lives and the finger it gives us.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Recently, more than one million Californians signed up for the State of California's &quot;Do Not Call&quot; list in Court's home state. Court has also been pushing for financial privacy protections in California and recently released the first four digits of the social security numbers of politicians who failed to support legislation requiring written consent before an individual's private information is share (see <a href="http://www.consumerwatchdog.org" target="_new">http://www.consumerwatchdog.org</a> for the publication of those numbers).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Court hopes to introduce the word &quot;corporateering&quot; into popular discourse to give the public a way to articulate inappropriate intrusions in their public and private lives.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Word of mouth is what corporations want most and fear most, the public should use it to protect their privacy, legal recourse, personal security and other freedoms large corporations often threaten,&quot; noted Court.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Court provides in his book ways people around the nation can join Californians in countering corporateering, including the following steps.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1. Tell a corporation, &quot;Do Not Call.&quot; Next time a telemarketer calls, just say, &quot;Put me on your do not call list.&quot; Corporations are required under law to have such lists and to pay $500 every time they call someone on them. If they keep calling, collect $500 for each violation. Many states have also developed &quot;Do Not Call&quot; lists that individuals can sign up for and corporations have to respect.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2. &quot;Opt out.&quot; Send a corporation the following note that you &quot;Opt Out&quot; of their system of sharing your private financial information:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I am asserting my rights under the Financial Services Modernization Act and the Fair Credit Reporting Act to &quot;opt out&quot; of the following two uses of my personal information:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Do not disclose personally identifiable information with your non-affiliated third-party companies or individuals.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Do not disclose my creditworthiness to any affiliate.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Further, I request, even though it may not be required by law, that you: (1) Do not disclose my transaction and experience information to any affiliate of yours; and (2) Do not disclose any information about me in connection with marketing agreements between you and any other company. I would appreciate written confirmation of these requests.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3. Change a corporate contract. Corporations typically require individuals to sign long, standardized contracts that often have repugnant clauses, such as a waiver of the right to trial, in the fine print. Next time you are presented with such a contract, read it and cross out the objectionable provisions before you sign. No corporations can force you to sign a contract. Individuals have a right to negotiate that they rarely use.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">4. Stop corporate junk faxes. A federal law makes it illegal to send an unsolicited commercial advertisement to a fax machine from anywhere in the U.S.A. People who receive junk faxes have the right to recover at least $500 per fax. In most cases, the law authorizes courts to award up to $1,500 per fax. For how to stop junk faxes and a sample complaint see: <a href="http://www.consumerwatchdog.org/other/fs/fs001543.php3" target="_new">http://www.consumerwatchdog.org/other/fs/fs001543.php3</a>.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">5. Challenge a corporation. When the corporation upsets you, put your gripe in writing to the corporation, to a regulator, or to the media. The corporation may or may not want to change, but the letter memorializes your problem. If you want to make anyone nervous, particularly a corporation, put something serious about them in writing.</font></p>
