                - March 25 - The board of directors of the National Committee 

                for Responsive Philanthropy, the nation's foremost philanthropic 

                watchdog organization promoting social justice in U.S. grantmaking, 

                has overwhelmingly approved a statement expressing strong concern 

                about the preemptive war launched by the United States on Iraq 

                and the impacts of the war on charity and philanthropy. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At the organization's 

                spring board meeting in Los Angeles on Saturday, March 22, the 

                NCRP board approved the statement on the war in Iraq, emphasizing 

                the human and economic cost of the war and the conflict's potential 

                impact on the U.S. nonprofit sector and the disadvantaged Americans 

                it serves. At the same time, the statement called on support for 

                U.S. troops and their families, recognizing the hardships that 

                they face by being called up for prolonged service in this overseas 

                war. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The U.S. philanthropic 

                sector and many of the sector's nonprofit leadership organizations 

                have been unusually quiet about this preemptive war and the wartime 

                budget impacts on the disadvantaged Americans served by charities 

                and philanthropies, " said NCRP Executive Director Rick Cohen. 

                "The NCRP board of directors felt that it had to speak out and 

                express its deep concern about this war and its potentially devastating 

                impacts at home and abroad." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The statement 

                of the NCRP board called on philanthropy to provide more resources 

                and more support for social justice efforts around the globe, 

                to work toward securing human rights, and to support nonprofits 

                that encourage and promote fundamental debates about the civic 

                climate and threatened civil liberties that this war has exacerbated. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The U.S. invasion 

                of Iraq should make every philanthropic institution think deeply 

                about the challenges to charity and philanthropy in responding 

                to the economic hardships that an exorbitantly costly war will 

                add to an already troubled economy and about their responsibilities 

                in promoting a vigorous and critically needed public discourse 

                about the national and international priorities and policies that 

                this nation's preemptive war reveals," Cohen said. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The following 

                is the full text of the statement approved March 22, by NCRP's 

                board: </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The board 

                of directors of the National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy 

                (NCRP), dedicated to helping the philanthropic community more 

                effectively serve the nation's most disadvantaged and disenfranchised 

                populations, is concerned about the impact that our nation's military 

                action in Iraq will have on our constituencies, our nation and 

                our world. We feel compelled to issue this statement as we join 

                our colleagues in the nonprofit sector and in philanthropy in 

                dealing with the ways our reality has changed because of this 

                war. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We are concerned 

                about the United States government's preemptive war against Iraq, 

                which exacerbates the inequality that disadvantaged and disenfranchised 

                communities already experience. Beyond the tragic, unquantifiable 

                human costs of going to war, the economic costs will range anywhere 

                from $200 billion to more than $1 trillion dollars. That includes 

                not only the cost of mounting and carrying out an invasion with 

                more than a quarter million U.S. soldiers, but the post-invasion 

                occupation of Iraq, the costs of rebuilding and recovery, and 

                humanitarian assistance. The economic costs are dwarfed by the 

                human costs. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"For our constituencies 

                among U.S. nonprofits, the war also means a new wave of cutbacks 

                in public investment, as the federal government will have to shift 

                more money into a war budget. The outcome will inevitably be reduced 

                human service and public infrastructure investment-and more pressure 

                on charity and philanthropy to fill the holes in our nation's 

                already frayed social safety net. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"While we are 

                concerned about the war, we support our troops and their families. 

                We call upon government and the philanthropic communities to be 

                aware of the many needs those who serve our nation have. Many 

                reservists forego regular salaries while they are deployed in 

                this conflict. Others called up for service have left families 

                at the brink of poverty because their economic contributions to 

                their households have not been replaced. Even when salaries are 

                replaced, military families are emotionally destabilized by this 

                war effort. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We are also 

                concerned about the civic climate that this war has exacerbated 

                and the range of civil liberties that are compromised in a climate 

                of war-driven public anxiety. We believe it essential to our constituencies 

                that the United States maintains a vigorous, open and accessible 

                debate about our national and international goals and purposes, 

                about our social and economic priorities and policies, and about 

                the preservation of our civil liberties. We urge the media to 

                play a constructive role in furthering this necessary debate. 

                We urge foundations to support those civil society organizations 

                that encourage and promote debate about our national direction. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Finally, we 

                urge individuals involved in philanthropy to provide more resources 

                for social and economic justice efforts at home and abroad and 

                to secure human rights around the world." </font>
