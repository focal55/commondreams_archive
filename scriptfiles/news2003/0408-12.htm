                - April 8 - This week the U.S. House of Representatives will debate 

                an energy plan (H.R. 6) that, if passed, would seriously weaken 

                America's energy future and economic security, according to the 

                League of Conservation Voters. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The bill includes 

                provisions to give $12.1 billion in tax breaks to polluting industries 

                such as oil and gas, but would do next to nothing to help Americans 

                use fuel more efficiently or obtain more energy from renewable 

                sources. H.R. 6 would also open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge 

                to oil and gas drilling and allow energy companies unprecedented 

                access to millions of acres of federal lands for oil and gas exploration.

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Republican 

                House leaders have ignored America's security needs by pushing 

                an energy bill that fails to reduce our dependence on foreign 

                oil or strengthen our economy," said Deb Callahan, League of Conservation 

                Voters president. "Voters want a cleaner, healthier, safer, and 

                more affordable energy future, but the Republican energy plan 

                rewards the oil and gas industry with billions of dollars in tax 

                breaks and unfettered access to our natural treasures." </font>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A March 2003 

                Gallup poll found that 60 percent of Americans want a solution 

                to our energy problems that focuses on conservation of existing 

                energy supplies over greater production of oil and gas. The poll 

                also showed that 73 percent of Americans favor higher fuel efficiency 

                standards for automobiles. Republican drafters of this energy 

                plan failed to include either in H.R. 6. Instead, the bill focuses 

                on rewarding the oil, gas, and coal industries with $12.1 billion 

                in tax breaks and the promise of much more revenue from drilling 

                and mining on public land. According to the Center for Responsive 

                Politics, the oil and gas industry invested $19.2 million in Republican 

                campaigns in 2002 and $27 million in 2000 -- almost 80 percent 

                of their total campaign contributions. </font>
