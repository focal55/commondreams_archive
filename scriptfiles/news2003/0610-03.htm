- June 10 -Thank you all for coming this morning. I am Kate Michelman, President of NARAL Pro-Choice America. I am honored today to join my colleagues in announcing the historic March for Freedom of Choice and our coalition partners who are rallying with us to save the right to choose. Together we represent the power, the passion, and the wide diversity of people who are pro-choice Americans.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The sobering facts: Since 1995, states have enacted 335 bills restricting a woman&#146;s right to choose. Congress has waged a relentless effort to roll back reproductive rights. President Bush is poised to make history by becoming the first president ever to enact a law criminalizing abortion. The Supreme Court has a razor thin majority protecting the right to choose. Those are the sober facts. These are dark days for pro-choice Americans. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The chill wind that Justice Blackman predicted a decade ago is now blowing at gale force</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So it all comes down to this moment. Since Washington politicians won&#146;t stand up women&#146;s freedoms and liberties and protect our rights, it becomes increasingly clear that only a powerful, mobilized grassroots pro-choice movement can avert the devastating consequences of women losing their right to chose. That moment is April 25, 2004 in Washington, DC. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We have a simple message for anti-choice leaders who control the White House and the Congress - don&#146;t tread on us, don&#146;t tread on our constitutional right to choose and don&#146;t tread on our right to privacy. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We will not stand by silently as our rights are trampled. Pro-choice Americans are on the move. On April 25 they will come together from all corners of the country. We will organize. We will mobilize. We are ready to take to the streets to protect the health, lives and rights of American women. This March will tell politicians in Washington to stay out of the doctors&#146; office, stay out of the clinics and stay out of our private decisions.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On April 25th, 2004, pro-choice Americans will save freedom of choice the same way it was won: one person, one neighborhood, one community and one state at a time. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Throughout the coming year, my colleagues and I will travel to various parts of the country rallying and mobilizing support for the March. We pledge our resources and commitment to saving reproductive freedom and choice and our right to privacy. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Women, men, families, mothers, grandfathers, nieces, nephews, friends and neighbors will march on Washington next year &#150; their voices strong, their presence awe-inspiring, their passion renewed &#150; President Bush will take notice, lawmakers will pay attention, anti-choice forces will be taken aback at the sheer number and determination of pro-choice Americans. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These unprecedented threats demand extraordinary action. We must begin at the grassroots. Only a large-scale March in the nation&#146;s capital can create momentum that this decisive moment in history requires &#150; and send politicians the message that America&#146;s pro-choice majority will not allow its freedoms to be taken away.</font></p>
