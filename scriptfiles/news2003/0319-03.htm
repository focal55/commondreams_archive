                is posting this report because it believes the document is a valuable 

                and timely contribution to people's understanding of the exact 

                nature of the Bush administration's bombing and invasion of Iraq.

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The document 

                contains an in-depth analysis of the concept of "Shock and Awe" 

                warfare as set forth by its architects and authors in "Shock and 

                Awe: Achieving Rapid Dominance," a book published by the National 

                Defense University (December 1996), an institution funded by the 

                Pentagon. The concept came into the news recently when on January 

                24, 2003 CBS News reported and confirmed that the Shock and Awe 

                concept was the basis for the U.S. war plan for Iraq. CBS reported 

                that a Pentagon official briefed on the plan has said, "there 

                will not be a safe place in Baghdad." </font>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Primarily, 

                The 'Shock and Awe' Experiment seeks to further public awareness, 

                and to build a foundation for press, organizations, and individuals 

                who wish to make informed statements on the subject. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The report, 

                believed to be the first of its kind, is intended to serve as 

                a resource for journalists and students who wish to increase their 

                understanding of the "Shock and Awe" battle plan and its potential 

                impact on Iraqi society. It provides a systematic and rigorous 

                analysis of the "revolutionary" new Shock and Awe doctrine, including 

                a thorough analysis of the plan's heavy emphasis on targeting 

                civilian infrastructure, and can serve as a research tool for 

                those who care to explore specific dimensions of the issue further.

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Shock and Awe 

                warfare explicitly calls for targeting civilian infrastructure 

                such as "water supplies, food processing and sanitation." It emphasizes 

                bombing in such a way to "create fear" and cause severe, widespread 

                "psychological and emotional" effects. The Shock and Awe Experiment 

                discusses the legal and humanitarian dimensions of war on Iraq 

                in this context, drawing on many reputable and authoritative sources, 

                citing international and humanitarian legal precedents. It references 

                many declassified Defense Intelligence Agency documents and two 

                recently leaked UN humanitarian crisis planning documents. The 

                'Shock and Awe' Experiment also reviews the surprisingly limited 

                discussion of Shock and Awe in the American media landscape during 

                the past 7 weeks since the original news "leak" on CBS News. </font>
