- October 27 - Two prominent Iraqi women from Baghdad will kick off a tour of the United States with a reception and presentation, &quot;Contemporary Life &amp; Art in the Cradle of Civilization&quot; at the <a href="http://www.nationalartsclub.org" target="_new">National Arts Club</a> in Manhattan,  15 Gramercy Park South, Monday October 27, 8-10pm. Amal Al-Khedairy, curator &amp; founder of Al Beit Al Iraqi Cultural Arts Center, Baghdad -- a leading cultural institution in Baghdad bombed in 2003; and internationally recognized Iraqi writer &amp; journalist Nermin Al-Mufti, will be introduced and speak at the event.  They are highly articulate in English, entirely informed about current realities in Iraq and will be available for interviews. New York-based journalists are invited to attend.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Al-Khedairy and Al-Mufti are two prominent Iraqi women who lived, worked and raised children through the upheavals of The first Gulf War, sanctions, and the current occupation.  They have been on the front lines calling attention to desperately urgent humanitarian issues in Iraq, especially those affecting women and children, and in advocating a strong voice and role for Iraqi women in Iraq's reconstruction.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">They will tour the United States along with long time friend Barbara Nimri-Aziz, Ph.d, author, journalist and social scientist based in the US who has covered Iraq for the BBC, Canadian Broadcasting and Pacifica Radio.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Their US tour is organized by the Fellowship of Reconciliation with many supporters and over 30 collaborating institutions, universities, local communities, and arts organizations around the US. For details, see (www.forusa.org).  Their itinerary will take them to venues in the New York/New Jersey area including the United Nations, to Washington, DC where they will lobby Congress for a stronger response to the plight of women and children in postwar Iraq.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From there, they plan to continue to Pennsylvania, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle, Madison, Chicago, Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky, Connecticut, Toronto, and other stops before returning to NYC and then Iraq.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Their agenda includes introducing Americans to the rich and ancient culture of Iraq as well as raising public and media awareness of the actual situation on the ground in Iraq. They will be soliciting greater focus and involvement from US government officials, NGOs, American citizens and American women leaders in the public and private sector.</font></p>
