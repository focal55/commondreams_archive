- August 27 - In a precedent-setting case with national repercussions,

the Missouri Supreme Court Tuesday overturned the death sentence of

a juvenile offender. The court found that &quot;a national consensus has

developed against the execution of juvenile offenders&quot; and cited the

number of states that have banned the practice.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

The Missouri Supreme Court struck down the death sentence of Christopher

Simmons, who was 17 years old when he committed a murder a decade ago.

 

The National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty earlier this year

launched a campaign to abolish the execution of juvenile offenders.

The United States is the only country that has executed a juvenile 

offender during 2003.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Today's decision helps usher the United States into the 21st century,&quot;

said Steven W. Hawkins, NCADP executive director. &quot;We do not let

juveniles sign contracts, serve in the military, marry, purchase

alcohol or cigarettes or even vote. Yet we somehow deem them eligible

for the death penalty. The double standard is appalling. Now Missouri

has stood up and said no to this double standard.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

Approximately 80 juvenile offenders are on death rows in the United

States. Six of the past seven executed juvenile offenders have been

from Texas and have been African American. Scott Hain, a white 

juvenile offender, was executed earlier this year by the state of Oklahoma.

 

Twenty-eight states now ban the execution of juvenile offenders --

16 states that permit the death penalty and 12 states that ban all

executions. Hawkins argues that juvenile offender executions must be banned, 

just as the executions of people with mental retardation have been.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

Hawkins cites a growing body of medical evidence that suggests juvenile

offenders are not as culpable as adult offenders and have a better

chance of rehabilitation. &quot;We once believed the human brain

was fully developed by age 14,&quot; Hawkins said. &quot;We now know that the

brain is still developing beyond the age of 17. The fact is that

juveniles have lesser capacity for reflective judgment and impulse

control than adult offenders. Unfortunately, our criminal justice

system has not kept pace with recent discoveries in the area of the

behavioral sciences.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

 The National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty was founded

in 1976 and is the only fully-staffed national organization

devoted specifically to abolishing the death penalty. NCADP is

comprised of more than 100 local, state, national and international

affiliates.
