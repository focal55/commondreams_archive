- May 5 - "Major combat 

operations" in Iraq have ended, but the war against disease and 

hunger continues for the Iraqi people, especially Iraq's children, 

according to global humanitarian agency Church World Service (CWS), 

concluding a weeklong assessment in Baghdad that ended Saturday, 

May 3. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Church World Service Emergency Response Consultant Steve Weaver 

reports a high incidence of diarrhea among children, overcrowding 

in hospitals and clinics, and a general lack of sources of protein. 

"According to UNICEF," Weaver said, "90 percent of children coming 

to Baghdad's Central Child Hospital have diarrhea." 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Baghdad Central Child Hospital is receiving 2,000 patients a 

day," said Jonathan Frerichs of Lutheran World Relief, traveling 

with Weaver. The hospital has so far had to bury 100 people in its 

garden. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"One pediatric hospital we visited," CWS' Weaver said, "which 10 

days ago had 40 patients today has 140." Even before the war, 

UNICEF reported that the average Iraqi child suffers 14 episodes of 

diarrhea per year. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The best passport for travel to deprived areas is anti-diarrhea 

medicines, or other cures for the age-old plagues that take high 

tolls on human life," said Frerichs, also press officer for Action 

By Churches Together (ACT). 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We saw beds shared by two or three children, with their mothers 

alongside. Many women had babies. Many patients were on cots or 

blankets on the ground, overcrowded and making do." Weaver relates. 

"That hospital needs 50 beds with sheets and blankets immediately." 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To help meet those needs, Church World Service and its partner 

agencies announce they are providing $75,000 additional in their 

ongoing $1 million All Our Children Campaign, funding medicines and 

medical supplies for pediatric hospitals in Baghdad. CWS is a 

founding member of the multi-agency All Our Children Campaign, 

established before the war to benefit the severe and longstanding 

health crisis among Iraq's children. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to UN and other sources, between 500,000 to 1 million 

children have died in Iraq since 1991. The death rate of children 

under 5 is reported as 2.5 times greater than in 1990. 

  

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since December 2002, the All Our Children Campaign has provided 

$268,800 in medicine, medical equipment and supplies to pediatric 

hospitals and clinics. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">New $75,000 Project for Baghdad's Institutionalized, Street 

Children and Orphans 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The latest All Our Children allocation funds a fourth and fifth 

project, in the campaign, totaling nearly $75,000, with both 

projects designated to benefit street children, orphans and other 

institutionalized children, and those separated from their families 

by the war -- among the most vulnerable of the country's 

population. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One $60,000 project, being administered in Baghdad by 

German-based NGO Architects for People In Need-Iraq (AFP), will 

supply badly needed medical examination tables, instrument tables, 

refrigerators for medicine storage, and supplies such as syringes, 

eye drops, bandages and surgical gloves, and numerous types of 

medicines. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The All Our Children contribution will fund fully one fourth of 

APN's medical care project. The funds will assist 9,100 children in 

the APN program's first phase, aimed at identifying and treating 

children with chronic and untreated medical conditions. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Clinics that are being reactivated include Habibiya 1, Habibiya, 

Al Safaa 1 and New Baghdad. "The APN clinics are seeing hundreds 

and hundreds of patients a day," CWS' Weaver reported. "They are 

overflowing with patients coming for medical care. They are seeing 

a tremendous amount of dysentery and other water-borne illnesses." 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another $15,000 project, to be administered by NGO Enfants du 

Monde (EMDH) In Baghdad, will address similar needs and will 

attempt to identify and register children separated from their 

families, aiming to reunite children with their families as fast as 

possible. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"President Bush says the United States will see the war on 

terrorism to the end," commented Church World Service Executive 

Director the Rev. John L. McCullough, New York City. "We also have 

to see our humanitarian responsibilities to the end. The war 

against hunger and disease continues for the Iraqi people." 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">U.S. and aid officials agree that currently there is no 

"humanitarian crisis" in Iraq," which means people are not on the 

verge of death," said CWS Emergency Response Director Rick 

Augsburger, New York City. "But there is severe humanitarian need 

that, if not met quickly, could result in a higher mortality rate 

for children and others who are vulnerable." 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CWS' Weaver said chronic diseases being reported among children 

in Baghdad include diarrhea and vomiting, believed caused by 

dysentery and amoebic dysentery, typhoid, epilepsy, iron 

deficiency, anemia, skin diseases including scabies, chicken pox, 

measles, and burns by benzene or gas. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From the Baghdad assessment team, Frerichs reports that, beyond 

the imposing monuments of Baghdad's remaining skyline, lie the 

"unauthorized, hidden showcases of poverty newly accessible on the 

outskirts of town." There, Frerichs describes, are the millions 

who live in and around Saddam City -- mostly Shiites who migrated 

from the south and who were marginalized by the previous regime. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In one of those communities, the community of Hai El Mahdi, the 

assessment team reports that they saw mothers whose infants did not 

hold up their heads and other signs of severe malnutrition. "One of 

the first people you meet," Frerichs recalls, "is a child standing 

with a bandaged foot on a large piece of dung." 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CWS' Weaver and his colleagues have visited a number of health 

care facilities in Baghdad, and report that, while health care 

workers are doing what they can to provide services and return to 

work, chaos remains in the city. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One psychiatric hospital the team visited was "looted down to 

the light switches, wires, and windows, with the patients still 

there," Weaver reported. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Weaver also noted that, across all populations, while there 

appeared to be plenty of flour, noodles, and rice, "There is a lack 

of protein." 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Weaver, CWS' consultant in Amman, Jordan, has been in Baghdad 

since April 23. He and Frerichs are accompanied during the Baghdad 

assessment by Menno Weibe, Mennonite Central Committee, Amman, 

Jordan and Edward Miller, Mennonite Central Committee. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NGO partners in the All Our Children Campaign include CWS, 

Jubilee Partners, the Mennonite Central Committee (MCC), the 

National Council of Churches USA (NCC), Oxfam America, Sojourners, 

and Stop Hunger Now. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Church World Service's participation in the All Our Children 

Campaign continues the international agency's decade-plus 

commitment to assisting the ongoing needs of the Iraqi people. CWS 

has provided more than $3.8 million since 1991 for UN-sanctioned 

humanitarian assistance in Iraq. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As part of its own $1.5 million appeal for the Iraqi people, 

launched prior to the war's outbreak, CWS has already sent a 

$110,000 grant to its on the ground partner the Middle East Council 

of churches (MECC). Four thousand CWS blankets are scheduled for 

shipment into Iraq next week. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During Iraq's reconstruction and rehabilitation, CWS will 

continue to focus on health needs, especially those of children, 

women, the elderly and low-income people with inadequate access to 

health care. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CWS Executive Director John L. McCullough said that "because of 

CWS' local partners and church relationships, we are able to 

continue providing assistance within Iraq regardless of conditions 

in the country." 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">McCullough adds that the agency can also "serve in an 

independent and impartial manner, because CWS chose not to be part 

of humanitarian assistance that was part of an effort, organized or 

coordinated by the U.S. military. Fortunately," he adds, "the 

local partners we work with are also able to administer to the 

community independently from the U.S. military."
