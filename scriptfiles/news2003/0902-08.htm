<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- September 2 - Statement of Anna Aurilio, Legislative Director.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While we are still waiting to hear what triggered the most massive blackout in U.S. history, it is clear that it is a tangible consequence of our over-reliance on cumbersome centralized power sources largely based on polluting fossil and nuclear power plants. To prevent future blackouts, we should use our technological know-how to increase energy efficiency and conservation, and shift to clean, renewable energy sources, especially smaller clean local power sources with more local control. </font>

</p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Bush energy plan and House and Senate energy bills take us in the wrong direction. These bills will increase the risk of blackouts by repealing existing consumer protections and subsidizing the construction of more large centralized coal and nuclear plants. National deregulation is not the answer. Congress should reject the House and Senate energy bills and focus on requiring the industry to meet mandatory reliability standards. These standards must not be solely created and enforced by the same industry that caused the problem. Instead they must give consumers a voice, contain strong enforcement standards and provide a process for reconciling local and national interests. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The state PIRGs and other local groups that have spoken out today represent states which have both regulated and deregulated electricity systems from all parts of the country. We recognize that our electric grid needs some modernization. But the emphasis should be on industry accountability, energy efficiency and cleaner, local power options not on more business as usual such as building more power lines to link larger dirty power plants. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The electricity industry is already calling for weaker air pollution regulations and $100 billion in transmission expenditures. U.S. PIRG's research shows that American's suffered through more than 33,000 violations of the smog standard over the last five years. The last thing we need is more air pollution from old dirty power plants. We are outraged that the electric industry is using the recent blackouts to justify yesterday's massive weakening of the Clean Air Act. This is just as false an argument as the Bush administration's attempt to blame California's energy problems on environmental regulations when in fact they were caused by corporate contributors to the Bush energy plan and campaign coffers. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In today's economy, Americans are struggling to pay their bills yet the industry is also using the blackouts to propose more than $100 billion for transmission line construction and upgrades paid for by the ratepayers. State PIRGs around the county call on regulators to refuse to allow utilities to charge ratepayers for the construction of new transmission lines and power plants unless they have proven that energy efficiency and cleaner, more local power options won't do the job. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This is a teachable moment that should remind us that, as we update our electric system we must strive for a nimbler, less cumbersome system. We need a system that recognizes the economic value of conservation and efficiency and puts an emphasis on smaller, more local generation sources that do not rely on fossil fuels. </font></p>
