- December 2 - National religious leaders will join a presidential candidate, U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold, and other public officials on the stage at the Gamaliel Foundation's Rolling Thunder public meeting at 6:45 p.m. Thursday in the Midwest Airlines Center, 400 W. Wisconsin Ave. The national meeting of grassroots community leaders will highlight public issues facing Wisconsin and ignite a national campaign for voter education and registration based on the anti-apartheid movement of South Africa.</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Presidential candidate Dennis Kucinich, Natal Province Anglican Bishop Rubin Phillip, Dr. William Shaw, president of the National Baptist Convention, Dr. Bob Edgar, national secretary of National Council of Churches and former Pennsylvania Congressman, and Milwaukee Archbishop Timothy Dolan are among the featured guests expected at the Rolling Thunder public meeting. Also expected are some 1,000 leaders of grassroots organizations from Wisconsin and across the country. They are in town for the Gamaliel Foundation's annual National Leadership Assembly, which runs Thursday through Saturday at the Hyatt Regency hotel.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Bishop Phillip of South Africa will kick off the voter education campaign by passing a torch to be lit by U.S. leaders in the struggle for social justice. Refocusing today's politics of personalities on public-policy issues will be a theme of Rolling Thunder. Gamaliel will organize massive public meetings, build alliances with other grassroots groups, and do non-partisan voter education and registration.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Rolling Thunder is inspired by a similar drive in the last days of apartheid in South Africa, when the opposition movement organized a series of meetings and mass protests across the nation calling for the reordering of national priorities to include the majority of the South African people.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Leaders of community organizations that make up the Gamaliel Foundation celebrated policy victories in 2003. They stood beside Illinois' governor while he signed into law a bill mandating foreign-born youth educated in the state be allowed to pay in-state tuition rates at state colleges. They won praise and more funding from Michigan's governor for their land-use reform work and their campaign to create a regional transit authority promoting city residents' access to jobs outside Detroit's urban core. Leaders also reached out to allies such as unions by helping to lead the Immigrant Workers Freedom Ride, which advocated a clear path to citizenship for immigrants trapped by a broken, overly bureaucratic system.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Nationally-known speakers at the Assembly will include David Rusk, author Cities without Suburbs; Myron Orfield, University of Minnesota Institute of Race and Poverty, and john powell, Kirwin Institute on Race and Ethnicity at Ohio State University. Former Maryland Governor Parris Glendening, known for smart growth policies he pioneered, will be at the Assembly Friday.</FONT></P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p></font><!-- #EndEditable --></td></tr>
