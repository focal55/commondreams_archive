- November 23
-
Over ten thousand people gathered this weekend outside the gates of Ft. Benning, Ga., in the most diverse demonstration yet of opposition to the School of the Americas, renamed Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation (SOA/WHISC), a combat-training school for Latin American soldiers. Hundreds of thousands of Latin Americans have been tortured, raped, assassinated, &quot;disappeared,&quot; and massacred by SOA graduates, according to participating groups.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The gathering culminated today with a solemn &quot;funeral&quot; procession. As of 5 p.m. at least 30 people had been arrested after entering the base in an act of nonviolent civil disobedience.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">They took this action despite knowing they likely face 3-6 months in federal prison. They are being held at the Muscogee County Jail. Since protests against SOA/WHISC began over 10 years ago, 170 people have served or are now serving prison sentences for civil disobedience.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Prison will not deter us,&quot; said Kathy Kelly, who was among those arrested today. &quot;We intend to close this school and to change the foreign policy this school represents.&quot; Kelly works with Voices in the Wilderness, a grassroots organization campaigning to end economic and military warfare against the Iraqi people.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Yesterday the U.S. Military blasted music at high decibels from inside Ft. Benning, directed at the permitted demonstration outside the gates of the base. The music stopped late yesterday afternoon.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Throughout the weekend Columbus Police used metal detectors to search every person attending the demonstration.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;We will not allow these blatantly unconstitutional attempts to drown out our voices,&quot; said Bill Quigley, a professor of law at Loyola Law School, and lawyer for SOA Watch. &quot;These childish actions only strengthen our resolve to stand up for our rights and all the victims of the SOA.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Columbus convergence concludes a week of resistance to empire and corporate globalization. Thousands gathered in Miami to protest the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA), and over 100,000 gathered in London -- during Bush's visit -- to protest the invasion and occupation of Iraq.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The three mobilizations released <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/scriptfiles/news2003/1120-08.htm">a joint statement of solidarity</a>.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;From the SOA, to FTAA, to the invasion of Iraq, our government's foreign policy is serving the interests of a few, and making us a lot of enemies,&quot; said Fr. Roy Bourgeois, founder of SOA Watch.
