- June 23 - The Supreme Court ruled on two cases involving the University of Michigan's affirmative action policy today.  The Gratz v. Bollinger case dealt primarily with the point system used by the University for the purpose of ensuring diversity and was found to be unconstitutional. Yet, in the Grutter v. Bollinger case, the Supreme Court considered whether states have a &quot;compelling interest&quot; in promoting diverse student populations. By a 5-4 margin, Justices endorsed the University of Michigan Law School's program seeking a &quot;critical mass&quot; of minorities and decided that this was not an illegal quota.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The decisions prove to be a mixed bag for both sides of the issue. The concept of affirmative action has been upheld, but the methods by which institutions of higher learning can administer this program are left unclear. What next?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">United States history provides a long and detailed account of the discrimination and prejudices faced by members of racial minorities and by women. Affirmative action promotes integration and equality among all members of society, regardless of race or gender, in the areas of education and employment.  It works to compensate for the disparities these practices created.  Despite the progress being made in diversifying and expanding the representation of racial minorities and women in higher education and in the workforce, much remains to be done.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Educational institutions and corporations must expand efforts to realize the importance of implementing affirmative action policies.  Outreach programs must be established that provide detailed information on the history and current state of affirmative action, in order to effectively promote diversity.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Clearly, the Right Wing's assault on affirmative action will continue, excluding minorities from the justice that America stands for.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The battle is far from over,&quot; says ADA National Director Amy Isaacs. She notes that organizing to express and discuss this issue is critical; the future of a fair society lies in our hands.  We must continue to fight against the inequities and disparities of society that undermine the people and principles of this country.</font></p>
