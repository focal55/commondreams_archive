- December 11 - The Energy Information Agency (EIA) will release their weekly report of natural gas and oil prices today. The report will likely reflect higher prices for natural gas, and it is equally likely that proponents of the pork-laden energy legislation that was stopped in the Senate last month will claim again that had the bill passed, natural gas prices would have been lower. Don&#146;t believe them.</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Nothing in the energy bill would increase the supply or lowered the price of natural gas this winter. It is the height of cynicism for proponents of this legislation, larded with pork such as the construction of a Hooters in Louisiana, to suggest that it provides a meaningful solution to our energy challenges.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Background</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Although the stalled energy bill contains billions of dollars in tax subsidies and royalty &#147;holidays&#148; for the oil and gas industry, there is very little in the bill that will increase the supply of natural gas in the short or medium term. In addition, although the bill provides incentives for the Alaska-to-lower-48 natural gas pipeline, supplies of gas from that source would not reach market for at least a decade.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The gas industry does not need subsidies to increase drilling. In response to the higher prices of last year, there are 30 percent more drilling rigs operating now in the U.S. than at the end of 2002. According to the Bush Administration&#146;s own analysis, 88 percent of the &#147;technically recoverable&#148; gas on federal lands is currently available for leasing and development.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Supplies of natural gas in storage for winter use have increased from unusual lows earlier in the year to slightly above historical levels for this time of year (5 percent above last year&#146;s levels and 4 percent above the five-year average, according to the Enerfax Daily, December 9, 2003.). Previous predictions of severe natural gas shortages this winter are not borne out by the current supply levels.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The best way to immediately reduce price and supply pressures on natural gas is to promote energy efficiency so that less gas is wasted. The American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy very recently released a report entitled Natural Gas Price Effects of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Practices and Policies, which details a variety of ways in which over $100 Billion in savings could be achieved in the next five years (2004-2008).&gt;&gt; <A HREF="javascript:HandleLink('cpe_1218_0','CPNEWWIN:child^toolbar=1,location=1,directory=0,status=1,menubar=1,scrollbars=1,resizable=1@http://aceee.org/energy/efnatgas-study.htm');" TARGET="_new">Read the study</A></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">On a longer term basis, renewable energy (solar, wind, geothermal, and biofuels) has been proven to be effective in reducing the demand for natural gas. In fact, the adoption of a suite of renewable fuels policies can actually reduce the price of natural gas by almost 10 percent, according to a study conducted by the Union of Concerned Scientists.&gt;&gt; <A HREF="javascript:HandleLink('cpe_1218_0','CPNEWWIN:child^toolbar=1,location=1,directory=0,status=1,menubar=1,scrollbars=1,resizable=1@http://www.ucs.org');" TARGET="_new">Read the UCS study</A></FONT></P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p></font><!-- #EndEditable --></td></tr>
