- September 8 - Representative Jim McDermott (D-WA) released the following statement today:</font>

<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;President Bush is about to ask Congress for an additional $87 billion to continue operations in Iraq. That's about three times the homeland security budget.  It would pay for all veterans' programs and benefits for every living American veteran for 15 months.  It represents every federal dollar for transportation for all of this year and the first quarter of next year. He's asking for more than five times what we spend on public assistance for the entire United States.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I did not think the President was right to go into Iraq. Because of his actions, I believe we now have a mortal responsibility to the people and future of Iraq. We cannot abandon them. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, Congress must not give the President a blank check after the many, many missteps that have been made in Iraq.  If this level of mismanagement were found in any other federal program, my colleagues would be demanding it be shut down or turned over to the states. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nation-building is not a strength of the Bush Administration. I think we've all realized that.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nor is diplomacy a strength. Our stance seems to be that any right-thinking ally should salute and say &quot;yes, sir!&quot; whenever the U.S. government speaks. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This Administration must conclude an agreement with the United Nations on security and reconstruction of Iraq.  We cannot go it alone.  We cannot demand total control.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For these reasons, I believe Congress must deny any funding request for Iraq until an agreement with the United Nations has been concluded. The errors of President Bush and those around him must be corrected, not funded.&quot;   </font></p>

<p></p>

<p></p>
