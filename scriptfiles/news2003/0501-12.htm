- May 1 - Using a 

unique methodology that investigates peoples' background 

knowledge on subjects before asking their opinions, Retro Poll 

compares each person's answers to different but related 

questions. This allows an assessment of the extent to which 

background knowledge, or its absence, contributes to particular 

political views. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When Americans hear specific provisions of the USA Patriot 

act, Retro Poll finds, they oppose the intrusions of this law 

into their civil rights by wide margin (average 77 percent). Yet 

when asked what impact the War on Terrorism is having upon civil 

rights, many of the same people say its "strengthening" or 

having "no impact" upon their rights (57 percent). 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This inner confusion is exemplified by a 37-year-old woman 

from Udora, Kansas who rejects each of three provisions of the 

Patriot Act mentioned in the poll and also opposes the use of 

torture and lengthy prison detention without trial; she also 

supports a requirement that the U.S. must prove accusations 

against other nations before attacking them. However, when 

asked: "should the U.S. support international efforts to 

prosecute war crimes," and "should the U.S. make war against Iraq 

or other countries the government accuses of supporting terrorism 

when they are not attacking anyone," this same Kansan hesitated, 

in each case, and replied: "I'm confused. What is Bush for? I 

want to support the president". One might think that the media 

would be fascinated with and want to study this contradictory 

phenomenon. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Retro Poll notes that by reporting overly simplified data that 

shows people in support of the War on Terrorism, the War on Iraq 

and the president, the media polls hide this conflict, concealing 

public resistance to unprovoked war and loss of civil rights. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The current poll looked at the background knowledge of those 

who support unprovoked war in Iraq and elsewhere vs those who 

don't. Those who believe the disinformation that there is 

"evidence that Saddam Hussein worked with the 9-11 terrorists" 

are 2:1 for war (as in a previous Retro Poll), while those who 

challenge this assertion are strongly opposed to war (60 percent 

in this poll and 80 percent in the earlier Retro Poll -- these 

findings are highly significant "p" equals 0.005, "p" is less 

than 0.001). "Support for the war," observed Poll Director Dr. 

Marc Sapir, "is largely the result of media's helping to promote 

false information and fear, via hundreds of appearances by 

officials and pundits offering unchallenged self-serving 

propaganda about threats to our security." 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The current poll explored the issue of the "climate of fear 

in the U.S." Sixty one percent of those polled agreed that 

there is a climate of fear. That group was then given 6 items to 

rate as contributing "much," "some," "little," or "none" to that 

climate of fear. When those who said "much" or "some" for each 

item were combined, the 6 items were ranked as follows: 

terrorist actions (85 percent) media hype (83 percent); failure 

to catch Bin Laden (77 percent); homeland security alerts (73 

percent); poor relations with other nations (71 percent); Saddam 

(71 percent); and the anthrax attacker still on the loose (65 

percent). With "media hype" getting the most votes for "much" 

(57 percent) as a cause of fearfulness, the poll provides 

evidence that the public is very suspicious of the way that TV 

(where 2/3 get their news) and other media process and manipulate 

information. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The random poll reached 215 people from 46 states between 

April 5th and 20th using college student volunteers. Individual 

questions have an error margin of 7 percent, but the correlations 

are significant beyond 99 percent. (more details at
