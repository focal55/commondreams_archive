                CITY, CA - April 3 - Rebuilding Homes, an organization which works 

                with both Israeli and Palestinian citizens to rebuild Palestinian 

                homes demolished by Israeli Defense Forces, today announced the 

                launch of its Rapid Response Rebuilding Program in cooperation 

                with the Israeli Committee Against House Demolitions (ICAHD). 

                The announcement comes on the heels of 16 new demolitions in the 

                Jerusalem area this morning, including the home of Salim Shawamreh, 

                an ICAHD spokesperson. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Though I've 

                never been charged with any crime, this is the fourth time my 

                home is demolished by the IDF," said Shawamreh. "Nevertheless, 

                we will keep rebuilding to let the world know that our families 

                have a right to live on the land we own. With help from all who 

                care, we will start rebuilding as fast as they demolish. We refuse 

                to be enemies." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With the 90 

                Palestinian homes demolished in the past 3 months, the Rapid Response 

                Rebuilding Program is designed to bring world-wide attention to 

                Israel's policy of demolishing Palestinian homes. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Only a small 

                percentage of demolitions are related to Israeli security-related 

                issues," said Donna Baranski-Walker, Campaign Manager of Rebuilding 

                Homes. "The practice is designed to break the Palestinian spirit 

                and family structure. The Rapid Response Rebuilding Program asks 

                people worldwide to support rebuilding to encourage Palestinians 

                and Israelis who are working together, nonviolently and constructively, 

                for a just peace. We are mobilizing now to begin rebuilding Mr. 

                Shawamreh's home and clear debris from 5 other homesites this 

                Saturday." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In each rebuilding 

                effort, Rebuilding Homes, ICAHD, and Palestinian partner the Jerusalem 

                Center for Social and Economic Rights, recruits Israelis to work 

                hand-in-hand with Palestinians to foster solidarity between the 

                two peoples. "Of course our goal is to rebuild homes," said </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Fred Schlomka, 

                ICAHD Operations Manager, "But we're mainly a political organization. 

                Each rebuilding day brings both sides to work together, eat together, 

                and plan next steps. With worldwide support, we'll stop the bulldozers 

                and build momentum for a just peace." </font>
