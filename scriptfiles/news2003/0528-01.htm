- May 28 - French President Jacques Chirac's 

plans for improving access to clean water, due to be put forward at the 

G8 Summit in France on June 1-3, will not tackle the real problems 

faced by developing countries, Friends of the Earth International said 

today.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The French President's Plan to finance 'access to water for all' 

advocates a central role for multinational corporations and the World 

Bank. This Plan will be put forward in a city famous for its bottled water, 

Evian (France).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In reality, the Plan promotes European water giant corporations at the 

expense of the poor, according to Friends of the Earth International.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">European service providers dominate the global water market. The 

world's top two private sector water companies, Vivendi and Suez (both 

French), control 70% of all private water services between them. The 

third largest is Thames Water, now part of German utilities 

conglomerate RWE.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Helene Ballande of Friends of the Earth France said: &quot;Access to water and sanitation are basic rights that should not be 

regulated by the invisible hands of the free market and the interests of</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">water multinationals but should instead be decided democratically by 

the people of each country.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">European Union (E.U.) countries also plan to promote in Evian their 

own EU Water Fund initiative. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The E.U. Water Fund, to be presented at the G8 summit in Evian, 

seems more about corporate welfare than helping the world's poorest. 

The EU plan builds on controversial proposals by former IMF director 

Michel Camdessus, to use aid money to subsidise the expansion of 

private water corporations,&quot; according to Olivier Hoedeman of 

Corporate Europe Observatory (CEO), a Friends of the Earth affiliate 

group.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Confidential documents obtained by CEO show how the EU's executive 

European Commission has worked in tandem with Suez and other giant water corporations in developing its international water initiatives. [1]</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">More than 100 organisations from across the globe this week issued an 

'Evian Water Challenge' to the leaders of the four European nations 

that make up half of the G8. The organisations demand that France, 

Germany, Italy and Britain halt their push to carve up the world's water</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">services for the benefit of big business through a trade agreement 

being negotiated across the lake from Evian, at the World Trade 

Organisation (WTO) in Geneva.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite their rethoric in Evian, the reality is that G8 countries are 

prioritizing water companies protected by the WTO rather than poor 

people and their right of access to water, according to Friends of the 

Earth.</font></p>
