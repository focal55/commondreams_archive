<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 
- November 5 -  Today conservationists praised Reps. Maurice Hinchey (D-N.Y.) and Charles Bass (R-N.H.) for introducing legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives to protect America&#146;s last wild and genetically pure buffalo. The Yellowstone Buffalo Preservation Act would end years of seasonal hazing, capture, and killing of buffalo in and around Yellowstone National Park by federal and state agencies until specific, common-sense conditions are met. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#147;The Yellowstone buffalo herd should have the freedom to roam our federal lands like any other wildlife,&#148; said Congressman Hinchey, who serves on the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee which has jurisdiction over the U.S. Department of Interior and the U.S. Forest Service. &#147;The current policy of hazing and slaughtering these majestic animals is unnecessary and shameful. My legislation will put an end to these misguided management practices and ensure that our federal agencies act as proper stewards of this wildlife icon.&#148;</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Acknowledging that the American buffalo (Bison bison) has profound ecological, cultural, historical, and symbolic significance to the United States, the Hinchey-Bass bill mandates efforts to allow Yellowstone buffalo to use public lands, including U.S. Forest Service lands next to Yellowstone National Park, through incentives and cooperative efforts with adjacent private landowners and ensures buffalo within the park are under the sole jurisdiction of the National Park Service.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Congressmen Hinchey and Bass deserve thanks for standing up for buffalo,&#148; said Sue Gunn of The Wilderness Society. &#147;This bill has the strong support of dozens of conservation and wildlife organizations representing millions of American citizens.&#148;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Yellowstone&#146;s buffalo are an American icon that thrill tens of thousands of park visitors every year. People find it inconceivable that this symbol of the American west is routinely slaughtered for simply roaming onto public lands next to Yellowstone National Park,&#148; said Tony Jewett of the National Parks Conservation Association.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In winter and early spring months over the past decade, nearly 3,000 Yellowstone buffalo have been slaughtered to minimize the possibility of disease transmission to cattle. Buffalo can carry brucellosis, a disease that poses little risk to them. In March 2003, 231 park buffalo were captured within Yellowstone by park rangers and shipped to slaughterhouses. In recent years the Park Service and the U.S. Forest Service have supported the Montana Department of Livestock in the hazing and killing of hundreds more. The hazing, roundup, and slaughter of Yellowstone buffalo, costing millions of dollars, is carried out supposedly to safeguard cattle interests. However, less than five hundred cows graze near Yellowstone National Park during the summer months, and about half that number in winter when buffalo leave the park.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Buffalo and cattle can coexist,&#148; said Michael Scott of the Montana-based Greater Yellowstone Coalition. &#147;There&#146;s never been a recorded transmission of brucellosis from buffalo to cattle in the wild and the alleged threat just isn&#146;t scientifically credible. This is about values; whether or not we&#146;re willing to make room for a few wild buffalo on America&#146;s public lands.&#148;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;We owe it to the American people to adopt a more effective management policy for Yellowstone's buffalo? one that is ethically and fiscally responsible,&#148; said Wayne Pacelle of The Humane Society of the United States. &#147;In 1999, taxpayers spent $13 million to secure federal land just north of Yellowstone to allow buffalo to seasonally migrate in and out of the park, but without political will that deal has yet to be completed. This bill provides the incentives to put a reasonable management approach on track, complete the aforementioned land deal, and save the majestic Yellowstone buffalo.&#148;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Yellowstone is our first and foremost national park, and the buffalo is one of our most cherished American animals,&#148; said Michael Markarian of The Fund for Animals. &#147;It&#146;s time for Congress to direct the federal agencies? whose very symbol is the buffalo? to engage in buffalo protection, not persecution.&#148;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dan Brister of the Montana-based Buffalo Field Campaign characterized the 2003 killings by the Park Service as &#147;out of step with the will of the American people.&#148; Praising the Hinchey bill, Brister said, &#147;Federal agencies have no business carrying out dirty work urged by the Montana livestock interests and nobody else? the American people won&#146;t tolerate it much longer. If ever there&#146;s a litmus test for basic conservation values, the Yellowstone Buffalo Preservation Act is it.&#148;</font></p>
