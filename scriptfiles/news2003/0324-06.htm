                has objected to Iraq broadcasting photos of U.S. POWs, the U.S. 

                government has allowed the very same thing.... Photos of Taliban 

                prisoners of war and John Walker Lindh were continually broadcast 

                on U.S. media outlets. The Pentagon is refusing to abide by the

                obligations of the U.S. to provide water immediately to the people 

                of Basra where the water system is cut off, noting the U.S. military

                A professor of expert systems at George Washington University, 

                Nagy wrote the article "The Secret Behind the Sanctions: How the 

                U.S. Intentionally Destroyed Iraq's Water Supply" for the Progressive 

                magazine. Nagy notes that the Geneva Conventions (Article 54) 

                state that "It is prohibited to attack, destroy, remove or render 

                useless objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian 

                population, such as ... drinking water installations..." Nagy 

                has uncovered a Defense Intelligence Agency document written right 

                before the Gulf War which spells out how sanctions would prevent 

                Iraq from supplying clean water to its citizens: "Iraq depends 

                on importing specialized equipment and some chemicals to purify 

                its water supply," the 1991 document states. "With no domestic 

                sources of both water treatment replacement parts and some essential 

                chemicals, Iraq will continue attempts to circumvent U.N. Sanctions 

                to import these vital commodities. Failing to secure supplies 

                will result in a shortage of pure drinking water for much of the 

                population. This could lead to increased incidences, if not epidemics, 

                of disease." Nagy has recently uncovered the Air Force's Doctrine 

                Document 2-1.2 of May 1998 entitled "Strategic Attack," which 

                includes an analysis of Desert Storm: "The loss of electricity 

                shut down the capital's water treatment plants and led to a public 

                health crisis from raw sewage dumped in the Tigris River." This 

                is under the section entitled "Elements of Effective Operations."
