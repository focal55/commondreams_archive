July 23 - Statement of NARAL Pro-Choice America President Kate Michelman.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Judiciary Committee has given its approval to an unreconstructed anti-choice activist. Now, it&#146;s up to the full Senate to protect Americans&#146; rights to privacy and choice. Mr. Pryor has called Roe v Wade an &#147;abominable decision.&#148; The truly abominable decision would be giving him a lifetime seat on the federal bench. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

The Senate has taken up Pryor&#146;s nomination just after the Supreme Court, in Lawrence v. Texas, resoundingly affirmed the basic Constitutional freedom Pryor has devoted his career to undermining: the right to privacy. Pryor, a hardened crusader against a woman&#146;s right to choose, possesses neither the dispassionate judgment nor the respect for precedent required in a federal judge. He opposes abortion even in cases of rape and incest, placing him on the most extreme end of the ideological spectrum.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the current political environment in which both houses of Congress are controlled by anti-choice leadership, a federal judge hostile to women&#146;s privacy rights can do serious damage. Since so few cases reach the Supreme Court, lower federal courts are often the last place women can turn. They deserve an open mind and a dispassionate ear from federal judges, not the confrontational activism of which Pryor has made his career.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Senate must reject Bill Pryor. He is yet another anti-choice nominee the federal court system does not need</font>.</p>

<p></p>
