                - March 31 - Catholics for a Free Choice today released a groundbreaking 

                publication on the rights of Catholics, &quot;Catholics and Abortion: 

                Notes on Canon Law.&quot; This is the first in a series of publications 

                in which CFFC aims to educate Catholics on what the body of church 

                law known as canon law says about issues such as abortion, divorce 

                and remarriage. The publication was written by CFFC senior associate 

                and canon lawyer Sara Morello. </font> 

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;When 

                  it comes to canon law and abortion, the right wing extremists 

                  often claim to be experts,&quot; said Frances Kissling, president 

                  of Catholics for a Free Choice. &quot;However, their interpretation 

                  of canon law is flawed and often intentionally distorted,&quot; 

                  said Kissling. &quot;For example, unsubstantiated claims are 

                  made that prochoice Catholics are heretics whose beliefs make 

                  them subject to excommunication,&quot; she said. </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Kissling 

                  said specific examples of this distortion includes recent attacks 

                  on prochoice legislators, including such influential lawmakers 

                  as California Gov. Gray Davis, Sen. Edward Kennedy and the late 

                  President John F. Kennedy, which suggested that their votes 

                  put them at risk for excommunication or denial of the sacraments. 

                  The failure of the church hierarchy to reveal the truth about 

                  church law and abortion prompted CFFC to produce this publication, 

                  she said. </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Because 

                  the church hierarchy has done little to set the record straight 

                  or to distance themselves from those who misinterpret church 

                  law for their own purposes, we offer this publication to explain 

                  what church law really says about abortion,&quot; Kissling said. 

                  </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Kissling 

                  said this work, an effort to enlighten prochoice Catholics about 

                  their rights, presents fundamental concepts about canon law 

                  in general and about its provisions regarding abortion in particular. 

                  This work, however, is equally valuable to non-Catholics wanting 

                  to understand some of the heated discussion about these issues. 

                  </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We 

                  respect the church's law,&quot; said Kissling. &quot;We respect, 

                  too, the law's emphasis on the protection of people's rights. 

                  We hope that this publication provides a deeper understanding 

                  of the law as well as provide guidance for Catholics who are 

                  concerned about making wise personal choices within the framework 

                  of church law.&quot; </font></p>
