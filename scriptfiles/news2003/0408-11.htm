                - APRIL 8 - The facts on the ground do not bear out the environmental 

                reassurances offered by advocates of oil drilling in the Arctic 

                National Wildlife Refuge, according to state and federal agency 

                sources cited in Broken Promises: The Reality of Big Oil in America's 

                Arctic. The report, issued by the Wilderness Society today, compares 

                the public relations claims made by drilling proponents to the 

                oil industry's track record and recent actions in the oil fields 

                of Alaska's North Slope. (Download the full report at <a href="http://www.wilderness.org/NewsRoom/Release/20030408.cfm" target="_new">http://www.wilderness.org/NewsRoom/Release/20030408.cfm</a>)

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For decades, 

                proponents of opening the Coastal Plain of the Arctic National 

                Wildlife Refuge to oil development have repeatedly claimed that 

                oil drilling would not harm the environment of the Refuge. As 

                evidence, they say drilling on Alaska's North Slope has been clean, 

                and cite several factors they say will make future development 

                environmentally benign. They profess a commitment to strict environmental 

                regulation, and they assert that new technologies - particularly 

                ice roads and directional drilling - would further reduce the 

                impact of drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Broken Promises 

                assesses those claims by comparing them with the documented impact 

                of past and present North Slope oil development, the industry's 

                environmental track record at Prudhoe Bay and in the National 

                Petroleum Reserve - Alaska (NPR-A), real technological trends 

                in the oil industry, and other factors. The result is a clear 

                record of broken promises on the North Slope that casts serious 

                doubt on the reassurances being made by drilling proponents and 

                their allies today. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among the report's 

                findings are the following: </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Drilling 

                is not environmentally benign: While industry and its political 

                allies argue that drilling on the North Slope has been environmentally 

                responsible and limited to a small "footprint," the Prudhoe Bay 

                field encompasses an industrial complex covering more than 1000 

                square miles. The National Academy of Sciences recently confirmed 

                that North Slope drilling operations cause environmental impacts 

                far beyond the industrial facilities themselves, including harmful 

                air and water pollution and disruptions to wildlife and wilderness. 

                Oil companies have been fined millions of dollars in recent years 

                for environmental and safety violations on the North Slope. Native 

                Alaskans from villages close to the Alpine oil field have increasingly 

                raised concerns about the rising incidence of asthma in their 

                villages and threats to the wildlife on which their subsistence 

                culture depends. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- The "winter 

                only" fallacy: Alaska politicians insist that oil exploration 

                in the Arctic would only occur in the winter. However, they rarely 

                mention that once oil is discovered, oil production activities 

                actually occur year-round. Summer production is particularly harmful 

                to wildlife, but even during the winter months oil exploration 

                has scarred the tundra and can cause disruption to polar bears, 

                musk oxen, and other year-round residents of the area. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Ice roads 

                are a smoke screen: Drilling proponents often claim that using 

                ice roads will minimize the impact of oil exploration and drilling. 

                However, rising temperatures caused by global warming have shrunk 

                the season during which ice-roads are practical by 40 percent 

                in recent years, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has suggested 

                there isn't enough fresh water in the Coastal Plain of the Arctic 

                National Wildlife Refuge to build the ice roads that would be 

                needed. Even the newest onshore oil fields on the North Slope 

                contain permanent gravel roads, and there are many proposals for 

                new roads. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Environmental 

                standards for North Slope drilling are getting weaker, not stronger: 

                Drilling advocates often promise that the strictest environmental 

                standards would be applied to Arctic Refuge oil development. Sadly, 

                regulation of the oil industry in Alaska has been weakening in 

                recent years, with Alaska Governor Frank Murkowski undermining 

                state environmental oversight and the U.S. Department of the Interior 

                rolling back federal regulations in the neighboring National Petroleum 

                Reserve - Alaska. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On March 19, 

                the US Senate voted 52-48 to strip Arctic drilling from the FY 

                2004 budget resolution. On Wednesday, the House of Representatives 

                is expected to debate energy legislation that includes language 

                opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas development.

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Drilling in 

                the Refuge would ruin one of America's most special places for 

                a few months' worth of oil that wouldn't get here for ten years," 

                said Jim Waltman, Director of Wildlife and Refuges Programs at 

                The Wilderness Society. "Policy makers evaluating proposals to 

                open the Arctic Refuge to oil drilling should look carefully at 

                the industry's promises, and its track record, before casting 

                their votes."
