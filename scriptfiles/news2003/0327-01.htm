                - March 27 - Mairead Corrigan Maguire and Jody Williams, two former 

                winners of the Nobel Peace Prize, and dozens of religious leaders 

                jumped barricades close to The White House to protest the Bush 

                administration's war against Iraq. Maguire, the 1976 Nobel Peace 

                Prize winner, and Williams, the 1997 recipient, joined United 

                Methodist Bishop C. Joseph Sprague, Roman Catholic bishop Thomas 

                Gumbleton, and former Defense Department official Daniel Ellsberg 

                in leading a group of 68 demonstrators arrested Wednesday afternoon 

                by D.C. Park Police. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"I am here 

                to break the law because my conscience tells me I must, and because 

                each of us have a moral responsibility to do all we can, in a 

                nonviolent way, to oppose the evil of this immoral act of aggression 

                and war by the United Kingdom/United States administrations, against 

                the will of we the people of the world," said Maguire. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At a press 

                conference just prior to the action, Bishop Sprague explained 

                his reasons for undertaking an action of nonviolent civil disobedience. 

                "The United Methodist bishops have sent four letters to the president 

                and vice president, whom many of you know are both Methodists, 

                seeking a meeting to discuss this war," stated Sprague. He went 

                on to say that that they only received "one terse reply" from 

                the Bush administration and no meeting. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The leaders 

                of the action marched to Lafayette Park at the corner of Madison 

                and H Street, where D.C. Park Police had closed and barricaded 

                the park. Individually and in small groups, protestors began jumping 

                the barricades in order to gain access to the park, where they 

                held a solemn prayer service mourning the victims of this war 

                and challenging the Bush administration to put an end to the violence. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Protest organizers, 

                anticipating the park closure, had earlier instructed a separate 

                group of demonstrators to enter the park, well before the planned 

                action. As the first group of protestors began to breach barricades 

                at Madison and H Street, the unrecognized protestors already inside 

                the park crossed barricades onto Pennsylvania Avenue and led a 

                prayerful witness directly in front of The White House. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bishop Gumbleton 

                of Detroit, who traveled to Iraq in January, was among those arrested 

                in Wednesday's action. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"As people 

                of faith and conscience, we proclaim that it is a grave sin to 

                support this war," said Gumbleton. "We cannot stand silent while 

                the Bush administration murders innocent men, women and children." 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 68 arrested 

                were charged and released by 9 p.m. Ten of those charged were 

                instructed to appear in court on April 18; the remainder were 

                ordered to appear May 29. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nearly every 

                religious denomination in the world has condemned the Bush administration's 

                war against Iraq as a crime against peace," said Dave Robinson, 

                national coordinator of Pax Christi USA. "Today, Buddhists, Jews, 

                Christians, Muslims, human rights and peace activists united our 

                voices against a war which is immoral, unjust, unethical and unnecessary."
