                - April 1 - Funding for the war on Iraq, while requiring massive 

                cuts in social spending for health, education, services, and welfare 

                and reduction of veterans benefits, is becoming a huge windfall 

                for favored corporations, say members of the Green Party of the 

                United States. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This $100-billion 

                war is proving a cash cow for corporations, especially those with 

                connections to the White House, Congress, and the Pentagon, while 

                U.S. troops and Iraqi civilians and soldiers face death and injury," 

                said Tom Bolema, Town Councilperson (Green) of Juniper Hills, 

                California. "European governments are furious that the administration 

                plans to award the major contracts, worth somewhere between $20 

                billion and $100 billion, to U.S. corporations, without any competitive 

                bidding process." </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The Bush Administration 

                has already awarded Halliburton subsidiary Kellogg Brown & Root 

                a Pentagon contract to rebuild Iraqi oil fields," said Jake Schneider, 

                treasurer of the Green Party of the United States. "USAID awarded 

                a $4.8 million contract to Stevedoring Services of America to 

                manage the Umm Qasr port. Companies like the Bechtel Group, Fluor 

                Corporation, Parsons Group and defense contractors Carlyle Group 

                and Global Crossing are expected to make millions off the war. 

                Humanitarian relief, including assistance in Iraq's water shortage, 

                is proving a distant second in priority behind military deals 

                and control over Iraqi oil." </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The nonpartisan 

                Center for Responsive Politics documents that Halliburton (for 

                which Vice President Cheney served as CEO from 1995 to 2000), 

                Bechtel, Fluor, and Parsons contributed a combined $2.64 million 

                to political campaigns between 1999 and 2002, with 68 percent 

                of those dollars given to Republicans. </font>

                most controversially in Cochabamba," said Mark Dunlea, chair of 

                the Green Party of New York State. "Will Bechtel use its current 

                connections and postwar influence to take over Iraqi resources?"

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*** According 

                to the Sustainable Energy and Economy Network and the Institute 

                for Policy Studies, current Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld 

                and then Secretary of State George Shultz, acting on behalf of 

                Bechtel, began negotiating a deal with Saddam in 1983 to open 

                up the Aqaba pipeline through Iraq. Saddam's rejection resulted 

                in the first rift in U.S.-Iraq relations. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*** An investigation 

                by the Center for Public Integrity revealed that nine members 

                of the Pentagon's Defense Policy Board have ties to major defense 

                contractors. (The exposure of Richard Perle's conflicts of interest 

                connections with Global Crossing led to Perle's resignation as 

                board chair last week, but Perle will retain a seat on the board.)

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*** Massive 

                new powers for Vice President Cheney to classify U.S. documents 

                will ensure less oversight and accountability, shielding contractors 

                and government officials with conflicts of interest from public 

                scrutiny. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"These deals 

                reveal that the major motivation for the invasion has less to 

                do with concern for liberation, an already dubious promise under 

                prolonged U.S. occupation, than with giving the U.S. corporate 

                and political control over Iraq and its resources," said Ben Manski, 

                Wisconsin and national party co-chair. "It's a situation comparable 

                to Enron's looting of Croatia when the Clinton Administration 

                awarded it a contract to help rebuild that nation after the conflict 

                in the former Yugoslavia in the early 1990s. What we're seeing 

                now is Enron politics at its worst."
