<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">NEW YORK - March 23 - Last week, a FAIR action alert (3/18/04) raised questions about PBS NewsHour host Jim Lehrer's curious &quot;editor's note&quot; regarding comments made by independent journalist Christian Parenti on the program's March 2 broadcast.  The program is now issuing a response to the hundreds of activists who have written to the show.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Parenti raised the possibility that corruption and mismanagement of the rebuilding contracts in Iraq were contributing to the insurgency against the American-led occupation of the country.  Those comments apparently provoked a response from Lehrer, who explained two days later (3/4/04) that &quot;a discussion about Iraq ended up not being as balanced as is our standard practice. While unintentional, it was our mistake, and we regret it.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">A NewsHour producer told the Village Voice (3/17/04) that Parenti's response to the question &quot;was not reportage, this was giving his opinion, and that's not why we brought him on.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">FAIR questioned why Parenti's comments, which were not factually inaccurate, would be singled out for an on-air apology-- particularly when other journalists brought on the NewsHour have expressed strong opinions (albeit ones that are more consistent with conventional wisdom).</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Responding to FAIR activists, NewsHour Executive Producer Les Crystal has sent the following email:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Dear sir or madam,</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In response to your recent email I would like to explain the rationale for Jim Lehrer's Editor's Note on the NewsHour on March 1 [sic].</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">We have no quarrel with what Christian Parenti said at the end of the segment in which he was interviewed. He was asked a question and appropriately gave us his answer. Our concern was with the lack of another view. We should have asked the other guest, Professor Juan Cole, for his reaction.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Balance is one of our most important standards. It is a signature characteristic of the program. We believe our viewers value it as much as we do. Therefore, we decided to acknowledge that we regretted the imbalance which occurred.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Thanks for writing and for you interest in the NewsHour. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Sincerely,</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Les Crystal</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Executive Producer, NewsHour with Jim Lehrer</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Crystal's explanation is very different from the comments NewsHour producers gave to the Voice, which were clearly directed at the content of Parenti's response.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">But more importantly, the NewsHour's policy still seems inconsistently applied.  Do the opinions of all guests require a balancing perspective, or was there something unique about Parenti's criticisms of Bush administration policies?</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">As FAIR noted, factually inaccurate statements made on the NewsHour by Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld (9/18/02) passed without comment, either by Lehrer or another guest.  (See FAIR Action Alert, 9/20/02.)  It remains curious that Parenti's words would be singled out for an apology.</FONT></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
