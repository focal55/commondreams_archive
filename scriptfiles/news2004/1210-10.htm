Reproductive rights are human rights. The right to decide for ourselves whether and when to have children free of government interference is a basic human right that no one can be allowed to take away from us.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Self-determination and freedom are the basis of human rights. Women, men and teens around the world have a right to reproductive freedom, health care, and education. Today, on Human Rights Day, we celebrate the achievements of those who have come before us and recommit ourselves to fighting forward until our right to determine our reproductive destiny is understood as essential to human freedom.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Planned Parenthood Federation of America is the nation's largest and most trusted voluntary reproductive health organization. We believe that everyone has the right to choose when or whether to have a child -- and that every child should be wanted and loved. Planned Parenthood affiliates operate nearly 850 health centers nationwide, providing medical services and sexuality education for millions of women, men, and teenagers each year. </i></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
