<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - September 2 - Coast to Coast: As Americans head out in droves to the coasts this Labor Day weekend, the Sierra Club is releasing a report that documents how and where Bush administration policies are threatening America&#146;s coastal treasures and what we can do to save them. &quot;No Day at the Beach: How the Bush Administration Is Eroding Coastal Protection&quot; is a comprehensive look at the Bush administration policies that threaten America&#146;s four coasts: the Atlantic, the Pacific, the Gulf of Mexico, and America&#146;s Freshwater Coast, the Great Lakes. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report is available at <a href="http://www.sierraclub.org/coastalreport" target="_new">http://www.sierraclub.org/coastalreport</a>. The Sierra Club is also running print ads in Santa Barbara, California; Sarasota, Florida; and Green Bay, Wisconsin, this week to highlight the report and the threats to those coasts. The ads can be viewed at http://www.sierraclub.org/pressroom/media/.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;As Americans are stocking the coolers and packing the beach chairs and towels for the last beach weekend of the summer, we&#146;re asking them to consider the future of their favorite coastal spots,&quot; said Carl Pope, Sierra Club Executive Director. &quot;This Sierra Club report documents how America&#146;s coasts are under siege by a host of Bush administration policies. Everyone should be asking, &#145;Will my favorite beach spot or ocean view look the same next year? Will the fish at the local seafood restaurant be safe to eat?&#146;&quot; </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report details the administration policies and philosophies that threaten the safety of the fish we eat and the beaches where children learn to swim, and the beauty of the scenic backdrop along 95,000 miles of America&#146;s coasts. The report details the following major threats to America&#146;s coastlines:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot; Mercury contamination</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot; Nutrient and sewage pollution</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot; Oil and gas development in sensitive coastal areas </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot; Destruction of coastal wild lands and wetlands </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report also uncovers several disturbing patterns of decision-making by the Bush administration when it comes to coastal policies. Among them are a steady erosion of general environmental protections, cuts in funding for coastal and environmental protection programs, subsidizing pollution and corporate welfare, and manipulation or suppression of science.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;In four short years, the Bush administration has led the greatest erosion of environmental protections America has ever seen, and our beaches, oceans, and coastal communities are no exception,&quot; said Pope. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To date, administration policies have given America outdated energy proposals, polluted runoff, mercury in our fish, burgeoning dead zones, and depleted fish and wildlife. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;If left unchecked, the Bush administration&#146;s misguided policies and misplaced priorities could strangle our waters with mercury and other pollution, spoil our horizons with oil rigs, and cripple coastal economies that depend on healthy coasts and oceans,&quot; said Pope. &quot;There is a better way. We can protect our coastal resources while preserving our coastal economy.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among the solutions outlined in the report are promoting cleaner, cheaper, and safer energy solutions that preserve America&#146;s wild heritage, enforcing the laws that protect our health and safety, and renewing the commitment to stewardship of public trust lands and waters.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Recently, two major reports on the health of our coasts and oceans have revealed just how imperiled these resources are. Both the bipartisan Pew Oceans Commission report, America&#146;s Living Oceans, Charting a Course for Change (<a href="http://www.pewoceans.org/oceans/index.asp" target="_new">www.pewoceans.org/oceans/index.asp</a>), and the Preliminary Report of the American Oceans Commission (<a href="http://www.oceancommission.gov/documents/prelimreport" target="_new">www.oceancommission.gov/documents/prelimreport</a>) agree that our coasts and the oceans upon which much of humanity depends are in serious trouble. These reports together aggregate the many warnings that have been made by scientists and coastal managers for decades. </font></p><p></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
