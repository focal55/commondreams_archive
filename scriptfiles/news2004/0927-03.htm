<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - September 27 - Sierra Club officials today voiced their support for residents of two small Indonesian villages that have filed charges against Newmont, a Denver-based mining company. Residents have accused Newmont of dumping cancer causing toxins in area waters. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Sierra Club has also declared its opposition to comments by the U.S. Embassy in Indonesia in defense of Newmont. On September 24th, embassy representatives stated that police questioning of Newmont officials in regards to the criminal charges could &#145;harm the country&#146;s efforts to attract investment.'</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The U.S Embassy&#146;s actions are a dangerous example of the Bush administration&#146;s misguided foreign policy,&quot; said Stephen Mills, Director of the Sierra Club&#146;s International Program. &quot;No country or community should be pressured into accepting that its children will be poisoned in exchange for development.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Residents of the Indonesian coastal fishing villages of Buyat and Ratatotok have filed criminal charges against Newmont, the world's largest gold producer, for illegally disposing of mine waste containing arsenic and mercury in ocean waters near the mine site. Villagers claim the company&#146;s pollution has destroyed their livelihoods and caused numerous health problems - including cancers and deformities in children. Newmont officials were detained and questioned by Indonesian police on Friday. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Bush administration is defending a company known for leaving toxic pollution in its wake around the world, rather than a poor community seeking environmental justice,&quot; stated Mills. &quot;While we do not believe it necessary that company officials be detained prior to a hearing, we do believe that these officials should be held accountable for the company's pollution and cooperate fully with any investigation.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This is not the first time charges have been brought against Newmont&#146;s polluting activities. Earlier this year, residents of Choropampa, Peru filed a similar suit against Newmont. Residents charge that local health problems were the result of a toxic spill of mercury from a truck originating from the company&#146;s Yanacocha mine. 330 pounds of liquid mercury were released in the spill.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Corporate exploitation of local communities for financial gain is commonplace throughout many developing countries. In April, the Sierra Club magazine Sierra exposed the secret relationship between the Denver-based mining company Echo Bay and its financial support for an Al-Qaeda linked terrorist organization in the Philippines under the auspices of 'international security.' Additionally, the New Orleans-based Freeport McMoran has been charged with dumping 120,000 tons of  waste per day into an Indonesian river.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The transgressions of American companies operating abroad reflect poorly on our country and damage our national security,&quot; said Mills. &quot;Pollution is wrong no matter where it occurs, and the residents of poor communities around the world have the right to know that many Americans support their demand for environmental justice.&quot;</font></p><p></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
