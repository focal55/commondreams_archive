<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BRAZIL -- November 22 -- An attack on an MST (Landless Rural Workers' Movement) campsite in Minas, Gerais state, on Saturday left five people dead and many more injured. Reports state that the attack was carried out by a large group of gunmen who wore hoods to protect their identity. </font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The long history of impunity for those who commit human rights violations and other acts of violence against the MST and other rural activists paved the way for Saturday's murders,&quot; Amnesty International said. &quot;We condemn the attack and call on the authorities to immediately investigate and bring those responsible to justice.&quot; </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The killings come after the latest appeal hearing for the 1996 El Dorado massacre in which 19 members of the MST were killed by military policemen in Par&aacute; state. Although the hearing upheld the convictions of the officers who commanded the operation, it appears a further 128 policemen suspected of involvement in the massacre will never be tried for their part. <br></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
