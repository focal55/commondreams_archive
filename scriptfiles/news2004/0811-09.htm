<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - August 11 - Green Party leaders and candidates responded quickly to the recent clarification by Democratic nominee John Kerry that he would have voted to authorize the invasion of Iraq, even if he had known that Saddam Hussein possessed no weapons of mass destruction.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Sen. Kerry's remarks suggest that he's as likely as President Bush is to invade countries that don't pose a threat to the United States,&quot; said Pat LaMarche, the Green Party's nominee for Vice President.  &quot;Except for changes in strategy, Kerry would maintain Bush policy on Iraq, including the occupation.  The invasion, occupation, and transfer of Iraqi resources and business to foreign ownership have inflamed animosity around the world against the U.S., destroyed sympathy and good will for the U.S. after the 9/11 attacks, and placed Americans at greater risk of terrorism.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Kerry, in an August 9 news briefing at the edge of the Grand Canyon, said &quot;Yes, I would have voted for the authority [of President Bush to declare war].  I believe it was the right authority to have.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The U.S. Constitution doesn't give the President authority to declare war,&quot; said Daryl Northrop, Iowa Green candidate for the U.S. Senate.  &quot;It grants this authority to Congress, in order to limit executive power.  When Congress, including Kerry, voted in October 2002 to surrender this authority to the President Bush, they violated one of the foundations of American democracy.  Kerry and most of his fellow Democrats also voted for the USA Patriot Act.  The Constitution will be at risk whether Kerry or Bush is elected.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Green Party of the United States and Green presidential nominee David Cobb have called for an end to the occupation of Iraq and the rapid return of U.S. troops.  The party, citing a list of deceptions by the Bush Administration, endorsed a resolution in July 2003 urging impeachment of President Bush.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many Greens will participate in antiwar rallies in New York City during the Republican National Convention, and will attend an event titled 'A Green World Is Possible: A Festival of Non-Violence, Ecology, Democracy, Social and Economic Justice' on August 28 in Washington Square <a href="http://www.gp.org/event_08_28_04.html" target="_new">http://www.gp.org/event_08_28_04.html</a>.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
