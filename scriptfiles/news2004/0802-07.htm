<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - August 2 - The National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty today urged Alabama Gov. Bob Riley to spare a 74-year-old man who is scheduled to be executed Thursday, Aug. 5.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">James Hubbard, who is suffering from both colon cancer and prostate cancer, would be the oldest person ever executed in the state of Alabama and the oldest person executed in the United States since 1941, when the state of Colorado executed 76-year-old James Stephens.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Even if one supported the death penalty, it is difficult to understand what purpose James Hubbard's execution would serve,&quot; said David Elliot, NCADP communications director. &quot;Executive clemency exists to prevent miscarriages of justice when the courts cannot or will not act. This is a clear case for mercy.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hubbard was sentenced to death for the 1977 murder of his girlfriend, Lillian Montgomery, in Tuscaloosa County. In 1980, Alabama's death penalty statutes were declared unconstitutional; in 1982, he was again tried and sentenced to death. He has spent more than two decades on death row.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So far this year, governors in three states and a parole board in a fourth state have granted clemency to four people facing execution. In Texas, Robert Smith was granted clemency due to mental retardation. In Oklahoma, Osvaldo Torres was granted clemency because of consular notification issues. In Indiana, Darnell Williams was granted clemency due to possible actual innocence. And in Georgia, the state parole board granted clemency to Willie James Hall, in part because of his exemplary record in prison and lack of prior convictions and in part because six jurors said they would have voted for life in prison without parole instead of for death had they known life without parole was an option.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Alabama, the last person to receive clemency while awaiting execution was Judith Ann Neelley, whose sentence was commuted to life without parole by former Gov. Fob James.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
