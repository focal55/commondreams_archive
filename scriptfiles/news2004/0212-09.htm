<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - February 12 - &#147;This is no more a budget than a chorus of kazoos is the U.S. Marine Corps Band,&#148; Congressman David Obey today told Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld during a House appropriations hearing on the Bush Administration&#146;s 2005 Budget request.  Obey said his concerns about the budget were more about what it did not include, rather than what it did.  The Wisconsin Democrat, Ranking Member on the House Appropriations Committee, pointed out that the Administration&#146;s $401.7 billion defense budget contains no funding for:  </FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Expected costs for the war in Iraq next year, which the Administration has already acknowledged could require at least $50 billion;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Army&#146;s five-year plan to increase the number of combat units by 15 additional brigades and as many as 30,000 troops; or</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The repair and replacement of equipment for units now beginning to rotate back to their bases after extended deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;We need to start with a budget that forthrightly lays out our expectations,&#148; Obey said during the appearance of Secretary Rumsfeld and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Richard B. Myers, before the Defense Appropriation Subcommittee. &#147;The Administration&#146;s approach, which leaves gaping holes in the public&#146;s ability to know what their government is doing and what it&#146;s going to cost, totally corrupts the debate in Congress over the shape of the budget.&#148; </FONT></P><P> </P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
