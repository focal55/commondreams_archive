<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - April 1 - Kate Michelman, President of NARAL Pro-Choice America issued the following statement today in response to President Bush&#146;s expected signing of legislation granting separate legal status to embryos and fetuses: </FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Everyone agrees on the need to protect pregnant women and the developing lives within them from harm &#150; and with just a few phone calls, the President could have persuaded Congress to pass a consensus bill doing so without entangling it in the abortion rights issue.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Instead, with his second major anti-choice bill signing in six months, President Bush is making his priorities clear -- and curtailing women&#146;s privacy and the right to choose is at the top of the list. President Bush is making good on his pledge to do everything in his power to restrict a woman&#146;s right to choose.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Pro-choice Americans aren&#146;t going to forget this President&#146;s record, with its steady drumbeat of attacks on reproductive freedom. We&#146;re going to send him a strong message with our March on Washington April 25 that we won&#146;t stand silently by as our rights are taken away.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">This bill joins a list of anti-choice actions by the Bush Administration that include: </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&middot; Signing the first-ever federal law criminalizing abortion;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&middot; Subpoenaing private medical records of thousands of women who&#146;ve had abortions;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&middot; Nominating scores of anti-choice judges to lifetime seats on the federal bench &#150; and forcing two of the most extreme past the Senate without a vote through recess appointments;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&middot; Reimposing the global gag rule, barring U.S. aid to international family planning programs that provide counseling on abortion; and</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&middot; Shifting funds toward dangerous abstinence-only education programs that censor information about contraception.</FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
