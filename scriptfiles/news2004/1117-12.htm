<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- November 17 -- A new study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association finds that smog is directly linked to deaths from heart and lung ailments in major U.S. metropolitan areas. With this troubling new evidence, the Bush Administration and Congress must make it a priority to save thousands of lives by enforcing and strengthening the Clean Air Act and by providing Americans with better transportation choices.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The November 17th issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association includes an extensive study titled, &quot;Ozone and Short-term Mortality in 95 US Urban Communities&quot; which finds that even a relatively small increase in ozone (a main ingredient of smog) is directly linked to an increase in deaths from heart and lung ailments. This study in the nation's most prestigious medical journal shows our air is too polluted and our health is at risk. According to the study, ozone smog pollution causes a significant increase in the risk of death for those in the 95 largest communities, where up to 40% of Americans live. Ozone smog comes from factories--including power plants, cars and trucks.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We've known for a long time that smog is unhealthy, but this is some of the strongest evidence yet that smog actually kills,&quot; said Nat Mund, Sierra Club's Washington Representative for Environmental Quality. &quot;Unfortunately the Bush Administration has weakened the Clean Air Act, allowing power plants to produce more smog-forming pollutants. There is a better way. The Bush Administration could save thousands of lives by cleaning up the pollution from old, dirty factories.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The EPA and Congress should use this information to reject efforts from large polluters to weaken Clean Air health protections. This study also shows that the Bush administration and Congress should provide more balanced funding for public transportation programs that reduce smog and traffic in our cities.</font></p>
