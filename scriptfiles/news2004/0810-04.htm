<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - August 10 - The national elections of 2004 may be the most important in generations. American voters are faced with a clear choice&#150;between an incumbent administration that has overseen the destruction of millions of good-paying jobs and is committed to economic policies that reward the rich and corporations, versus nominees who are committed to putting America back to work, to keeping good jobs here in the United States and to solving the nation&#146;s health care crisis. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The labor movement is more unified than ever in ensuring that the next president of the United States puts the interests of the working families who are the backbone of this great nation at the top of his priorities. The AFL-CIO is leading an unprecedented political effort, putting together the largest grassroots political mobilization in its history. Tens of thousands of union activists are working day-in and day-out on the campaign. Union members are informed and eager to turn our nation around. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The AFL-CIO Executive Council has committed our full support and resources to this critical effort. The members of the Council are unified in our resolve to let nothing deter or distract us from this task. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Once this election has been won, we will focus with equal energy and commitment on the steps we know must be taken to strengthen the labor movement&#146;s ability to fight and win for America&#146;s working families. I will put together a planning process in which all the unions of the AFL-CIO will be asked to participate fully. Addressing common issues in an environment of shared values and mutual respect, we are confident that we will find common ground and reaffirm our commitment not only to building a bigger, stronger movement of working people, but to the critical values of union solidarity and unity.</font></p><p></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
