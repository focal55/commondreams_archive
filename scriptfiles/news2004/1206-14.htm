<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- December 6 -- The War Resisters League is excited to announce that it has now released its 2005 Peace Calendar, which marks the 50th year of its publication.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WRL, an 81-year-old secular pacifist organization, is commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of its popular Peace Calendar with a special retrospective edition. The 2005 calendar, Let Us Go Forward Together, contains artwork and text from all the previous calendars. It includes full color reproductions of the 49 previous covers; quotations from historical and current nonviolent activists describing peace campaigns, presenting the philosophy of nonviolence, and offering first person accounts of courageous <br>nonviolent actions; photographs, drawings and cartoons. Historian Howard Zinn, author of many books and plays and professor emeritus of Boston University, provided the preface. End notes, consisting of comments and song lyrics, were contributed by singer, songwriter and political activist, Ani Di Franco.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ruth Benn, editor of Let Us Go Forward Together, commented on its contents: &#147;The 60 pages presented in this calendar, culled from the thousands of pages of material printed in the earlier editions, demonstrate the value and vibrancy of the nonviolent movement in the U.S. and, indeed, around the world. As war and terrorism seem to be escalating steadily, it is particularly important to keep words of peace and hope at hand as we go about our daily routine.&#148;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The peace calendar is 5 &frac12; x 8 &frac12; in size, and has 128 pages. It has color covers backed with mini-covers of all 50 calendars. The cover price is $12.95.  For more info see WRL&#146;s website: www.warresisters.org or stop by 339 Lafayette St (at Bleecker), Manhattan.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
