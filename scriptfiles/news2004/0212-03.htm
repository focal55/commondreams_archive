<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - February 12 - Members of Congress today released an open letter to British Prime Minister Tony Blair in support of Katharine Gun, the former British intelligence employee who faces two years in prison for leaking a memo to the press that exposed a U.S. surveillance &quot;surge&quot; against countries on the U.N. Security Council aimed at securing authorization for war on Iraq.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Congressional letter was signed by House Judiciary Committee ranking member Rep. John Conyers Jr. (D-MI). It was initiated by Rep. Dennis J. Kucinich (D-OH) and also signed by Rep. Raul M. Grijalva (D-AZ), Rep. Janice D. Schakowsky (D-IL) and Rep. Lynn C. Woolsey (D-CA).</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The letter to Blair states: &quot;We cannot conceive of a scenario in which Ms. Gun's actions would present a national security threat to the United States.... The British and American public deserved to know all the elements involved in the buildup to the war. Whistleblowers play an essential role in a democracy. What they say may not please the powers that be, but that is the public service of the whistleblower. A democracy must protect the whistleblower from reprisal.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Rep. Woolsey commented: &quot;Katharine Gun shouldn't be facing two years in jail when she deserves a hero's welcome. We have the right to know what our government is doing in our name, and it appears we must count on people like Katharine to tell the real story.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The full text of the Congressional letter [PDF format] is posted at: <A HREF="http://www.accuracy.org/gun/blair.pdf" TARGET="_new">www.accuracy.org/gun/blair.pdf</A></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Other new developments:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">On Tuesday (Feb. 10), the Chilean government asserted that when technicians checked its phones at the U.N. mission in the wake of the story alleging pre-war spying, they found that most had been bugged. <A HREF="http://www.newsday.com/news/nationworld/world/wire/sns-ap-chile-u.n.-spying,0,5493967.story?coll=sns-ap-world-headlines" TARGET="_new">&quot;Chile Says Its U.N.
