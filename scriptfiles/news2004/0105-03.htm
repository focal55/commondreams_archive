- January 2 - Diego-based farm animal advocacy and vegetarian outreach group, will be performing a street theatre demonstration to protest the USDA's role as a beef industry PR firm in the wake of the recent outbreak of Mad Cow Disease in the United States.  The demonstration will be in held in front of the San Diego Federal Building (4th and Broadway) at 12:00pm on Saturday, Jan 3, 2004.</FONT><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">To highlight the extent to which the USDA is playing with consumers' lives a member of Compassion for Farm Animals will be dressed as the Grim Reaper and will be wearing a mock USDA name tag.  This USDA Grim Reaper will be passing out &quot;Mad Cow Death Certificates&quot; signed by USDA Undersecretary Ann Veneman.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The death certificates will include causes of death such as: &quot;Failure by government agencies to effectively protect consumers&quot;, &quot;Faulty testing methods&quot; and &quot;Continued practice of feeding rendered animal flesh to herbivorous animals&quot;.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Since the announcement of the first known case of Mad Cow Disease-infected cattle in the U.S. the reaction of most San Diego consumers has been one of indifference. This can be largely attributed to the USDA having spent the two weeks since the discovery of the disease in the U.S. working hard to ensure that consumers feel comfortable eating beef and not worrying about variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD), a fatal and incurable brain-degenerative disease in humans linked to the consumption of Mad Cow Disease infected beef products. The fact that since the announcement the USDA has been acting more like a beef PR firm is not surprising considering the USDA press spokesperson, Alisa Harrison, recently came to the agency after serving as press spokesperson for the National Cattlemen's Beef Association.  </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The USDA is supposed to police the meat industry and protect consumers. How can anyone trust a government agency that is dominated by the industry it is meant to regulate? The fox is guarding the chicken coop. Even the measures taken in the last few days are not meant to protect consumers. The ban on downed animals has been on the table for years; they made this move to try and win back foreign investment not to protect consumers,&quot; said David Agranoff of Compassion for Farm Animals.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">While mostly ignored by the mainstream media, many inconsistencies have surfaced in what the USDA is calling effective ways to handle the disease and what has really been done:</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&gt; The only reason the Washington state cow was tested is because she was </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">downed (unable to stand).  Ten times as many cows became downers last year than the USDA claimed to have tested.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&gt; United Press International (UPI) requested documentation and results </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">through the Freedom of Information Act of the testing the USDA has done over the last two years.  The USDA has not provided this proof of testing and is six months overdue on complying with UPI's Freedom of Information Act request.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&gt; It is still legal to feed rendered cow protein to pigs, chickens and other animals. All animals can carry diseases similar to BSE (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy ) a.k.a. &quot;Mad Cow Disease&quot;.</FONT></P><P> </P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">CFA does not intend to scare people with their actions on Saturday but instead feels that people deserve to hear another voice.  The San Diego media has thus far given little voice to those who have genuine concerns about the way the USDA is handling the outbreak of Mad Cow Disease in the United States. People should know who is behind the statements that &quot;everything is safe&quot; so that they can properly weigh the facts for themselves.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;We feel the best protection is in what we choose to eat.  However it will take pressure from citizens to completely overhaul the entire structure of the USDA before citizens can feel truly protected,&quot; said Cari Beltane of CFA.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">About Compassion for Farm Animals</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Compassion for Farm Animals (<A HREF="http://www.VegSanDiego.com" TARGET="_new">www.VegSanDiego.com</A>) has been active in San Diego since 2002 with the purpose of informing the San Diego community of the various issues related to vegetarianism and veganism as well as supporting and connecting the existing vegetarian community in the city.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">They recently launched the website <A HREF="http://www.MadCowTruth.com" TARGET="_new">MadCowTruth.com</A> to specifically address the issues related to the outbreak of Mad Cow Disease in the United States.</FONT></P><P> </P><P></P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p></font><!-- #EndEditable -->
