<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - April 8 - P.O.V., public television's annual award-winning showcase for independent non- fiction films, launches a new installment of PBS's first Web-only documentary series, P.O.V.'s Borders. The interactive, multipart series ( <A HREF="http://www.pbs.org/pov/borders" TARGET="_new">http://www.pbs.org/pov/borders</A> ) looks at the environment as it affects us on a daily basis. </FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Every day, we make decisions about what we eat, drink and breathe. What do we choose, and why? P.O.V.'s Borders: Environment will focus on three basic ingredients of life -- earth, air and water -- with individual stories from across the country about how daily choices shape our surroundings. From a Hollywood funeral for the electric car to Larry David's not-so- politically correct reasons for driving a hybrid, to whimsical stories about our fascination with bottled water and a game where players race to save heirloom seeds from extinction, the site's content will be engaging, interactive and educational.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">P.O.V.'s Borders will showcase different media, including radio, interactive community spaces, games and video, along with invited guests who will write online diaries and answer questions on a range of topics, from garbage to global warming. The site will also feature issue-based curricular material for educators including an international classroom project, as well as giveaways, quizzes, factoids, polls, useful links and ample chances for users to post their points of view.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;We launched P.O.V.'s Borders in October 2002 to explore the potential of interactive online narrative,&quot; says P.O.V. Executive Director Cara Mertes, creator and executive producer for the series. &quot;We see the series as an ongoing showcase for engaging point-of-view storytelling experiences conceived especially for the Internet. Each episode will ask visitors to consider an aspect of their everyday lives in ways that challenge their preconceptions, and expand our own 'borders' of understanding.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Now entering its 17th season on PBS, P.O.V. is the first and longest-running series on television to feature the work of America's most innovative independent documentary storytellers. Bringing over 200 award-winning films to millions nationwide, and now a new Web-only series, P.O.V.'s Borders, P.O.V. has pioneered the art of presentation and outreach using independent non- fiction media to build new communities in conversation about today's most pressing social issues.</FONT></P>
