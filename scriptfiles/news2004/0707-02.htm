For over two years Attorney General John Ashcroft has invoked the rarely used State Secrets Privilege in order to prevent from becoming public Ms. Edmond's allegations regarding the FBI's conduct before and after 9/11. He has most recently used it to quash a subpoena request for her deposition from attorneys representing 9/11 family members in litigation against terrorists and their financiers. In May 2004, Ashcroft reclassified information provided by the FBI to Congress that corroborated Ms. Edmonds' allegations. The nonprofit Project On Government Oversight has separately sued Attorney General Ashcroft and the Department of Justice (DOJ), asking the court to find the DOJ's reclassification of information unlawful and unconstitutional.</FONT></P><P> <FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The decision today represents another example of the Executive Branch's abusive nature of using secrecy as a weapon against Whistleblowers,&quot; said Mark S. Zaid, Edmonds' attorney. &quot;It is quite disappointingly evident that accountability is no longer a word in our Government's dictionary,&quot; added Zaid. An immediate appeal is planned.</FONT></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
