<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - September 17 - In a letter delivered today to the members of the U.S. Senate Appropriation Committee's Subcommittee on Energy &amp; Water, twenty-five member groups of the Sustainable Energy Coalition requested restoration of funding for key renewable energy programs in the U.S. Department of Energy's Fiscal Year 2005 (FY05) budget.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Noting that &quot;the Administration budget has proposed cuts or seriously under funds programs critical to increased national energy security and environmental quality,&quot; the groups specifically urged restoration of fudning for key renewable energy programs.  These include the Geothermal, Concentrated Solar Power, Solar Buildings, Biomass, Renewable Energy Production Incentive, and General Program Direction line items.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The specific recommendations are provided in the text of the letter below which also includes the list of signing organizations.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">September 17, 2004</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Honorable Pete Domenici, Chair, Subcommittee on Energy and Water Appropriations</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">U.S. Senate</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Washington, D.C. 20510</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Honorable Harry Reid, Ranking Democrat, Subcommittee on Energy and Water Appropriations</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">U.S. Senate</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Washington, D.C. 20510</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ATTN: Staff Member - Appropriations Committee</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dear Chairman Domenici and Ranking Democrat Reid,</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As the Subcommittee approaches its markup of the FY05 Energy and Water Appropriations bill, we wish to point out several particular areas of concern. In particular, the Administration budget has proposed cuts or seriously under funds programs critical to increased national energy security and environmental quality.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Concentrated Solar Power</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The program should be funded at least $10 million dollars in the light of a recent positive technical due diligence study on the part of DOE, the National Academy of Sciences and independent consultants, Sargent and Lundy, and the growing market interest in ongoing projects in Arizona, California, and Nevada.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Geothermal Energy</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Administration's budget cuts this program by just over $3 million, which we urge the Subcommittee to reverse.  The reduction was reportedly intended to penalize Congress for earmarks in the program's FY03 funding.  (In FY03, the geothermal program was funded at $29,390,000.)  The Administration request of $25,800,000 will force the DOE geothermal program to make damaging cuts in its baseline program.  This could result in eliminating funding for significant portions of the programs advanced technology development efforts.  We urge the Subcommittee to restore the geothermal program to at least $30 million in FY 2005, equivalent to level funding compared to FY03.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Renewable Energy Production Incentive</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Department of Energy's Renewable Energy Production Incentive Program (REPI) was created in 1992's Energy Policy Act (EPAct) as a counterpart to the renewable energy production tax credits made available to for-profit utilities.  It needs and deserves significantly more funding than requested, and we would urge the Subcommittee to consider providing at least $13 million for REPI.  EPAct authorizes the Department to make direct payments to not-for-profit public power systems and rural electric cooperatives at a rate near 1.8 cents per kWh for electricity generated from solar, wind, geothermal and biomass projects.  In order to fully fund all REPI applicants, $60 million would be needed for FY 2005, yet only $4 million has been requested.  We urge the subcommittee to provide at least $13 million.  The House passed a $5 million appropriation for the program and we are hopeful the Senate will pass at least an equal or greater amount.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Solar Buildings</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Solar Buildings program should grow to $5 million overall to meet the developing needs of advanced solar hybrid lighting and solar thermal projects, which could contribute directly to substantial reductions in US natural gas and electricity consumption in the immediate future.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Biomass</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOE funding for Biomass, including Biofuels and Biopower/energy, should be at FY04 levels or higher, and funds for hydrogen, except those dedicated to renewable hydrogen from biomass, should not be taken from appropriations intended for the advance of biomass science, technologies and industries. Biomass is becoming increasingly attractive to the transportation fuels and power industries as important additions in the transition from heavy to lighter carbon fuels. Well directed R, D and D is essential to the success of this transition.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">General Program Direction</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition to specific funding recommendations, we wish to make several observations about the DOE programs for the Subcommittee to consider in crafting its report language:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Distributed Energy RD&amp;D program within the DOE Renewable Energy RD&amp;D program has focused primarily on non-renewable technologies.  We would prefer that  the program focus on crosscutting technologies that assist the broadest possible benefits to all renewable applications - including smart interconnection both at the transmission and customer side of the meter, energy storage, advanced Combined Heat and Power concepts, and hybrid systems using multiple energy sources.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While Program Direction has grown to encompass internal activities, the Program should include a significant subset of activities to enhance the knowledge of biomass, geothermal, hydropower, solar and wind resources both in the US and globally.  The program should also input this information in a timely manner into the technology RD&amp;D programs so that they can plan technology improvements on the particular resource characterizations.  Finally, the program should create and maintain a list of distributed generation and related products and equipment that have been certified by nationally recognized testing laboratories so that project developers can use such equipment in projects interconnected to the grid without having to retest its performance characteristics.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We appreciate the Subcommittee's past support for DOE's renewable energy programs.  Thank you for your consideration of our views on these specific issues that we hope you will address in the FY 05 appropriations process.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sincerely,</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">American Bioenergy Association</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">American Public Power Association</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">American Solar Energy Society</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">American Wind Energy Association</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bob Lawrence &amp; Associates</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Business Council for Sustainable Energy</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">City &amp; County of San Francisco</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Colorado Energy Group, Inc.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Energy Storage Council</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Environmental &amp; Energy Study Institute</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Geothermal Energy Association</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Geothermal Resources Council</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">National Hydropower Association</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">New Community Project</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">New Uses Council</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Northwest SEED-Sustainable Energy for Economic Development</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Renewable Fuels Association </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Solar Energy Industries Association </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Stella Group Ltd. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sterling Planet </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sturman Industries </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Union of Concerned Scientists </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">U.S. Combined Heat and Power Association</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> U.S. Public Interest Research Group </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Vermont Energy Investment Corporation</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">cc: All Members of the Subcommittee</font></p><p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">###</font></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
