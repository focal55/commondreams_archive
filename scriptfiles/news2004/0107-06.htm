- January 7 - In celebration of the 30th anniversary of the Endangered Species Act, U.S. PIRG and other conservation groups released<A HREF="http://www.pirg.org/alerts/route.asp?id2=11665" TARGET="_new"> a set of 30 profiles</A> of species that would most likely be extinct but for the protections afforded by the law. </FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">While few of the profiled species have recovered enough to relinquish protection, the fact sheets demonstrate that numerous species are making steady progress toward recovery that would otherwise be impossible without the Endangered Species Act. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The Endangered Species Act is the only tool we have to bring species back from the brink of extinction. Still, the Bush administration has given into special interests that stand to benefit from reduced species protections and has opposed listing imperiled species,&quot; said U.S. PIRG Endangered Species Associate Shannon Ryan.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Since taking office, the administration has not listed any species of its own accord. Under court order, the administration has listed 24 species. In comparison, the Clinton administration listed nearly three times as many species without legal action. The Endangered Species Act also suffers from chronic funding shortfalls. While the federal government acknowledges that $153 million is needed to list and protect a backlog of more than 200 declining species, the Bush administration has requested only $12 million for 2004.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The ESA has shown that it can bring species back from the brink of extinction, but if you want more success stories, you need adequate funding and qualified experts,&quot; said National Wildlife Federation Senior Counsel John Kostyack. &quot;Unfortunately, the Bush administration has refused to request the needed funding and it has repeatedly attempted to remove wildlife experts from the key decisions,&quot; continued Kostyack. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Endangered Species Coalition Policy Director Beth Lowell cited an interview with the Los Angeles Times in which the Department of the Interior's Assistant Secretary for Fish, Wildlife, and Parks, Craig Manson, said, &quot;If we are saying that the loss of species in and of itself is inherently bad, I don't think we know enough about how the world works to say that.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The Bush administration's contempt for the law is putting at-risk species in even greater jeopardy. It is outrageous that the very person who is supposed to uphold the Endangered Species Act is its most outspoken adversary,&quot; said Lowell. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Contrary to the administration's claims, we know enough about the world to realize that endangered species enrich our lives and play critically important roles in our ecosystems. The myriad threats facing our nation's wildlife-habitat destruction, invasions from non-native species, rampant development-demonstrate the folly of weakening the Endangered Species Act,&quot; said Defenders of Wildlife Director of Legislative Affairs Mary Beth Beetham.</FONT></P><P></P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p></font><!-- #EndEditable -->
