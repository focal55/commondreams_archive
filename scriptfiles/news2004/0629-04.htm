<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - June 29 - Responding to growing conflict between the states and the federal government over the issue of medical marijuana, Rep. Hinchey (D-NY) and Rep. Rohrabacher (R-CA) will offer an amendment to a House spending bill next Wednesday (July 7th) that would prevent the U.S. Justice Department from undermining state efforts to provide terminally ill and chronic pain patients access to doctor-recommended medical marijuana. The amendment would prohibit the Justice Department from spending any money on arresting or prosecuting medical marijuana patients in states where medical marijuana is legal. 152 members of Congress voted for a similar amendment last year. The U.S. Supreme Court will decide later this year whether or not federal laws prohibiting the use of marijuana for medical reasons are unconstitutional.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">This Thursday, July 1st talk-show host Montel Williams, who suffers from multiple sclerosis and uses medical marijuana, will urge members of Congress to support the Hinchey-Rohrabacher medical marijuana amendment. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">What: Luncheon Congressional Briefing with Montel Williams (lunch provided)</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">When: Thursday, July 1, 12:00pm - 1:00pm </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Where: B-338 Rayburn House Office Building</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;It&#146;s outrageous that Montel Williams and thousands of other Americans are treated as criminals because they use medical marijuana to relive their pain and suffering,&#148; said Bill Piper, Director of National Affairs for the Drug Policy Alliance. &#147;The real criminals are federal bureaucrats who keep cancer, AIDS, and MS patients from the medicine they need and the members of Congress that fail to act. &#147;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">BACKGROUND:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&middot;       Eleven states have adopted medical marijuana laws since 1996 - most of them by a vote of the people.
