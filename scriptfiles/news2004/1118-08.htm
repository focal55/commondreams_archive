<p align="LEFT"><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- November 18 --</font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Attorneys for Green Party presidential candidate David Cobb and Libertarian Michael Badnarik have sent letters to each Ohio county election director asking them to begin preparations immediately for the recount of the presidential vote.            Although a demand for a recount is usually not made until after the vote has been certified, there are concerns that waiting that long would not allow enough time for the recount to be completed before the Ohio presidential electors meet on December 13 in Columbus.  </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Ohio Secretary of State's office has told the press that certification of the vote would occur around December 6, allowing only a handful of days for a full recount prior to the December 13 meeting.            In letters dated November 17 and sent by overnight delivery, Cobb and Badnarik's attorneys say that &quot;such a timeframe will not allow for a meaningful recount and will undermine our clients' rights under applicable law, including Ohio recount law.&quot;  Cobb and Badnarik will file the recount demand jointly.            The letters go on to say that &quot;the lack of a meaningful recount will also violate the rights under federal and state constitutional and statutory law of all Ohio citizens who cast a ballot for President on Election Day..  Immediate action is necessary so that the recount procedures may begin as soon as possible.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This is consistent with our standing up for the right to vote and for each vote to be counted.  What's the point of having a recount if it won't be completed in time?  Everyone knows what happened in Florida in 2000 and no one wants to see that happen again,&quot; said Blair Bobier, Media Director for the Cobb-LaMarche campaign.            Bobier said the formal recount demand and the bond of $113,600 would be officially filed on Friday.            Cobb and Badnarik are represented by John Bonifaz, General Counsel of the National Voting Rights Institute and Ohio attorney Nancy Holland Myers.            The Cobb-LaMarche campaign is now in the process of recruiting volunteers and raising funds for monitoring the actual recount process. Volunteers and donors should visit the campaign website, <a href="http://www.votecobb.org/" target="_new">http://www.votecobb.org</a>, for more information.</font></p><p align="CENTER">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
