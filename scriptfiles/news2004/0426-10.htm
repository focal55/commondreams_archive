<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - April 26 - The Bush Administration has announced it will begin trade negotiations with Panama today in the hopes of completing a bilateral &quot;free trade agreement&quot; (FTA). The negotiations represent the latest attempt to expand NAFTA further into Latin America. A Panama FTA would complement the Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) with Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and the Dominican Republic that the Administration finished negotiating last year.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">CAFTA is facing growing opposition in the U.S. Congress, and talks for a proposed &quot;Free Trade Area of the Americas&quot; (FTAA) that would encompass every country in Latin America and the Caribbean except Cuba have been stalled for months. The Bush Administration has also announced plans to begin negotiations for a &quot;free trade&quot; agreement with Colombia next month.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Like CAFTA, the Panama FTA is just a Trojan horse for the stalled FTAA&quot; said Larry Weiss, Executive Director of Citizens Trade Campaign. &quot;Many Latin American countries reject the NAFTA model and refuse to go along with the Bush Administration's plans to extend that model throughout the hemisphere. The administration is employing a backdoor FTAA strategy by twisting the arms of the small and weak governments in the region.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The Administration will likely offer a raw deal to Panama with any trade agreement they negotiate,&quot; said Bill Klinefelter, Political and Legislative Director of the United Steelworkers of America. &quot;The U.S. Trade Representative showed that labor rights are simply not a concern with the CAFTA negotiations. We have no reason to think they will have any more regard for Panamanian workers.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Citizens Trade Campaign (CTC) is a national coalition of environmental, labor, consumer, family farm, religious, and other civil society groups founded in 1992 during the fight over the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
