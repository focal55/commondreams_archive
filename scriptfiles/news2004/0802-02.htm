<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - August 2 - In response to inadequate regulation of genetically engineered (GE) foods in the United States, voters are attempting to protect their community's health and environment by regulating GE crops and animals&#151;something the USDA, FDA, and EPA have not done.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Last fall, voters in Mendocino County were the first in the nation to ban GE agriculture. This action has sparked a movement among California consumers who are now poised to vote this fall on similar bans in seven other counties. California's status as an agricultural powerhouse and the biotechnology industry's vow to oppose bans on GE crops and animals make the grassroots movement in California an important story for reporters to follow.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">U.S. PIRG's review of seven county initiatives in California to ban genetically engineered agriculture in the largest agricultural state in the U.S. discusses the political, environmental and health issues surrounding those efforts, including:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot; Health and environmental risks associated with GE foods, such as the increased risk of allergic reactions;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot; The international community's opposition to GE foods specifically in the EU and Japan, large U.S. agricultural export markets; and</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot; Industry opposition to local regulatory efforts that have pumped large sums of money into local initiatives on GE issues, up to $5.5 million in one state.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The paper reveals that despite the risks and international opposition, the U.S. regulatory framework continues to treat GE crops and animals the same as their naturally occurring counterparts. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We hope that this information will be helpful as you continue to follow the issue of genetically engineered foods. <a href="http://www.pirg.org/alerts/route.asp?id2=13974" target="_new">Click here</a> to find the complete white paper exploring this important development in citizens' quest to implement protections against the risks of genetically engineered crops and animals.</font></p><p></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
