<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - July 13 - Subway, the fast food sandwich chain, has given $4 million to the American Heart Association (AHA) since 2002, and will gave an additional $6 million through 2007, the Corporate Crime Reporter has learned. </FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In exchange, Subway gets to put the AHA &#147;fighting heart disease and stroke&#148; logo on its materials throughout its chain of stores, according to an AHA spokesperson. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Tomorrow, Fred DeLuca, co-founder and president of Subway, Cass Wheeler, chief executive officer of the AHA, members of Congress, and Bush administration officials will be on the national mall in Washington, D.C. in an event sponsored by Subway to &#147;galvanize support for fighting childhood obesity.&#148; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Subway sandwiches feature such classics as Steak and Cheese, Subway Melt, (a first class blend of tukey breast, ham, crispy bacon, and melted cheese), Italian BMT (pepperoni, genoa salami,and ham) and the Cold Cut Trio (turkey based ham, salami, and bologna) &#150; not your typical heart healthy sandwiches. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The chain also markets seven subs with six grams of fat or less. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Public health activists condemned the AHA/Subway alliance. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;This is part of the broader story of the corruption of the American public health movement,&#148; said Commercial Alert's Gary Ruskin. &#147;AHA ought to drop its support for Subway. They have been converted into an auxiliary marketeer for Subway. They are apparently for sale.&#148; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;The fast food companies are running in a panic over the obesity epidemic,&#148; Ruskin said. &#147;They are striving to do anything to make it seem that they are not responsible for it or part of it. This is just one more way that companies like Subway try to hide their tracks and boost their public relation images.&#148; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In a written statement e-mailed to Corporate Crime Reporter, the AHA said it will only accept sponsorships from &#147;those restaurants that have a public/market positioning associated with healthy foods or have heart-healthy and non-fried food alternatives on the menu.&#148; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;Subway actively promotes low-saturated fat meal options and exercise in their advertising messages,&#148; the AHA said in the statement. &#147;Their messaging reinforces that a well-balanced diet and exercise are important tools in maintaining a healthy weight</FONT></P><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
