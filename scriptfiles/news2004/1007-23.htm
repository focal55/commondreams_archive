<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON, DC - October 7 - During Tuesday's debate Vice President Cheney claimed that John Kerry's plan to roll back tax cuts for individuals making over $200,000 would negatively impact nearly a million small businesses. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cheney said "about 900,000 small businesses will be hit if you do, in fact, do what they want to do with the top bracket." </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The figure Cheney cited is highly disingenuous and Cheney’s logic highly convoluted. 

 

Under Cheney's definition a small business is any taxpayer who reports some income – even just $1 – from a small business investment or partnership. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By this logic "every partner at a huge accounting firm or at the largest law firm would represent small businesses."  </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Also, by Cheney's definition, President Bush would have counted as a small business in 2001 because that year "he reported $84 of business income from his part ownership of a timber-growing enterprise."  

 

The overwhelming majority of actual small businesses are in the lower tax brackets and would be unaffected by the Kerry proposal.</font>
