<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - July 21 - According to its Web site, the teen-targeted TV show &#147;NFL Under the Helmet,&#148; which airs on Fox affiliates across the country, is &#147;where football and pop culture collide.&#148; Co-host Rebecca Grant recently told Maxim magazine why she likes hosting the show: &#147;I heard &#145;Under the Helmet&#146; was looking for someone hip and not too prissy to hang with the guys&#151;and that&#146;s exactly what I&#146;m all about.&#148;</FONT></p><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">But a new analysis prepared for tonight&#146;s public hearing on broadcast localism before the Federal Communications Commission in Monterey, Calif., found that local Fox-affiliate KCBA-TV counts &#147;NFL Under the Helmet&#148; as part of its requirement to air three hours per week of educational/informational programming for children. In its &#147;Children&#146;s Television Report&#148; filing to the federal agency, KCBA said the no-holds barred show &#147;showcases the pro-social on and off the field activities of the NFL&#146;s leading players and coaches.&#148;</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Alongside its questionable characterization of &#147;NFL Under The Helmet,&#148; the analysis by Children Now and the Institute for Public Representation at Georgetown University found the station still fell short of the three-hour minimum for children&#146;s educational programming. Among the three other high-powered stations in the Monterey-Salinas market, one station, Univision affiliate KSMS-TV, also failed to meet the three-hour rule, and KION-TV (CBS) and KSBW-TV (NBC) just barely met the minimum requirement.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;Children need to have access to a variety of programming that is specific to their educational needs, and local broadcasters clearly are not meeting their public-interest obligations to children,&#148; said Patti Miller, director of Children Now&#146;s Children &amp; the Media program. Miller will present some of the findings at the hearing.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The preliminary analysis of the stations&#146; reports to the FCC found there are no locally-produced E/I programs in the market that are specific to the needs and interests of a diverse community, where more than half of all children are Latino. The one high-powered Spanish-language station, KSMS-TV (Univision), offers just two E/I programs. The analysis also found that all 20 programs that broadcasters claim as core educational programming either originate from networks or are syndicated.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The research, which examined the last quarter of 2003, also found that one-fifth of children&#146;s educational programming on KSBW-TV (NBC) was preempted by sports programming. Among all four channels, E/I programs were not scheduled at times when children were most likely to be watching. The hearing begins at 6:00 pm at the Steinbeck Forum, Third Floor, One Portola Plaza, Monterey, Calif.</FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
