<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - April 13 - With Attorney General John Ashcroft testifying before the 9/11 Commission today, a quick analysis of his previous statements shows he has repeatedly lied to Congress about the Bush Administration's 9/11 counterterrorism record.  Specifically, when questioned by Congress in 2002 about why he tried to de-prioritize and slash funding for counterterrorism before 9/11, Ashcroft resorted to dishonest denials, even in the face of budget documents that proved he was not telling the truth.</FONT></p>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">For instance, in testimony before the House of Representatives, Ashcroft said that before 9/11, his &#147;number-one goal&#148; at the Justice Department &#147;was the prevention of terrorist acts&#148; and that he immediately &#147;began to shape the department and its efforts in that respect.&#148; [Source: Attorney General John Ashcroft testimony, 2/28/02]. But according to the <A HREF="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A13541-2004Mar21?language=printer" TARGET="_new">Washington Post</A>, internal Administration documents from before 9/11 &#147;show that Ashcroft ranked counterterrorism efforts as a lower priority than his predecessor did.&#148; The documents &#147;indicate that before Sept. 11, Ashcroft did not give terrorism top billing in his strategic plans for the Justice Department, which includes the FBI. A draft of Ashcroft&#146;s &#145;Strategic Plan&#146; from Aug. 9, 2001, does not put fighting terrorism as one of the department&#146;s seven goals, ranking it as a sub-goal beneath gun violence and drugs.&#148;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Ashcroft tried to blame his own negligence of counterterrorism on the previous Administration, claiming to Congress that &#147;the five-year plan that had been put in place by my predecessor didn&#146;t mention counterterrorism.&#148; [Source: Attorney General John Ashcroft, 2/28/02]. But according to the New York Times, &#147;the plan issued by Attorney General Janet Reno in 2000 said the Justice Department would have to devote more attention and resources to terrorism, citing sophisticated computer and bomb-making technology and the &#145;emerging threats of chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear weapons.&#146;&#148; [Source: NY Times, 3/1/02]</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Ashcroft has even been dishonest about events after 9/11, telling Congress that when the Administration was writing the emergency counterterrorism funding bill after the attacks, the FBI &#147;came to me with a $670 million request, and we counseled them to take that to $1.1 billion.&#148; [Source: Attorney General John Ashcroft, 2/28/02]. But according to the Washington Post, &#147;In the early days after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, the Bush White House cut by nearly two-thirds an emergency request for counterterrorism funds by the FBI... The document, dated Oct. 12, 2001, shows that the FBI requested $1.5 billion in additional funds to enhance its counterterrorism efforts with the creation of 2,024 positions. But the White House Office of Management and Budget cut that request to $531 million.&#148; Ashcroft &#147;cut the FBI&#146;s request for items such as computer networking and foreign language intercepts by half, cut a cyber-security request by three quarters and eliminated entirely a request for &#145;collaborative capabilities.&#146;&#148;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">For full citations and links to the cited documents, visit: <A HREF="http://www.misleader.org."
