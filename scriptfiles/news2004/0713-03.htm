The stirring message shows the clear contrasts between Democratic Vice Presidential nominee John Edwards and Vice President Dick Cheney.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Using stark video images set to music and footage of the candidates themselves, the ad paints a picture of Edward&#146;s commitment to an America that lifts people up and unites its citizenry in compassion and trust.  Dick Cheney, on the other hand, is shown promoting a climate of fear.  MoveOn PAC sent the message out to members on its email list.  The ad can be viewed by logging on to www.moveonpac.org.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;As recent polls show, voters understand that Vice President Cheney has no optimistic vision for America,&#148; said Eli Pariser, executive director of MoveOn PAC.  &#147;We look forward to the public comparison between John Edwards&#146; message of hope and Cheney&#146;s cynical fear-mongering.&#148;</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">According to TIME Magazine, based on a recent poll of registered and &#147;likely voters&#148;, John Edward&#146;s favorable rating &#147;outpaces his unfavorable rating by a margin of 39% to 12%.  By contrast Cheney's favorable (41%) and unfavorable (40%) ratings are essentially the same.&#148;  The poll further underscores that Edwards does more for Kerry than Cheney does for Bush, revealing that&#147;24% say Edwards as the Vice Presidential candidate makes them more likely to vote for Kerry, compared to 11% who say Cheney makes them more likely to vote for Bush.&#148;</FONT></P><P> </P><P><B><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The script of the ad is as follows:</FONT></B></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">FADE IN: The word &#147;Compassion&#148; comes on the screen.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">DISSOLVE TO:  John Edwards video (subtle uplifting music) </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;We are going to build an America where we say no to kids going to bed hungry.
