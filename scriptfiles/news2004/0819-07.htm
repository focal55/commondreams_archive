<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BOSTON - August 19 - While Google's IPO makes its founders instant billionaires on paper, Responsible Wealth today announced that federal tax subsidies contributed more than $9 million to their immediate $73 million profit.</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It's hard to understand why we changed the laws to give people who sell stock half the tax rate that they would pay on wages,&quot; said Scott Klinger, co-director of Responsible Wealth.  &quot;Google's founder's success is something we should celebrate, but they don't deserve or need multi-million-dollar subsidies - just for selling stock.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Reductions in capital gains taxes over the last decade have added billions to America's largest fortunes.  With the completion of Google's public offering, company co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin netted more than $36 million each.  If the Google offering had occurred in 1997, the pair would have each owed nearly $20 million in capital gains taxes.  Instead, the government's share will be just $11 million.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This tax cut and others have combined to cause reductions in a host of federal programs, including the Small Business Administration.  For the coming year, President Bush proposes to slash SBA spending by more than 50%.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Ironically,&quot; said Klinger, &quot;padding the fortunes of America's newest billionaires threatens one of the government agencies planting the seeds for the next generation of Googles.  Instead of subsidizing the already wealthy, we should be investing more in future opportunities.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Responsible Wealth has used Google to illustrate how society helps create wealth.  In a recent report entitled, &quot;I Didn't Do It Alone: Society's Contribution to Individual Wealth and Success,&quot; it calls attention to the public investment and social institutions that helped Google, including:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* The enormous taxpayer-funded research in Silicon Valley and Stanford University, where Google's technology was developed.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* The Internet platform, without which Google would not exist, an invention funded by the world's largest venture capitalist, the United States government. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Government regulation and oversight of the financial institutions and the stock market that Google is leveraging.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to Klinger, &quot;Google's success shows what kind of public investments are key to wealth creation.  It's not tax breaks.  It's real investments - from public education to technology research - that will deliver the Googles of the future.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;I Didn't Do It Alone: Society's Contribution to Individual Wealth and Success,&quot; was written by Chuck Collins, co-author with Bill Gates, Sr. of &quot;Wealth and Our Commonwealth&quot; and associate director of United for a Fair Economy; Scott Klinger, co-director of Responsible Wealth and a Chartered Financial Analyst; and Mike Lapham, co-director of Responsible Wealth.
