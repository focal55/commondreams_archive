The Department of Justice (DOJ) has prosecuted five multi-state farm slavery cases involving over 1,000 workers in the past five years. The CIW assisted the DOJ in the investigation and prosecution in four of these cases. The story of the CIW has been covered in The New Yorker and National Geographic, and on PBS. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Taco Bell Truth Tour, organized by the CIW, began in Louisville, Kentucky on February 27, where farmworkers, labor unions, religious organizations, and student groups gathered at the corporate offices of Yum!
