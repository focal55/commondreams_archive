<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BOSTON -- November 5 -- </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Student activists from across Boston will join with Sudanese refugees for a candlelight vigil in Boston Common at 4:30 p.m. on Friday to protest the genocide led by the Sudanese regime against its own black African population. An estimated 1,000 black Africans are being murdered in Sudan every week, but the international community has failed to take strong action to stop the genocide.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The candlelight vigil, held adjacent to Brewer Fountain by Park Street Station, is being organized by campus activists from several Boston area colleges in conjunction with the American Anti-Slavery Group. Vigil co-sponsors include the Harvard Black Students Association, Harvard's Amnesty International Club, Delta Tau Delta (Tufts University), Beta Theta Pi (MIT), the Health and Human Rights Caucus at the BU School of Public Health, BU CAUSE Justice, and other college groups from the Boston area.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Francis Bok, who escaped from ten years of slavery as a child in Sudan, will be the vigil's keynote speaker, appearing alongside student activists.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Despite declarations of genocide by Colin Powell and UN confirmation of mass casualties, the international community has failed to take any meaningful steps to ending genocide in Sudan,&quot; noted Yanelly Molina, a senior at Tufts and one of the vigil's organizers.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;In Darfur, at least 70,000 Black Sudanese have been killed as a result of militia raids sponsored by the Government of Sudan,&quot; remarked Jessye Crow-Rothstein, another Tufts student organizing the rally. &quot;The UN has called Sudan the 'worst humanitarian crisis in the world,' yet it refuses to impose sanctions or even call the crisis what it is, genocide.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jesse Sage, associate director of the American Anti-Slavery Group, explained that the rally was just the latest example of grassroots activism by Americans outraged by the Sudan genocide and the inaction of the international community. &quot;This vigil is a sign that the American people will not be silent. Every day, hundreds are dying. Our leaders need to take action now.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For more information, see <a href="http://www.iAbolish.com/vigil" target="_new">http://www.iAbolish.com/vigil</a></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
