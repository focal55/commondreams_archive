<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - September 17 - BRIGALIA BAM, <a href="http://www.fairelection.us" target="_new">www.fairelection.us</a></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dr. Brigalia Bam is the Chairperson of the Independent Electoral Commission of South Africa. She is the former General Secretary of the South African Council of Churches. She said today: &quot;We are civic leaders, parliamentarians, diplomats, academics, electoral officials, journalists, and veteran election monitors. We come from 15 countries on all five continents. We have worked for decades in our home countries to reform our electoral systems, to make them more responsive, more open, and more fair. We have been invited by the U.S. non-governmental organization Global Exchange with the aim of assisting Americans in the effort to increase confidence in the electoral process. ... Our experience in dozens of countries around the world has shown that the presence of non-partisan, non-governmental observers from other countries can help ensure fair and transparent elections and build trust in democratic processes. ... Through sharing with Americans the democratic innovations and advances occurring around the world, we hope to bring to light the best practices that may benefit the U.S. political system.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JASON MARK, <a href="mailto:jason@globalexchange.org">jason@globalexchange.org</a></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jason Mark works with Fair Election, a project of Global Exchange. He said today: &quot;Electoral experts from 14 countries will arrive in the United States this week to begin an unprecedented international monitoring of the U.S. elections. The 20-person team consists of distinguished pro-democracy advocates who have spent much of their lives creating and improving electoral systems in their home countries. The electoral observers will spend two weeks in the U.S. investigating controversies that appear to be undermining public faith in the U.S. political process. ... The pre-electoral fact-finding team will spend four days in Washington, D.C. ... The delegation will then split into five groups to conduct further investigations in Arizona, Georgia, Florida, Missouri, and Ohio. In those states the monitors will meet with secretaries of state, hear from county voting registrars, talk with community organizations, observe voter registration drives, and hold town hall meetings to get a full picture of American democracy.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Other members of the delegation include the following:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Oscar Gonzalez.
