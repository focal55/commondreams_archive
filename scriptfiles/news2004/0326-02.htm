<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Task Force staff to train more than 100 participants on electoral and fundraising skills specifically focused on the issue of marriage equality. Nearly half the Power Summit participants are from Massachusetts. Contrary to recent polling, the Task Force predicts that during the neighborhood door-to-door voter identification canvas voters will be responding to the issue of equal marriage rights for gay and lesbian couples more favorably and in much larger numbers than polls would predict. Our experience is that when we talk with voters face-to-face on any gay issue, we outperform what polls would predict by 15-25 points. On the marriage issue, that is enough to stop anti-gay politicians from using the gay community as a wedge issue, and can change the result of a popular vote on the issue -- should a vote be placed before the people by the MA legislature on March 29.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Dave Fleischer, Task Force director of organizing &amp; training explains the importance of the New England Power Summit:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Our community didn't pick a fight with anti-gay politicians. We want all Americans, Democrat, Republican and everyone in- between, to take a look at their gay neighbors and consider how much all of us have in common when it comes to our need to protect the people we love. Wedge-issue political hacks, including President Bush, have made a serious miscalculation that will cost them votes in the upcoming elections. If the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community does its job and does this work on an appropriate scale, any politician who is relying on reflexive anti-gay sentiment to power their campaign will in fact be running a very high risk of losing because they have picked on the wrong group of people. We are going to fight back with a weapon that anti-gay bigots can't cope with: a direct, honest discussion with the American people.&quot;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Fleischer continued, &quot;Anti-gay extremists and President Bush have picked a fight with us. And they're not interested in a fair fight. They want to hide behind vague language like 'sanctity' and code words that communicate to their base that ridiculing and demeaning gay people's aspirations to be full-fledged members of society is what they get when they vote Republican.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;If anti-gay politicians want the votes of bigots, then the Task Force is committed to making sure that they learn that there is a cost attached to that choice. And the cost is the votes of fair-minded people, who as they learn more about what marriage means to lesbian and gay families and why it's important to us, will ultimately cast their vote against discrimination and for candidates for office who stand against discrimination.&quot;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><i>Founded in 1973, the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force was the first national lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) civil rights and advocacy organization and remains the movement's leading voice for freedom, justice, and equality. It works to build the grassroots political strength of our community by training state and local activists and leaders and organizing broad-based campaigns to defeat anti-LGBT referenda and advance pro-LGBT legislation. The Policy Institute, the community's premiere think tank, provides research and policy analysis to support the struggle for complete equality. As part of a broader social justice movement, it works to create a world that respects and makes visible the diversity of human expression and identity where all people may fully participate in society. Headquartered in Washington, D.C., it also has offices in New York City, Los Angeles, and Cambridge.</i></FONT></P>
