<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PARIS -  September 21 - Greenpeace displayed pictures of the victims 
of the world's worst industrial disaster- Bhopal - at the opening of an 
international textile exhibition in Paris, where DOW Chemical, the 
entity responsible for the 1984 disaster presented a new fiber called 
XLA.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Greenpeace together with ICJB   demand that DOW accepts full 
liability for the ongoing disaster in Bhopal. 

Visitors attending the release of DOW's new textile at Premier Vision's 
exhibition, were received by Greenpeace activists dressed in black 
t-shirts revealing the faces of the victims of Bhopal and handing them 
information regarding the company's corporate irresponsibility. 
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greenpeace is also demanding that the multinational pay the health 
treatments of the survivors and clean up the large stockpiles of 
dangerous poisons and the contaminated underground water left behind at 
the site of the accident. 

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The people affected by the disaster now live in the shadow of an 
ongoing environmental and health catastrophe. The banner that carries 
the faces of the Bhopali victims reveals the hidden collection of DOW - 
the real story of Bhopal after twenty years. We, the people of Bhopal 
have suffered for 20 years now and it is disheartening to discover that 
instead of taking responsibility for cleaning up the polluted disaster 
site in Bhopal and offering medical assistance to the ailing survivors, 
DOW is busy making profits."  Said Rani Niloufer, a 20-year-old Bhopal 
survivor</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 

On 3 December 1984, more than 40 tons of poisonous gases leaked from a 
storage tank at a Union Carbide  pesticide factory into the heart of 
Bhopal city, immediately killing 8,000 people. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since then, more than 
20,000 deaths have been attributed to the disaster. Survivors and their 
children continue to suffer long-term health effects ranging from cancer 
and tuberculosis to birth defects and chronic fevers.

In June 2004, the Government of India submitted a statement to the New 
York District Court on the Bhopal contamination clean up case asking 
Union Carbide to carry out the Bhopal plant-site remediation. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"DOW investors, and all those who will buy this fabric, should be aware 
that DOW has blood on their hands and no new textile will help them hide 
their crimes in Bhopal. Only when they pay for all the survivors' health 
treatment and clean the poisonous site, will justice be done," added 
Vinuta Gopal, Greenpeace campaigner from India protesting today in Paris.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greenpeace has been working in Bhopal since 1999 when a team of 
Greenpeace scientists worked with Bhopal community groups to analyse the 
severity and extent of the contamination on and around the factory site. 
The study found substantial and, in some locations, severe contamination 
of land and water supplies with heavy metals and chlorinated chemicals.
