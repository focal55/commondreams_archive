<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -  September 29 - Responding to the latest in a series of outrageous attempts by the Republican Party to use religion to mislead the American public, <a href="http://prochoiceaction.org/">NARAL Pro-Choice America</a> encouraged religious leaders to speak out against divisive scare tactics such as ads claiming that John Kerry would ban the Bible or promote widespread abortion.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

NARAL Pro-Choice America Board member Reverend Katherine Ragsdale said, "The majority of Americans of all faiths support a woman's right to choose. But the real issue here is the way that George Bush and his allies are trying to turn Americans against each other and use faith as a way to divide us, instead of bringing people together. I hope that my clerical colleagues will join me in speaking out against these completely inappropriate attacks." 

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Recently, the Republican National Committee admitted to having sent pamphlets to voters in Arkansas and West Virginia insinuating that John Kerry would ban the Bible if elected.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> This was followed by the launch of Web sites titled "<a href="http://www.kerrywrongforcatholics.com">KerryWrongforCatholics.com</a>" and "<a href="http://www.kerrywrongformormons.com">KerryWrongforMormons.com</a>" that featured an outrageous misquoting of a speech Kerry gave in the U.S. Senate.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ten years ago, Kerry made a strong statement to Congress condemning the bombing of a reproductive health clinic. The RNC recently launched a Web site to attack John Kerry for standing up for women, lifting pieces of his statement to make it appear as though Kerry was "promoting" abortion.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NARAL Pro-Choice America called on its allies in the religious community to emphasize Kerry's solid pro-choice record and his commitment to reducing unintended pregnancies and the need for abortion through proactive reproductive health policy that respects women and safeguards their health. </font>
