<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - June 2 - Green leaders charged that the national debate, especially over the war on Iraq, will not be between President George W. Bush and Sen. John Kerry, and that Democrats have surrendered their position as opposition party to the Greens.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Green candidates competing for the party's presidential nomination, as well as independent candidate and possible Green endorsee Ralph Nader, are seeking the support of Americans who opposed the invasion and occupation of Iraq and intend to persuade other voters that Bush, backed by Republicans and most Democrats, misled them into an unnecessary war.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;A vote for either Kerry or Bush is a vote for war,&quot; said Tony Affigne, co-chair of the International Committee of the Green Party of the United States.  &quot;The debate over Iraq in the 2004 election is not Democrat versus Republican.  It's Green versus the war parties.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Greens noted other major election year issues on which President Bush and Sen. Kerry generally agree:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">-- Sen. Kerry and most of his Democratic colleagues voted yea on the USA Patriot Act, which Greens call a serious assault on constitutional rights.  (Greens also note that the October 2002 vote by Congress, including Sen. Kerry, to surrender war powers to the White House violated the U.S. Constitution.)</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">-- Sen. Kerry has endorsed the Bush Administration's support of Sharon policies in Israel; Greens have condemned Israel's recent grab of West Bank lands and murders of Palestinian civilians, called for Israel to adhere to international law and U.N. directives, and supported initiatives from Israeli and Palestinian peace groups.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">-- Neither Bush nor Kerry offers strong initiatives to stem catastrophic global climate change; Greens have called for a renegotiated Kyoto Accord with more comprehensive measures, especially for reversing the global addiction to fossil fuels, and with the U.S. as signatory.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">-- Both Bush and Kerry support international trade authorities which frequently overrule local and national environmental, labor, and human rights protections; Greens have called for international trade agreements that strengthen local democracy and economic autonomy, environmental protections, and workers' rights.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">-- Both Bush and Kerry would continue to permit control by HMOs, insurance firms, drug manufactureres, and other corporate lobbies over U.S. health care, including prescription drugs; Greens propose a single-payer national health insurance program.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">For further comparison of Green with Democratic and Republican positions, visit <A HREF="http://www.therealdifference.org/" TARGET="_new">http://www.therealdifference.org/</A></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><A HREF="http://www.therealdifference.org/issues.html" TARGET="_new">http://www.therealdifference.org/issues.html</A>, and <A HREF="http://www.therealdifference.org/issues2.html" TARGET="_new">http://www.therealdifference.org/issues2.html</A></FONT></P><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
