<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - May 6 - By giving in to far-right pressure to reject over-the-counter status for the Plan B&reg; emergency contraceptive, the Bush Administration has blocked a move that could prevent a substantial number of abortions, charged NARAL Pro-Choice America, the leading national advocate for personal privacy and a woman&#146;s right to choose. </FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In a statement, NARAL Pro-Choice America Interim President Elizabeth A. Cavendish said:</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;This decision proves once again the Bush Administration is a lot of conservative and not much compassion. By intervening with the FDA to make sure that the concerns of far right activists outweigh the considered judgment of scientific experts he himself appointed, the President has missed a golden opportunity to put his slogan into practice. But this White House would rather play abortion politics than prevent abortions.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Over-the-counter access to emergency contraception could dramatically lower the number of unintended pregnancies and abortions in this country, and would be particularly beneficial for victims of sexual assault. But those concerns were outweighed by the objections of a small number of ideological extremists who oppose even contraception.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Pro-choice Americans are outraged by this decision &#150; and we&#146;ll make sure the President knows it.&#148;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Further information about emergency contraception is available at <A HREF="http://www.prochoiceamerica.org/facts/im_ec.cfm" TARGET="_new">http://www.prochoiceamerica.org/facts/im_ec.cfm</A>.</FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
