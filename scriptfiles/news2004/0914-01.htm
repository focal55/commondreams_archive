<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - September 14 - Despite promises to support renewal of the nation's ban on military-style assault weapons, the President's lack of leadership and kowtowing to the gun lobby have led to an expiration of the ban.  The ban expired last night.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to the Associated Press, White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan, on board Air Force One today, was unable to name a single member of Congress the President contacted in an effort to save the ban.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Joshua Horwitz, Executive Director of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, had this to say:  &quot;This is a sad day for America, and for American democracy.  The will of the vast majority has been usurped by the extreme demands of a fanatic few.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Some may be inclined to blame the gun lobby for the expiration of the assault weapons ban.  But let there be no mistake who is to blame for playing politics with public safety and the lives of law enforcement: George W. Bush.  All that the President had to do was call his Republican Party leaders in the House, and the ban would have been saved.  Yet he did nothing.  In the end, the expiration of the assault weapons ban is another broken promise, and another example of this President's failed leadership.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Now it is time for the voters to have their say.  Come November, Americans will tell the President how they feel about a so-called leader who breaks his word to law enforcement.  They will tell the President how they feel about a so-called leader who refused to fight for a landmark public safety law.  And they will tell the President how they feel about a so-called leader who sold out America's public safety for an endorsement by an extreme special interest group.&quot;</font></p><p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">###</font></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
