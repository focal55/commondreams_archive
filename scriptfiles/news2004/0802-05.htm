<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - August 2 - Two new studies by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) find that a permanent repeal of the federal estate tax would greatly reduce charitable giving. The CBO estimated that overall charitable giving would decline between 6 and 12 percent, and the decline in charitable bequests would range from 20 to 30 percent, if the estate tax were fully repealed.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The CBO studies confirm results from independent analysts, and show that estate tax repeal would cause charities to lose between $12 and $24 billion in giving per year, &quot; said John Irons, Senior Economic Policy Analyst at OMB Watch, a Washington, D.C.-based government watchdog group. Total charitable giving in the United States reached $201 billion in 2003.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Not only would repeal of the estate tax clearly devastate our nation&sup1;s charities,&quot; commented Lee Farris, Senior Tax Policy Organizer at Responsible Wealth in Boston, a group that monitors economic inequality.  &quot;Repeal would cost the U.S. Treasury $1 trillion over the next two decades. At a time of record deficits, we as a nation cannot afford this double drain, on revenue as well as on philanthropic funding.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The estate tax is currently slated to be eliminated for one year in 2010, and then return in 2011.  Congress is expected to take up the debate on whether to permanently repeal the tax in September.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Responsible Wealth, a project of United for a Fair Economy, raises awareness of economic inequality.
