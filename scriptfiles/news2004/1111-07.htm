<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- November 11 -- Wisconsin Resident Receives National Parks Award Conservationist Praised for Work to Protect Apostle Islands, Saint Croix Parks</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Washington, D.C. -  Martin Hanson, the Wisconsin conservationist whose advocacy for both the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore and Saint Croix National Scenic River inspired Congress to create the two parks, today received the prestigious Marjory Stoneman Douglas Award from the nonpartisan National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA) for his lifelong efforts on behalf of Apostle Islands and other Great Lakes parks. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Martin Hanson has been a driving force behind protecting the Apostle Islands for four decades,&#148; said Craig Obey, NPCA vice president for government affairs. &#147;From guiding President Kennedy during his 1963 visit to the islands to his creation of Friends of the Apostle Islands this past year, Martin Hanson&#146;s commitment to this national treasure has been second to none. He is an inspiration to anyone who cares about the Apostle Islands, the rest of our national parks, and the treasures and heritage they protect.&#148;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Designated a national lakeshore in 1970 and expanded in 1986, Apostle Islands National Lakeshore is composed of 21 forested islands and a 12-mile strip of mainland, all with a long history of use by the Ojibwa Indians, 19th century traders, and others. The Apostle Islands also provide critical habitat for migrating and nesting birds. The park&#146;s six historic lighthouses are the largest such group found in any site in the National Park System. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One of the original eight rivers designated under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act of 1968, the Saint Croix National Scenic River protects a 252-mile stretch of land and water that provide visitors with year-round recreation, education, and enjoyment opportunities.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NPCA&#146;s annual Marjory Stoneman Douglas Award was established in 1986 to honor individuals who often must go to great lengths to advocate and fight for the protection of the National Park System. Named for Marjory Stoneman Douglas, a life-long advocate for Everglades National Park, the award recognizes the outstanding efforts of an individual or group that result in the protection of a site or proposed site in the National Park System.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
