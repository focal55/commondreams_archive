<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - January 22 - Public Campaign Action Fund, a national nonpartisan campaign finance reform organization, launched an on-line contest to select a name for those individuals who raised more than $500,000 for President George W. Bush's re-election committee.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Bush campaign currently calls those who raise $100,000 &quot;Pioneers&quot; and those who raise $200,000 &quot;Rangers.&quot; The Washington Post reported today that &quot;there is even whispered talk on Wall Street of a new category of super-fundraiser, those able to bundle $500,000 or more.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Just because the Bush campaign won't name these super-mega-fundraisers doesn't mean they're not keeping track of who is raising $500,000,&quot; said Nick Nyhart, executive director of Public Campaign Action Fund. &quot;We're going to name them for them.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Entries to name this category of fundraisers can be made at <A HREF="http://www.pcactionfund.org/contest/" TARGET="_new">www.pcactionfund.org/contest/</A>. After entries have been made, a panel of political experts (which is in formation) will judge them and select five finalists. Finalists will receive prizes.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Citizens will then be asked to select their favorite from these five finalists.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The amount of money that all presidential candidates are required to raise limits voters' choices, and ultimately undermines democracy,&quot; said Nyhart.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Winners will be announced on March 1, 2004.</FONT></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
