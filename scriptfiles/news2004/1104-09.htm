<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SEATTLE -- November 4 --  WHAT: Donna Zajonc (SAY JOHN), author of the new book 'The Politics of Hope' is available to provide advice to those who are blue in the BLUE STATES who might be suffering from Post PARTISAN Depression.</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHO: Donna Zajonc, a Certified Political Leadership Coach, a former mental health nurse and was elected to three terms in the Oregon State House of Representatives starting at the age of 28. Zajonc co-founded the Bainbridge Leadership Center in Washington State. She is the author of the new book &quot;Politics of Hope -Reviving the Dream of Democracy.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHERE: Available via telephone or from Seattle, Washington</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHEN: Following the November 2, 2004 election</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Background: As a former elected state legislator and a mental health nurse, Donna Zajonc, knows how important it is to pay attention to post-partisan depression syndrome. As a political leadership coach, Zajonc has a few recommendations to help manage through the post election transition period.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Advice for Post Partisan Depression</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(1) Take Time. Avoid quick judgment or making sudden decisions. The body needs time to rest. Stay away from strident friends or listening to harsh media programs. Protect your psyche and do something fun.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(2) Grieve. Any loss involves grief and acknowledging your frustration and anger. Accept your feelings and understand that it is normal to feel depressed when your vision is lost.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(3) Dream again. If your candidate lost, you may have lost part of your dream. Begin again. Renew your dream by thinking about what you want for your family, your community and your children.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(4) Converse. It is important to share your dream with others and invite them to do the same: share and listen to those with whom you agree and disagree. This will be the most challenging part, but it is an imperative part of the process.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(5) Hope: Understand that breakdowns precede breakthroughs. Disappointment leads to new possibilities and we find hope in the face of defeat.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Healing your individual post-partisan depression will contribute to the collective healing of our American family. Let us use this time to grieve, reach out to one another, listen, converse and dream again.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>EDITORS NOTE: Media wishing to interview Ms. Zajonc or to use tips from her recent article -- Post Partisan Depression -- can call Kim Fuller at (cell) 918-289-9450 or visit<a href="http://www.politicsofhope.com/book-politics.html" target="_new"> http://www.thepoliticsofhope.com</a></i>.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
