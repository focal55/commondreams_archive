<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ZIMBABWE -- November 8 --  Amnesty International today moved to correct misleading information falsely attributed to the South African section of the organization and other partner non-governmental organizations in Southern Africa. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Information has been widely distributed by email falsely claiming that Amnesty International South Africa (AI-SA) and <a href="http://www.civicusassembly.org/" target="_new">CIVICUS</a>, as well as other NGOs and civic organisations, are mobilising members to prevent entry into, and disrupt life in, Zimbabwe between 4 - 8 December 2004. <br>Contrary to the information widely circulated by e-mail and picked up by some media organisations, Amnesty International reiterates that in its campaign for the protection and promotion of human rights in Zimbabwe, it has adopted an exclusively peaceful approach and dialogue. <br>Advocating any action that might lead to violence is contrary to the guiding principles of Amnesty International.<br></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Background</b><br></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As part of its ongoing human rights work in Zimbabwe, AI-SA and CIVICUS: World Alliance for Citizen Participation announced plans earlier this week to carry out a Border to Border Solidarity Rally on the 10 December 2004, which is International Human Rights Day. <br>The joint initiative between AISA and CIVICUS will involve citizens from the neighbouring countries of Zambia, Mozambique, Botswana and South Africa &#145;peacefully&#146; marching to the different borders of Zimbabwe on this date. <br>This rally is intended as an avenue for civil society organizations in countries neighbouring Zimbabwe, Zimbabweans in the Diaspora and citizens in general, to express their concern about the continued violation of basic fundamental freedoms of the people of Zimbabwe. It is also intended to advocate for the repeal or/and amendment of existing and planned repressive legislation in Zimbabwe, including the recently tabled NGO and Churches Bill. <br></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
