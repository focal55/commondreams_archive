<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - September 20 - In an effort to keep advertisers from undermining freedom of the press and editorial integrity, 61 journalism and law professors sent a letter today to the American Society of Magazine Editors, asking it to enact new rules to require disclosure of product placement in magazines, and to prohibit the disguising of ads as editorial content, or providing special favors to advertisers.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The letter was written and organized by Commercial Alert, a nonprofit organization that opposes commercialism.  It was sent to Marlene Kahan, executive director of the American Society of Magazine Editors.  The letter follows.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dear Ms. Kahan:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Magazine editors in the U.S. are under increasing pressure to weave advertising into their editorial content.  In the past, advertisers have sought to influence stories, often with success.  Now they are going further, and seeking to turn ads into articles.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These efforts are a fundamental threat to press freedom and to the integrity of American journalism.  If magazines become mere tout sheets for products and the interests of those who sell them, then every story will be suspect, and the reading public may have nowhere to turn for information that is truly independent of reigning commercial interests.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If there was ever a need for resolute action by your organization, this is it.  You should strengthen the Society&#146;s editorial guidelines, to draw a clear line against aggressive advertiser intrusion into story content.  This would both provide confidence to readers, and would prevent advertisers from playing one magazine against another.  It would also give editors a convincing reason to turn down advertisers&#146; requests.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In recent months, publications such as the Wall Street Journal, Advertising Age, PR Week and the Christian Science Monitor have reported on how advertisers are leaning on editors to blend advertising with editorial content. This is part of broader efforts by advertisers to increase the impact of their advertising spending.  Other media &#150; especially television, movies and video games -- have acceded to advertisers demands for more product placements.  </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now advertisers are trying to gain similar concessions from magazines, too. &#147;The only way we&#146;re going to be more successful is to get even more creative and try to find ways to address this church-and-state,&#148; meaning the high wall between advertising and editorial, Matthew Spahn, director of media planning at Sears, Roebuck, told Advertising Age.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many editors are feeling the pressure. &#147;More advertisers ask us to blur the lines between advertising and editorial,&#148; Nina Lawrence, publisher of Bride and Modern Bride, told Advertising Age.  &#147;It&#146;s accelerated in the last year.&#148;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Brand names appear more frequently in magazine articles these days, which raises questions about the extent of product placement.  For example, the Christian Science Monitor recently reported on an article in Ski magazine, which mentions the Land Rover truck brand eight times, and features seven pictures of the truck &#150; in an article on travel in Colorado.  The article praises the Rover for its &#147;versatility,&#148;&#147;well-crafted lines,&#148; and a &#147;rugged but cosmopolitan look,&#148; as well as its &#147;ride [which] was smooth even in bad conditions.&#148;  </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some editors appear to be weakening in the face of advertisers&#146; demands.  For example, Kim Olson, director of brand public relations for General Mills, told PR Week, &#147;It depends on the magazine and the publisher, but I see much more openness to (product placement) now than there ever has been before.  Where it used to be church and state, there is much more of a willingness to come together and at least discuss it &#150; not always a willingness to do, but a willingness to discuss.&#148;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The American Society of Magazine Editors should safeguard the integrity of magazines, by incorporating the following provisions into its editorial guidelines.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Product placement.  If an author, editor or publication receives money, goods or other consideration from an advertiser mentioned in an article, that fact should be prominently disclosed, including the amount or fair market value of the goods or payment.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Advertorials and special sections. The words &#147;advertising&#148; or &#147;advertisement&#148; or &#147;promotion&#148; should be at least 1.5 times the size and weight of the publication&#146;s normal editorial body type face, rather than just &#147;at least equal in size.&#148;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">No special treatment for advertisers. ASME should incorporate a provision from the Society of Professional Journalists&#146; code of ethics to &#147;Deny favored treatment to advertisers and special interests and resist their pressure to influence news coverage.&#148;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Enforcement.  Current ASME enforcement mechanisms are inadequate to meet the new increased advertiser pressure.  Any magazine that violates ASME editorial guidelines should be ineligible for National Magazine Awards for at least five years.  Editors who violate the editorial guidelines three times should be permanently expelled from the ASME.  All warning or sanction letters from ASME should be made public and placed on the ASME website.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sincerely, </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Robin Andersen, Associate Professor, Department of Communication and Media Studies, Fordham University; author, Consumer Culture and TV Programming</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Paul Ashdown, Professor of Journalism and Electronic Media, School of Journalism and Electronic Media, University of Tennessee, Knoxville</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">David Badger, Professor of Journalism, School of Journalism, Middle Tennessee State University</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sarah Bartlett, Bloomberg Professor of Business Journalism, Baruch College, City University of New York</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">C.
