<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - March 9 - As the House of Representatives Committee on Resources prepares to convene Wednesday, March 10, all eyes are on questionable figures in the US Forest Service budget that reveal a plan that may leave several programs dangerously underfunded.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In a forthcoming report, The Wilderness Society reveals an illogical system of borrowing and reallocation of funds that will fail to meet the long-term goals of effective wildland fire management and long-term conservation needs. The money to pay for fire suppression is raided from critical forest fuels reduction projects, and other programs, which Congress has failed to fully repay.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In the past, these transfers have delayed land acquisitions, postponed maintenance and halted forest rehabilitation projects and research. As we face a potentially volatile wildland fire season, such shortsighted planning may have the effect of placing communities at greater risk, instead of protecting them.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Taking money from other programs to pay for fire suppression costs is a shortsighted policy that may result in more money being spent on fires because prevention funds were removed,&quot; said Michael Francis, The Wilderness Society's National Forest Program Director.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Unfortunately, administrative costs in FY 2003 for hazardous fuels management were approximately 20%&#151;or nearly $42 million&#151;of the wildland fire program's overall budget, which means a significant amount of funding for fuels reduction work never actually reaches the places needing it most. In addition, substantial cuts to state and local fire assistance raise deeper questions about their priorities; specifically how the Forest Service proposes to protect communities from wildland fire.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">When the 'Healthy Forests' bill was signed into law, it authorized $760 million in funding for hazardous fuels reduction. However, the actual funding will only amount to $476 million. The FY 2005 budget numbers have revealed that only $80-$100 million is new funding, and the remaining amount comes from other program budgets.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In the report, The Federal Wildland Fire Budget, The Wilderness Society outlines several critical shortcomings of the Forest Service budget including:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The cycle perpetuated by borrowing from prevention and other land management budgets to fund fire suppression.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Lack of information needed to prioritize protection of communities in the wildland-urban interface.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Inadequate funding to reduce the build-up of hazardous fuels near communities and for local fire assistance.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Spiraling costs of wildland fire suppression.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">For More Information</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><A HREF="http://www.wilderness.org/Library/Documents/loader.cfm?url=/commonspot/security/getfile.cfm&PageID=8329" TARGET="_new">Download Executive Summary of the report (PDF)</A></FONT></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
