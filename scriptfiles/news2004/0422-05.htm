<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - April 22 - It's no secret that the Bush administration has spent the last three years dismantling America's environmental protections. Now the nation will find out why.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Sierra Club Executive Director Carl Pope will release his new book, <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1578051096/commondreams-20/ref=nosim/" TARGET="_new">'Strategic Ignorance: Why the Bush Administration Is Recklessly Destroying a Century of Environmental Progress'</A>, on Earth Day in Washington, DC. The book is co-authored by Paul Rauber, senior editor of the award-winning Sierra magazine.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;[President] Bush has done his best, in only three years, to break our national compact on environmental progress and turn the clock back -- not years or decades but a full century,&quot; Pope explains in the book.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;This is what the American people do not know: The Bush administration is full of officials who believe -- from the bottom of their hearts, not just their wallets -- that weaker laws on clean air, less funding to clean up toxic waste dumps, and national parks and forests run for private profit are actually good for the country.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In addition to chronicling the Bush administration's record on the environment, Strategic Ignorance uncovers the logic behind that record, revealing a pattern of ideological extremism that is out of step with previous Republican and Democratic administrations, not to mention the American public. The book also explains what happens when the administration's radical agenda contradicts public opinion, sound science, and even the law.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Publishers Weekly recently raved, &quot;The real energy from the book comes from its accumulation of small facts to paint the picture of obsessive secrecy, crony capitalism and the administration's conscious, unabashed commitment to economic exploitation of the air America breathes, the water it drinks and the earth it walks on.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Pope and Rauber peel the layers off the big environmental stories of the last three years, from the Bush administration's misguided efforts to let polluters rewrite clean air laws to its attempt to allow more arsenic in America's drinking water. The book also offers up smaller yet equally disturbing examples of special treatment for a host of polluting industries.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Readers, for example, learn how Karl Rove, the President's chief political advisor, directly involved himself to remove protections for endangered fish on the Klamath River, resulting in the largest fish kill in the river's history. The book also reveals how the Bush administration fired its top mining safety official after he recommended enforcement actions against a coal company responsible for an accident that spilled 250 million gallons of slurry into two Kentucky creeks.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Other highlights of the book include:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">* &quot;Ten Commonsense Solutions for the Next Twenty Years,&quot; which would restore common sense to the public environmental agenda.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">* &quot;Ten Commandments for the Hard Right,&quot; simple unwavering principles consistently applied by the Bush administration to roll back social and environmental progress;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">* The Bush administration's &quot;Romance with Risk,&quot; where caution is thrown to the wind under the guise of cost-benefit analysis;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">* &quot;Why not sell the Grand Canyon?&quot; and other stories about how anti-government extremists with the administration have removed protections from an area the size of Texas and Oklahoma as part of a scheme to privatize public lands;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">* The &quot;Scientific Method&quot; according to the Bush administration, where scientific findings are &quot;the raw material of spin to be dribbled out, manipulated, or suppressed as suits the political needs of the moment;&quot; and</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The Bush administration's assault on the environment has been breathtaking in its swiftness, scope, and severity,&quot; commented U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer, D-CA. &quot;In Strategic Ignorance, Carl Pope and Paul Rauber clearly dissect the administration's agenda and methods. More than a wake-up call, this book is a call to arms for defenders of America's priceless natural heritage.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">For additional notes and updates not in the book visit <A HREF="http://www.strategicignorance.com" TARGET="_new">www.strategicignorance.com</A></FONT></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
