<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">PORTLAND,OR - February 4 - On the heels of the Bush administration's budget announcements, today the Save Our Wild Salmon Coalition (SOS), a nationwide coalition of more than 50 businesses, conservation organizations, commercial and sportfishing associations, river groups and taxpayer advocates, released a chronological report of the Bush administration's record on recovery of imperiled Pacific wild salmon and steelhead. The report summarizes 35 separate Administration actions in the last three years, which together document a consistent pattern of failure to restore salmon, comply with laws and treaties, or build the Northwest's salmon economies. </FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Restoring salmon for the Northwest has not been an administration priority in its first three years,&quot; said Pat Ford, executive director, Save Our Wild Salmon Coalition. &quot;The two flagship federal salmon plans have been struck down in court. Promised and required protections have been repeatedly violated. The west coast's largest salmon kill occurred. It's a very poor record, it is consistently poor for three straight years, and it's the reverse of what people and communities need.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The plan to recover Endangered Species Act-listed salmon in the Columbia-Snake Basin has been consistently shortchanged over the last three years. In 2001 and 2002, federal agencies charged with their recovery implemented less than 30 percent and funded less than 50 percent of the required actions. Because of such inadequacies the salmon plan was recently ruled illegal by a federal court.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The Timeline of Failure shows that, like the falsely-named Healthy Forests and Clear Skies initiatives, President Bush's ostensible devotion to salmon recovery is little more than a press release and a facade,&quot; said Bill Arthur, Northwest regional director, Sierra Club. &quot;Press releases don't work any better than pray-for-rain salmon recovery plans. We have had too much praying, too many press releases, and not enough salmon recovery action that works.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Monday, the Bush administration released their proposed budget for FY05, which by their own assessments allots $607 million for the implementation of the Columbia-Snake River salmon plan: $47 million (8 percent) less than the administration requested last year, and $23 million (4 percent) less than enacted last year. At best, this amounts to only 60 percent of the resources needed to implement the plan. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The fact that these are tight fiscal times is reflected in the administration's cuts to the salmon budget,&quot; said Rob Masonis, Northwest regional director, American Rivers. &quot;But failing to fully fund salmon recovery now -- and close what's become a growing salmon funding deficit -- will just create more difficult choices in the future. A real effort to recover wild salmon now would save money in the long run.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">As the Timeline of Failure documents, over the past three years, federal courts have repeatedly struck down federal salmon policies and plans for failing to do what laws require. The Bush administration has failed to keep harmful toxins from entering Northwest salmon rivers, failed to keep water temperatures cool, failed to assure rivers have enough water, and failed to ensure that federal salmon plans comply with the Endangered Species Act. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;We haven't been able to make any headway on salmon protection efforts with this administration so far,&quot; said Todd True, senior staff attorney, Earthjustice. &quot;Instead, recent acts by the administration have made it as difficult as possible for salmon. With barriers such as dams, trucking and barging, hot water, pollutants, mining equipment and dioxins, we're lucky the fish keep coming back at all.&quot; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Fortunately, wild salmon and steelhead have been returning in higher numbers recently, compared to decades of dismal returns after the completion of the lower Snake River dams. President Bush and his administration have repeatedly tried to take credit for those increased returns; however, according to scientists good ocean conditions, not administration policies, deserve credit for the higher numbers. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The salmon are returning to the rivers and streams of the Northwest not because of man-made solutions, but because of a gift of nature,&quot; said Brock Evans, director, Endangered Species Coalition. &quot;The Bush administration must be held accountable to strengthen and improve protections for salmon during this time -- not simply take credit for the good works of Mother Nature.&quot; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The higher than average salmon returns in the Pacific Northwest have supported hundreds of jobs and brought hundreds of millions of dollars into the region's struggling economy. Rather than capitalizing on this and making tough decisions in order to restore salmon to self-sustaining harvestable populations, this administration suggests that they will limit fishing in order to protect the dwindling numbers. Worse, administration officials are pointing to recent increases in returns of some stocks as reason to do away with the limited legal protections currently sustaining them.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Salmon aren't just any fish - they are an important economic resource to the Northwest that still supports lots of jobs,&quot; says Glen Spain, Northwest regional director, Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen's Associations. &quot;The Northwest's salmon-based economy is hemorrhaging badly, and the time is way past for just bandaids. The administration must make better decisions and put in place better policies that will protect this vital economic resource; they mean too much.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">To see a copy of the timeline in PDF form, please go to <A HREF="http://www.wildsalmon.org" TARGET="_new">http://www.wildsalmon.org</A> or call 503-230-0421.</FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
