<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">ISAFJORDUR - June 22 - &quot;Choose the future, not whaling&quot;, was the message communicated when the Greenpeace ship, MV Esperanza arrived at the port of Isafjordur, the number one Icelandic whaling center. The port visit  is the first stop in this year's shiptour in Iceland. During the day Greenpeace will meet with locals communities, whalers and fishermen to discuss the future of whaling in Iceland.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Icelandic government recently announced that they will put their so called &quot;scientific&quot; whaling programme on hold and limit this year's take to 25 minke whales. The planned take of 500 whales, including sei and fin, during a 2 year period, has been cancelled due to a strong domestic criticism combined with the lack of a market for whale products.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">A total of 36 minke whales were caught last year when Iceland, despite massive global protests, resumed whaling again for the first time in 14 years. (1)</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Iceland is on the border between old and new, future and past&quot;, said Greenpeace International Ocean Campaigner, Frode Pleym. &quot;The Government of Iceland should make the obvious wise decision and cancel the entire programme. By choosing the only truly sustainable future path, Iceland can set an example for other whaling nations to follow and secure a future for the people of this country&quot;.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The market for whale meat is small and decreasing in whaling nations Iceland, Norway and Japan due to changed eating habits and the level of environmental toxins in the whale products. Iceland still has an ample supply of whale meat left over since last year's take and no future market is in sight.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The growing domestic opposition to whaling came as a surprise to the Government.The Icelandic travel industry association and the whale  watching operators have made it clear that a restart of whaling in  Iceland will damage the reputation of the nation and decrease the  amount of tourists visiting. Tourism and whale watching has become one of the major sources of income in Iceland.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Early indications are that eco tourism- and whale watching in particular- , is already suffering because of whaling, said Frode Pleym.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Last autumn Greenpeace launched an offer to the Icelandic Government showing the clear economic and environmental gain in choosing sustainable tourism over whaling. By taking a pledge people worldwide pledged to consider a vacation in Iceland rather than somewhere else if whaling was stopped. So far almost 60 000 people worldwide have taken the pledge representing over 60 million USD in tourism value versus 4 million USD from commercial whaling when it was last active. (2)</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot; The Icelandic Government has a golden opportunity to chose living whales and eco tourism over whaling&quot;, said Pleym. &quot;At the IWC meeting next month, the government can announce that the two year research programme is finished and that neither research whaling nor commercial whaling will play part in Iceland's future&quot;.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Onboard the Esperanza are Greenpeace activists from 17 countries. The next stop during the tour is Husavik, Icelands whale watching center. After that the Esperanza will head for Reykjavik where Greenpeace will participate in this years OSPAR meeting.
