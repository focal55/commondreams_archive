<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - September 17 - MoveOn PAC today called on the Bush Administration to release the full text of the National Intelligence Estimate, which President Bush has had since July, so that Americans can better understand how he and his top officials have consistently misled them about developments in Iraq.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The demand came as MoveOn PAC's latest TV ad, &quot;Quagmire,&quot; is running in Iowa, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Ohio and nationally on CNN. The ad claims &quot;George Bush misled us into war with Iraq, sending poorly equipped soldiers into battle.&quot; </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bush surrogates, including campaign chairman Marc Racicot and former Sen. Bob Dole, sought to distract attention from news reports yesterday that the consensus of the US intelligence community, contained in the classified intelligence report, directly contradicts recent Bush, Cheney and Rumsfeld public statements about prospects for US success in Iraq. Both Bush spokespeople attacked MoveOn PAC's ad without noting the obvious conflict between the Administration's rosy scenarios and the intelligence community's dire warnings that corroborated the central message of the ad.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As it began running, new evidence emerged of Bush's failure to tell the truth about Iraq. On August 5, President Bush told us, &quot;(Iraq is) on the path to lasting democracy and liberty,&quot; at the White House as he signed the Defense bill. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Then on Aug 24, Vice President Cheney told voters in Iowa: &quot;We're moving in the right direction (in Iraq).&quot; </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;So we have a President who has misled the American people on Weapons of Mass Destruction and the likelihood of nuclear weapons development in Iraq -- claims that were refuted again in a draft report written by the top American weapons inspector in Iraq, made public in the media today,&quot; said Eli Pariser, executive director of MoveOn PAC.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;They told us our troops would be welcomed as liberators; now over 1,000 are dead. They told us the war would pay for itself, and now we've spent $150 billion. Americans deserve to see the N.I.E. in its entirety, so they can judge for themselves how truthful this President has been about the adequacy of his leadership on Iraq,&quot; Pariser said</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Editor's Note: View new ad at <a href="http://www.moveonpac.org" target="_new">http://www.moveonpac.org</a></font></p><p></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
