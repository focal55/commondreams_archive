<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- DECEMBER 3 -- </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This week&#146;s economic reports renew alarm bells for America&#146;s working families. Instead of the healthy job growth some had predicted, employers added only 112,000 jobs in November&#151;half the expected number and well short of what we need simply to keep up with population growth. The unemployment rate has not improved since last summer, and new jobless claims rose sharply last week. The nation&#146;s retailers reported a surprisingly sluggish start to the holiday shopping season. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Americans desperately need and want good jobs and cannot find them. With the exception of a few months, the employment situation has not changed all year. Last January, more than 14 million workers were looking for jobs but couldn&#146;t find them or were working part-time because they could not get full-time work. Today, the number has dipped only slightly. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hard-hit sectors of the economy continue to reel. Manufacturing lost another 5,000 jobs last month, bringing total manufacturing job loss under the president&#146;s watch to 2.7 million. Employment in information services remains unchanged, and the sector has lost 545,000 since President Bush took office. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The economy is deeply unbalanced and too weak to produce the jobs, especially the good jobs, American workers and their families need. And the president continues to do nothing but cut taxes and hope for the best. America&#146;s working families deserve better. <br></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
