<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BOSTON - October 5 - Citing concerns about exploiting children to market toxic products to their families, thirty prominent children's and environmental organizations sent a public letter today to US Youth Soccer (USYS) asking them not to renew their sponsorship agreement with TruGreen/ChemLawn. </font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since the partnership was announced in May, 2003, TruGreen/Chemlawn, using address lists provided by USYS, has sent mailings addressed to &quot;The Family of&quot; young soccer players touting ChemLawn's services.  The mailings explicitly state several times that TruGreen/ChemLawn will donate a percentage of each purchase to USYS.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;These mailings are not only a violation of children's privacy, but a transparent attempt to get children to nag their parents for ChemLawn's services,&quot; said Dr. Susan Linn, of Harvard's Judge Baker Children's Center and author of Consuming Kids: The Hostile Takeover of Childhood. &quot;Marketers are constantly looking for ways to make it harder for parents to say no - in this case by equating support of their children's soccer team with hiring a company to dump pesticides on their lawn.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Studies have linked lawn pesticides to birth defects, liver and kidney damage, and neurological disorders.  Children are more likely to come into contact with lawn pesticides and are more vulnerable to their effects.  The use of pesticides has been linked to an increased risk of childhood illnesses including non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, brain cancer, and leukemia.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The letter calls on USYS to:</font></p><ul><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Protect children's health by not renewing their     sponsorship agreement with ChemLawn when the     current agreement expires in December, 2004.</font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Protect children's privacy by refusing to share their     contact information with USYS -or any other corporate     sponsors.</font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Refrain from working with corporate partners whose     products and/or practices may cause harm to children.</font></li></ul><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The letter was written by the coalition to Stop Commercial Exploitation of Children, a national advocacy group that counters the harmful effects of marketing to children.  Signatories include organizations concerned about the commercialization of childhood as well as and environmental and public health advocacy groups concerned about the harmful effects of pesticides.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Parents with concerns about the ChemLawn/US Youth Soccer Partnership are urged to contact USYS Director of Marketing Chris Branscome (1-800-476-2237; <a href="mailto:cbranscome@usyouthsoccer.org">cbranscome@usyouthsoccer.org</a>).</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The complete text of the letter and its signatories can be found at: <a href="http://www.commercialexploitation.org/Pressreleases/lettertousys.htm" target="_new">http://www.commercialexploitation.org/Pressreleases/lettertousys.htm</a></font></p><p></p><p align="CENTER"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">###</font></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
