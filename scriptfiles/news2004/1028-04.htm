<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LONDON -- October 28  -- Activists from Greenpeace International today climbed onto the nets of a European Union bottom trawling vessel in the North Atlantic while she attempted to land her destructive haul, as part of an ongoing protest against deep sea destruction and the EU's efforts to block an international moratorium.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Activists from Greenpeace International today climbed onto the nets of a European Union bottom trawling vessel in the North Atlantic while she attempted to land her destructive haul, as part of an ongoing protest against deep sea destruction and the EU's efforts to block an international moratorium.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On the third day of sustained action against the EU bottom trawler &quot;Playa de Menduina&quot;, the two activists then unfurled a banner which read &quot;EU Deep Sea Destroyer&quot; before being dragged through the waves on the net and up onto the deck of the Spanish flagged trawler. There they hoisted a flag on the vessel, which bore the international &quot;Stop&quot; red circle over the words 'EU Deep Sea Bottom Trawler'. They remained on deck for 25 minutes before jumping to a waiting Greenpeace inflatable.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the last two days at the United Nations, fisheries representatives have been discussing the future of the high seas and tomorrow will specifically discuss calls for an international moratorium on high seas bottom trawling.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bottom-trawling boats on the high seas, the majority of which are from EU countries, drag fishing gear weighing several tonnes across the sea bed, destroying everything in their path including marine wildlife such as coral and devastating life on underwater mountains ? or 'seamounts'.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Maria Jose Caballero, Greenpeace campaigner onboard the &quot;Esperanza&quot;, said: &quot;The EU and all governments of the world must support a moratorium on high seas bottom trawling. The UN is currently meeting to protect deep seas from this kind of destruction and the EU is inexcusably blocking attempts to stop bottom trawlers trashing important and unique habitats.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The &quot;Esperanza&quot; is currently investigating and documenting bottom trawling in the North Atlantic. Seamounts in this area run from the south of Iceland to the Azores and form the world's largest mountain range</font>.</p>
