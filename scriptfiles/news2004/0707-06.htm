<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - July 7 - The Sierra Club joined recreation, hunting and other conservation groups across the country in calling the Forest Service&#146;s proposed rules for off-road vehicle use on America&#146;s National Forests largely ineffective. The proposal, designed to govern use of all-terrain vehicles (ATVs), dirt bikes and other off-road vehicles (ORVs) on America&#146;s 176 National Forests and Grasslands, marks a small step forward but still needs significant strengthening. </FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The Forest Service has taken a small step by acknowledging the serious threat that unmanaged off-road vehicle use poses to America&#146;s National Forests, wildlife habitat and the millions of people who recreate in these special places,&quot; said Karl Forsgaard, Chair of the Sierra Club&#146;s national Recreation Issues Committee. &quot;However, the proposed rule falls short and must be strengthened if it is to truly succeed.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Although some changes are positive, they alone will not solve this growing problem. The Bush administration must include additional measures in the final rule to ensure basic protections for public land, wildlife and other types of recreation. These include:</FONT></P><UL><LI><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> Within two years, designating roads and routes that are appropriate for off-road vehicle travel. At the end of this period, such use could only occur on designated roads and routes; </FONT></LI><LI><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Designating roads and routes based on a full and public analysis of the site-specific environmental impacts and user-conflicts;</FONT></LI><LI><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Immediately barring use of all unauthorized, renegade routes; and</FONT></LI><LI><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Authorizing off-road vehicle use only to the extent that effective monitoring and enforcement are annually funded and implemented.</FONT></LI></UL><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Forest Service is proposing several policy changes that would be beneficial if effectively implemented on the ground. These include:</FONT></P><UL><LI><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> Prohibiting cross-country travel by motor vehicles except under limited circumstances;</FONT></LI><LI><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Authorizing ATV and dirt bike use only on roads and off-road vehicle routes specifically designated as open for such use; </FONT></LI><LI><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Enabling law enforcement officers to issue citations more easily. </FONT></LI></UL><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;In order for real reform to succeed, the Bush administration needs to include a two-year timeframe for implementing the rule on the ground, and they need to prohibit interim use of existing renegade, unauthorized ATV and dirt bike routes,&quot; said Forsgaard. &quot;The upcoming 60-day public comment period gives people an opportunity to urge the Forest Service to improve its proposed rule, to better protect the land.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Last year, U.S. Forest Service Chief Dale Bosworth identified unmanaged recreation, particularly off-road vehicle use, as one of the greatest threats to America&#146;s National Forests. He described a litany of adverse impacts to the land, wildlife and other visitors and highlighted the proliferation of unplanned - or renegade - dirt bike and all-terrain vehicle (ATV) routes that criss-cross many National Forests. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The proposed rule is available today on the Forest Service&#146;s website at: <A HREF="http://www.fs.fed.us/recreation/programs/ohv/index.shtml" TARGET="_new">http://www.fs.fed.us/recreation/programs/ohv/index.shtml</A>. Publication of the proposal in the Federal Register, expected in the next several days, will begin a 60-day public comment period.
