<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - September 14 - In the past week, a handful of stories have cast doubt on whether George W. Bush fulfilled his National Guard obligations 30 years ago.  Reports by the Associated Press (9/7/04), Boston Globe (9/8/04) and U.S. News &amp; World Report (9/20/04) have all raised new questions about Bush's military service.  Though each of these stories has been accompanied by significant official documentation, developments in the investigations by AP, U.S. News and the Boston Globe have been largely sidetracked by the fixation on questions about the authenticity of documents aired on CBS on September 8.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Weighing the credibility of evidence is an essential function of journalism.  Experts have weighed in on both sides on the authenticity of CBS's so-called Killian memos (New York Times, 9/14/04; Washington Post, 9/14/04); efforts to establish the origin of those documents should continue.  However, news outlets that focus on this tangent of the National Guard story to the exclusion of the unchallenged new evidence that has recently emerged are neglecting another essential journalistic task: holding powerful people and politicians accountable.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the wake of the stories scrutinizing Bush's stateside service during the Vietnam era, it's hard to imagine a better situation for the White House than to have the press corps ignore a range of evidence raising questions about Bush's fulfillment of his obligations while obsessing singularly on one set of documents from one story.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A review of some of the information uncovered in recent news reports:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The September 7 Associated Press story, based on new records the White House had long maintained didn't exist, debunked a Bush assertion that he'd skipped his flight physical because the jet he was trained on was becoming obsolete.  According to AP, Bush's unit continued to fly the same jets for two years after the missed physical.<br>
    <br>
  </font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The September 8 <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines04/0908-02.htm">Boston Globe expose</a> concluded that Bush failed in his military obligations by missing months of duty in Alabama and in Boston. </font><br>
    <br>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As the Globe revealed, Bush had signed contracts on two separate occasions swearing to meet minimum Guard requirements on penalty of being called up to active duty.  According to the military experts consulted by the Globe, Bush's Guard attendance was so bad &quot;his superiors could have disciplined him or ordered him to active duty in 1972, 1973 or 1974.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  </font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">U.S News &amp; World Report (9/20/04) reviewed National Guard regulations and reported that the White House has been using &quot;an inappropriate-- and less stringent-- Air Force standard in determining that he had fulfilled his duty.&quot;  The magazine noted that Bush committed to attend at least &quot;44 inactive-duty training drills each fiscal year&quot; when he signed up for the Guard, but that Bush's own records &quot;show that he fell short of that requirement, attending only 36 drills in the 1972-73 period, and only 12 in the 1973-74 period.&quot; The magazine explains that even by using the White House's preferred methodology for measuring Bush's service, he still fell short of those minimum requirements.<br>
    <br>
  </font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An NBC Nightly News segment (9/9/04) played a clip of Bush being interviewed in 1988, acknowledging that favoritism sometimes played a part in getting into the National Guard.  While he had said that he didn't think that happened in his case, he did voice his approval of the practice: &quot;If you want to go in the National Guard, I guess sometimes people made calls.  I don't see anything wrong with it.&quot;  (He continued with a remark that could be taken as an insult to the men and women who did face combat during the war: &quot;They probably should have called the National Guard up in those days. Maybe we'd have done better in Vietnam.&quot;)</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Even CBS's September 8 broadcasts, the subject of so much scrutiny, included important information beyond what is contained in the disputed memos.  On the CBS Evening News and 60 Minutes II that night, CBS featured Ben Barnes, the former speaker of the Texas legislature, describing how he used his political influence to help a young George W. Bush bypass a waiting list and secure a coveted position in the Guard.  In addition, the CBS stories also featured an interview with Robert Strong, a former colleague of Bush's commander, Lt. Col. Jerry Killian, the purported author of the disputed documents.  Strong described the pressure Bush's commander was working under: &quot;He was trying to deal with a volatile political situation, dealing with the son of an ambassador and a former congressman.... And I just saw him in an impossible situation. I felt very, very sorry because he was between a rock and a hard place.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Instead of asking the White House tough questions about the well-documented information contained in these reports, media have focused almost exclusively on the claims and counter-claims made about the Killian memos-- as if the discrepancies over Bush's service record stand or fall based on this one set of disputed documents.  It's the equivalent of covering the sideshow and ignoring the center ring.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
