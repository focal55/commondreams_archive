<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NEW YORK, NY -- November 2 -- Today Miles Rapoport, President of Demos, a nonpartisan public policy organization, and former Secretary of the State of Connecticut, issued the following statement regarding today's high voter turnout and reported problems at polling sites: </font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;All across the country, preliminary indications from early voting and from polling places this morning point to extremely high voter turnout this election, reversing thirty years of declining voter participation. This is wonderful news for our democracy, and we applaud voters for braving long lines and confusion in order to make sure that their ballot is cast and their voice is heard. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;As we applaud and welcome this surge in voter participation, however, it has exposed many lingering challenges to a fair and open balloting process. Our most immediate cause for concern are reports from across the country of structural failures in our election systems. These include: </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Polling places opening late <br>Absentee ballots not being received by voters <br>Shortages of provisional ballots <br>Poll workers asking for ID when it is not a requirement <br>Voters finding they are not on voter registration rolls <br>Voting machine failures <br>Confusion over polling site changes <br>Understaffed polling stations, leading to long lines <br>&quot;The clearest early lesson from today is that there continue to be significant and preventable structural problems in our election systems, and major election reform is still needed. Our election procedures should embrace high voter turnout, not buckle under its weight. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;In light of voters' experiences today, states must resolve the weaknesses in their election systems and use funds authorized by the Help America Vote Act (HAVA) to reform and improve how elections are run, including increasing their capacity to handle high voter turnout. There is also a crying need for national uniform election procedures, in order to minimize the arbitrary variations and conflicting standards that voters are subject to. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Today, and during the past few weeks of early voting, Americans have shown their deep commitment to democracy and their determination to making their voices heard. We must honor that commitment by ensuring an election system that is fair, accurate and capable of serving voters well.&quot; </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For information about challenges to the integrity of our elections in 2004, download the &quot;Democracy at Risk&quot; press briefing kit at <a href="http://www.demos-usa.org/" target="_new">www.demos-usa.org</a>. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Demos: A Network for Ideas &amp; Action is a nonprofit, nonpartisan public policy organization based in New York</i></font><i>.</i> <br></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
