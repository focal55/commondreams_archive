<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MINNEAPOLIS  -- December 8 --  A group of prominent Minnesota organizations and citizens sent a letter today to Minnesota Senator Norm Coleman criticizing his decision to call for the resignation of the United Nations' Secretary General Kofi Annan in connection with the Oil-for-Food Program.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The signatories wrote that they were &quot;deeply troubled&quot; by Senator Coleman's &quot;extreme position&quot; on Annan. Coleman has admitted that he has no evidence of wrongdoing or impropriety on the part of Annan.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;At this sensitive moment, we should be reinforcing the United Nations as a forum for furthering international security and human rights,&quot; said Barbara A. Frey, Human Rights Program, University of Minnesota, a signatory of the letter. &quot;Unfortunately, Senator Coleman has chosen to burn bridges instead of build them, a reckless and ambitious act that puts us at risk as a nation.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It's disappointing to see Senator Coleman publicly attack one of the world' s most respected leaders at a time when we are asking for greater UN involvement in places like Sudan and Iraq,&quot; said Mark Ritchie, President of the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, who helped organize the letter. &quot;Leaders from around the world, including Prime Minister Blair, have expressed their support for Annan in light of Coleman's comments. This letter shows that many Minnesotans also don't agree with him.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Prominent signatories to the letter to Coleman included:<br></font></p><ul><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Arlen Erdahl, former U.S. Congressman from Minnesota.<br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Barbara Frey, Director of the Human Rights Program at the University of Minnesota.<br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Harlan Cleveland, former Ambassador to NATO under President Johnson.<br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Norma Rowe, Co-President of the United Nations Association of Minnesota.<br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dean Zimmermann, Minneapolis City Council.<br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rebecca Yanisch, former Minnesota Commissioner of Trade and Economic<br>Development.<br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Kathleen Laurila, Vice President for the International Federation of<br>University Women.<br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">David Weissbrodt, Fredrikson and Byron Professor of Law.<br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">	Don Fraser, former U.S. Congressman from Minnesota.<br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">.

The program was necessary because UN sanctions instituted in 1990, in response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, had resulted in massive malnutrition and increased infant mortality rates. It was recognized at the time that because the program went through Saddam Hussein, there would likely be fraud and other problems, but it was determined that the humanitarian need was too important. Under the program, millions of Iraqis were fed, child malnutrition and mortality went down, and access to electricity and clean water increased.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Problems within the Oil-for-Food program first surfaced in 2000. It became public that contracts to purchase Iraqi oil included kickbacks to Saddam. In addition, several countries including Turkey, Jordan and Syria were purchasing oil outside of the program. Each oil contract through the program required the approval of the UN Security Council, including the U.S.. On at least 70 occasions, Security Council members were informed by UN staff about problems with the contracts, but the U.S. never blocked a single contract.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Last year, Kofi Annan appointed Paul Volcker, former Fed Chairman, to head up an investigation by an independent panel of the problems with the program. Volcker will release the first phase of his findings in January. Volcker has access to internal UN documents, records, and personnel that Coleman does not.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We acknowledge the need for greater accountability of this program,&quot; the letter writes. &quot;When all the facts are in, we can then go about establishing an efficient and transparent procedure that will strengthen the UN in the future.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The full letter to Coleman can be read at:<a href="http://www.iatp.org/" target="_new"> www.iatp.org</a>.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For additional comment, contact:<br>David Weissbrodt, Fredrikson and Byron Professor of Law, 612-625-5027.<br>Don Fraser, former U.S. Congressman from Minnesota, 612-379-9451.<br>Stuart Ackman, boardmember of the United Nations Association of Minnesota<br>and the UNA-USA, 612-280-2325.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>The Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy promotes resilient family farms, rural communities and ecosystems around the world through research and education, science and technology, and advocacy.<br></i></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
