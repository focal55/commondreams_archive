<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - August 23 - The AFL-CIO deplores the massive and systematic violations of human rights, being committed in the province of Darfur, Sudan. Tens of thousands of innocent civilians have been killed and over one million people have been driven from their homes. We call on the Government of Sudan to immediately stop the violence perpetrated against civilians; disarm, and hold accountable the commanders and militias responsible for the horrific abuses; cooperate with and adhere to the terms implemented by the African Union (AU) through its monitoring mission; act fully and speedily to implement UN Security Council Resolution 1556; and allow unrestricted access by humanitarian groups to those in need in Darfur. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We call on all signatories to the April 8 cease-fire agreement, and their proxy militias, to fully respect the terms of the cease-fire. We urge all parties perpetuating the conflict to immediately initiate dialogue and address the underlying social, political and financial problems that underpin the crisis. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In accordance with the recent US House of Representatives resolution, we urge the Bush Administration to identify this crisis in Darfur as &#147;genocide&#148; and take action in line with the interests of the African Union to stop the atrocities and ensure humanitarian access in the region. The AFL-CIO has joined with the international labor movement and human rights organizations to closely monitor developments and will take all appropriate steps to help ensure a quick end to this horrible outrage. </font></p><p></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
