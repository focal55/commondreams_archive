<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- October 28 -- The American Civil Liberties Union and New York Civil Liberties Union today welcomed letters sent by the New York City Council and a coalition of Irish-American groups to Congressional conferees, asking them to keep anti-immigrant measures out of their final 9/11 reform legislation. Although the conferees&#146; attempt to reach a compromise before the election failed, they are slated to continue working on a measure for Congress to vote on during a lame duck session.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;If the Red Sox can win the series, lawmakers can put politics aside to get this done right,&quot; said Laura W. Murphy, Director of the ACLU Washington Legislative Office. &quot;Controversial anti-immigrant powers and Patriot Act expansions not even called for by the 9/11 Commission deserve full and open debate - it is shameful that the House leadership is attempting to use this legislation to push through unrelated measures.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a letter sent to the conferees, New York City Council Members outlined their concerns, including the creation of a de facto national ID, denial of basic judicial review over unfair or arbitrary deportations, summary deportations, increased burdens for asylum seekers, and the potential for individuals to be deported to countries where they will be tortured.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We in New York City still feel the impact of the attacks of September 11th, and the City Council is taking the right step in saying that Congress must not pass anti-immigrant legislation in our name,&quot; said Donna Lieberman, Executive Director of the New York Civil Liberties Union.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A coalition of Irish-American groups also wrote to conferees, raising concerns over the court stripping and expedited removal provisions. The letter notes that the House bill would allow Irish immigrants, including permanent residents, to be deported simply for defending the right of the Irish Republican Army to use weapons against military targets.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The letter was sent by the <a href="http://www.iauc.org/index3.htm" target="_new">Irish American Unity Conference</a>, <a href="http://www.iauc.org/actnow2004.htm" target="_new">Irish Deportees of America Committee</a>, <a href="http://www.inac.org/" target="_new">Irish Northern Aid</a>, <a href="http://www.irishnationalcaucus.org/" target="_new">Irish National Caucus</a>, <a href="http://www.aoh.com/" target="_new">Ancient Order of Hibernians</a>, and <a href="http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/Senate/3257/" target="_new">Lawyers Alliance for Justice in Ireland</a>.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Groups from across the political spectrum are urging lawmakers to remove the anti-immigrant and law enforcement expansion provisions. The inclusion of these measures in the House bill has prompted opposition from groups as varied as the ACLU, families of 9/11 victims, <a href="http://www.gunowners.org/" target="_new">Gun Owners of America</a>, the <a href="http://www.nclr.org/" target="_new">National Council of La Raza</a>, the <a href="http://www.maldef.org/" target="_new">Mexican-American Legal Defense and Education Fund</a> and the conservative <a href="http://www.canf.org/2004/principal-ingles.htm" target="_new">Cuban American National Foundation</a>. </font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
