<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - October 11 - A report from <a href="http://www.pfaw.org/pfaw/general/" target="_new">People For the American Way</a> Foundation documents that concerns raised about Bush nominees to the federal appeals courts have been well-founded, as many of those judges now sitting on the bench wrote or joined opinions this year seeking to significantly limit congressional authority, protection of individual rights, and access to justice.

 

<p>"Too many of President Bush's appeals court nominees have had records of indifference or outright hostility to individuals' rights and their ability to protect their rights through the courts," said People For the American Way Foundation President Ralph G. Neas.  "We now have more evidence that those who raised concerns about many of these nominees were right to do so." 

 

<p>According to the report, an update to an earlier report covering the initial years of Bush judges, in divided cases decided during the first eight months of 2004, Bush-nominated appeals court judges wrote or joined almost 50 opinions seeking to limit congressional authority and the protection of constitutional, environmental, consumer, and individual rights.

 

<p>Notably, many of the cases examined in the report document that appeals court judges nominated by President Bush have prevented or sought to prevent individual Americans from presenting their claims to a jury.  In a disturbing pattern, judges often misused, or tried to convince their colleagues to misuse, summary judgment procedures to prevent a case from even being heard, in spite of evidence that should have allowed cases to go forward.  Abuse of summary judgment prevents individuals challenging the actions of the government, powerful corporations, and other institutions from even having their day in court.

 

<p>Opinions by Bush-nominated appeals court judges, often written in dissent, sought to:

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
<p>"Federal judges have real power to affect peoples' lives and legal protections," said Neas. "That is why it is important for senators to continue to take seriously their constitutional obligation to scrutinize federal judicial nominees to ensure that they have demonstrated a commitment to upholding individuals rights, legal protections, and access to justice."
