But the Campaign for America&#146;s Future and a large coalition of senior, labor and civic groups have joined to make the case that the new drug deal gives windfall profits to the drug and insurance industry and provides tax breaks for the rich &#150; without giving a reliable prescription drug benefit or drug price relief to seniors and people with disabilities.   </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">President Bush will no doubt talk about his prescription drug bill in his State of the Union speech on January 20.

Their enormous political contributions to Bush and his party gave them easy access to the White House and Congressional drafting sessions.

The new law, which will spend a good part of $400 billion over 10 years to buy drugs for seniors, should have empowered Medicare to do what any private firm would do when it buys a lot of anything, widgets or health care services:  go to the drug companies and </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">negotiate the lowest possible price.  (This is what the Veterans Administration does, saving billions on drug prices.)  Instead, the bill President Bush is so proud of actually explicitly prohibits the federal government from negotiating low prices on behalf of beneficiaries.[3]  This is a provision that only a drug company lobbyist could have written.   </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Gail Shearer, Health Policy Director at Consumers Union, looked at the impact of Bush&#146;s new drug plan on the pharmaceutical expenditures of consumers, making the assumption that the law will do nothing to curb the outrageously high prices charged by the big drug companies. [4]</FONT></P><P>  </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">She found that &#147;the benefit design, and the assumption of continued growth in expenditures combine so that people at most expenditure levels actually face out-of-pocket expenditures in 2007 (when they would have coverage) greater than their out-of-pocket expenditures in 2003 (when they have no drug coverage).&#148; </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">To repeat, she finds that &#147;Most beneficiaries will face higher out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs after full implementation, despite the benefit.&#148;      Specifically, she found:</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The average Medicare beneficiary (without prescription drug coverage) spending</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">$2,318 in 2003 would find that his or her out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">(including: premium, deductible, co-payments, and &#147;doughnut&#148;) are higher in 2007,</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">despite the new prescription drug benefit, and would total $2,911 in 2007 (real 2003 dollars).</FONT></P><P> </P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Bush says:  &quot;[T]his legislation is a victory for all of America's seniors.&quot; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">George W.

Under the new legislation, elderly and disabled Medicare beneficiaries who qualify for Medicaid and have gross incomes modestly above the poverty line will begin paying charges of $5 per month per brand-name prescription and $2 per month per generic prescription.  (The charges are lower for those below the poverty line.)  For those with few prescriptions, these differences may not matter much.  For those with many prescriptions, however, the differences can be significant.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Of particular concern, these $5 and $2 charges will be increased each year by the percentage that drug costs rise per Medicare beneficiary, which the Congressional Budget Office projects will be about 10 percent per year.  These near-poor elderly and disabled beneficiaries live primarily on fixed incomes that do not rise over time or on small Social Security checks that rise with the general inflation rate, which CBO projects will be about 2.5 percent per year.  In other words, the drug co-payment charges these beneficiaries will have to pay will rise about four times faster than their incomes.  </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Still more troubling, Medicaid generally covers all drugs that a beneficiary needs.  By contrast, the new legislation allows the private insurance plans that will deliver the Medicare drug benefit to beneficiaries in Medicare fee-for-service (as well as HMOs and PPOs that provide all Medicare benefits to their enrollees, including the drug benefit) to limit coverage to two drugs per therapeutic class.  This means that many poor elderly and disabled beneficiaries who currently receive drug coverage through Medicaid may lose coverage for the drugs they have been prescribed.[11]</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Bush says:  The new law protects existing retiree coverage. </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Facts:  It doesn&#146;t do much to prevent companies from dumping their drug plans for their retired employees.   </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The Congressional Budget Office estimates about 2.7 million seniors could lose benefits that may be more generous than those that will be offered under Medicare.&quot;  From USA Today, 11/25/03. [12]  </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Alliance for Retired Americans reports:  The law provides a subsidy to sponsors of qualifying private employer retiree health plans, but that amount is 28% of &#147;allowable retiree costs&#148; in excess of &#147;cost threshold&#148; up to amount of &#147;cost limit.&#148; For 2006, the individual cost threshold is $250 and cost limit is $5,000. Allowable retiree costs exclude administrative costs, net of rebates, charge backs, discounts, etc. The law only requires the plan to provide drug coverage that is &#147;at least actuarially equivalent to the standard prescription plan&#148; which means many companies could, and probably will, reduce current coverage. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 2.7 million retirees who currently receive drug coverage through a former employer will lose those benefits.

Supporters tout this as &#147;only a demonstration project,&#148; but it is the beginning of the privatization of Medicare. Private insurance companies will have the option to &#147;cherry-pick&#148; enrollees, that is they will accept healthier seniors, leaving sicker seniors in the traditional program . Unlike the traditional program, private insurers do not guarantee premiums, can drop patients and change coverage. The law also establishes a &#147;means test&#148; for the Medicare program under which higher income seniors will pay higher premiums for Part B, ranging from 40-220%.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In order to get such drug coverage you must either leave the traditional Medicare program and join a Medicare Advantage plan (this replaces the failing Medicare+Choice program that replaced the failed Medicare HMO program) or buy a stand alone policy from a private &#147;Plan Sponsor.&#148; The private &#147;Plan Sponsor&#148; is either an insurance company licensed in the state or a company that meets the solvency standards established by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).

This new $6.8 billion tax break has nothing to do with prescriptions &#150; it allows wealthy Americans to shelter income in high-deductible health savings accounts that most Americans can&#146;t afford.  Plus this tax break is only for Americans under 65 years old &#150; eliminating the overwhelming majority of Medicare beneficiaries.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In HSAs Won't Cure Medicare's Ills Urban Institute health economists Leonard E. Burman and Linda J. Blumberg write: &#147;This proposed set-up would primarily benefit those with high incomes for at least two reasons. First, the tax deduction is worth most to them. A $4,500 HSA contribution, the maximum permitted in the House legislation, would generate a tax deduction worth $1,575 per year to a household in the top income tax bracket. The value of the tax benefit would be less than half as much for a moderate-income family&#151;much less if it could not afford to contribute much to the account.  </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Second, high-income people can afford the risk of a high deductible. $2,000 in unreimbursed medical costs is a huge burden for someone earning $30,000 per year, but chump change for someone earning $300,000. Employers may kick in part of the deductible out of their premium savings, but those savings are expected to be dwarfed by the deductible.
