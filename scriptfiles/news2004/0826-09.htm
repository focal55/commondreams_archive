<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NEW YORK - August 26 - On August 29, as the right to assemble in New York's greatest park is being infringed by our government, Progressive Source Publishing will officially launch America 2014: An Orwellian Tale with a dramatic free speech action at Central Park's Bethesda Fountain.   </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The short guerilla theater action is scheduled to begin at 5:00 pm with author Jonathan Greenberg's reading of the satirically-revised &quot;Patriotic Citizen's Bill of Rights and Responsibilities,&quot; from his new novel. A group of free-speech activists will stand silently in a row during the reading with their mouths' duct-taped shut, wearing tee shirts that read, &quot;The Future You Fear: Bush2014.com.&quot;  They will give away 38 free copies of the book at the event, to signify the importance of free speech to the 38 signers of the United States Constitution.    In the book, which author Frank McCourt calls, &quot;a hell of a story, deftly-written, with a wacky, delicious sense of humor,&quot; the Constitution has become a casualty of the &quot;war on terror,&quot; and &quot;subversive&quot; speech is punishable by death.  </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHAT:  Guerrilla Theatre Action Decrying City's Suppression of Free Speech for RNC Protesters who will read from satirically-revised, &quot;Patriotic Citizens Bill of Rights&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHO:  Free Speech Activists</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHEN:  Sunday, August 29th, 4:00 p.m.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHERE:  Bethesda Fountain, Central Park</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">America 2014 is the first book of its kind in this election year culture war, a bare knuckles political satire that picks up where Fahrenheit 9-11 left off.  Set in the fourth term of the &quot;Blush&quot; Administration, protagonist Winston Smith is sentenced to execution in a nightmarish prison for defying the censor in the renamed &quot;God's United States.&quot; More information about the book, including the full text of the satirically-revised Bill of Rights, is available at <a href="http://www.progressivesource.com/Page.html" target="_new">America2014.com</a>.  </font></p><p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">###</font></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
