<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - April 30 - Congressman Bernie Sanders (I-VT), sent a letter today to the CEO of Sinclair Media calling on them to reverse their decision to pre-empt &quot;Nightline's&quot; tribute to America's fallen soldiers.  The &#147;Nightline&#148; program in question will feature Mr. Koppel reading aloud the names of the US servicemen and women who have given their lives in Iraq. </FONT></p><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Sanders wrote, &#147;Your company&#146;s shameful and cynical statements disrespect both the victims of terrorism and the brave Americans who have made the ultimate sacrifice in the Persian Gulf.  It is an outrage to suggest that giving recognition to the fallen in Iraq is an attempt to sabotage their mission.  These American heroes deserve to be heralded, not hidden in the closet. The Nightline show in question will allow all Americans to personalize the service and sacrifice of the pride of the nation.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;Your company&#146;s censorship sets a dangerous precedent that is contrary to the First Amendment and America&#146;s long tradition of access to information.  This is an issue that some of my colleagues and I will be addressing with the FCC. Frankly, to censor information you disagree with has very little to do with freedom and what makes this country great. It sounds more like totalitarianism.&#148;</FONT></P><P> </P><P><B><I><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Below is the text of the letter. </FONT></I></B></P><P> </P><P> </P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">April 29, 2004</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">David D.

The &#147;Nightline&#148; program in question will feature Mr. Koppel reading aloud the names of the US servicemen and women who have given their lives in Iraq.  Sinclair has denounced this public memorial to the fallen as an effort to derail the war effort.  Going further, Sinclair contends that ABC News highlights the fallen in Iraq as a greater tragedy than those killed on September 11, 2001.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Your company&#146;s shameful and cynical statements disrespect both the victims of terrorism and the brave Americans who have made the ultimate sacrifice in the Persian Gulf.  It is an outrage to suggest that giving recognition to the fallen in Iraq is an attempt to sabotage their mission.  These American heroes deserve to be heralded, not hidden in the closet.  The Nightline show in question will allow all Americans to personalize the service and sacrifice of the pride of the nation. Every American, regardless of their position on the war, grieves for the families of the soldiers who have died in this war. </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In fact, it is your company&#146;s position that is motivated by crass politics.  The decision is of particular interest considering Sinclair executives are major financial backers of President Bush's political campaigns. According to the non-partisan Center for Responsive Politics, Sinclair executives have donated more than $16,000 in hard money and more than $120,000 in soft money to President Bush and his allies since 2000. </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Furthermore, the decision is especially troubling given the obligation that you as a holder of a license to use the public airwaves have to disseminate programming without politically-motivated censorship.  Because of your unilateral decision, viewers in St. Louis, Missouri; Columbus, Ohio; Greensboro, North Carolina; Charleston, West Virginia; Pensacola, Florida; Springfield, Massachusetts; Tallahassee, Florida; and Asheville, North Carolina will be denied the opportunity to see the Nightline program.  </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Your company&#146;s censorship sets a dangerous precedent that is contrary to the First Amendment and America&#146;s long tradition of access to information.

It sounds more like totalitarianism. </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">I urge the Sinclair Broadcasting Group to rethink this decision. Restore the public&#146;s faith in your stewardship of our airwaves.  Viewers who do not wish to view the Nightline program are fully competent to turn the channel.  They don&#146;t need corporate executives far from their local communities censoring the news in a way that many of us view as an insult to America&#146;s armed forces.</FONT></P><P> </P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
