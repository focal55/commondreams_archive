<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - April 13 - The Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR) is releasing a series of data briefs as the American Public Health Association's National Public Health Week wraps up.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Among the key findings in these briefs:</FONT></P><UL><LI><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Health insurance coverage has fallen from the economic peak in 1999 through the recovery in 2002, with nearly 70 million Americans lacking coverage during all of 2002. </FONT></LI><LI><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Dependents (both children and adults) and Latinos are the groups most likely to lack coverage. Legislative solutions must focus on increasing access to health insurance as well as ensuring equity across age, race, and employment status.</FONT></LI><LI><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> While most Americans are covered either through their employer or the employer of a family member, nearly 40 percent of the population goes without employer provided coverage for at least part of the year. </FONT></LI><LI><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Coverage of dependents had fallen during the nineties, but the decline has been much sharper since the onset of the economic contraction, with children being hit hardest. Increasingly, families are turning to Medicaid to cover the children of low-wage workers. </FONT></LI><LI><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> Low-wage workers are about half as likely as high-wage workers to have employer-provided health insurance from either their own employer or a family member&#146;s. Less than half (47.3 percent) of low-wage workers had any employer-provided health insurance during all of 2002.</FONT></LI><LI><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> The expansion of Medicaid through SCHIP was insufficient to overcome the loss of employer-provided health insurance and health insurance coverage fell among children over the economic contraction. However, more children of the working poor do have Medicaid now than a decade ago.</FONT></LI><LI><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> Young adults (age 18 to 25) are less likely than other adults to have health insurance coverage. This group is least likely to have employer-provided coverage and coverage as a dependent has fallen sharply over the economic contraction. </FONT></LI></UL><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">This in-depth analysis of access to health insurance by Heather Boushey, Joseph Wright, and Marya Murray Diaz, has found that lack of coverage is due to a number of factors, the most important being cutbacks in employer-provided health insurance. This has resulted in unequal access to health insurance. Policy responses to declining coverage have so far been inadequate.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><i>The full set of briefs are available at: <A HREF="http://www.cepr.net/health_insurance/hi_brief.htm" TARGET="_new">http://www.cepr.net/health_insurance/hi_brief.htm</A></i></FONT></P><P><i><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The data used in this analysis is from CEPR&#146;s analysis of the Survey of Income and Program Participation. CEPR creates user-friendly Data Sets from this survey and makes the data and programs available to other researchers via our website (<A HREF="http://www.cepr.net" TARGET="_new">www.cepr.net</A>). This project was funded by a generous grant from the Rockefeller Foundation.</FONT></i></P>
