<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">NEW YORK - January 29 - NPR ombudsman Jeffrey Dvorkin responded (1/28/04) to complaints about a Morning Edition interview with Vice President Richard Cheney, including many emails that were sent in response to a FAIR Action Alert (1/23/04).</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In his response, Dvorkin wrote that &quot;FAIR's suggestion that Morning Edition devote some time to further investigation of Cheney's statements from that interview would clearly be a service to the listeners and a good follow-up to this interview.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Responding to some letter-writers who he said wanted interviewer Juan Williams to have taken an &quot;argumentative tone&quot; with Cheney, Dvorkin said that he &quot;thought that the tone was right overall and that Williams was asking tough questions.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Dvorkin did not address the central point of FAIR's Action Alert, which was that Williams failed to question Cheney's bizarre claim that the military trailers found in Iraq were &quot;conclusive evidence&quot; that Iraq had an ongoing biological weapons program.  After initially being described as mobile labs, the trailers were later identified as a system for producing hydrogen for artillery balloons that had been sold to Iraq by the British (London Observer, 6/15/03).</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">After saying that the BBC's &quot;in-your-face&quot; style of journalism was not appropriate for NPR, Dvorkin did say, &quot;That doesn't mean that NPR should let a guest get away with stating something clearly outrageous or untrue.&quot; That was precisely why FAIR was disappointed with the Cheney interview, and why we put out an Action Alert to encourage NPR to challenge such statements in the future.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">You can see the ombudsman's report at <A HREF="http://www.npr.org/yourturn/ombudsman/2004/040128.html" TARGET="_new">http://www.npr.org/yourturn/ombudsman/2004/040128.html</A></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">You can see FAIR's original Action Alert at <A HREF="http://www.fair.org/activism/npr-cheney.html" TARGET="_new">http://www.fair.org/activism/npr-cheney.html</A></FONT></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
