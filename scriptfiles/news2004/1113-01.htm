<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NORTH ATLANTIC -- November 13 -- Greenpeace activists from the MV Esperanza were today thrown overboard by an EU fishing vessel setting its destructive bottom trawling nets in the high seas.</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since the early hours of this morning twelve activists have been occupying the trawler, stopping her from setting her nets. Within the last hour the trawler crew used fire hoses in an attempt to get them off. Despite several warning to respect the lives of the activists, three people were forced into the sea with the nets.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The activists had witnessed the destruction of deep sea life when the Lithuanian flagged ?Anuva? hauled her nets yesterday, bringing up a metre long piece of ancient coral, as well as numerous other deep sea species</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Meanwhile at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, Greenpeace is calling for the UN to impose an immediate moratorium on all high seas bottom-trawling on the high seas. A resolution on the issue is expected on Tuesday 16th November.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Just this week the North Atlantic Fisheries Council approved the protection of five areas. However this doesn't go far enough. As more than 1000 scientists have already said, only a total time out will do,&quot; said Greenpeace Campaigner Dima Litvinov.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As well as the action at sea and political work within the United Nations, Greenpeace is also trying to contact the owner of the ship in Vigo, Spain, to urge him to recall his ship and stop bottom trawling.<br></font> </p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
