<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - May 10 - The Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR) has released a series of data briefs looking at access to health insurance in the US as Cover the Uninsured Week gets under way this week.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Health insurance coverage has fallen from the economic peak in 1999 through the recovery in 2002, with nearly 70 million Americans lacking coverage at some point in 2002. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Dependents (both children and adults) living with someone with employer-provided health insurance are now less likely to be on that employer plan than they were a few years ago. Children, in particular are increasingly not on an employer-based plan -- even if their parents remain on such a plan. Many children of workers on employer-based health plans have switched to Medicaid or no coverage at all.</FONT></P><UL><LI><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The expansion of Medicaid through SCHIP was insufficient to overcome the loss of employer-provided health insurance and health insurance coverage fell among children over the economic contraction. However, more children of the working poor do have Medicaid now than a decade ago.</FONT></LI><LI><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">While most Americans are covered either through their employer or the employer of a family member, nearly 40 percent of the population goes without employer provided coverage for at least part of the year. </FONT></LI><LI><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Low-wage workers are about half as likely as high-wage workers to have employer-provided health insurance from either their own employer or a family member&#146;s. Less than half (47.3 percent) of low-wage workers had any employer-provided health insurance during all of 2002.</FONT></LI><LI><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Latinos are more likely than other racial/ethnic groups to lack coverage. Legislative solutions must focus on increasing access to health insurance as well as ensuring equity across age, race, and employment status.</FONT></LI><LI><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Young adults (age 18 to 25) are less likely than other adults to have health insurance coverage. This group is least likely to have employer-provided coverage and coverage as a dependent has fallen sharply over the economic contraction. </FONT></LI></UL><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">This in-depth analysis of access to health insurance by Heather Boushey, Joseph Wright, and Marya Murray Diaz, has found that lack of coverage is due to a number of factors, the most important being cutbacks in employer-provided health insurance. This has resulted in unequal access to health insurance. Policy responses to declining coverage have so far been inadequate.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The full set of briefs are available at: <A HREF="http://www.cepr.net/health_insurance/hi_brief.htm" TARGET="_new">http://www.cepr.net/health_insurance/hi_brief.htm</A></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The data used in this analysis is from CEPR&#146;s analysis of the Survey of Income and Program Participation. CEPR creates user-friendly Data Sets from this survey and makes the data and programs available to other researchers via our website (<A HREF="http://www.cepr.net" TARGET="_new">www.cepr.net</A>).</FONT></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
