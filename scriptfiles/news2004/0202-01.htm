<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - February 2 - Two leading environmental groups today welcomed the decision of the Belgian Government to reject an application to grow genetically modified (GM) oilseed rape.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The rejection of the European Union (EU)-wide application from Bayer CropScience was announced today and follows research showing that the GM oilseed rape would damage the environment.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Belgian experts concluded that growing this GM oilseed rape would have negative impacts on biodiversity that could not be brought under control. They also believe that guidelines for farmers to prevent contamination of non-GM crops are unworkable and difficult to monitor.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The expert advice followed the largest GM field scale trials to date in the UK, which concluded that growing GM oilseed rape would be worse for wildlife than growing the conventional crop (1). Other UK studies have also shown that insects can carry the pollen of oilseed rape over many kilometres (2). Such research underlines how immensely difficult, if not impossible, it would be to contain the cultivation of GM oilseed rape and protect non-genetically engineered farming.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">German-based Bayer CropScience had applied through Belgium for a Europe-wide licence to grow the GM oilseed rape. The Belgian Government could only have forwarded it to other member states for a joint decision if it had met European laws to protect the environment. Two other applications for a similar crop, also by Bayer, are being processed by Germany.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Karen Simal, GM campaigner for Greenpeace Belgium said:  &quot;This is a slap in the face of the biotech industry and a victory for the environment. The Belgian Government has eventually acknowledged that growing GM oilseed rape is harmful to the environment. GM crops like this should never be grown.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">While welcoming the Belgian government's refusal to allow cultivation, Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth deplore the fact that, at the same time, the Belgian Government approved the crop for import and processing in Europe. The import part of the application will now be forwarded to other EU member states.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Adrian Bebb, GM campaigner for Friends of the Earth Europe said: &quot;GM oilseed rape will harm the environment and contaminate non-GM agriculture, whether it is grown in the EU or elsewhere in the world. It is inconsistent to ban the cultivation yet allow it for import. Protecting the environment by rejecting GM crops should be the first responsibility of every Government.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Karen Simal continued: &quot;Consumers are to some extent protected from GMOs as many food manufacturers refuse to allow GMOs in their products, but allowing such ingredients on the market places an extra burden on them. Although most consumers have made it clear they don't want GMOs in their food, they will need to keep on actively rejecting such products.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Notes to Editors</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">A briefing on the oilseed rape and a letter sent to the Belgium Public Health and Environment Ministers are available from Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth and  can be found at  <A HREF="http://www.foeeurope.org/GMOs/Index.htm" TARGET="_new">www.foeeurope.org/GMOs/Index.htm</A> and at  <A HREF="http://www.greenpeace.be" TARGET="_new">www.greenpeace.be</A></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">(1)   The largest trials to date on the oilseed were recently conducted in the UK and concluded that growing GM oilseed rape would be worse for the environment. Independent scientists found that bees and butterflies were less abundant in the GM crops than in non-GM crops due to a lack of weeds and wild plants. There were also substantially less weed seeds present in the GM crops. Weed seeds are  an important source of food for small mammals and birds, particularly during winter. <A HREF="http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/gm/fse/index.htm" TARGET="_new">http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/gm/fse/index.htm</A></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">(2)   Ramsay, G., Thompson, C &amp; Squire, G (2003).
