<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Rally Outside World Bank/IMF To Demand Full Debt Cancellation for Impoverished Nations on Institutions' 60th Birthday, Deliver Thousands of Birthday Cards</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><b>WHAT:</b>		Unhappy Birthday party/rally to demand full debt cancellation for impoverished nations. The event will have a birthday party theme, and will include a giant birthday card, cake, and party games and favors. Organizers will deliver thousands of birthday cards signed by people across the country calling for full debt cancellation to a representative of the World Bank, who will receive the cards at 1:30 pm.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><b>WHEN:</b>       Wednesday, April 21, 2004, 12 Noon - 2:30 pm</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><b>WHERE:</b>	Rally/Unhappy Birthday party, at Murrow park across from World Bank, 18th and Pennsylvania Streets, NW. Following the rally at 2 pm, there will be a march by some participants to US Treasury building, 15th and New York Avenue, NW.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><b>WHO:</b>		Speakers include:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Students, people of faith, and community organizers from DC and across the country will participate in an &quot;Unhappy Birthday&quot; party for the IMF/World Bank on April 21st. The IMF and World Bank will celebrate 60 years of existence in 2004. On the occasion of their 60th birthday, the coalition organizing the event will make it clear that: &quot;It's No Time for A Party! It's Time to Drop the Debt!&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The unhappy birthday party and rally will issue a clear call for 100% debt cancellation for impoverished nations without harmful conditions. After 8 years of its limited and conditional debt relief program, the Heavily Indebted Poor County (HIPC) Initiative, coalition members argue, the IMF/World Bank have failed to provide an effective end to the debt crisis facing countries of the Global South.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The spread of the AIDS virus won't stop and wait for the IMF and World Bank to cancel the debt,&quot; said Jubilee USA Network National Coordinator Marie Clarke. &quot;While the IMF/World Bank fiddle around with HIPC, the AIDS pandemic claims 8,000 lives each day.  African nations pay $15 billion each year to the IMF/World Bank and wealthy creditors instead of spending that money to fight AIDS. This tragedy cannot be allowed to continue.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Several accounting firms and a recent report contracted by Jubilee Ireland have shown that the World Bank and IMF can afford to write off the debts of impoverished nations using their own resources and reserve accounts without threatening their credit rating.</FONT></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
