<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - February 19 - The Green Party of Virginia is sponsoring an Activist Networking Dinner, which will be held on Saturday, March 6th, from 4 to 10 PM at the Comfort Inn &amp; Conference Center, 3200 W. Broad Street, Richmond.  The event includes workshops, tabling and guest speakers.  The ACLU, Food Not Bombs, Witness For Peace, Richmond Peace Education Center, National Youth Voting Rights, Friends of Animals, Oxfam America, and more will offer workshops.  Additionally, representatives from these organizations will talk to the group during dinner and have information tables. </FONT></p><P> </P><P> <FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;This is the second of a series of events where we hope to get different activist groups to first know each other, and then to work together, helping each other on their projects&#148; said state party Chairwoman Susan Dridi.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Besides activist networking and workshops, Green Presidential Nominee Candidates Kent Mesplay, Lorna Salzman David Cobb, will treat attendees to a forum.  Each will address the group, outlining their vision for the country and why they deserve the nomination.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;Having a viable third-party in this country will give the citizens a real voice&#148; said state party chairman James Polk.  &#147;The Democratic and Republican parties are beholden unto the corporations and large special interest donors.&#148; &#147;Green Party candidates accept NO corporate or PAC money, making them dependent on the voters and really caring about what they have to say.&#148;</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Additionally, another highlight of the event will be a Keynote Address by Green Politician and social activist Matt Gonzalez.  Matt recently only narrowly lost a bid for Mayor of San Francisco, capturing 47% of the vote, while being outspent over 10-1.  The evening will be further enhanced by the appearance of Ralph Nader, who ran for President of the United States in 2000, with the Green Party.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Journalists are encouraged to cover the event.
