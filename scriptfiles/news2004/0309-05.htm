<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - March 9 - A delegation from six African elephant range states have agreed to support Kenya, which itself is holding 30 tons of impounded ivory, in its position to oppose any trade in ivory.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The decision was passed during a consultative meeting in Nairobi where Uganda, Ethiopia, Mali, Cameroon, Tunisia and Ghana gave unanimous support to Kenya's position. The Kenyan Government hosted the meeting to discuss pertinent issues related to the conservation of the African elephant -- including the conditions that need to be met before a proposed ivory stockpile sale by three Southern African countries takes place.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Conservationists, including IFAW (the International Fund for Animal Welfare - www.ifaw.org), have lauded the agreement by the seven states, which was reached before the next Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). From March 15- 19 the CITES Standing Committee will meet in Geneva to discuss one-time ivory stockpile sales and to decide whether the conditions to allow such a sale have been met. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In November 2003, at the CITES Conference of the Parties in Santiago, Chile, provisional approval was given to South Africa, Namibia and Botswana to sell a combined total of 60 tons of stockpiled elephant ivory once certain conditions had been met. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Currently, buying and selling ivory is illegal, although a healthy black market for ivory still exists. Demand for ivory in Japan and China has fueled elephant poaching in Asia and Africa, pushing all species of elephant to the brink of extinction.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">According to CITES, the conditions that must precede a one-off sale include: verification that only registered government stocks originating from exporting countries should be sold, that any ivory seized or of unknown origin should not be traded and that the proceeds of the 60 tons of ivory should be used exclusively for elephant conservation, community conservation and development programs within or adjacent to the African elephant range. The Kenyan Government has expressed concern that several of the conditions have not been met. One key condition is a system to monitor illegal killing of elephants that has not been achieved. Based on these failings Kenya and the other 6 African states oppose any sale.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;We are greatly encouraged by the seven countries' decision to oppose any trade in ivory,&quot; said James Isiche, IFAW Regional Director for East Africa. &quot;It is almost impossible to ensure that legal ivory trade will not be corrupted with illegal ivory. Furthermore, the laxity in the domestic law enforcement mechanism especially in a country like Japan enables the traders to transact their business almost unhindered,&quot; added Isiche.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Without defining stringent conditions for trade and verifying that these conditions are met by both the export and import countries, no ivory trade should be allowed to proceed,&quot; said Grace Gabriel, IFAW's Program Manager on Wildlife Trade/Habitat Protection.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The African elephant has had a distressing history, plummeting from 1.3 million in the early 1970's to an estimated 600,000 in 1989 due to severe poaching. Current statistics indicate that African elephants number about 400,000 and Asian elephants number 35,000 to 50,000.</FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
