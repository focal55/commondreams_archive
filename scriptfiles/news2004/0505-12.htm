<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - May 5 - A Texas high school&#146;s policy prohibiting same-sex prom dates is raising eyebrows around the nation.   People For the American Way Foundation (PFAWF), a national civil liberties group with more than 600,000 members and supporters, as well as an office in Houston, Texas,  is representing the mother of a Lago Vista High School junior who has been forbidden under this policy from buying tickets to bring her best friend, a female student at another high school, to the prom.  </FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> The school&#146;s policy prohibiting a female student from bringing another female student to the prom constitutes unlawful sex discrimination under Title IX as well as under the 14th Amendment and while the student is not gay, she and her mother are concerned that this policy also unfairly and illegally discriminates against gay students.</FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> On behalf of this student and her mother, PFAWF has written a letter to the school&#146;s principal asking her to rescind the discriminatory policy by the end of the week, and avoid legal action. </FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> The letter is available online at: <A HREF="http://www.pfaw.org/pfaw/dfiles/file_337.pdf" TARGET="_new">http://www.pfaw.org/pfaw/dfiles/file_337.pdf</A></FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> Judith E. Schaeffer, Deputy Legal Director of People For the American Way Foundation, is available for media interviews on this issue.  Schaeffer specializes in First Amendment and civil rights matters, including litigation involving religious freedom, church-state separation, school censorship, and discrimination.</FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> Schaeffer has appeared on numerous television and radio programs to discuss these issues, including NBC&#146;s &#147;The Today Show&#148; and CBS&#146;s &#147;This Morning.&#148;  Her comments have appeared in The Washington Post and many other newspapers around the country.</FONT></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
