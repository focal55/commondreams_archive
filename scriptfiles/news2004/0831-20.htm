<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NEW YORK - August 31 - <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">War profiteer Halliburton is holding a Celebrity Breakfast for Texas Republican Party delegates at the Hilton Hotel on Tuesday morning; Activists will protest outside the hotel, wearing pig snouts and rolling around in money. </font>
<p>WHEN: Tuesday, August 31, 8:30 A.M.</p>
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHERE: The Hilton Hotel.  1335 Ave. of the Americas. New York, NY.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">VISUALS:  Political theater featuring dozens of pig-snouted Hallibacon executives rolling around in billions of dollars in corporate welfare, squealing and thanking the Texas delegates for the wonderful job they are doing for Hallibacon (which should be much funnier than Scott Baio&#146;s performance for the Texas delegates inside the breakfast).  Also, scores of anti-war activists, global justice activists and peeved-off tax-payers will be on hand, demanding accountability and justice from Halliburton for
their corporate corruption, war profiteering and bilking of the American taxpayers.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHAT: On Tuesday, August 31st at 8:30 am, anti-war profiteer and corporate accountability activists from New York, California and Texas will converge in front of the Hilton to protest Halliburton&#146;s Celebrity Breakfast for the Texas GOP delegation. Co-sponsors of the protest include CODEPINK, Houston Global Awareness, The Reagan Home of the Criminally Insane and the Tejas Bloc.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Why protest Halliburton? Halliburton and its subsidiary KBR, formerly known as Kellogg, Brown and Root, have played integral roles in the destruction, occupation and reconstruction of Vietnam, Panama, Bosnia,
Kosovo and, most recently, Iraq.  Their most recent drive for profits has led to the death of innocent Iraqis, US soldiers and their own employees. Furthermore, Halliburton has also benefited from relationships with governmental officials, recently and most notably Vice-President Dick Cheney.  Cheney from 1995 to 2000 served as CEO of Halliburton and still receives $178,000 annually in salary from them.  In return, Halliburton has gotten $9 billion in no-bid contracts from the Bush-Cheney regime and is eventually estimated to be worth about $18 billion for this oil and gas service company.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Halliburton&#146;s provision of services has also been shoddy at best and criminally fraudulent at worst.  Every week new stories break in the news media detailing overcharges of $60 million for fuel delivery, $27.5 million for food services never provided to American troops, KBR trucks crisscrossing Iraq for hundreds of miles carrying empty loads, corporate executives enjoying lavish stays at 5 star Kuwaiti hotels on the American taxpayers tab and dodging taxes in offshore tax shelters paying only a
scant $15 million in taxes a year.  In January, the company admitted that two employees involved in Iraq work took kickbacks worth $6.3 million from Kuwaiti contractors.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Antiwar and global justice activists consider Halliburton the poster child for corporate corruption and war profiteering: corporate influence corrupting the political system, utilizing cost-plus contracts to defraud American taxpayers while providing shoddy services, exploiting a bloody devastating conflict in Iraq and recklessly exposing their employees to hazardous conditions to make large profits.</font></p>
