The first term of President George W. Bush  begins its final year, and an employee evaluation is in order. The President's employers, the citizens of the U.S., are going to do a close analysis on the performance of their most prominent employee.</FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> 	Americans for Democratic Action (ADA), the nation's oldest liberal advocacy organization, is urging its members and any others who are  dissatisfied to send President Bush a pink slip informing him that his employment with the U.S. government is terminated as of election day November 2, 2004.</FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> 	Through letters and on the website www.adaction.org, participants send a message to George Bush outlining his poor record as President  and their desire to elect someone else to fill his position. The  letter or email is then sent to the White House and participants are encouraged to organize for the upcoming election.</FONT></p><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
