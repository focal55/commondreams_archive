<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - January 15 - On Monday January 26th the federal trial for the 28 human rights activists from across the United States, facing federal charges for civil disobedience, begins in Columbus, Georgia.  The 28 were among 10,000 who gathered in November 2003 to call for a closure of the notorious School of the Americas, renamed the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation. In an act of nonviolent civil disobedience, the defendants peacefully crossed onto Fort Benning property, site of the school, to commemorate the victims of SOA violence in Latin America. They are charged with trespass and face up to six months in federal prison and $5,000 in fines.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Trial judge G. Mallon Faircloth is known for giving the maximum of six months to opponents of the SOA/WHISC. Nearly 170 people have served a total of over 75 years in prison for engaging in nonviolent resistance in a broad-based campaign to close the school.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Those who speak out for justice are facing prison time while SOA-trained torturers and assassins are operating with impunity,&quot; said SOA Watch founder Fr. Roy Bourgeois.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The SOA/WHISC is a combat training school for Latin American soldiers. Its graduates are consistently involved in human rights atrocities and coups, including the El Mozote Massacre of over 900 civilians and the failed coup in 2002 in Venezuela. In 1996 the Pentagon was forced to release manuals used at the school that advocated torture, extortion and execution. In a statement about their action of conscience, several defendants state that &quot;[Latin American military forces] do not exist primarily to defend one nation against another, but rather to protect an unjust and inequitable distribution of resources within each country against movements of social and political change.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The evil of the SOA/WHISC has been well documented and is still being committed in Central and South America,&quot; stated defendant David Corcoran, 69, a hospital chaplain from Des Plaines, Illinois. &quot;My action [crossing the property line at Fort Benning] is to resist that evil with my whole being. It is a statement of 'no, not in my name,' which speaks much louder and stronger than any words I can say.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">SOA Watch, founded in 1990, is a national, grassroots, faith and conscience- based group committed to nonviolence.
