<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">OAKLAND, CA - April 14 - Jewish Voice for Peace, the largest Jewish peace group of its kind in the United States, harshly criticized President George W. Bush for his promises to Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon at a White House press conference today. </FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In response to Sharon's commitment to a withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, Bush stated that a final status settlement of the conflict would not include a return to the borders that existed before the 1967 war; that Israel could go ahead with its planned route for a &quot;separation wall&quot;; and that a permanent status solution for Palestinian refugees would only include a return to a Palestinian state, not to Israel. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;What the President has done today is short-circuit negotiations and to pre-determine final status outcomes on very sensitive issues,&quot; said Mitchell Plitnick, co-director of Jewish Voice for Peace. &quot;By giving Israel these assurances on borders and refugees, he has left the Palestinians no room to negotiate these issues, which are so central to Palestinian aspirations. The President has changed the framework for negotiations, and has done so to reward Israel for a Gaza pullout that is both mandated by international law and in the best interests of Israel. And his commitment to this ill-conceived course will bind America for years to come.&quot; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Negotiations for the Gaza withdrawal and compensation for it have been conducted between the United States and Israel only, with no input at all from the Palestinians. In response to Bush's words at the press conference, Palestinian Prime Minister Ahmed Qureia said: &quot;He is the first president who has legitimized the settlements in the Palestinian territories when he said that there will be no return to the borders of 1967. We as Palestinians reject that, we cannot accept that, we reject it and we refuse it.&quot; </FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
