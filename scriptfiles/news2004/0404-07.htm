<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - April 2 - Following is a statement from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities:</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Labor Department announced today that the nation added 308,000 payroll jobs in March. The report marks the first month of substantial job growth in a previously weak labor market. On closer inspection, however, the good news is much more mixed than it may first appear.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">-- Americans are working less, not more, due to shorter average work weeks. The rise in the number of payroll jobs was more than canceled out by a decline in the number of hours worked in the average payroll job (from 33.8 to 33.7 hours per week). The total number of hours worked by all Americans in payroll jobs declined in March, the Labor Department said. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">-- The gain of 308,000 payroll jobs, while welcome, was canceled out by equally large losses in self-employment. Although the payroll figures leave out the self-employed, other data in the Labor Department report show that the number of self- employed Americans dropped by 304,000 in March. (Those figures, from a survey of households, show that the overall number of employed Americans was essentially unchanged in March. Like the payroll data, the household survey found that employment other than self-employment rose by about 300,000.) The shift from self-employment to payroll jobs may, in most cases, represent an advance toward more desirable employment, but it is not the pure employment gain it may initially seem. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">-- The percentage of Americans at work is the lowest for any March in ten years. Over the past 12 months, gains in employment have not been sufficient to keep pace with normal population growth. The percentage of adults working in March -- 61.9 percent -- is the lowest for any March since 1994. (This figure is not seasonally adjusted.) </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">-- Long-term unemployment also rose in March. The Labor Department data show that the number of long-term unemployed - those who have been out of work for more than 26 weeks and are still looking for a job -- rose by 117,000 in March. The data also show that the proportion of the unemployed who are long-term unemployed individuals climbed from 22.9 percent in February to 23.9 percent in March. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">(Unless otherwise noted, figures are seasonally adjusted.) </FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
