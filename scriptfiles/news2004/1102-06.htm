<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- November 2 -- Common Cause, the national non-partisan advocacy organization, is hearing from thousands of people across the country who thought they had registered to vote, but showed up at the polls only to find their names not included on voting lists. Thousands of people who requested but never received absentee ballots are trying to vote in person, and being challenged or told to vote by provisional ballot. </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nationwide, there appear to be activities that seem to be designed to suppress people&#146;s ability to vote, from election judges randomly asking voters for identification, to students at a historically black college being denied the right to vote. s. More than 131,000 calls have come in to a voter alert line, 1-866-MYVOTE1, which Common Cause is operating with a consortium of groups. NBC is promoting the alert line.  </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During media briefings today, Chellie Pingree, President of Common Cause, will answer questions about voting problems throughout the country, including trouble areas in: Ohio; Wayne Co., MI; Broward Co., Dade Co. &amp; Orange Co., FL; South Carolina; Allegany, PA; Dallas, TX.  Spencer Overton, professor at The George Washington University Law School, will also join the briefings to answer questions about voting law and procedure. </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Over the past 10 days, thousands of voters have called to complain about not receiving registration cards and absentee ballots, of being unable to find their polling place, and of worrying that electronic voting machines may not record their vote accurately. Thousands have called in to report long lines, and many others are concerned about intimidation or fear narrow interpretations of elections procedures will cost them the right to vote today,&#148; said Chellie Pingree of Common Cause. </font></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ELECTION DAY MEDIA BRIEFINGS</font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br> </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">            What:             Election Day Media Briefings to inform reporters about information coming in from voters on the voter alert line nationally and on-the-ground polling station volunteers in states.
