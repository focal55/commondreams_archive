<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">NEW YORK - July 13 - Though Fox News Channel wraps itself in slogans of journalistic evenhandedness, FAIR's latest study of Fox's Special Report with Brit Hume finds the network's flagship news show still listing sharply right. In one-on-one interviews, conservatives accounted for 72 percent of ideological guests, and Republicans outnumbered Democrats five to one. And, according to the study, Special Report rarely features women or non-white guests in these prominent newsmaker interview spots: 83 percent of guests were white males.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The study, featured in the August issue of Extra!, was commissioned by filmmaker Robert Greenwald for the film Outfoxed: Rupert Murdoch's War on Journalism. The film will screen across the country on Sunday, July 18 at house parties organized by MoveOn.org; you can find the screening nearest you at <A HREF="http://action.moveon.org/outfoxed/" TARGET="_new">http://action.moveon.org/outfoxed</A>/.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">FAIR's current study looked at 25 weeks of Special Report's one-on-one interview segments including 101 guests. Results were compared to those from 2001 and 2002 FAIR studies of Special Report.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">*  Conservatives outnumbered progressives by more than five to one. Fifty seven percent of Special Report's guests were ideological conservatives; 12 percent were centrists, and 11 percent were progressives (while 20 percent were non-ideological). Among ideological guests, conservatives accounted for 72 percent. This marks an increase in left-of-center guests since 2002, when a mere three percent were left of center-but also an increase in conservatives, up from 48 percent.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">*  Republicans outnumbered Democrats by five to one (35 to 7). Furthermore, of the handful of Democrats that did appear, the majority were centrist or conservative. Only one of the 35 Republicans, on the other hand, was centrist, and none were progressive. The five-to-one imbalance is a marked regression from the 2002 study, when Republicans outnumbered Democrats by only three to two.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">*  Women and people of color continue to be scarce. Only 7 percent of guests were women, and only 11 percent were people of color. Only one woman of color was featured in a one-on-one interview: National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice. And the female and non-white guests were remarkably conservative; no progressive women and only one progressive person of color appeared.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">If Fox is the &quot;fair &amp; balanced&quot; network it claims to be, then the guest list of what Fox calls its &quot;signature news show&quot; ought to reflect a diverse spectrum of ideas and sources. In FAIR's second study of Special Report in 2002, the show had slightly moderated the imbalance with regard to Republican and conservative guests found in our 2001 study. But with current findings indicating that the show has tipped back toward increased imbalance, it becomes harder to defend Special Report from charges that it chooses its guests based on political sympathies, not news judgment.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Fox is depriving its viewers of real debate and some important and dissenting views,&quot; said FAIR's Steve Rendall, co-author of the study.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The complete report can be accessed online at: <A HREF="http://www.fair.org/extra/0407/special-report.html" TARGET="_new">http://www.fair.org/extra/0407/special-report.html</A>.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">For more information on Outfoxed, visit <A HREF="http://www.outfoxed.org" TARGET="_new">http://www.outfoxed.org</A>.</FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
