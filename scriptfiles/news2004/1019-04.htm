<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">    WASHINGTON  ,  DC    &#150; October, 18 -  The North American gray wolf population is growing, yet this growth will only continue if federal protections remain in place, Defenders of Wildlife cautioned during National Wolf Awareness Week.   </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;National Wolf Awareness week is the perfect opportunity to highlight the progress wolves are making,&#148; stated Nina Fascione, Vice President of Species Conservation at Defenders of Wildlife. &#147;And while the number of wolves has grown from just under one-thousand, when the species was listed on the Endangered Species Act, to over four-thousand today, wolves are still a threatened species.&#148;  <br>As one of the leading wolf conservation organizations, Defenders proactively engages in aggressive efforts to protect the species by using the following methods:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">    * Defenders helps pioneer the use of economic incentives to promote protection of the endangered species on private lands by managing The Bailey Wildlife Foundation Wolf Compensation Trust.  The fund pays livestock owners for losses due to wolf predation. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">    * Defenders implements proactive measures to prevent wolf-human conflict using The Bailey Wildlife Foundation Proactive Carnivore Conservation Fund.  Monies from the fund are used for practical projects that help reduce conflict. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">    * Defenders also works closely with law enforcement agencies to stop illegal killing of imperiled species like the wolf and has set up the Imperiled Predator Fund which is used to help authorities uncover information on illegal wolf hunting.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">    * And, when necessary, Defenders litigates against federal and state initiatives that jeopardize wolf recovery efforts. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Yet, despite the gains in wolf populations, the species faces many obstacles including a federal proposal to remove protections for it in the Eastern U.S. , an expansion of Alaska &#146;s aerial gunning program and an increase in illegal killings throughout the Southwest.  </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The threats facing wolves throughout our country can have repercussions if left unchecked,&#148; stated Fascione.   </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Ms. Fascione expanded on the following threats to the wolf: </b> </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">    * The federal government has proposed removing federal protections for wolves throughout the entire eastern United States and thus effectively ending the species recovery before it is complete.  </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">    * Alaska Board of Game members have proposed tripling the area covered by the aerial killing program in 2005 to a total of 50,000 square miles of land.  If not reversed, this decision is a death sentence for nearly 900 wolves on top of the 1500 taken annually by other means.  The loss of wolves will severely affect Alaska &#146;s ecological balance.  </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">    * Throughout the Southwest, wolves have been illegally killed as they begin a perilous path to recovery.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">    * Expanded development, road building and pollution continue to encroach on wolf habitat, thus threatening the species and further forcing wolves into human communities. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot;       &#147;During Wolf Awareness Week, I urge all Americans to take a second look at this valuable and often misunderstood creature.  Wolves have been an integral part of the North American ecosystem for hundreds of years and they remain so today,&#148; added Fascione.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
