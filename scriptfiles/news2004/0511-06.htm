<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - May 11 - The Sierra Club - the nation's oldest, largest and most influential environmental group - today endorsed Senator John Kerry for President of the United States, citing his outstanding leadership in safe-guarding America's air, water and public lands.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;John Kerry will provide the environmental leadership that has been sorely missing in the Bush White House,&quot; said Sierra Club President Larry Fahn. &quot;His commitment to environmental progress stands in stark contrast to the Bush administration's all-out assault on the environment and its record of putting polluting corporations before the American public's health and safety.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;John Kerry has spent his entire career promoting real solutions aimed at ensuring that America's air, water, and natural resources are protected for future generations.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Kerry has demonstrated environmental leadership throughout his career in public service, from helping organize Massachusetts' first Earth Day in 1970 to opposing the Bush administration's efforts to dismantle environmental gains made over the last century. Highlights of Kerry's environmental record include:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">   Advocated strict enforcement of the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act,   and opposed Bush administration efforts to weaken the laws in order to   let polluters put more dangerous toxics into our air and water;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">   Advocated restoration of the Superfund Act's &quot;polluter pays&quot; trust fund   to clean up hazardous waste sites that will be orphaned by the Bush   administration's refusal to make polluters responsible for cleaning up   their messes;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">   Led the charge against the Bush administration's attempts to allow oil   drilling in the pristine Arctic National Wildlife Refuge;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">   Championed an energy plan that increases fuel economy to reduce the   nation's dependence on oil and supports the development of clean,   energy-saving technologies and renewable energy to reduce our dependence   on other polluting sources of energy;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">   And, advocated for the United States to take the lead in international   efforts to cut global warming pollution, reverse ozone depletion,   protect tropical rain forests, preserve biological diversity and press   for sustainable development.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;John Kerry's record on the environment is impressive by any measure and reveals a sincere personal passion for the issue,&quot; Sierra Club Executive Director Carl Pope said. &quot;He understands that there is a better way than the Bush administration's alliance with corporate polluters. With Kerry as President, we could be sure that America's health and heritage are protected.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The endorsement was decided by volunteer members who serve on the Club's political committee and Board of Directors. Following the announcement, the Sierra Club will mobilize more than 700,000 members to talk to their friends and neighbors about supporting Kerry in November.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;One of our biggest challenges is to educate the American public about the Bush administration's dismal environmental record,&quot; Fahn said. &quot;Now, thousands of Sierra Club members in every state will be volunteering their efforts to tell voters about the clear choice in this election. They will be encouraging all Americans who care about the environment to vote for John Kerry in November.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">To learn more about why the Sierra Club endorsed John Kerry, please visit our website at: <A HREF="http://www.sierraclub.org/pressroom" TARGET="_new">http://www.sierraclub.org/pressroom</A></FONT></P><P></P><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
