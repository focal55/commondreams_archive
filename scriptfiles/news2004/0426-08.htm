<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - April 26 - In the May 3rd issue of Newsweek, an unofficial study by a defense consultant, now circulating through the army, shows that U.S. soldiers do not have military vehicles, equipment or armor needed for protection against Iraqi uprisings&#151; consequently that has meant <A HREF="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4825948/" TARGET="_NEW">25% more American casualties </A>in Iraq.</FONT></p><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The study cites that of the 190 killed by landmines, improvised explosive devices, or rocket-propelled grenade attacks, &quot;almost all those were killed while in unprotected vehicles, which means that perhaps one in four of those killed in combat in Iraq might be alive if they had had stronger armor around them.&quot; Additionally, &quot;thousands more who were unprotected have suffered grievous wounds, such as the loss of limbs.&quot; </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Bush, however, continues to withhold funding that military officials say is desperately needed to plug shortfalls in armor and protection equipment.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Instead of following through on his promise to give the military the urgently needed protection equipment, Bush has left major funding holes in the most basic areas. </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Military commanders just last week desperately begged Congress just last week to fill key shortfalls left by the President's budget. </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">They pointed out a $132 million shortfall for bolt-on vehicle armor, an $879 million in shortfall for combat helmets, and a $40 million shortfall for body armor. Meanwhile, according to the Chicago Tribune, the White House has &quot;dramatically reduced the number of Abrams tanks and Bradley Fighting Vehicles in Iraq,&quot; even as the fighting intensified, leaving troops to &quot;ride in lightly protected Humvees, trucks and troop carriers&quot; which are much more vulnerable to attack.</FONT></P><P> </P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">For full citations and links to the cited documents, visit: <A HREF="http://www.misleader.org/daily_mislead/Read.asp?fn=df04262004.html" TARGET="_NEW">www.misleader.org</A>. </FONT> </P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
