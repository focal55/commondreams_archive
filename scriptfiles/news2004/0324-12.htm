<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - March 24 - As former Presidential candidates and other Democrats rally for Sen. John Kerry at a Democratic National Committee-sponsored unity event this Thursday, the last remaining challenger, Congressman Dennis Kucinich, will continue to actively campaign.  </FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">He issued the following statement: &quot;I congratulate Sen. Kerry for his excellent showing in the primaries and caucuses. While the direction of the nomination seems certain, the direction of the Democratic Party remains to be determined.  I look forward to being part of that process.</FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">I will continue to call for unity in the Democratic Party around principles of peace, health care for all, and fair trade.  It is urgent that the Democratic debate continue and that every part of the Party is heard from, so that by the conclusion of the convention in July, unity will sweep across our Party in a powerful surge toward victory.</FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">I continue to be dedicated to the pimary-and-caucus process to demonstrate the possibilities of a new direction for the Democratic Party.  It is critical that the Democratic Party be able to attract and energize those who stand for peace, healthcare for all, and principles of social and economic justice in trade policies.  We need those votes to win in November.</FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">My campaign will continue to give voice to those principles and to those voters so that, come November, Democrats will be able to win. My campaign will continue to be the vehicle to bring people into the Democratic Party who might otherwise feel disenfranchised. That could well prove to be the decisive factor in victory.</FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">As a Democratic candidate, I acknowledge and congratulate the Party in its call for unity, just as the Party acknowledges my intention to continue campaigning in more than a dozen states and U.S. territories that have not yet voted.  </FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Everyone who has pursued or is pursing the nomination has already publicly stated our willingness to support the eventual nominee. I stand by that commitment and I also remain an active candidate.&quot; </FONT> </p><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
