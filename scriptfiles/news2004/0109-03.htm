<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - January 8 - With U.S. casualties in Iraq rapidly approaching 500, Democratic Presidential Candidate Dennis Kucinich today called for the U.S. to go to the United Nations with a proposal that would bring US troops home.  &quot;The question we must all ask ourselves,&quot; he said &quot;is how many lives is enough?&quot;</FONT></p><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">According to wire service reports, today a U.S. Black Hawk medivac helicopter crashed near Fallujah, killing all nine soldiers aboard, according to the U.S. military.  The casualties bring to 496 the number of US service men and service women who have been killed in Iraq.  Yesterday, a U.S. soldier was killed and 34 wounded in a mortar attack on a U.S. military base west of Baghdad.  Earlier that day, U.S. troops said they destroyed a home in Fallujah, west of Baghdad.  Neighbors said a husband and wife were killed and their five children orphaned.  The cause of the crash has not been reported, but other U.S. helicopters have been shot down in that area.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Kucinich released this statement:</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;We have now lost nearly 500 U.S. soldiers in Iraq, with many times that number of Iraqi civilians killed, and with several times that number of U.S. soldiers wounded.  The question we must all ask ourselves is: How many lives is enough?  I'm once again calling on the Administration to change its international policy direction, to reach out to the world community through the United Nations, to bring U.N. peacekeepers in and to bring our troops home.  This exit strategy has been on my website for three months now and represents the best plan to ensure the stabilization of Iraq, the end of the war and the beginning of world security, and to bring our troops home.&quot;</FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
