<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">LOS ANGELES - June 15 -<I> Nobody on this earth has the right to tell anyone that their love for another human being is morally wrong.&quot; - from the Barbra Streisand card.</I></FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><I>&quot;Marriage is not about affirming somebody's love for somebody else.&quot; - from the Rick Santorum card.</I></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> One of the most unique political statements in the ongoing debate regarding equal marriage rights for same-sex couples will make its debut at Los Angeles Pride on June 19 in the form of a deck of playing cards. While the item is designed to be fun, there is little doubt about the power of the message packed inside.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Task Force Director of Development Charles Robbins said, &quot;In The Cards Design approached us at a unique time in the evolution of the marriage debate. The link of images and words used on these cards offers a snapshot into the personalities and thoughts involved in this critical equal rights issue.&quot; The deck includes colorful images of key supporters, politicians, celebrities, and opponents of equal rights for all citizens. In The Cards Design will be donating a percentage of the revenue from sales of the cards to the Task Force. In addition, the Task Force will be promoting the decks at events throughout the country.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;We are thrilled to have the Task Force as a partner for this one-of-a-kind deck,&quot; said In The Cards Marketing Director Alex von Rosenberg. &quot;The heart and diamond cards represent the love and strength of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community and straight supporters. Spades are often the strongest suit and include politicians that have had the strength to stand with conviction for the rights of the LGBT community. Clubs are the weakest suit and include caricatures of equality opponents along with their frequently hypocritical views.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Many of those featured in the deck are household names like Margaret Cho, Howard Dean, the Queer Eye Five, Michael Moore, and Madonna, along with detractors such as Rush Limbaugh and Rick Santorum. The Jokers are Jerry Falwell, adorned with Teletubbies, and President George Bush, depicted with a look and thought process that has become all too common during his Presidency.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The deck is a casino-quality, regulation poker deck, containing 52 caricatures accompanied by quotes by or about the individual on the card. The decks can be purchased for $12 at the <A HREF="http://www.thetaskforce.org/store/cards.cfm" TARGET="_NEW">Task Force Web site</A> or on the <A HREF="http://www.andmarriageforall.com" TARGET="_NEW">And Marriage for All Web site</A>. The Task Force and In The Cards Design will also be working with independent groups who wish to use the cards as a fundraising and communications vehicle. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In The Cards Design, Inc. develops specialty products focused on the communication of a message.
