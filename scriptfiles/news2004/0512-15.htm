<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - May 12 - Global Exchange and Rainforest Action Network today revealed plans to intensify &#147;Jumpstart Ford,&#148; the national grassroots campaign to compel Ford Motor Company to improve its fleet-wide fuel efficiency to 50 MPG by 2010 and eliminate tailpipe emissions by 2020. According the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Ford fleet ranks the worst in average fuel efficiency of all major U.S. automakers for model-year 2004. To confront Ford about its out-dated fleet of gas-guzzlers, activists will hold a &#147;Day of Intervention&#148; at the company&#146;s annual shareholder meeting in Louisville, KY on Thursday, May 13.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Ford shareholders will be presented with postcard-sized versions of two ads, warning them of a major national campaign depicting Ford as &#147;America&#146;s Oil Addict.&#148; The first in the series of ads features a stack of oil drums shaped like the famous Absolut bottle set against the stars and stripes, branded with the Ford logo and a headline reading, &#147;ABSOLUT ADDICTION.&#148; Campaign organizers will confront the company&#146;s owners, board of directors, executives and shareholders during the meeting&#146;s question and answer session.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;Ford&#146;s addiction to oil is endangering America&#146;s health, environment, economy and security,&#148; said Jason Mark, a campaigner with Global Exchange. &#147;Ford needs to get off the oil barrel. With a little bit of tough love, Americans can help Ford recover from its gas-guzzling ways.&#148;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;Ford, once America&#146;s flagship automaker, has spiraled downward to become America&#146;s oil addict,&#148; said Jennifer Krill, campaign director at Rainforest Action Network. &#147;The first step toward recovery is for Ford to admit that it has a problem: oil addiction. Ford&#146;s recovery from its addiction to oil will be the American auto industry&#146;s first real step towards creating a clean and healthy family of cars.&#148;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Global Exchange and Rainforest Action Network are part of a coalition of 80 public interest groups campaigning to clean up American automakers.
