<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - May 12 - An international jury of conscience, including Eve Ensler, Obie-award winning author of &quot;The Vagina Monologues,&quot; issued a statement today finding U.S. civilian leaders to be &quot;responsible and accountable for grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions&quot; in Iraq since the March 2003 invasion.</FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> The thirteen-member jury considered evidence on a range of violations including the continued arbitrary detention and torture of Iraqi civilians, the use of cluster munitions in heavily populated civilian areas, the extrajudicial killings of Iraqi civilians, and the destruction of vital services.</FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> The jurors found that &quot;instead of caring for Iraqi people, the US authorities have killed, starved, maimed and tortured thousands of Iraqi people, destroying their infrastructure, including their water and health facilities. ... This was done by the US government. The people of the US are responsible and must hold their government accountable.&quot;  </FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> As outrage over the torture of Iraqi prisoners by the U.S. military continues to grow both domestically and internationally, the evidence at the tribunal highlighted the systematic brutality of the U.S. invasion and military occupation for the people of Iraq. </FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> Juror Eve Ensler commented on the impact of Saturday's tribunal: &quot;The images of bombs falling like grapes from the sky and children playing in barrels of uranium, the language of not calling it torture, and the failure to provide security, water, and health and to preserve the ancient cultural property of Iraq shatters my heart: I hold a human shame, a sorrow that is so vast and so deep there is a physical aching in all of me.&quot;</FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> The Jury's statement emphasizes that &quot;the responsibility for defining the future of their country has always rested with the people of Iraq and not with any outside power, or external military force, let alone one that previously encouraged and collaborated with Saddam Hussein in some of his most violent escapades.&quot;  </FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> Columbia University Professor Hamid Dabashi, Chairman of the Jury, noted, &quot;The fire of the pain we witness our fellow humans endure half-way around the globe tests our mettle. But we will win - we, the ordinary people, have always won.&quot;  Fellow juror Eve Ensler concurred: &quot;What gives me hope is the will of the people.  We will win this struggle, there is no alternative.&quot;</FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> Global anti-war activists created the World Tribunal on Iraq in 2003 to hold the Bush administration and its allies accountable for their actions, to establish facts about what happened in Washington and Iraq, and to inform the public of those facts.  Precedents for this process include the 1967 Russell Tribunal to investigate crimes by the U.S. and allies in Vietnam, and the International War Crimes Tribunal against weapons of mass destruction by the German Green Party in Nuremberg in 1983.  Hearings are being held in sixteen cities across the world and will culminate in the final session in Istanbul, Turkey on the second anniversary of the invasion, March 20, 2005.</FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> Witnesses, advocates and representatives of the WTI - New York Session are available for interviews.
