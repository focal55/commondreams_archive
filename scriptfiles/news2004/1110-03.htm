<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- November 10 -- </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">New horse sanctuary guidelines were issued today by the Doris Day Animal League and the Animal Welfare Institute. Titled &#147;Basic Guidelines for Operating an Equine Rescue or Retirement Facility,&#148; the document offers practical advice and is available free to anyone operating or interested in starting up an equine rescue or retirement facility.  </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A working group of veterinarians, equestrians and public policy experts compiled the guidelines, which include information on feeding, enclosures, veterinary care, new arrivals and other fundamentals.  Developed on the premise that high quality equine management need not be restrictively expensive, the guidelines will be a valuable management resource as efforts to end the slaughter of horses for human consumption continue and the number of equine rescue and retirement facilities grows in response.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;We are inviting equine rescue and retirement facilities to incorporate these guidelines into their management practices.  By making every effort to adhere to these standards, facilities can enrich their day-to-day operations while demonstrating to the public that the equine rescue community takes very seriously its responsibility to provide quality care to its animals,&#148; said Liz Ross, Director of Special Projects for the Doris Day Animal League and editor of the publication.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The guidelines will be distributed free of charge to existing equine rescue and retirement facilities and will be available on-line at www.ddal.org and www.awionline.org.  While compliance with the guidelines is strictly voluntary, the authors hope they will provide the groundwork for a future and more extensive certification and monitoring program.  &#147;In the meantime, they serve as a benchmark for good operating standards,&#148; said Ross.<br></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
