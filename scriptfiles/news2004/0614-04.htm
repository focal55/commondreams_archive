<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - June 14 - In a letter sent today to the leadership of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives, 23 member groups of the Sustainable Energy Coalition called upon Members of Congress to work in a bipartisan fashion to enact &quot;tax provisions promoting renewable energy ... without further delay.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Noting &quot;the overarching importance of energy issues today - at gas pumps, pipelines, power lines, power plants, and overseas,&quot; the letter's signers stressed that &quot;with every month that passes without adoption of energy tax legislation, the renewables industry faces increasing uncertainty and disincentives to further investment.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Furthermore, &quot;the Congressional debates on this issue indicate that there is strong bipartisan support for expanding renewable energy production.  Nevertheless, tax provisions crucial to the renewables sector, such as the Production Tax Credit, have been delayed.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>The full text of the letter and list of signers follows:</B></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Dear Senators Frist and Daschle and Representatives Hastert and Pelosi:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">We are writing this letter to ask for your support for investment in renewable energy technologies before the end of this Congress.  More specifically, tax provisions promoting renewable energy should be passed without further delay as they are critical to the health of the nation's renewable energy sector.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">As electricity demand continues to rise, it is ever more urgent that the United States invest in domestic energy supplies that provide clean, reliable electricity to consumers.  Domestic renewable technologies such as biomass, geothermal, hydropower, solar and wind all need our nation's support at this crucial time.  We strongly support bipartisan efforts to promote investment in this critically needed energy infrastructure.  The overarching importance of energy issues today - at gas pumps, pipelines, power lines, power plants, and overseas - demonstrates the need for immediate Congressional action on renewable energy tax incentives.  With every month that passes without adoption of energy tax legislation, the renewables industry faces increasing uncertainty and disincentives to further investment.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Congressional debates on this issue indicate that there is strong bipartisan support for expanding renewable energy production.  Nevertheless, tax provisions crucial to the renewables sector, such as the Production Tax Credit, have been delayed.  We urge you to continue to work with all members of the Congress to enact legislation that achieves these goals as soon as possible.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Renewable energy technologies provide domestic, clean, reliable electricity.   In addition, the renewables industry provides significant job growth and creates other economic benefits.  We thank you for your continued bipartisan support of these technologies and we urge you to enact renewable energy tax provisions to spur investment in this sector without delay.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Sincerely,</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Micah Walker Parkin, Interim Executive Director, Alliance for Affordable Energy</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Genevieve Cullen, Co-Director, American Bioenergy Association</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Randall Swisher, Executive Director, American Wind Energy Association</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">F.
