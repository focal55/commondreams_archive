<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - March 22 - On March 23rd, Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham will kick-off a six-city tour in Lansing, MI to promote the Bush Administration's highly questionable hydrogen program.  Instead of creating a new clean energy vision, the Bush Administration's plan, titled &quot;Hydrogen Power: The Promise, The Challenge,&quot; would make hydrogen in the dirtiest way possible and continue America's dependence on polluting energy sources.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The Bush Administration's hydrogen proposal is like a nicotine patch that increases cigarette cravings,&quot; said Dan Becker, Director of Sierra Club's Global Warming and Energy Program.  &quot;Instead of producing hydrogen with clean, renewable energy sources like wind and solar power, the Bush Administration wants to rely on polluting coal plants and nuclear power.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Hydrogen is created by stripping hydrogen atoms from water molecules or other materials.  This process requires energy.  The Bush Administration's plan would use the dirtiest energy sources, like coal and nuclear power, to create this energy.  Instead of handicapping a 21st century energy technology with 19th century polluting technology, the Bush Administration should be promoting a clean energy future that produces hydrogen from renewable energy sources like wind and solar power.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Announced during the 2003 State of the Union address, the Bush Administration called on the Department of Energy to invest $1.7 billion in the research and development of hydrogen technologies, including automobiles, fuel cells, and hydrogen fuel infrastructure.  However, the administration's hydrogen proposal requires industries to produce only hydrogen concept vehicles and &quot;demonstration technology.&quot;   The mass production of hydrogen technologies is not mandated, and there are no detailed plans for the creation of the infrastructure, like filling stations, needed to support a hydrogen economy.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Not only is the Bush Administration promoting hydrogen from polluting sources of energy, the Administration's plan hands corporate polluters a blank check at taxpayer's expense,&quot; said Becker. &quot;The Bush Administration's plan fails to require automakers to bring a single hydrogen vehicle onto the market.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">America needs to move forward with research and development on hydrogen technology.  However, many hurdles must be overcome before hydrogen can become a viable energy solution.  The Bush Administration's plan is an attempt to let polluters off the hook today, with the promises of a clean future tomorrow.  Instead of giving corporate polluters a pass, the Bush Administration should require them to put existing, on-the-shelf technology to work.  There is a better way.  By using existing fuel-saving technology, automakers could double the fuel economy of their vehicles within ten years, curbing global warming, cutting America's oil dependence, and saving consumer's money at the gas pump.  We can also produce 20 percent of our electricity with clean, renewable energy sources by 2020, creating jobs and cleaning up the environment.</FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
