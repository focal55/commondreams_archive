<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - January 16 - Internet Flash Movie, at <A HREF="http://www.bushflash.com/mlk.html" TARGET="_new">http://www.bushflash.com/mlk.html</A>, Recalls King&#146;s Warnings Against the Ravages of War.</FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">A day after citizens opposed to the U.S. occupation of Iraq booed President Bush when laid a wreath at the grave of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., prominent peace groups launched an inspiring internet flash movie that reveals just how out-of-sync the White House is with Dr. King&#146;s message of peace and love. </FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The flash movie represents just one way that peace, social justice and civil rights groups are trying to reclaim Dr. King&#146;s message and remind Americans that King was not only a champion for civil rights, but also a stalwart defender of peace and social justice. This holiday weekend public interest groups are holding countless teach-ins and symposiums, publishing op-ed pieces, and distributing messages over the internet. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The internet flash movie excerpts Dr. King&#146;s April 4, 1967 speech at Riverside Church in New York City and overlays his words with images from the Vietnam War and the current Iraq War. A loop of a Tupac Shakur song provides a musical background. Over images of war abroad and poverty at home, Dr. King&#146;s voice tells viewers: &#147;A nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death.&#148; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The film was produced by Global Exchange, Code Pink: Women for Peace, Black Voices for Peace, and United for Peace and Justice. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;Dr. King and Mr. Bush are polar opposites,&#148; says Medea Benjamin, co-founder of Global Exchange, a human rights group that co-produced the flash movie.  &#147;Dr. King&#146;s message was love, peace and compassion; Bush&#146;s message is war, revenge and fear. If Dr. King were alive today, he&#146;d be leading massive protests against Bush&#146;s war in Iraq, his abandonment of the poor in this country, and his attacks on affirmative action.&#148;  </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;Even as our warmongering president insults Dr. King with his actions, thousands of people all around the United States are honoring the memory of Dr. King by working today&#151;and every day of the year&#151;for peace and justice,&#148; says Reverend Graylan Hagler, National President of the Ministers for Racial and Economic Justice and a board member of United for Peace and Justice. &#147;By sharing this internet movie with friends and family, people can help spread Dr. King's true message.&#148; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Dr. King movie can be viewed by visiting <A HREF="http://www.globalexchange.org" TARGET="_new">http://www.globalexchange.org</A> or <A HREF="http://www.unitedforpeace.org" TARGET="_new">http://www.unitedforpeace.org</A> or <A HREF="http://www.alternet.org" TARGET="_new">http://www.alternet.org</A>.</FONT></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
