<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON, D.C. - October 12  -  A new report released today by the <a href="http://www.sierraclub.org" target="_new">Sierra Club</a>, the <a href="http://www.uswa.org/uswa/program/content/index.php" target="_new">United Steel Workers</a>, <a href="http://www.seiu.org/" target="_new">Service Employees International Union</a> (SEIU), <a href="http://www.unitehere.org/" target="_new">UNITE/HERE</a>, the <a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/" target="_new">Union of Concerned Scientists</a>, and the <a href="http://www.nrdc.org/" target="_new">Natural Resources Defense Council</a> shows that a clean energy policy would create 1.4 million new American jobs while saving the average American household more dollars every year on energy, resulting in a $1,275 annual saving in 2025.  The report, "Smarter, Cleaner,
<p>Stronger: Secure Jobs, a Clean Environment, and Less Foreign Oil," authored by Redefining Progress, uses classic economic modeling to demonstrate the economic and environmental benefits of adopting a cleaner, smarter energy policy: the creation of new American jobs, lower energy bills, and increased protection of our air, water and land.

<p>"This report shows that there is a better way.  A smarter energy plan would create good new American jobs, while cleaning up the environment," said David Hamilton, National Director of the Sierra Club's Global Warming & Energy Program. "Protecting the environment creates jobs, but the Bush administration is protecting its friends in the oil and coal industries and putting average Americans at risk by blocking smarter, cleaner, stronger energy policy."

<p>The clean energy policies laid out in the report stand in stark contrast to the Bush administration's energy plan.  That measure embraces increasing oil dependence by the U.S., while ignoring global warming.  Further, the Bush plan offers little more than lip service to increase energy efficiency and our use of renewable energy such as solar or wind power.

<p>In addition to releasing the report, the coalition is placing print ads in media markets around the country.  The print ads feature an x-ray of a human skull with a peanut where the brain is located.  This image is framed by the headline, "Investing in Clean Energy Will Create 1.4 Million New American Jobs - So Why Isn't This a No Brainer for the Bush Administration?"

<p>The Bush administration has put working families and the environment at risk by pursuing a backwards and polluting energy policy. Crafted in secret with energy industry lobbyists, the Bush administration's energy plan calls for more polluting power plants, more oil and gas drilling on public lands, and billions of dollars in tax breaks to corporate polluters. In addition to pursuing its flawed energy policy, the Bush administration has shown a marked hostility across the board to the environment and workers' rights.

<p>"Labor unions and environmental groups are standing side by side today because good jobs and clean energy are a no brainer," said Dan Becker, Washington Director of the Sierra Club's Global Warming Program. "We can all breathe easier because the United States will gain 1.4 million jobs and curb global warming from this package of energy efficiency improvements, renewable energy, and clean cars."

<p>The report released today examines a suite of clean energy policies that will increase energy efficiency, renewable energy, and improve fuel economy.  A copy of the national report, state profiles, and the print ads are available online at <a href="http://http://www.nrdc.org/" target="_new">www.sierraclub.org/globalwarming</a>.
