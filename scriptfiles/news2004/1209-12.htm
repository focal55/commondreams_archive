<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NEW YORK, NY -- December 9 -- One day after a federal court judge in Washington, D.C., refused to bar the Army from sending Specialist David Qualls back to Iraq because his enlistment contract was involuntarily extended, lawyers from the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) say they will ask the Court to issue an order today requiring the Army not to retaliate against him.  Specialist Qualls was denied a Temporary Restraining Order despite evidence that he was never warned that the &#147;Try One&#148; enlistment contract he signed might be superceded by the Army&#146;s &#147;Stop Loss&#148; policy.  Qualls, who was the only one of eight servicemen represented by CCR challenging the policy who publicly identified himself, served as a radio operator in Taji, Iraq, for nine months and has already stayed beyond the one year he signed up for in July of 2003.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Judge Lamberth&#146;s decision means the enlistment contracts servicemen sign are not worth the paper they are written on,&#148; said CCR Legal Director, Jeffrey Fogel.  &#147;His decision reinforces the myth that we have an all-volunteer army,&#148; he added.  &#147;The truth is we have a back door draft.  The Government&#146;s use of trickery to recruit and enlist soldiers can undermine the morale of our troops on the ground.&#148; </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CCR Vice President, Jules Lobel, who argued the case for Qualls said, &#147;David Qualls was the victim of a fraud.  He served his country; he did his time.  He expected the Army to honor the agreement they made and they didn&#146;t.   His government deceived him and he is paying the price.&#148;</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The lawsuit, Qualls v. Rumsfeld, comes at a time when the Secretary of Defense has come under fire from troops in the field complaining about the lack of equipment and adequate protection for military vehicles.  While Qualls lost his request for relief, the case will continue with regard to a request for an injunction requiring the army to return the all the plaintiffs home from Iraq and Kuwait.<br></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
