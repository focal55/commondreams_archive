<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - August 5 - On Sunday, August 15, 2004, Common Cause President and former Maine Senate Majority Leader Chellie Pingree will join guests at the Burt residence on Perkins Point Road, along with supporters and members of Common Cause across the country, in a nationwide house party fundraiser. The simultaneous parties will deliver information about the current state of our election process and will recruit activists to take part in activities supporting election reform, but the guests in Newcastle will have a special opportunity to talk with one of the event headliners in person.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The parties, which begin at 7:00 PM (Eastern), will feature a conference call with Chellie Pingree and Arianna Huffington. Huffington, a nationally syndicated columnist and author of eight books, is an impassioned, independent and intrepid advocate for political reform and social awareness. She has established herself as a distinctive and provocative figure in American politics. Arianna and Chellie will discuss issues and take questions concerning Election Day 2004. They&sup1;ll cover topics such as voting reforms enacted since 2000, potential problems that may arise on November 2, and how individuals can take action locally to improve our democracy.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Background: The United States ranks 140th out of 163 of the world's democracies in average voter turnout. While almost 75 countries had better than a 70% average turnout in the 1990s, the U.S. could do no better than 44.9%. In addition, on Election Day, November 2, many people in the U.S. will be voting on touchscreen voting machines, which have not proven to be tamper-proof or computer bug-free. This is embarrassing, but worse, it is very alarming.  </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Common Cause has decided to do something about these problems. Through our &quot;Vote for America&quot; program, a non-partisan voter registration and get-out-the-vote effort, we are asking everyone to do their part to get friends and family members &shy; especially those who seldom or never vote &shy; to go to the polls on Election Day, November 2. Common Cause is also putting together a large, volunteer, non-partisan Election Day monitoring program called Take Action for Elections.
