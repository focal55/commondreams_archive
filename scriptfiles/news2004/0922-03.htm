<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - September 22 - In a letter delivered today to the leaders of the U.S. Senate and U.S. House of Representatives as well as to the key congressional tax and energy policy committees, 29 member groups of the Sustainable Energy Coalition called upon Congress &quot;to enact the FULL SET (emphasis added) of energy efficiency and renewable energy tax incentives that have been pending before the U.S. Congress since at least the beginning of 2003.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The organizations noted that &quot;many of these provisions have been approved in the past one or more times by the Congress only to subsequently become incorporated into, and mired down by, more controversial legislation.&quot;  Moreover, it now appears likely that the Congress will seek to only approve a few selected sustainable energy tax provisions before ending its current session.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The letter's signers argued that &quot;these renewable energy and energy efficiency tax incentives must be freed from the burden of controversial legislation that may not pass the Congress this year,&quot; and urged Members &quot;to enact these provisions, including comparable tax treatment for cooperative and municipal utilities, on their own merits ... before you end this session and go home.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Furthermore, they wrote, &quot;enactment of these incentives is absolutely imperative to curb our dependence on energy imports, reduce rising oil and natural gas prices, and cut the growing emissions of greenhouse gases.  Failure to approve these measures will cost quality American jobs, cripple new basic domestic industries, and set back the recovery of businesses hurt by rising energy prices.  It will also worsen national and homeland energy security and environmental quality, the nation's balance of trade, and American industry's international competitiveness.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Finally, the letter reminded Members that &quot;enacting these tax incentives is one of the best things you can do for your constituents, your states, and for the nation's energy future&quot; and that &quot;it is now well past the time when they should be signed into law.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The full text of the letter and complete list of signing organizations follows.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">September 22, 2004</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dear Member of Congress:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We, the undersigned business, environmental, consumer, and energy policy organizations, are writing to urge you to enact the full set of energy efficiency and renewable energy tax incentives that have been pending before the U.S. Congress since at least the beginning of 2003.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These proposals enjoy broad support among the Members of the U.S. Congress as well as among the members of the U.S. public.  In fact, many of these provisions have been approved in the past one or more times by the Congress only to subsequently become incorporated into, and mired down by, more controversial legislation.  It is now well past the time when they should be signed into law so they can begin helping American consumers and businesses cope with their energy problems.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Enactment of these incentives is absolutely imperative to curb our dependence on energy imports, reduce rising oil and natural gas prices, and cut the growing emissions of greenhouse gases.  Failure to approve these measures will cost quality American jobs, cripple new basic domestic industries, and set back the recovery of businesses hurt by rising energy prices.  It will also worsen national and homeland energy security and environmental quality, the nation's balance of trade, and American industry's international competitiveness.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Congress has a unique opportunity, as well as a responsibility, to American voters to help the nation invest in energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies in the power, transportation, residential, appliance, and other sectors.  But to realize this opportunity, these renewable energy and energy efficiency tax incentives must be freed from the burden of controversial legislation that may not pass the Congress this year.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Enacting these tax incentives is one of the best things you can do for your constituents, your states, and for the nation's energy future.  Consequently, before you end this session and go home, we urge you to enact these provisions, including comparable tax treatment for cooperative and municipal utilities, on their own merits.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sincerely,</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Alliance for Affordable Energy<br>Alliance to Save Energy<br>American Bioenergy Association<br>American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy<br>American Public Power Association<br>American Solar Energy Society<br>Bob Lawrence &amp; Associates, Inc.<br>Breakthrough Technologies Institute<br>Business Council for Sustainable Energy<br>Cascade Associates<br>City &amp; County of San Francisco<br>Clean Fuels Development Coalition<br>Colorado Energy Group<br>Environmental &amp; Energy Study Institute<br>Exquisite Heat<br>Geothermal Energy Association<br>Geothermal Resources Council<br>National Environmental Trust<br>National Ethanol Vehicle Coalition<br>New Uses Council<br>Northwest Sustainable Energy for Economic Development<br>Renewable Fuels Association<br>Solar Energy Industries Association<br>Solena Group<br>The Stella Group, Ltd.<br>Sturman Industries<br>SustainableBusiness.com<br>Union of Concerned Scientists<br>Vermont Energy Investment Corporation<br></font></p><p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">###</font></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
