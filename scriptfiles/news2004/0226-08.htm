<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - February 26 - The new MPP Medical Marijuana PAC, the first federal political action committee focused on the medical marijuana issue, announced its first contributions today. Contributions were made to a bipartisan group of six candidates in closely contested races.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">   The mission of the MPP Medical Marijuana PAC is to support candidates for federal elected office who have taken action, or have pledged to take action, to ensure that physician-approved patients have safe and legal access to medical marijuana. It will also oppose officeholders who have worked against such protections for patients, and it will strategically focus on closely contested races. The initial round of contributions -- $1,000 each -- went to the following candidates:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">   Paul Babbitt (D) ...... AZ 1 (Flagstaff, Prescott, and Navajo                           reservation)</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">   Bob Beauprez (R) ...... CO 7 (Lakewood and parts of Arvada and                           Aurora)</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">   Michael Michaud (D) ...

WA 2 (Bellingham and most of Everett)</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">   (All are incumbents except Babbitt, who is running against    incumbent Rep. Rick Renzi (R))</FONT></P><P>   <FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;This is the next step in the evolution of medical marijuana as a political issue,&quot; said Steve Fox, director of government relations for the Marijuana Policy Project (MPP) in Washington, D.C. &quot;We have informed elected officials about the widespread public support for the issue, we have lobbied members of Congress and their staffs directly, and we have activated our grassroots. Now it is time to provide financial support to those who are willing to support medical marijuana.&quot;</FONT></P><P>   <FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;National and statewide polling consistently shows public support for medical marijuana in the 75 to 80 percent range,&quot; Fox added. &quot;Eventually, elected officials will realize that supporting medical marijuana is a political no-brainer. Not only will it help them at the polls, but it will also enhance their fundraising.&quot;</FONT></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
