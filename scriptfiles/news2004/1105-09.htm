<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">HOUSTON, TX -- November 5 -- News Advisory: Amnesty International USA (AIUSA) will hold a rally on Friday, Nov. 5 at 5 p.m., 2004, calling on Texas Governor Rick Perry to halt executions in Texas. The event will take place outside the Harris County Courthouse, 1201 Franklin St., in Houston. AIUSA will set up a wall of 280 boxes representing the 280 boxes of uncatalogued evidence recently found in the HPD crime lab.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On Oct. 12, 2004, Governor Perry said that Texans, among other things, want a government that &quot;does a few things but does them well.&quot; That night Donald Aldrich was executed despite the fact that 280 boxes of uncatalogued evidence were recently discovered in the Houston Police Department's crime lab dating back 25 years. Aldrich is one of five individuals convicted in Harris County, Texas who have been executed in the three months since the lost evidence was discovered. There are currently four more individuals from Harris County scheduled to be executed between now and Dec. 1, 2004.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Members of AIUSA from 11 Southern states will join with local community groups to publicly call on Governor Perry to guarantee that the principles of fairness and responsibility are applied at every level and that the government works well for all Texans. <a href="http://takeaction.amnestyusa.org/action/%20index.asp%27step=2&item=11255" target="_new">http://takeaction.amnestyusa.org/action/ index.asp'step=2&amp;item=11255</a></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SPEAKERS: Dr. William F.
