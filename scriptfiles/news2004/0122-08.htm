<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - January 22 - Eighteen business, consumer, environmental, and energy policy organizations today called upon members of the U.S. Congress to &quot;enact the broadly-supported energy efficiency and renewable energy provisions in the proposed, but presently stalled, national energy bill.&quot;</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In letters being sent today to members of the congressional leadership, the groups stressed that &quot;there is substantial support in Congress and around the country for the cross-section of sustainable energy provisions in the final energy bill.  [Accordingly,] Congress should act immediately to enact these non-controversial and vitally important provisions as part of a comprehensive, balanced, and environmentally sound energy bill, as stand-alone legislation, or through incorporation into another piece of legislation.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In particular, &quot;such widely supported clean energy provisions include: the Renewable Fuels Standard, improved appliance efficiency standards, extension and expansion of the Production Tax Credit as well as broadened investment tax credits for efficiency and renewables, higher funding authority for energy efficiency and renewable energy programs, net metering and interconnection standards, revisions in geothermal leasing, the reauthorization of the Renewable Energy Production Incentive program, and extension and expansion of federal energy management provisions including energy-saving performance contracting authority.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The letter concluded that &quot;these sustainable energy provisions are needed by all Americans to reduce energy imports, improve national and homeland security through less vulnerable and more dispersed energy systems, curb greenhouse gas emissions, enhance electrical grid reliability, and create new jobs and domestic businesses.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The full text of the letter and list of 18 signing organizations follows.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Alliance for Affordable Energy ** Alliance to Save Energy ** American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy ** American Solar Energy Society ** Bob Lawrence &amp; Associates ** City &amp; County of San Francisco ** Clean Fuels Development Coalition **Colorado Energy Group ** Environmental &amp; Energy Study Institute ** Geothermal Resources Council ** Mainstay Energy ** Metropolitan Partnership for Energy ** New Uses Council ** Potomac Resources, Inc. ** Redwood Alliance ** REP Ameica ** SustainableBusiness.com **The Stella Group, Ltd.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">January 22, 2004</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Dear Senator/Representative:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">We, the undersigned business, environmental, consumer, and energy policy organizations are writing to urge that the Congress enact the broadly-supported energy efficiency and renewable energy provisions in the proposed, but presently stalled, national energy bill.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Poll after poll has indicated that the public considers energy efficiency and renewable energy to be the favored choices for our energy future.  Consequently, there is substantial support in Congress and around the country for the cross-section of sustainable energy provisions in the final energy bill.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Within the energy bill report, such widely supported clean energy provisions include: the Renewable Fuels Standard, improved appliance efficiency standards, extension and expansion of the Production Tax Credit as well as broadened investment tax credits for efficiency and renewables, higher funding authority for energy efficiency and renewable energy programs, net metering and interconnection standards, revisions in geothermal leasing, the reauthorization of the Renewable Energy Production Incentive program, and extension and expansion of federal energy management provisions including energy-saving performance contracting authority.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Although some of these provisions were weakened during compromise negotiations, they are, on balance, positive steps for the clean energy industry.  Moreover, these sustainable energy provisions are needed by all Americans to reduce energy imports, improve national and homeland security through less vulnerable and more dispersed energy systems, curb greenhouse gas emissions, enhance electrical grid reliability, and create new jobs and domestic businesses.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Congress should act immediately to enact these non-controversial and vitally important provisions as part of a comprehensive, balanced, and environmentally sound energy bill, as stand-alone legislation, or through incorporation into another piece of legislation.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Furthermore, we also would like to bring your attention to some of the other provisions that were not included in the present energy bill but which enjoy broad public support and have been endorsed by strong votes in the U.S. Senate.  These include a Renewable Portfolio Standard and aggressive, mandatory targets for reducing national oil consumption.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">We look forward to working with you further on this important endeavor.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Sincerely,</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Alliance for Affordable Energy</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Alliance to Save Energy</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">American Solar Energy Society</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Bob Lawrence &amp; Associates</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">City &amp; County of San Francisco</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Clean Fuels Development Coalition</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Colorado Energy Group</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Environmental &amp; Energy Study Institute</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Geothermal Resources Council</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Mainstay Energy</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Metropolitan Partnership for Energy</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">New Uses Council</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Potomac Resources, Inc.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Redwood Alliance</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">REP (Republicans for Environmental Protection) </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">America SustainableBusiness.com </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Stella Group, Ltd.</FONT></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
