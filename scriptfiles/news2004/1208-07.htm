<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- December 8 -- On this Global Day of Action Against Debt Domination, as Jubilee South and debt campaigners across Asia, Africa, and the Americas organize demonstrations and other actions to highlight the illegitimacy of the debt, Jubilee USA Network proclaims its solidarity with movements challenging debt domination. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jubilee USA Network is the US arm of the global Jubilee movement. With more than 60 member organizations including religious denominations and faith-based organizations, community groups, environmental, labor, and solidarity organizations, Jubilee USA promotes its mission to cancel the unjust and illegitimate debts of impoverished nations through public education, organizing, media outreach, and advocacy.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jubilee USA Network believes there is a moral imperative for full (100%) debt cancellation of debts owed by impoverished nations with a high level of human need. Jubilee USA also calls for cancellation of debts found to be illegitimate or odious, wherever they exist, through a just and equitable process not controlled by the creditors. We insist that debt cancellation not be preconditioned on IMF/World Bank economic policies, which have been so devastating to growth and equity.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The debt crisis faced by developing countries persists and continues to rob impoverished nations of resources desperately needed for development. From 1970-2002, Africa received some $540 billion in loans, and paid back $550 billion in principal and interest. Yet the continent today remains burdened by a debt stock of $295 billion. The debt has already been paid.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For the most impoverished nations struggling to fight the HIV/AIDS pandemic which is claiming 8,000 lives each day, it is a tragic reality that debt service payments to institutions like the IMF and World Bank continue to divert funds from desperately needed social services. The IMF, World Bank, and other multilateral creditors hold most of the debt of the poorest nations &#150; 61% of debts owed by the 27 countries that have qualified for the institutions&#146; debt relief mechanism (HIPC) are owed to multilateral creditors. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative launched by the IMF and World Bank in 1996 has failed to provide the promised &#147;robust exit&#148; to the debt crisis faced by impoverished nations. Though the limited relief that has come from the program has gone towards much needed social programs, after 8 years it is clear that a much bolder approach must be taken. The HIPC group of countries is still paying $8 billion/year in debt service; this is not much less than the $10 billion/year paid in 1995. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Moreover, harmful economic conditions continue to be imposed by the IMF and World Bank on impoverished nations as a condition for debt relief. It is in this way that debt has become a form of domination. These policies &#150; like water privatization, indiscriminate trade liberalization, low-inflation targets, and more &#150; are devastating poor country economies and peoples&#146; lives. They must be stopped.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On this Global Day of Action Against Debt, we renew our call for a Jubilee cancellation of debts. Definitive debt cancellation delinked from all economic conditions is a critical first step towards the restoration of right relationships in the global community &#150; relationships which are currently fractured by the crisis of debt.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jubilee USA calls on the US government, the IMF and World Bank, and the G-7 and other wealthy creditors to take immediate action in 2005 to address the crisis of debt. We are encouraged by recent developments on multilateral debt &#150; especially by the fact that the US government and the UK government announced their public support for &#147;up to 100%&#148; multilateral debt cancellation from the IMF and World Bank in 2004. This is a demand Jubilee USA and worldwide Jubilee movements have made for years.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the short term (in the first 6 months of 2005), we call on our government and others to enact a plan for full (100%) multilateral debt cancellation for all impoverished countries, not just those in the HIPC Initiative. We insist that this cancellation come without economic conditionalities attached or via the failed HIPC Initiative. Finally, we call on the IMF to sell gold and the World Bank to use some of it reserves and commit future profits to finance debt cancellation. These wealthy multilateral institutions need to contribute their fair share. We will work hard to ensure that our government takes action early in 2005 to see full multilateral debt cancellation become a reality. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If we are successful, this will be an important victory. But it will be just the first step in a broader effort. We will redouble our efforts in 2005 to address debts of countries at all income levels which are odious and illegitimate. The cancellation of Iraq&#146;s debt in 2004 is a perfect example of a debt which is clearly odious. Though creditors refused to describe it as such, the cancellation of Iraq&#146;s debt establishes a precedent that must be followed to its logical conclusion.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We believe that neither the people of Iraq, nor citizens of other countries formerly ruled by dictators, should be obliged to repay odious debts. Debts contracted by other notorious dictators, such as Mobutu Sese Seko who ruled Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo) with an iron fist from 1965 to 1989 and the generals who waged their &#147;dirty war&#148; against the people of Argentina from 1976 to 1983 are equally odious and must not be repaid. Moreover, we urge that loans made for failed projects, in the context of the Cold War, be examined as illegitimate debts. We support the establishment of a just and equitable process, such as a fair and transparent arbitration process, to identify and cancel odious and illegitimate debts. We also affirm the rights of impoverished nations to repudiate or refuse to pay such debts. We support the debt audits currently underway in countries including the Philippines, Brazil, and elsewhere to determine the illegitimacy of debts.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To conclude, on this Global Day of Action Against Debt Domination, we stand with debt campaigns and movements across Asia, Africa, and the Americas in proclaiming, Freedom from Debt = Freedom from Domination! Cancel the Debt, Now!</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
