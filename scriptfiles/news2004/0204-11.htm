<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - February 4 - An unprecedented collection of 324 national, state, and local environmental, civil rights, civil liberties, women's rights, public health, social welfare, senior, religious, and social justice organizations today urged the Federal Election Commission to reject an FEC General Counsel draft advisory opinion that could severely restrict the ability of nonprofit organizations to communicate with the public about important policy issues.  The FEC is scheduled to consider the opinion at its meeting this Thursday, February 5. (For a copy of the letter and the draft advisory opinion, see <A HREF="http://www.pfaw.org/go/FEC_Advisory_Opinion" TARGET="_new">www.pfaw.org/go/FEC_Advisory_Opinion</A>.)</FONT></p><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">It could be virtually impossible for groups other than federal PACs to criticize or commend members of Congress or President Bush for anything they say or do if the commissioners approve the draft opinion's assertion that any communication that &quot;promotes, supports, attacks, or opposes&quot; any federal candidate must be paid for using funds raised under the restrictions of the federal election laws.  According to the organizations' letter of concern, the draft advisory opinion could allow the FEC to regulate and potentially stifle debate on public policy issues, granting the agency a level of power that far exceeds the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA) as well as the express advocacy test upheld by the Supreme Court.  </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">For example, the opinion, as drafted, could put unprecedented restrictions on spending for:</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">o        A web site that criticizes funding cuts contained in the budget recently transmitted to Congress by President Bush;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">o        An awards dinner honoring Senator Feingold for his support of campaign finance reform;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">o        A newsletter article that lists members of Congress who have co-sponsored legislation supported by an organization; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">o        A fundraising appeal from organizations that seeks to oppose Bush administration policies toward the environment.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Making it unlawful to criticize the policies and actions of a sitting President or Members of Congress except under the auspices of a registered political committee is one of the most fundamental attacks on the freedom of speech and freedom of association of American citizens ever contemplated by a government agency,&quot; says the public interest organizations' comments. </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Alarmed by the draft opinion's far-reaching potential to limit public debate on issues, restrict the ability of advocacy organizations to criticize public officials, undermine voter registration activities, and severely limit charitable groups' fundraising activities, the public interest organizations &quot;urge the Commission, with the greatest sense of urgency and in the strongest terms possible, not to issue the draft opinion in its present form.&quot;</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Attorneys available for comment:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Mike Trister and Holly Schadler, Lichtman, Trister &amp; Ross, 202-328-1666    </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Gail Harmon and Elizabeth Kingsley, Harmon, Curran, Spielberg &amp; Eisenberg, LLP, 202-328-3500</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Organization media contacts:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">People For the American Way: Laurie Boeder 202-467-4999</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Alliance for Justice: Carrie Boron 202-822-6070</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Leadership Conference on Civil Rights: Michelle Woolley 202-263-2881</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">NARAL Pro-choice America: Evelyn Becker 202.973.3020</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">NAACP National Voter Fund: Greg Moore, 202-898-0969</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Sierra Club: Kerri Glover, 202-547-1141 </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">League of Conservation Voters: Mark Sokolove, 202-454-4573</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Planned Parenthood Federation of America: Colleen McCabe, 212-261-4729</FONT></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
