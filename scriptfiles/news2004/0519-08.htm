<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">GENEVA- May 19 - As the 192 countries of the World Health Assembly (WHA) consider policy recommendations to address a global epidemic of malnutrition, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are urging governments to resist influence-peddling by the food industry. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), cardiovascular disease, Type 2 diabetes and certain cancers linked to diet and obesity are part of a major shift in the cause of death around the world. In response, the UN&#146;s health agency is moving ahead with a Global Strategy on Diet, Physical Activity and Health that would help inform consumers about the dangers of foods high in sugar, salt and fat while curtailing promotion of junk food. </FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The US government has been a leading opponent of many of the key provisions of the Global Strategy on Diet, and has successfully sought changes that will weaken the recommendations dramatically. While many countries and NGOs have supported a ban on junk food promotion, the US and the food industry have preferred provisions that focus on the responsibility of individuals rather than on corporate accountability. Activists are drawing parallels between the US position on diet and nutrition policy and the US actions to thwart tobacco control initiatives, as evidenced by the US role in negotiations over the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC).</FONT></P><P> <FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;Once again, the US government is prioritizing the profits of a powerful industry over the lives of people around the world. We saw this sort of cowboy diplomacy as the US sought to weaken the global treaty on tobacco control. Now the Bush Administration is trying to water down the Global Strategy on Diet, Physical Activity and Health for the sake of Big Food,&#148; says Kathryn Mulvey, Executive Director of the US-based corporate accountability organization Infact.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The food industry is aggressively using its trade associations to influence international health policy. The Confederation of the Food and Drink Industries (CIAA) of the European Union and the International Council of Grocery Manufacturers Associations (ICGMA)&#151;which includes the Grocery Manufacturers of America&#151;are seeking official relations with WHO, a status reserved for NGOs concerned with health. Philip Morris/Altria, parent of Kraft Foods, the largest branded food and beverage corporation in the world, is a prominent member of the GMA. In a letter being delivered to WHO this week, Infact, Commercial Alert and dozens of allied organizations around the world have called on WHO to include a ban on junk food marketing to children in its Global Strategy.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;The food industry, led by Kraft and other global corporations, is driving an epidemic of obesity with junk food promotion while undermining measures to protect health. With aggressive behind-the-scenes lobbying and close ties with governments of some wealthy nations, the food industry is mirroring the tobacco industry&#146;s attempts to derail policy. But the FCTC process has taught us that when countries are united around public health, they can prevail in the face of the most powerful economic forces. We applaud the majority of countries that maintain their strong commitment to health,&#148; says Bejon Misra of ConsumerVOICE (India), a member of Consumers International.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The WHA marks the one-year anniversary of the adoption of the FCTC, a global treaty that will save millions of lives and change the way the industry operates globally. There is strong momentum behind the treaty&#146;s implementation, as more than 100 countries have signed and 12 have ratified. The FCTC, which bans tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship and protects public health policy from tobacco industry interference, becomes binding international law after 40 countries sign and ratify. In more than 40 countries across the globe, civil society organizations are participating in the sixth International Week of Resistance to Tobacco Transnationals (IWR2004) with public events calling for swift FCTC ratification.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Last week the US government&#146;s signing of the FCTC was met with skepticism. According to Infact, the move appeared to be the latest in a series of public relations maneuvers to cover up its efforts to undermine the treaty. Throughout the FCTC negotiating process, the US government consistently took positions to weaken the treaty at the expense of people&#146;s lives in the US and around the world.</FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
