<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NEW YORK  -- November 10 -- The Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR), today welcomed the Attorney General&#146;s resignation and called for a return to the rule of law and respect for the U.S. Constitution.   According to CCR Legal Director, Jeffrey Fogel the President should appoint a new Attorney General who will restore the rights and the government transparency that are the foundation of democracy. &#147;John Ashcroft&#146;s policies have divided the Nation, just as the recent election did.  We urge the President to uphold his pledge to unite the nation.  He can begin this process by appointing a new Attorney General, who has a record of upholding the rights of U.S. citizens rather than dismantling them,&#148; Fogel stated.</font></p>
<p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Ashcroft Justice Department tenure has been marked by a distain for constitutional principles and our democratic tradition. He has illegally rounded up immigrants with no connection to terrorism and detained them under abusive conditions in our own jails simply because of their religion or country of origin.  He has argued before the Supreme Court that the president can lock up a U.S. citizen in secret and throw away the key without ever giving them access to a lawyer, a court, their family, or even knowledge of the charges against them.  </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An obsession with secrecy has been the hallmark of Ashcroft&#146;s tenure.  He ordered federal agencies to resist all Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, and hides behind claims of national security when pressed to provide evidence or documentation that may not support the Administration&#146;s point of view.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Attorney General accused those who charge the Administration with constitutional violations of aiding the terrorists, yet by dismantling centuries of law, it is Mr. Ashcroft who has done the damage to our nation: his many critics are the true patriots. Many of Ashcroft&#146;s most frightening assaults on the rights and safety of Americans and people around the world directly and adversely affect CCR clients:</font></p><p> </p>
<ul>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Turkmen v. Ashcroft,  CCR challenged the rounding up of thousands of Muslims on minor immigration violations to investigate them for links to terrorism based on no evidence other than their racial and religious profile in the wake of 9/11.</font></li>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Attorney General ordered people sent to be interrogated in other countries where torture is a routine part of interrogations, in direct violation of our own Convention against Torture, as in the case of CCR client, Maher Arar.</font></li>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He rewrote the FBI guidelines on government spying to permit spying on political and religious organizations without any suggestion of criminal activity.</font></li>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He has falsely prosecuted dozens in an attempt to portray his Administration as tough on terror&#151;and achieved only a single conviction, which was then overturned.</font></li>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He has attacked the privacy of U.S. citizens, insisting on the right to peer into what we read in public libraries or on the internet or listen into our most private conversations without getting judicial approval or needing any proof of criminal activity.</font></li>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">His department issued a memorandum which was later leaked to the press that argued a legal basis for the U.S. to torture detainees in its prisons and detention centers abroad, from Guant&aacute;namo to Bagram to Abu Ghraib:  the results have been horrifyingly documented. </font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The next Attorney General should insist there be no government spying without a criminal &#147;probable cause,&#148; put an end to the divisive practice of religious and racial profiling, and restore dignity to the office.</font></p><p> </p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CCR President Michael Ratner said, &quot;Ashcroft has done more to destroy constitutional rights in this country, then any Attorney General in recent memory. From mass roundups to spying on first amendment activities, he has shredded basic rights. We are glad to see him go.&quot;</font></p>
