<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - August 24 - A new nationwide poll reveals strong opposition to church involvement in partisan politics, says Americans United for Separation of Church and State. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite aggressive efforts by some religious leaders and politicians to encourage greater political activity by houses of worship, a poll released today by the Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life shows that a solid majority of Americans are extremely wary of mixing organized religion with partisan politics. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The survey found that 65 percent of Americans oppose church endorsement of political candidates, 69 percent think it improper for political parties to ask congregations for their membership lists and 64 percent oppose the idea of Catholic bishops denying communion to politicians who fail to support church teachings on abortion and related issues.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Americans clearly do not want houses of worship to become pawns in the game of partisan politics,&quot; said the Rev. Barry W. Lynn, Americans United executive director. &quot;The message should be clear: keep partisan politics out of the sanctuary.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This survey is a strong rebuke to those misguided politicians and clergy who want to exploit religion for political purposes,&quot; Lynn continued. </font> </p><p></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
