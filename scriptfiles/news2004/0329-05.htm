<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - March 26 - On April 30, 2001, CNN reported that when the new Bush Administration released the government&#146;s annual terrorism report, it made a serious change: &#147;There was no extensive mention of alleged terrorist mastermind Osama bin Laden,&#148; as there had been in previous years. </FONT></p><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">When asked why the Administration had reduced the focus, &#147;a senior Bush State Department official told CNN the U.S. government made a mistake in focusing so much energy on bin Laden.&#148;</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The report directly contradicts the White House&#146;s continuing assertion that fighting terrorism was its &#147;top priority&#148; before September 11th.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The move to downgrade the fight against Al Qaeda before 9/11, despite repeated warnings that an Al Qaeda attack was imminent, is consistent with other Administration behavior. Specifically, the Associated Press reported in 2002 that &#147;President Bush&#146;s national security leadership met formally nearly 100 times in the months prior to the Sept. 11 attacks, yet terrorism was the topic during only two of those sessions.&#148; </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Meanwhile, Newsweek reported that internal government documents show that, before 9/11, the Bush Administration moved to &#147;de-emphasize&#148; counterterrorism. When  &#147;FBI officials sought to add hundreds more counterintelligence agents&#148; to deal with the problem, &#147;they got shot down&#148; by the White House, the magazine said.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">For full citations and links to the cited documents, visit: <A HREF="http://www.misleader.org" TARGET="_new">www.misleader.org</A>. </FONT> </P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
