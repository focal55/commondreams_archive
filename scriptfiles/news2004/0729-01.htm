<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BOSTON -July 28 - Author-filmmakers Michael Moore and Greg Palast joined with Representatives Corrine Brown (D-Jacksonville) and Peter Deutsch (D-Ft. Lauderdale) to demand steps, as Palast said, &quot;To prevent Republican hacks in Florida swiping the election of 2004 as they did four years ago.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At a press conference Wednesday morning before the Florida delegation to the Democratic Convention in Boston, Moore endorsed a bill introduced by Brown to make it easier for Congress to challenge an election tainted by apparent fraud.  </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Don't let them steal Florida again,&quot; said Palast, the investigative reporter who in 2000 first uncovered for BBC Television that Katherine Harris and Jeb Bush had wrongly removed tens of thousand of Black citizens from voter rolls.  Palast's reports on the theft of the elections are featured in Moore's film &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Palast has discovered that current lists of 47,000 &quot;felon&quot; voters which Florida has targeted for removal is at least 90% wrong.  &quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;These so-called criminals' only crime,&quot; said Palast, &quot;is VWD - voting while Democratic.&quot;   The &quot;purge&quot; list contains four Democrats for every Republican.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Palast pointed out such names on the lists as Thomas Cooper whose date of conviction is entered as January 30, 2007, &quot;a criminal of the future.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Earlier this month, after Palast testified before the US Civil Rights Commission in Washington, the CRC voted to ask the Justice Department to open a criminal investigation of the State of Florida's handling of voter rolls.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Palast's expos&eacute; of the &quot;fake felon purge&quot; for Harper's Magazine was nominated for a National Magazine Award in 2002. </font> </p><p></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
