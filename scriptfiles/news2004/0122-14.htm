<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - January 22 - We are extremely disappointed the Senate today approved a massive omnibus spending bill without including provisions to stop the Bush Administration from implementing a massive overtime pay cut for millions of America&#146;s workers. The Senate prematurely ended debate on a critical issue that could impact the financial security of working families across the country. </FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">We will continue to wage a national mobilization to block the Bush overtime pay cuts and we will consider every possible vehicle to block them. </FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Bush Administration has ignored a groundswell of opposition, including tens of thousands of public comments from economists as well as working Americans, hundreds of thousands of faxes and emails from individual workers and bipartisan votes by both houses of Congress. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Today&#146;s vote will galvanize workers who are appalled by the Administration&#146;s attempts to deprive them of fair compensation for extra hours on the job. Such hostility to the needs of working families cannot be tolerated.</FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
