<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - September 23 - <a href="http://www.winwithoutwarus.org/">Win Without War</a>, the national anti-Iraq war coalition whose members include<a href="http://www.moveon.org"> MoveOn.org</a>, <a href="http://www.truemajority.org">True Majority</a> and <a href="http://www.workingassets.com/">Working Assets</a>, launched a grass- roots campaign today calling for the public release of the National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) on Iraq. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">They began circulating an on-line petition late yesterday and asked members to phone their Senators today urging support for Senator Bob Graham's call for President Bush to release the document.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Late last week, the media reported that contents of the NIE analysis had been leaked which described conditions for stability and democracy in Iraq as "bleak." Public officials who have reviewed the estimate describe the document as painting a dark assessment of the prospects for Iraq.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> It presents three possible scenarios: worst case is that current developments will lead to civil war and regional instability; best case is that stability will remain tenuous. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The NIE report is the first on Iraq since 2002, represents the consensus view of all U.S. intelligence agencies, and was given to the President in July.

The document, prepared by the National Intelligence Council and approved by the National Intelligence Board, sharply contradicts the optimistic picture being presented by President Bush. Senator Bob Graham (D-Florida) told NPR that the report should, "pour a big bucket of cold water over the Bush administration's rosy views."
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
"President Bush has had this document since July but he persists in telling the American people a very different story. The first step in getting out of a quagmire is to recognize that you are in one. President Bush is apparently unwilling or unable to take that first step," said WWW National Director and Former US Congressman Tom Andrews.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Either President Bush is trying to deceive the American people about conditions in Iraq, or he is deluded about the reality there. I frankly don't know which is worse. Americans were spun into this war by the false claims of the President and his top officials. We badly need to hear the truth about how many more American soldiers' lives and how many more billions of dollars are at stake," Andrews added.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Today's speech by Interim Iraqi Prime Minister Ayad Allawi to a joint session of Congress is the most recent and desperate episode in the systematic deception of the American people," Andrews concluded. "The man was carrying water for his sponsor when he opened with a patently false statement: 'First, we are succeeding in Iraq.' What would failure look like?"</font></p>
