<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DENVER, CO - September 17- When Ralph Nader speaks in downtown Denver Saturday, Sept. 18, he’ll be greeted by beggars—but not the homeless variety.

 

Protestors will drop to their knees and beg Nader to drop out of the Presidential race.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

 

The “beg-in” protest will take place Sat., Sept. 18, at 4 p.m. in front in front of Tattered Cover in Lodo, 1628 16th Street (Wynkoop and the 16th Street Mall) where Nader will be doing a book signing.

 

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“If I thought Mr. Nader had a prayer of winning this election, I’d work for him and vote for him,” said Ken Seaman, who ran as a Green for Denver’s First Congressional Seat in 2000. “But since that’s not possible, I would ask that he withdraw from this race and improve the chances of Mr. Kerry becoming President. When you consider what this country might be like if Mr. Kerry were to lose this election, I think Nader has no choice but to withdraw and to throw his support to the Democrat.”

 

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the 2000 Presidential election, George W. Bush beat Al Gore by 537 votes in Florida, and Nader garnered over 97,000 votes, pulling enough votes from Gore to give Florida’s 27 Electoral College Votes—and the election—to Bush. But it’s less known that Bush won New Hampshire by 7,211 votes, giving him four Electoral College votes. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Gore would have won the presidency with these four votes, and Ralph Nader got exactly 22,188 votes in New Hampshire! Nationally, Nader got three percent of the popular vote in 2000, but he won enough votes in both Florida and New Hampshire to tip those states—and the election—to Bush.

 

Launched in July 2003, <a href="http://www.repentantnadervoter.com" target="_new">RepentantNaderVoter.com</a> PAC’s goal is to convince former Nader voters to vote for Kerry in 2004.</font></p>
