<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - March 18 - There will be a conference call news briefing Monday, March 22 at noon EST, to release &quot;Rethinking Growth Strategies: How State and Local Taxes and Services Affect Economic Development&quot; by economist Robert G. Lynch. Other participants include experts on state-level tax issues for Arizona, New York, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Oregon, and Washington.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In the scramble to lure businesses and jobs to their state, policymakers have operated for many years on the assumption that low taxes and business tax incentives make the best bait. A new study -- under embargo until 12:01 a.m. March 23, 2004 by the Economic Policy Institute -- offers strong evidence that such policies are neither the best nor the most cost-effective strategies for attracting businesses and creating jobs. Conversely, raising taxes to support public services can promote economic and jobs growth.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Rethinking Growth Strategies: How State and Local Taxes and Services Affect Economic Development&quot; by economist Robert G. Lynch provides a comprehensive overview of the current research into the factors that influence state economic growth. The result is a powerful refutation of the idea that cutting taxes and shrinking government and services will attract new businesses and create jobs. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">See full press release: <A HREF="http://www.epinet.org/newsroom/releases/2004/03/040323lynchbook.pdf" TARGET="_new">http://www.epinet.org/newsroom/releases/2004/03/040323lynchbook.pdf</A></FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
