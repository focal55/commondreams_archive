<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - May 6 - Pride At Work applauds the New York Times for adding gender identity or expression to the nondiscrimination section of its corporate H.R. policy.  This move by the company follows the adoption of the same language in the Times' union contract with the Newspaper Guild (CWA) last fall.  Labor Unions have a long history of protecting workers, and the work of the Newspaper Guild to uphold the rights of transgender employees is included in this tradition.  Protection of gender identity and expression in the union contract was a crucial catalyst, launching the company's initiative to add it to its own policy.  Addition of gender identity or expression to the New York Times Company corporate H.R. policy will include the other NYT corporateproperties- The Boston Globe and the Worcester Telegram, both of which are union shops.  </FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;It is energizing to see companies that are committed to maintaining a fair and safe work environment for all employees&quot; said Nancy Wohlforth, Co-President of Pride At Work, AFL-CIO.  &quot;Transgender workers often face ignorance, discrimination, and harassment on the job.  Gender identity and expression protection clauses in union contracts are one way to combat bias, but for a company to voluntarily incorporate protections in their own guidelines is proof that the union's work has been effective.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The New York Times has a solid reputation as one of the greatest newspapers in the world.  Pride At Work hopes that other newspapers will follow their lead and add these essential non-discrimination protections to their corporate policies. </FONT> </P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
