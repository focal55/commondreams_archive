<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - February 9 - The National Youth and Student Peace Coalition says the historic FBI-issued subpoenas to Drake University and peace activists in Iowa prove civil liberties are under attack, and demonstrate the urgency for a 2nd national youth and student Books Not Bomb Day of Action on Thursday, March 4.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;When the government intimidates people expressing their opinions non-violently in Iowa, the civil rights of all Americans are being questioned,&quot; said Joseph Truong, a spokesperson of the National Youth and Student Peace Coalition (NYSPC).  &quot;How can we truthfully say we want to foster civil and human rights abroad when they are being challenged here in the U.S.?&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">On February 4, a FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force issued a subpoena to Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa, seeking all records concerning a November 15, 2003, anti-war conference at the school.  This subpoena marks the first time in recent memory that a grand jury has investigated the political activity of an anti-war organization.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;As the election season draws closer, and Bush's approval ratings continue to drop, the Bush Administration seems to grow more desperate,&quot; says Lenore Palladino, a National Youth and Student Peace Coalition activist. &quot;However, these scare tactics will not be successful. Young people will continue to organize and on March 4, we will take our case directly to the public, demanding a repeal of USA Patriot Act provisions and an end to the abuses of civil liberties that has occurred under the Bush Administration.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">NYSPC says that government surveillance and repression of social justice activists has grown more vigorous.  United for Peace and Justice released memos in November showing the federal government has been engaged in a coordinated, nationwide surveillance operation of the US anti-war movement for the past two years.  In addition, during last year's March 5 student and youth day of action, NYSPC reports that nationwide at least 300 youth were suspended, 151 were arrested and 2 schools were locked down in response to the event.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><I>Founded in response to the September 11th attack, the National Youth and Student Peace Coalition (<A HREF="http://www.nyspc.net" TARGET="_new">www.nyspc.net</A>) represents youth and students from 18 national and regional organizations which empower young people to take action for peace and justice in their communities.</I></FONT></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
