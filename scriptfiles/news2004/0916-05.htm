<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - September 16 - President Bush recently called for exit exams for all high school students despite contradictory statements by his own campaign. In response, the Children's Defense Fund (CDF) urged the President to clarify his position and actively oppose the implementation of this unwise, high-stakes testing proposal. Instead of mandating exit exams, we should ensure that all children have the resources they need to succeed in high school and rely on a broader range of academic indicators in measuring high school students achievement. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Everyone wants to see our education system improve,&quot; said Jill Morningstar, Co-Director of Education and Youth Development at CDF. &quot;But if the current testing policy is adopted nationally, we will see higher dropout rates, higher rates of student disengagement, and an inordinate amount of classroom time spent preparing for the exit exam &#151; especially for low-income minority youth. This is the wrong direction for Americas students.&quot; </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Professional standards for educational testing, test publishers, and an overwhelming body of research suggest that a single test should not be the sole determinant when making important decisions about students.Over-reliance on a single test in academic settings can have a significant negative effect on learning, and all children need to be provided with the same opportunity to learn the material covered on assessments before they are punished for not passing them. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">True reform is in jeopardy if students are not given the tools they need to succeed. Morningstar noted that at the same time that the President is proposing to require more testing, he is under-funding his own No Child Left Behind Act by $9.4 billion. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">More Information:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="http://www.childrensdefense.org/education/exitexams.pdf" target="_new">High School Exit Exams: Quick Facts </a>(Adobe PDF : 3 pages : 155 KB)</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="http://www.childrensdefense.org/data/nclb_underfunding.asp" target="_new">No Child Left Behind Title I Underfunding</a> (Fiscal Year 2005) How much would your district receive under the Bush budget compared to how much your district would receive if the No Child Left Behind Act were fully funded?</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
