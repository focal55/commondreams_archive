<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - June 3 - Representatives Waters (D-CA), Leach (R-IA), Frank (D-MA), Bachus (R-AL) and Lee (D-CA) introduced the JUBILEE Act today into the House of Representatives.  The JUBILEE Act is groundbreaking legislation that would require the U.S. Treasury to work in appropriate multilateral settings to achieve 100 percent cancellation of the debts of 50 nations by the International Monetary Fund. The IMF would be required to finance the cancellation from their own resources without harmful conditionality. </FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The JUBILEE Act will help build a better, safer world by providing impoverished nations the fresh start necessary for development,&quot; said Marie Clarke, National Coordinator of Jubilee USA Network. &quot;The cancellation of debts owed to the IMF would remove a major impediment to poverty eradication and economic growth in Asia, Africa and Latin America and enable the nations to invest their own resources in health care, education, and poverty reduction.&quot; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Jubilee USA Network applauds the prophetic action of these five Congress people who have demonstrated their political, spiritual and moral courage to call for the IMF to do their fair share of debt cancellation,&quot; Clarke said. &quot;We face the greatest health crises in our times, a crisis that threatens the very survival of the global community. Without full debt cancellation, AIDS will continue to be a death sentence for the developing world.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The introduction of the JUBILEE Act is timed to coincide with the G-8 summit next week  in Sea Island, Ga. The G-8 are likely to address the issue of the debt crisis faced by impoverished nations. UK Prime Minister Tony Blair and Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown are proposing an extension of the World Bank and IMF's debt relief scheme, the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries' Initiative and the extension of debt relief to countries that have not yet benefited from the program. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Jubilee USA Network argues that rather than taking small steps with this failed program, we must follow the lead of sponsors of the JUBILEE Act and commit to a lasting solution to the debt crisis and leverage 100 percent cancellation of the external debt of the most impoverished nations by the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank as well as all other significant bi-lateral creditors.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Jubilee USA calls on the G-8 to adopt the call for 100 percent cancellation by the IMF of the fifty eligible countries as a part of their strategy to resolve the debt crisis,&quot; stated Clarke.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The IMF will respond to the call for 100 percent cancellation by pleading poverty. But reports by British accounting firms, and just last fall by Jubilee Research in the UK have shown that the World Bank and IMF have enough resources to cancel 100 percent of the Heavily Indebted Poor Country debts without any impact on their credit rating or ability to lend, and could probably expand to cover cancellation for many countries outside the HIPC Initiative.</FONT></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
