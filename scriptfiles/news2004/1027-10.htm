<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NEW YORK, NY -- October 27 -- Urge Columbia University to restore academic integrity and end the harassment of dissenting students and faculty</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Columbia University students will unveil a controversial, disturbing documentary, today, which reveals academic abuse and student intimidation at Columbia University.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The film, Columbia Unbecoming, was produced for a group of Columbia University students by the David Project, a non-profit educational organization. The screening begins at 10 a.m. in the Regency Room of the Grand Hyatt Hotel on 42nd Street between Lexington and Park Aves.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The documentary features interviews with students who share their experiences and feelings about professors and campus events relating to the Middle East conflict.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Columbia student Ariel Beery comments: &quot;What we have here is a clear case of abuse of professional power, of intimidation of students, done for political ends. The politics are irrelevant -- the abuse is relevant. Some students here are fearful of expressing dissenting views or complaining against professors, and the Administration has yet to deal with the problem sufficiently.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another student observes in the film, &quot;Harassing students because they express pro-Israel views or are identifiably Israeli should be treated no differently than harassment of students because they're black or gay.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Students are asking the Administration to:</b></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- adopt a zero-tolerance policy on campus against intimidation and harassment, with clear consequences for violators;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- ensure academic integrity and an intellectually-diverse faculty in the Middle East studies department; and</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- adopt a single standard of sensitivity for all minorities and ethnic groups on campus.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For more information, visit <a href="http://www.davidproject.org/" target="_new">http://www.davidproject.org</a>.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
