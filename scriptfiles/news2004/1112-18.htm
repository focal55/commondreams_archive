<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NORT ATLANTIC -- November 12 -- Activists from the Greenpeace ship, Esperanza, have stopped an EU bottom trawling vessel from operating on the high seas of the North Atlantic.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Three activists boarded the Lithuanian flagged ?Anuva? and unfurled banners reading &quot;Stop deep sea plunder&quot;. They occupied the nets of the trawler as well as climbing onto the trawl nets doors. The action prevented the vessel from re-setting the nets and from carrying out further high seas destruction.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Whole habitats are being ripped up from depths of 1000 metres just for the sake of a few fish. This deep sea plunder is wiping out unknown worlds, including ancient coral. The destruction is unnecessary and what's worse, irreparable,&quot; Greenpeace Campaigner Dima Litvinov said, from the Esperanza.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Anuva is a Lithuanian flagged ship owned and operated out of Spain. It has a sordid history of flag -hopping and illegal fishing. &quot;The Anuva has the distinction have of having been de-flagged by Belize, a well known flag of convenience state,&quot; Litvinov said.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The EU, and the North East Atlantic Fisheries Council have been meeting in London this week and should be ashamed to have such a vessel fishing in their waters. It is a prime example of how poorly regulated high seas fisheries are.&quot; Greenpeace Campaigner Sebastian Losada said.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bottom-trawling boats, in the majority from EU countries, drag fishing gear weighing several tonnes across the sea bed, destroying everything in their path including marine wildlife such as coral and devastating life on underwater mountains - or `seamounts'.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The United Nations General Assembly meets in New York next week to debate the future of the high seas. Greenpeace is calling for the UN to impose an immediate moratorium on all deep sea bottom trawling on the high seas. A resolution on the issue is expected on Tuesday 16th November.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The activists launched the action from the Greenpeace MV Esperanza, which has been investigating and documenting bottom trawling in the North Atlantic for the past five weeks. Seamounts in this area run from the south of Iceland to the Azores and form the world's largest mountain range.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Greenpeace is an independent campaigning organisation that uses non-violent, creative confrontation to expose global environmental problems and to force solutions that are essential to a green and peaceful future.</i><br></font> </p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
