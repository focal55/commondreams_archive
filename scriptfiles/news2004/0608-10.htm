<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - June 8 - The PEN USA First Amendment Action Committee is concerned with the recent detentions and deportations of several foreign journalists at the Los Angeles International Airport.  </FONT></p><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Earlier this month, a British reporter was handcuffed, detained, and then deported, drawing criticism from Reporters Without Borders (RWB), an international journalists&#146; watchdog group.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Freelance reporter Elena Lappin failed to produce a press visa upon her arrival at LAX, leading airport officials to handcuff her and take her to a detention center.  She was subsequently deported.  Reporters Without Borders contends that a dozen other foreign correspondents, including six French reporters, were treated in a similar fashion at the Los Angeles airport.  </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Lappin told The Los Angeles Times: &quot;I felt subhuman.  I was treated like a criminal, handcuffed, fingerprinted and mug shots were taken. I suddenly had no rights. It was very, very humiliating.&quot;</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Reporters Without Borders has also criticized the detention and deportation of two international reporters in New York City, fearing that these cases represent a larger crackdown by U.S. authorities against the international media.  </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Tala Dowlatshahi, the U.S. representative for Reporters Without Borders, claims that the treatment is &#147;a deliberate restriction of press freedom.&#148;  He adds that that the reporters&#146; group has &#147;been gravely concerned about new Homeland Security restrictions, not only on journalists but on other individuals and communities that have been targeted in a country that prides itself on democratic freedoms.&#148;  The Secretary General of Reporters Without Borders, Robert Menard, personally wrote U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge condemning the alleged treatment of Lappin and her peers.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Border protection and customs officials have attempted to deflect this criticism, citing that foreign reporters were not being singled out for expulsion, that instead, it was part of a larger policy intended to increase U.S. security.  Ana Hinojosa, the director for U.S. Customs and Border Protection at LAX contends that &#147;It&#146;s not about the occupation of a passenger that&#146;s coming to the United States, we are concerned that every foreigner has the proper visa to enter the country.&#148;  </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Hinojosa explained that the requirement for the press visa dates back to 1952, and that border officials have begun enforcing it a requirement for foreign journalists after the 9/11.  Menard countered that the policy is &quot;arbitrary if not discriminatory.&quot;</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">PEN USA&#146;s First Amendment Action Committee is concerned with the allegations of foreign reporter harassment at U.S. airports.  Security concerns should not infringe on the ability of international reporters to do their jobs, and these reporters should not be treated disrespectfully or deported for committing minor errors. Such a policy reflects badly on the United State&#146;s commitment to our First Amendment and the freedom of the press worldwide.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">As a member of International PEN&#146;s Writers in Prison committee, PEN USA works to secure the release and to support the families of writers of conscience around the world.  PEN USA&#146;s First Amendment Action Committee, the fastest growing committee at PEN USA, works to support freedom of speech and to protect the First Amendment in the United States.</FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
