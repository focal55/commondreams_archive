<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - August 19 - The Sierra Club announced today that it will fund a new bi-national effort to address devastating lead contamination caused by the American Smelting and Refinery Company (ASARCO) in El Paso and Cuidad Ju&aacute;rez.  The Organizaci&oacute;n Popular Independiente, A.C. and the El Paso Group of the Sierra Club are among 10 environmental projects receiving grants awarded by the Sierra Club&#146;s Beyond the Borders - Mexico Project, which works to strengthen grassroots environmental and community groups in Mexico.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During ASARCO&#146;s 112 years of operation it emitted hundreds of tons of lead, arsenic and cadmium, contaminating neighborhoods in both El Paso and Ju&aacute;rez. The El Paso and Ju&aacute;rez groups will coordinate a bi-national effort to raise public awareness of health and environmental problems in the area around the smelter and to ensure that public and industry officials are held accountable for clean up.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Pollution doesn&#146;t recognize borders,&quot; said Jenny Mart&iacute;nez, Sierra Club Program Officer. &quot;To ensure healthy air, land and water we must work together bi-nationally.  We cannot protect our shared environment unless we develop effective relationships between Mexican community groups and Sierra Club members along the border.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The following groups also received funding for activities ranging from ensuring safe drinking water, to training rural farmers in agro-ecology techniques, and combating illegal dumping and garbage burning.  Five of the 10 projects are based in border cities:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Aqua XXI, A.C. in Ciudad Ju&aacute;rez, Chihuahua; Centro de Estudios Fronterizos y de Promoci&oacute;n de los Derechos Humanos, A.C. in Ciudad Reynosa, Tamaulipas; Cobanares Federaci&oacute;n Estatal de Sociedades de Solidaridad Social in Ciudad Obreg&oacute;n, Sonora; Consultor&iacute;a T&eacute;cnica Comunitaria, A.C. in Chihuahua, Chihuahua; Instituto Fronterizo de Estudios para el Desarrollo, A.C. in Matamoros, Tamualipas; Organizaci&oacute;n de Comunidades Pro-Vida Digna in Matamoros, Tamaulipas; Red Fronteriza de Salud y Ambiente, A.C. in Hermosillo, Sonora; Asociaci&oacute;n Ecol&oacute;gica Santo Tom&aacute;s, A.C. in Villahermosa, Tabasco; Instituto Sexto Sol de Acci&oacute;n Comunitaria in Motozintla, Chiapas. See project summaries below.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Too many U.S. companies have taken their polluting factories south of the border,&quot; said Stephen Mills, Director of the Sierra Club&#146;s International Program.  &quot;Communities on both sides of the border have the right to a clean environment, so the message we&#146;re sending to the polluters with these grants is that you can run but you cannot hide.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The application deadline for the next round of grants is October 15, 2004. Mexican and Sierra Club border groups interested in applying for Beyond the Border - Mexico Project grants can find the application and grant guidelines by visiting the Sierra Club&#146;s bilingual web page: <a href="http://www.sierraclub.org/beyondtheborders/mexico/grant.asp" target="_new">www.sierraclub.org/beyondtheborders/mexico/grant.asp</a></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In February of 2001, the Sierra Club&#146;s Board of Directors met with local groups in Brownsville, Texas, and Matamoros, Tamaulipas to assess the environmental damage inflicted by the rapid industrialization of the border. The visit prompted the creation of a multi-year project to support Mexican grassroots environmental and community organizations in their fight for environmental justice. In partnership with The Sierra Club Foundation, the Sierra Club&#146;s Beyond the Borders - Mexico Project, including its grant component, was created.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Beyond the Borders &#150; Mexico Project                             Fall 2004 Grantees</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Organization: AQUA XX</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Project Name:  &quot;Continuation: Environmental monitoring and participatory strategies for improving the environment and health in the Colonia Ricardo Flores Mag&oacute;n&quot; Location: Ciudad Ju&aacute;rez, Chihuahua, M&eacute;xico</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This project provides residents with the knowledge and tools to find their own solutions to poor environmental and health conditions in the Colonia Flores Mag&oacute;n.  Residents requested that AQUA XXI use this participatory model because of its success in other colonias.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Organization: Centro de Estudios Fronterizos y de Promoci&oacute;n de los Derechos Humanos, A.C.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Project: &quot;Continuation: Raising Public Awareness and Environmental Justice in the Northeast Border of Mexico&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Location: Reynosa, Tamaulipas, M&eacute;xico</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This project promotes human and environmental rights on the border.

This is the second phase of a previous Beyond the Borders - Mexico grant project, which trained 18 women from local organizations to be local environmental health promoters.  The training helped residents connect local environmental quality and family health.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Organization: CONTEC - Consultor&iacute;a T&eacute;cnica Comunitaria, A.C.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Project: &quot;Social Participation and Technological Change in the Sierra Tarahumara&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Location: Chihuahua, Chihuahua, M&eacute;xico</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Over the last two winters in workshops funded by the Beyond the Borders - Mexico Project, CONTEC helped ejido farmers develop ecological codes, provided information on soil and water conservation, the use of sustainable farm technology, and community development based on the realities of indigenous institutions and culture.  The current grant will fund the production of three manuals compiling information from the workshops for farmers, community outreach workers, technicians, and teachers.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Organization:  Instituto Fronterizo de Esutdios para el Desarrollo, A.C.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Project: &quot;Continuation: Center for Community Organization and Participation&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Location: Matamoros, Tamaulipas, M&eacute;xico</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With a Beyond the Borders grant last year, this group established a Community Training and Organization Center where people living in and around landfills (pepenadores) have found a practical use for the thousands of tires that are dumped each year by making soles for huarache sandals from them.  The center provides training for residents and has supported the formation of a cooperative.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Organization:  Organizaci&oacute;n de Comunidades Pro-Vida Digna</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Project: &quot;Continuation: Reforestation and Cleanup of 20 de noviembre Drain&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Location: Matamoros, Tamaulipas, M&eacute;xico</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This project will continue the reforestation around the 20 de noviembre drainage system, the management and promotion of cleanup by the relevant municipal authorities, and continue work with surrounding communities.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Organization: Red Fronteriza de Salud y Ambiente, A.C.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Project: &quot;Community Monitoring of Sonora River Water Quality&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Location: Hermosillo, Sonora, M&eacute;xico</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Sonora river watershed is the principal source of water for the residents of Hermosillo (capital of the state of Sonora) and the semi-desert zone of Sonora. The watershed is being contaminated by polluted runoff from sewage and agricultural and mining activities.  This project will provide environmental education to 14 high schools in 8 municipalities of the Sonora river region. Through public education RFSA hopes to pressure the relevant authorities to clean up the river and hold the polluters accountable.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Organization: Asociaci&oacute;n Ecol&oacute;gica Santo Tom&aacute;s A.C.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Project: &quot;Community Environmental School in Southeastern Mexico&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Location: Villahermosa, Tabasco, M&eacute;xico</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Asociaci&oacute;n Ecol&oacute;gica Santo Tom&aacute;s is working with the communities that are negatively affected by the petroleum drilling and processing plants that have surged in the region since the signing of NAFTA.  The communities have organized themselves, forming Environmental Watch Groups, and have confronted the polluting entities with varying degrees of success.  This project will provide training in environmental laws and regulations so that the community groups have the tools and knowledge to demand accountability from the industries that are not complying with the established laws and the authorities who are not being held accountable for enforcing the laws.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Organization: Instituto Sexto Sol de Acci&oacute;n Comunitaria</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Project: &quot;Sustainable Food Production: Permanent facilities to promote Sustainable Agriculture, Environmental Education and Reforestation&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Location: Motozintla, Chiapas, M&eacute;xico</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This project provides permaculture and organic horticulture training free of charge to small-scale peasant farmers, students, health promoters and other community members as a way to eradicate malnutrition and promote economic self-sufficiency.  The farm shows government agencies that food self-sufficiency can be better achieved through the diversification of crops produced without chemicals rather than the old green-revolution method of relying on chemical fertilizers, herbicides and insecticides. The project also supports community access to education as an important means of reducing poverty and empowering people to conserve natural resources.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">El Paso Group of the Sierra Club; Rio Grande Chapter</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Project: Lead Contamination Accountability Project</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Location:  El Paso, Texas</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Lead Contamination Accountability Project will address lead and arsenic contamination in residential areas on both sides of the US-Mexico border around a smelter operated by American Smelting and Refinery Company of El Paso (ASARCO).

The project will determine the breadth and scope of the health problems in the community, form a neighborhood committee of community promoters and recognized community leaders, provide training on environmental health and social leadership, and with the participation of the Sierra Club group in El Paso, develop public awareness campaigns within the communities and identify and solidify local networks of leaders and activists.</font></p><p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">###</font></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
