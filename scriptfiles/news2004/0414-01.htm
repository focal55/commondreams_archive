<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - April 14 - On APRIL 13TH 2004 	President Bush failed again to answer the one most crucial question that is on the minds of most Americans:  &quot;When will our troops come home from Iraq?&quot;   Ohio Congressman Dennis J. Kucinich says Bush promised more of the same no-end-in-sight vision that has marked this unjustified and illegitimate war from the beginning.</FONT></p><P>	<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The President's answers to questions about how long our forces will remain were as vague as ever and wholly predictable,&quot;   Kucinich emphasized.  The President's statements that, &quot;We'll stay the course. We'll complete the job.  We must not waiver.   The United States will continue to occupy - his word - Iraq as long as necessary,&quot; makes it clear that this election is about world leadership and who is telling the truth to the American people.  &quot;It is not George W. Bush,&quot; says the Democratic Presidential challenger.</FONT></P><P>	 <FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Bush is prepared to escalate American involvement in the region,&quot; says Kucinich.   &quot;This administration is going to sacrifice the lives of our soldiers.&quot;   The statements made by this President are alarming.   &quot;If more troops are needed,&quot; Bush said.  &quot;He will send them. Any concession or retreat,&quot; he went on, &quot;will embolden the enemy.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">	Kucinich has some questions for the President.   &quot;When will Bush realize that our very presence in Iraq has become a lightning rod for increased hostility and increased violence?&quot;   The economic impact is profound.  &quot;We can't afford to stay the course.  We need a new course - a reasoned and responsible way out, not a political rationalization for keeping our troops at risk indefinitely, and sending even more troops into harm's way.&quot;</FONT></P><P>	<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Given the President's unhesitating willingness to send more and more of our young men and women to a war that was launched on lies and exaggerations, how long will it be before he resorts to a reinstatement of the draft to feed the demands of a thoroughly flawed and totally failed foreign policy?&quot; The Ohio Congressman who lead the vote against the invasion is emphatic, &quot;We went to war for the wrong reasons.  We continue to be at war for the wrong reasons.  And it's time to ask the United Nations to assume responsibility so our troops can come home!   This can only come about when the US takes an entirely new direction, reconnecting with the world community through the United Nations, letting go of ambitions to control the oil and the contracts, trying to privatize Iraq, and run the government by remote control.&quot;</FONT></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
