<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - August 16 -</font><font style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Today, civic leaders and elected officials across the country called on 
President George W. Bush and Senator John Kerry to participate in the 
presidential debates proposed by the genuinely nonpartisan Citizens&#8217; Debate 
Commission and to reject the presidential debates proposed by the unsuitable 
Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD), after a Federal Court on Thursday 
ordered the Federal Election Commission to open a full investigation into 
whether the CPD acted in a &#8220;partisan manner&#8221; when sponsoring the 2000 
presidential debates.</font><P style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in"><font style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On Thursday, 
August 12, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, Judge Henry H. 
Kennedy, Jr., found that the FEC acted &#8220;contrary to law&#8221; in dismissing a 
complaint claiming that the CPD is a partisan organization and, therefore, 
ineligible under federal election law to sponsor presidential debates. (A copy 
of the decision can be found at </font><font color="#0000ff" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><U><A 
href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/04-731.pdf"><FONT style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/04-731.pdf</FONT></A></U></font><font style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">) This ruling casts a dark cloud over the 
legitimacy of the CPD to sponsor the upcoming 2004 debates,&#8221; said Jason Adkins, 
co-lead counsel for the plaintiffs It is time for the CPD to step aside and 
allow a truly non-partisan organization sponsor the national presidential 
debates in accordance with federal law.</font></P><P style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in"><font style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Today, the 
truly nonpartisan Citizens&#8217; Debate Commission sent official invitations to the 
Bush/Cheney and Kerry/Edwards campaigns for the nominees to participate in five 
legally sound presidential debates and one legally sound vice-presidential 
debate at colleges and universities around the country. The invitations  
available at<B> </B></font><font color="#0000ff" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><U><A

including former FEC General Counsel Larry Noble, Ambassador Alan Keyes, Tom 
Gerety of the Brennan Center for Justice, Heritage Foundation co-founder Paul 
Weyrich, former television talk show host Phil Donahue, Jehmu Greene of Rock the 
Vote, Congressman Ron Paul (R-TX), Bay Buchanan of the American Cause, former 
Senator Eugene McCarthy, executive producer of the 1996 presidential debates Bob 
Asman, TransAfrica Forum founder Randall Robinson, Tony Perkins of the Family 
Research Council, Tom Fitton of Judicial Watch, Stuart Comstock-Gay of the 
National Voting Rights Institute, Joan Mandle of Democracy Matters, Norman Dean 
of Friends of the Earth, former Congressman and chair of the Center for Voting 
and Democracy John B. Anderson, Nick Nyhart of Public Campaign, and Harvard Law 
professor Jon Hanson.&nbsp; </font></P><P style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#8220;<FONT style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">For the sake 
of democracy and voter education, the nonpartisan Citizens&#8217; Debate Commission 
must replace the bipartisan CPD, which fails to comply with federal law and 
fails to serve voters&#8217; interests,&#8221; said George Farah, executive director of Open 
Debates and a member of the Citizens Debate Commission. </FONT></font></P><P style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in"><font style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since 1988, 
negotiators for the Republican and Democratic nominees have jointly drafted 
secret debate contracts that dictated precisely how the debates would be run &#8211; 
from selecting who would ask the questions, to decreeing who would participate. 
Co-chaired by the former heads of the Republican and Democratic parties, the CPD 
implemented and concealed those contracts, shielding the major party candidates 
from public criticism. As a result, the presidential debates have been reduced 
to glorified bipartisan news conferences, and viewership has plummeted, with 
twenty-five million <I>fewer</I> Americans watching the 2000 presidential 
debates than watching the 1992 presidential debates.</font></P><P style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in"><font style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Aspiring to 
reverse the decline in debate viewership, the Citizens&#8217; Debate Commission has 
invited the major party candidates to participate in debates that would feature 
engaging formats, address a variety of pressing national issues, and include 
third-party challengers that a majority of eligible voters want included, if any 
meet such criteria. The nonpartisan Citizens&#8217; Debate Commission, which has been 
endorsed by the <I>Los Angeles Times </I>and other major newspapers, is 
comprised of seventeen national civic leaders from the left, center and right of 
political spectrum, and sixty diverse civic organizations serve on its Advisory 
Board. </font></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
