- January 8 - The American Public Health Association (APHA) is calling on federal, state and local governments and public health agencies to institute a &quot;precautionary moratorium&quot; on the construction of Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) because of health concerns. The new policy statement, passed at the organization's national meeting in November, was only recently posted to its web site. It also urges immediate funding of new research to better understand the exposures of communities, particularly children, to pollutants from CAFOs.</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">An estimated 54 percent of U.S. livestock are now confined on only five percent of livestock farms. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, CAFOs are defined as more than 1,000 beef cattle, 2,500 hogs, and 100,000 broiler hens. CAFOs generate an estimated 575 billion pounds of manure annually. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;CAFO environments make workers sick, and pose public health risks to children and other vulnerable people living nearby,&quot; said David Wallinga, MD, director of the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy's Food and Health Program. &quot;This landmark policy says that we shouldn't add to the problems by building more CAFOs.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">APHA cited numerous studies documenting serious health problems among CAFO workers, including respiratory problems and effects on neurologic function. CAFO generated manure can contain constituents and byproducts of health concern including heavy metals, antibiotics, pathogen bacteria, nitrogen and phosphorus, as well as dust, mold, bacterial endotoxins and volatile gases. CAFO-generated manure is typically stored in open or covered pits or lagoons and later spread or sprayed untreated on nearby cropland, posing additional risks to public health.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Runoff from manure-applied fields can carry human pathogens into surface waters, which often serve as drinking water sources, according to the APHA statement. Epidemiology studies have linked several outbreaks involving these pathogens to livestock waste. Manure land application in excess of the land&#146;s absorptive capacity also can lead to excess nitrogen and phosphorus in soil, eutrophication of surface waters and algae overgrowthincluding some algae producing human toxins. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The world's largest public health organization has now weighed in,&quot; said Robert Lawrence, M.D. of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. &quot;We know enough science to stop continuing to build more of these meat factories that are miserable for animals, and which make people ill.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The APHA 2003 policy statement #7 on CAFOs can be read in full at: <A HREF="http://www.apha.org/legislative/policy/2003/2003-007.pdf" TARGET="_new">http://www.apha.org/legislative/policy/2003/2003-007.pdf</A></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In November, the Institute for Agriculture and Trade and the Global Resource Action Center for the Environment (GRACE) launched a web site (<A HREF="http://www.eatwellguide.org" TARGET="_new">www.eatwellguide.org</A>) that connects consumers with sources of meat and poultry that has been raised by non-confinement and without routine antibiotic use.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><I>The Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy promotes resilient family farms, rural communities and ecosystems around the world through research and education, science and technology, and advocacy.</I></FONT></P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p></font><!-- #EndEditable -->
