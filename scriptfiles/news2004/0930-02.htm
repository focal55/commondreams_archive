<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - September 30 - Today marks the end of federal fiscal year 2004 and nearly $1.1 billion in federal funds previously allocated for the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) will be taken back from the states and returned to the U.S. Treasury. The following is the statement of Ron Pollack, Executive Director of Families USA, about the SCHIP funds:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The President made lofty statements, in the limelight of the Republican convention, about the need for expanding children's health coverage. At midnight tonight, however, with no fanfare, his Administration will withdraw $1.1 billion from the states that had been earmarked for that very purpose - funds that could have provided health coverage for approximately 750,000 uninsured children. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The President now promises to develop a national campaign to inform families about the State Children's Health Insurance Program. But it makes little sense to inform families about the program if there are inadequate funds available to serve them. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The 8.4 million children who are currently uninsured deserve more compassionate attention and care than what will happen tonight. The loss of these funds will prevent low-income children from receiving the health care they so very much need.&quot; </font></p><p></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
