CACI, which has 27 interrogators working under Army command in Iraq, has taken a defiant stance on Taguba's allegations. ... Last year, CACI earned $507 million in IT revenues from the government, making it the country's seventeenth-largest federal IT contractor -- behind the multibillion-dollar leaders Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman but ahead of prominent contractors like Halliburton, Bechtel and AT&amp;T. Sixty-five percent of its revenues came from the Defense Department. ... CACI has friends in high places, including Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage -- a CACI director and consultant from 1999 to 2001, when he joined the Bush administration. ... When he was elected a CACI director in 1999, Armitage was a member of the Pentagon's Defense Policy Board and president of Armitage Associates, a consulting firm with a long list of powerful clients that included Boeing, Unocal, Texaco, Goldman Sachs and the Brown &amp; Root subsidiary of Halliburton.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">MUNA HIJAZI, <A HREF="mailto:endlesswar@thieves.org">endlesswar@thieves.org</A>, <A HREF="http://defendersfje.tripod.com/defendersonline/" TARGET="_new">http://defendersfje.tripod.com/defendersonline/</A></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Hijazi is an organizer with the Virginia Anti-War Coalition.

The Post reported: &quot;If accepted by Prime Minister Ayad Allawi, it would put the highly visible U.S. foreign contractors into a special legal category, not subject to military justice and beyond the reach of Iraq's justice system. ... Two U.S. contract employees at Abu Ghraib prison who were accused in a Pentagon report of participating in illegal abuse of Iraqi prisoners ... have not been charged with any crimes in Iraq or the United States. ... Estimates of the total number of foreigners working here -- from Americans to South Africans to Chileans -- have ranged from 20,000 to 30,000.&quot; <A HREF="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A39159-2004Jun13" TARGET="_new">www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A39159-2004Jun13</A>.</FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
