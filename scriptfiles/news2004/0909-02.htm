<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - September 9 - In honor of the more than 1,000 U.S. soldiers who have been killed in Iraq as of this week, some 700 peace vigils will be held throughout the United States tonight. In hundreds of cities, including New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Orlando, Salt Lake City, Philadelphia, Columbus, Des Moines, Honolulu, and Washington, DC, people will gather to mourn the more than one thousand young Americans who have died in Iraq, almost seven thousand who are maimed, and tens of thousands of Iraqis who have died. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The President won't mourn our dead, but we will,&#148; said Andrea Buffa of the women&#146;s peace group CODEPINK. &#147;Tonight, we will mourn for all the people who&#146;ve been killed in Iraq, and also call for an end to this tragic occupation, and for our troops to be brought home now.&#148;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The vigils were organized within 48 hours of the news that the death toll for U.S. soldiers in Iraq had hit 1,0000, by some of the largest peace coalitions in the United States - United for Peace and Justice, which has more than 800 member groups around the country, and Win Without War, whose members include Moveon.org and the National Council of Churches. Some of the vigils are being organized by groups like CODEPINK: Women for Peace, Military Families Speak Out, and Veterans For Peace, and are expected to draw hundreds of people; others are being organized by individuals in small towns where handfuls of people will gather by candlelight to reflect on the needless loss of life that has been caused by the Iraq war.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In New York City, the largest vigil will take place at Columbus Circle and is being organized by United for Peace and Justice and CODEPINK. In Washington, DC, the main vigil will take place in Lafayette Park. In San Francisco, the largest vigil will be at United Nations Plaza. In Los Angeles, at Wilshire and Veteran, in front of the federal building.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A full list of the peace vigils planned for this evening is available at <a href="http://action.moveon.org/vigil/index.html" target="_new">http://action.moveon.org/vigil/index.html</a></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
