<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - April 21 - Over 1,600 buses carrying tens of thousands of pro-choice Americans will arrive in Washington, DC in the next few days &#150; and travelers are ready to give the government a piece of their minds. </FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">NARAL Pro-Choice America, the nation&#146;s leading advocate for personal privacy and a woman&#146;s right to choose, mixed new technologies and old-fashioned grass-roots organizing to encourage members of America&#146;s pro-choice majority to participate in the March for Women&#146;s Lives and send a message to our public officials that we will not let our fundamental rights be taken away. And concerned pro-choice citizens heeded the call. The excitement is building up and down the east coast &#150; all buses are sold out in New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Maine and Vermont. Within the Beltway, the NARAL Pro-Choice America Action Center located at 12th &amp; F Streets, NW &#150; across from Metro Center -- has registered over 3,500 marchers &#150; literally from off the street.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Aiding in the mobilization efforts are almost 1,000 NARAL Pro-Choice America volunteers trained in phone banking, crowd canvassing and organizing 101. 150 volunteers have converged at the Action Center in recent days to glue thousands of placards onto cardboard handles &#150; the signs declaring &#147;It&#146;s Your Choice &#133; Not Theirs,&#148; will be carried by NARAL Pro-Choice America marchers on the day of the March.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Kate Michelman, President of NARAL Pro-Choice America said, &#147;What these numbers show is that when pro-choice Americans learn what is at stake, they take action to protect their rights. We will send George Bush and his anti-choice allies a strong message on April 25th - when it comes to private medical decisions, we decide &#150; not them.&#148;</FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
