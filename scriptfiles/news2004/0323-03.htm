<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - March 23 - MoveOn.org will release a hard hitting television ad campaign -- co-sponsored with the Environmental Working Group Action Fund and print ad campaign -- co-sponsored with Natural Resources Defense Council against the President's proposed ten year mercury cleanup delay at a Washington press conference this Friday, where top experts will outline the threat to children exposed to mercury in utero and in their tuna and other fish sandwiches. </FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The TV ad will feature a poison symbol morphing into a happy face on a child's lunchbox - illustrating the President's decision to classify mercury as less hazardous under the Clean Air Act, so he can delay a previously scheduled cleanup of this toxin, which contaminates fish from coal power plant emissions. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Already, 180,000 MoveOn.org members have signed a petition opposing this favor for Bush's utility industry contributors, which will put an entire generation of children at risk. EPA says that 630,000 children are born annually with mercury levels that put them at risk for learning disabilities and other neurological illness. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In December, EPA proposed a mercury rule that will expose kids to more mercury, for far longer, than what the agency had previously planned, and what its own panel of experts said was achievable and cost-effective. The public comment period on the proposal ends April 30th &#150; MoveOn.org and other groups plan to swamp EPA with responses.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WHO: </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Carol Browner, Former Administrator, EPA </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Ken Cook, President, Environmental Working Group (EWG)</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Larry B.
