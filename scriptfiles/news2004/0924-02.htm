<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - September 24 - The Christian Coalition has a partisan political agenda and churches should refuse to distribute its biased &quot;voter guides,&quot; according to Americans United for Separation of Church and State.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Coalition is holding its &quot;Road to Victory&quot; Conference in Washington, D.C. Sept. 24-25, with sessions in the Dirksen Senate Office Building and a local hotel. The group, founded by TV preacher Pat Robertson, seeks to forge evangelical churches into a political machine to support favored candidates.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Said the Rev. Barry W. Lynn, Americans United executive director, &quot;The Coalition calls itself Christian, but its real mission is political. This group's voter guides are intended to elect Republican candidates who are sympathetic to its agenda.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Churches are tax-exempt organizations, and they may not distribute partisan literature,&quot; Lynn said. &quot;Coalition voter guides are Republican campaign literature masquerading as objective election information. I urge pastors not to participate in this underhanded scheme.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Americans United has opposed the Coalition since the group was founded in 1989. Due to Americans United's educational work, most churches have declined to distribute the Coalition's biased campaign literature.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This year Americans United has distributed over 80,000 informational letters to educate religious leaders about the requirements of federal tax law. </font></p><p></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
