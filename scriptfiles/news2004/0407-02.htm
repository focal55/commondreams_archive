<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - April 7 - Throughout &quot;Earth Month,&quot; the Sierra Club will be highlighting its efforts to stop the host of Bush administration policies that pose an unprecedented threat to the health and safety of America's communities. Through general public education, legislative, legal work and TV, radio and print advertising, the Sierra Club is using the Earth Day celebration, traditionally a time of heightened awareness of conservation issues, to draw attention to threats to the environment and the solutions.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">As Americans prepare to celebrate Earth Day on April 22, the Sierra Club is ramping up activities throughout the month and unveiling a new wave of paid advertising target the host of Bush administration policies that pose an unprecedented threat to the health and safety of America's communities. Through general public education, legislative, and legal work, as well as television, radio and print advertising, the Sierra Club is using the Earth Day celebration - traditionally a time of heightened awareness of conservation issues - to draw attention to the Bush administration's environmental record.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Earth Day is a time for Americans to reflect on the state of our environment,&quot; said Carl Pope, Sierra Club executive director. &quot;As we take stock this Earth Day, Americans will see that the Bush administration's policies leave little to celebrate. By dismantling the Clean Air and Water Acts, selling out public lands to the timber and oil industries, and allowing polluting industries to rewrite environmental laws, the Bush administration has its sights firmly set on overturning a century of environmental progress.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Sierra Club is unveiling TV ads in Michigan, Florida and Pennsylvania, radio ads in Alaska, Ohio, Oregon, Idaho, Wisconsin, and Nevada, and print ads in Idaho, Washington and West Virginia.  The ads, produced by Haddow Communications, focus on a variety of issues, including mercury, Superfund, wild forests, and nuclear waste. The ads are the latest in a series that advance the Sierra Club's &quot;There is a better way&quot; theme, which offers solutions for environmental progress.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;From allowing mercury to accumulate in the waters we drink and in the fish we eat, to cutting down our last wild forests and shifting the financial burden of toxic waste cleanups from polluters to taxpayers, Americans deserve to know the immediate and long-term implications of the Bush administration's destructive environmental policy agenda,&quot; Pope said.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The ads are available at <A HREF="http://www.sierraclub.org/pressroom/media/" TARGET="_NEW">http://www.sierraclub.org/pressroom/media/</A>.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Background on current Sierra Club policy and legal work:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Clean Air</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Bush administration has consistently given polluters a pass by weakening key clean air protections, instead of enforcing laws that protect the air we breathe. Sierra Club has worked in coalition with other environmental and public health organizations to block the administration's legislative scheme to undermine the Clean Air Act.  The so-called &quot;Clear Skies&quot; bill rewrites the Clean Air Act, repealing and delaying key protections, and replacing them with a polluter trading plan that may leave communities across the country at risk from soot, smog, and mercury pollution.  Through the regulatory process, the administration is proposing weak mercury protections (Clean Water section) and undermining the New Source Review program of the Clean Air Act, which requires factories - including power plants - to install modern pollution controls when they make a change that increases pollution.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In the face of the Bush administration's assault on the Clean Air Act, the Club is prosecuting several high profile enforcement actions against the nation's dirtiest coal plants, as well as fighting to overturn the Bush administration's politically-motivated weakening of the clean air laws. From North Carolina to New Mexico, the Club is leading efforts to enforce the Clean Air Act against some of the oldest, dirtiest coal plants in the country, plants that spew tons of toxic mercury into the air unnecessarily every year. Sierra Club joined other organizations and several states, suing to block the New Source Review changes, and, on Christmas Eve, the DC Circuit stepped in to block the most egregious of these changes until the case is decided.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Clean Water</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">As the Bush administration has reversed the steady progress we have made in cleaning up our nation's waters and keeping drinking water safe, the Sierra Club has responded with public education and legal challenges. This January, the Bush administration proposed to allow coal-fired power plants to emit three times more mercury into our air for decades longer than current law would allow. Under the plan, some plants could continue to emit excess mercury if they bought pollution credits from plants that reduced emissions more than required, threatening to create pollution &quot;hot spots.&quot; Ironically, the Bush administration's plan to weaken the current law came about a month after the Food and Drug Administration and the EPA for the first time issued a draft joint advisory expanding health warnings about the toxic effects of eating mercury tainted fish.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Last January, the Bush administration instructed its agencies not to enforce Clean Water Act protections for many wetlands and small streams without first obtaining permission from headquarters.  According to the EPA's own analysis, at least 20 million acres of wetlands (20 percent of U.S. wetlands) could become vulnerable.  The Bush administration's directive replaces a 25-year-old rule defining the scope of the Clean Water Act. The policy has had the effect of denying safeguards for wetlands, ponds and small streams that the law has previously protected from unregulated pollution and filling. The Sierra Club is working with other groups to see the guidance revoked.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Bush administration seriously weakened protections under the Clean Water Act by establishing regulations for the Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation industry which allows these factory farms to dispose of their waste - manure, pathogens, hormones and antibiotics - by spreading it on fields where it seeps into rivers and streams. Sierra Club has filed suit in Federal Court in New York to protect the public from this enormous health threat.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Toxics</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Sierra Club is asking Congress and the Bush administration to reinstate the Superfund &quot;polluter pays&quot; fees which expired in 1995. The measure, which would place the financial burden associated with cleaning up abandoned toxic waste sites on polluters instead of taxpayers, gained strong bipartisan support in a Senate vote last month despite falling short of passage. Superfund ran out of polluter-contributed funds last fall, and President Bush is the first President since it was enacted not to support the &quot;polluter pays&quot; principle.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Public Lands</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In addition to continuing to oppose Bush administration proposals to drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, the Sierra Club is fighting on a number of fronts to protect wild places across the county. The Bush administration has already stripped protection from 10 percent of America's land - an area larger than Texas and Oklahoma combined - systematically reversing the conservation legacy of President Teddy Roosevelt. If the administration's energy bill were to pass, it would make oil and gas drilling the dominant use of our public lands. Other battles include pushing for full funding of the Land and Water Conservation Fund, fighting the RS2477 loophole that allows rights-of-way roads in wilderness areas, and legal efforts to stop mountaintop removal mining.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Forests</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Under the guise of &quot;forest health,&quot; the Bush administration has stepped up the pace of logging on America's National Forests without regard for environmental protections. The administration is expected to announce plans soon to weaken or reverse protections for wild forests and fish and wildlife. In Oregon, the Bush administration has proposed massive post-fire logging in one of America's wildest and most pristine places, the Siskiyou Wild Rivers area. The Sierra Club filed suit in Arizona to protect old growth trees near the rim of the Grand Canyon from Bush administration logging plans. In California, the Sierra Club is at the forefront of a pitched battle with the Bush administration over logging in two of the nation's most treasured areas - the Sierra Nevada Range, including the areas surrounding Lake Tahoe and Yosemite National Park, and the Giant Sequoia National Monument.  In both cases, the Bush administration is ignoring decades of scientific study and pushing blindly ahead with plans for destructive  logging in these national treasures. The Sierra Club is asking the administration to focus resources on community protection from wildfires and true forest restoration instead of destructive commercial logging.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Energy</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Bush administration developed a polluting national energy policy three years ago in the backroom meetings of the Cheney Energy Task Force.  The end result has been an energy bill that is an act of secrecy from start to finish.  This bill would benefit the worst polluting industries in America without cutting our oil dependence, decreasing the risk of blackouts or creating jobs. Instead of taking responsible steps forward, this bill would take us backward and put our communities at risk. This bill elevates the profits of the polluting corporations funding the Bush administration over the public good.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Along with urging Congress to oppose the Energy Bill, the Sierra Club is also suing Vice President Cheney and his task force for violating the Federal Advisory Committee act.  The case will be argued before the Supreme Court on April 27.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Club is also fighting to protect Americans from unsafe, inadequately tested storage sites like Yucca Mountain, Nevada, for toxic nuclear waste. The Bush administration is pushing for high-level nuclear waste to be stored at Yucca Mountain while serious safety and environmental concerns about the facility have yet to be addressed. There is significant evidence that transporting nuclear waste across the country storing it at Yucca Mountain will put American citizens at risk.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">To view the Sierra Club List Terms &amp; Conditions, see: <A HREF="http://www.sierraclub.org/lists/terms.asp" TARGET="_NEW">http://www.sierraclub.org/lists/terms.asp</A></FONT></P><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
