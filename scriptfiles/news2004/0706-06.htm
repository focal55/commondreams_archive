<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - July 6 - John Edwards will be a great vice president. He is a truth-teller who will bring integrity and working family values to the second highest position in America. </FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Like John Kerry, Edwards has championed the interests of working men and women in the U.S. Senate and is a staunch supporter of workers&#146; rights, earning a 96 percent AFL-CIO voting record during his Senate career. </FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">This is a team that will generate a lot of excitement and draw a sharp contrast with the failed policies and leadership record of George Bush and Dick Cheney. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Edwards has strong working class and union roots. His father was a mill worker. His mother was a member of the Letter Carriers and his brother, a member of the Electrical Workers. In 2003, he wrote in an AFL-CIO candidate questionnaire: &#147;I know from my own life how important unions are. The only reason my brother&#146;s family has had health care is because of the union. We have a lot of work to do to protect workers&#146; rights in America.&#148; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">It is a mark of John Kerry that he had narrowed his selection of a running mate to a small pool of individuals who are all strong, outspoken advocates for working people. Dick Gephardt, who had been endorsed for president by a number of AFL-CIO affiliated unions, deserves special thanks for all he has done to make the presidential contest a referendum on good jobs for America&#146;s workers, and for his unfailing service to our country. Dick is a lifetime friend of working men and women, and he will undoubtedly continue to play a strong role in the campaign to take back America and in our nation&#146;s leadership.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">A full copy of John Edwards&#146; responses to the AFL-CIO candidate questionnaire and information about his voting record can be found at <A HREF="http://www.aflcio.org" TARGET="_new">www.aflcio.org</A>.</FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
