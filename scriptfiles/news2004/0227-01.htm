<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - February 27 - On Tuesday, February 24, 2004, solely for political gain, President Bush endorsed and called for quick passage of the anti-gay Musgrave Constitutional Amendment - which as it is now written, would ban the recognition of not just marriage, but all forms of same-sex partner recognition, including civil unions and domestic partnerships.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Task Force called this hurtful, divisive and distinctly un-American act by Bush a declaration of war on gay America. (<A HREF="http://www.ngltf.org/news/release.cfm?releaseID=634" TARGET="_new">Read our full statement here</A>.) Upon hearing Bush's speech, the Task Force, along with a coalition of our sister organizations, helped pull together rallies/press conferences attended by hundreds of people in both New York and Los Angeles. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Many of you asked us at these rallies and through hundreds of phone calls/e-mails since Tuesday, what you can do to express your outrage. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In the short term:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">1. Call and write your U.S. Representative and two U.S. Senators and tell them to vote against an amendment to the U.S. Constitution banning civil marriage for same-sex couples and urge them to lobby their colleagues in Congress to do the same. Don't know who your elected officials are? Go here to find <A HREF="http://www.vote-smart.org/" TARGET="_new">contact information</A> for them. (Service provided by Project Vote Smart)</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">2. Speak From Your Heart With Family and Friends. It is vitally important that we all express to our loved ones why the issue of equal marriage rights for same-sex couples is so important. A tip sheet for breaking the ice and speaking to your family and friends about this issue can be downloaded from the<A HREF="http://www.thetaskforce.org/marriagecenter" TARGET="_new"> Task Force Marriage Information Resource Center.</A></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">3. Call the White House. Right-wing political and religious extremists are flooding the White House with calls of support for Bush. We must make our voices heard.
