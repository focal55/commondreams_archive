<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- November 10 -- Was Every Vote Counted Accurately? Nader/Camejo Goes Forward with Hand Recount in New Hampshire</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Washington, DC: Independent Presidential Candidate Ralph Nader will be holding a press conference at 1:00 in at 1616 P Street, NW, 7th Floor. The press conference will focus on widespread reports of voting problems that raise questions about vote counting. The United States needs to face up to serious shortcomings in its electoral <br>process so that we can have trust in the results of the vote.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nader/Camejo has requested a hand recount of the vote in New Hampshire because of reports of anomalies favoring President Bush in towns that used the Diebold AccuVote optical scan machines. A hand recount will either rule out the possibility of machine error or show a discrepancy in the Diebold machine and the actual vote-either way voters need to know. To review the request for a hand recount in New Hampshire visit www.VoteNader.org. Similar inexplicable results have been found in other states, including Ohio. Nader has called on John Kerry to demand that every vote be counted accurately. His campaign has remained strangely silent on the matter.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This election has highlighted the need for electoral reform including federal standards for federal offices and non-partisan administration of the elections from ballot access, through debate participation and to how the vote is cast and counted.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
