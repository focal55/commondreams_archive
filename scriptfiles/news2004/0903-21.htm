<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NEW YORK &#150; September 3 - President George W. Bush included prominent mention of the &#147;unborn&#148; in his speech to the Republican National Convention, targeting Roe v. Wade in keeping with the GOP platform.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Because a caring society will value its weakest members, we must make a place for the unborn child,&#148; Bush said in his speech.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bush&#146;s statement brought a swift rebuke from Gloria Feldt, president of Planned Parenthood Action Fund.  &#147;This president has Roe v. Wade as his target,&#148; Feldt said.  &#147;President Bush finds it easy to toss off these red meat anti-choice phrases for his extremist base, but the women of America and the world will pay a tragic price if this man is returned to the Oval Office.&#148;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>- Bush Flip-Flops on Freedom - </b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;President Bush is flip-flopping on freedom,&#148; Feldt said.  &#147;He speaks of freedom and opportunity for all, including his daughters but embraces government control over our most fundamental human right &#150; the right to decide whether and when to become parents.&#148;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">President Bush&#146;s convention address included conflicting statements in support of the changing roles of women in society, countered by his targeting of Roe v. Wade.  &#147;&#133;In one of the most dramatic shifts our society has seen, two-thirds of all Moms also work outside the home,&#148; Bush said.  &#147;This changed world can be a time of great opportunity for all Americans&#133;And government must take your side.&#148;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Indeed, the world has changed,&#148; said Feldt.  &#147;And these opportunities exist for women today because we have rights and access to birth control and safe and legal abortion, so we have control over our childbearing.&#148;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;I grew up on the other side of the oil patch from George W. Bush in Texas,&#148; Feldt said.  &#147;I grew up in the world President Bush and his party&#146;s platform envision once again for America, and it was not a land of opportunity and liberty for women.&#148;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>- A Week of Party Favors for the Right -</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bush&#146;s inclusion of anti-choice language in his convention speech capped a week of party favors for the extremist Right.  The convention opened with approval of a GOP platform calling for a constitutional amendment to ban abortion.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On Monday, anti-choice leader Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA) provided some of his most extreme comments regarding reproductive rights, in an appearance with Feldt on NPR&#146;s &#147;Fresh Air with Terry Gross.&#148;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;A fertilized egg is a little boy or a little girl,&#148; Santorum said on Monday, while cloaking such extremist rhetoric for his convention speech Wednesday night.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Feldt said the contrast couldn&#146;t be clearer for women and their families as the nation heads toward the November election.  &#147;Some say we&#146;ll never go back to the days before Roe v. Wade, but President Bush has promised to appoint judges who will take us back to that time when women died routinely from too-frequent childbearing and unsafe abortions.&#148;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;That&#146;s why the Planned Parenthood Action Fund has made its first-ever presidential endorsement: for John Kerry.&#148;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Planned Parenthood Action Fund endorsed John Kerry for President on April 23, 2004.  The announcement marked the first time in the history of the non-partisan, independent Planned Parenthood Action Fund that it had endorsed a candidate in a presidential race.
