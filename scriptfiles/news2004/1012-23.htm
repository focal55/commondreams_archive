<p>WASHINGTON - October 12 - Citing "grave concerns over the prospects for real 
military reforms," 45 members of the U.S. Congress called possible State 
Department plans to provide foreign military financing (FMF) for Indonesia 
in 2006 "premature, unwarranted, and unwise."

<p>In a letter to Secretary of State Colin Powell, the members of Congress 
wrote that "impunity remains firmly entrenched" and justice has not been 
served for past human rights violations in East Timor and elsewhere.

<p>"The rights record of the TNI [Indonesian military] continues to be 
unacceptable. Crackdowns against civilians have escalated in West Papua. 
The end of martial law in Aceh has not led to improvements on the ground," 
they wrote.

<p>They called the Indonesian military "a massively corrupt institution," much 
of whose income "comes from illegal and semi-legal activities, including 
prostitution, drug-dealing, environmentally destructive logging, and 
trafficking in people."

<p>The Representatives wrote, "Restricting FMF sends a critical message to the 
TNI and should not be dispensed until there is genuine reform and justice 
for rights violations."

<p>In a briefing this week, departing U.S. Ambassador to Indonesia Ralph Boyce 
told foreign press that he was disappointed that U.S.-Indonesia military 
relations remain restricted due to Jakarta's failure to prove that it had 
improved its human rights record. Boyce stated, "we don't have the material 
with which to seriously go to Congress and do that."

<p>FMF provides grants and loans for weapons and other military equipment and 
training. Congress has restricted FMF since 2000 and is set to renew the 
restriction for the 2005 fiscal year.

<p>Representatives Patrick Kennedy (D-RI), Chris Smith (R-NJ), Lane Evans 
(D-IL), and James McGovern (D-MA) organized the letter. A copy of the 
letter and a complete list of signers can be found at
