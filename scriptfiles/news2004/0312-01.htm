<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - March 11 - It is appalling that the Bush administration is proposing to name a &#147;manufacturing czar&#148; who has shipped American jobs to China&#151;Anthony Raimondo. This administration&#146;s number one export has been good American jobs&#151;we&#146;ve lost nearly 2.8 million manufacturing jobs under his watch.</FONT></p><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Shutting American plants down, moving them to China in search of cheap labor and exporting America&#146;s jobs is not the jobs plan we need. Instead, we need real policies that create good jobs&#151;jobs that have health care, pensions, and a family-supporting wage. </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Raimondo&#146;s record also speaks directly to his disregard for America&#146;s working families. In his efforts to keep workers from forming unions, Raimondo has hurt not only workers but undermined the most effective economic tool for raising wages, gaining benefits, and improving their communities. </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">President Bush&#146;s nomination ignores America&#146;s needs for real leadership and a real jobs plan. His consideration of Raimondo makes ever more clear that his plan for American manufacturing is smoke and mirrors.</FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
