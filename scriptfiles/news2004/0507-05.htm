<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - May 7 - Sony and Major League Baseball made a partial tactical retreat last night from their plans put advertising on baseball fields, but there still will be pre-game ads on bases and pitching mounds, and ads on on-deck circles during games at the option of each home team. </FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;Sony and Bud Selig are still insulting the fans and our national pastime.  There shouldn&#146;t be ads on the ballfield, period,&#148; said Gary Ruskin, executive director of Commercial Alert.   </FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;It&#146;s time for Selig to be unequivocally clear, and declare the playing field off limits to advertising,&#148; Ruskin said.  &#147;He should make a public commitment that a ballfield is for playing ball.  It is not a billboard.&#148; </FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;A bad idea is a bad idea, and a little less of a bad idea is still a bad idea,&#148; Ruskin said. &#147;Lots of fans enjoy the warm-ups as much as the game.&#148; </FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;This is a tactical retreat to soften up the fans, and gain acceptance for the plastering of ads on the ballfield,&#148; Ruskin said. &#147;If Selig wants to sell ad space, he should lead by example, and put patches for corporate advertisers on his suits.&#148; </FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">  Commercial Alert is asking people to bear in mind Sony&#146;s degradation of our national pastime when they consider whether or not to buy Sony products or see Sony movies. </FONT></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
