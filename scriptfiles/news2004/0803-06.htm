<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SA</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">N FRANCISCO - August 3 - Today Trinity County, California became the second county in the nation to ban the production of genetically engineered (GE) crops and animals.  By a vote of 3-1, Trinity County Supervisors elected to ban GE crops and  animals in an effort to protect Trinity's local economy and environment.</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The proposed ordinance has been supported by a broad spectrum of Trinity residents, including farmers, businesses, home gardeners, nurseries, social workers, students, church people, teachers, environmentalists, government employees, and investment, computer, and health professionals.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Today's vote is in keeping with the tradition in Trinity County over 25 years of passing ordinances to protect the well being of its citizens,&quot; said Susan Bower, local farmer and ban proponent.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Trinity's vote for a sustainable and sound agriculture economy is an important first step in reclaiming control of our food supply, &quot;said Doug Mosel, GMO Free Mendocino coordinator and spokesperson for the BioDemocracy  Alliance. &quot;This sends a clear message that local, safe production is the  responsibility of all.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Trinity County's decision reflects a growing movement across America to phase-out genetic engineering and to defend local agriculture, biodiversity and human health. Four other California counties will vote in November to ban genetically engineered crops (Marin, Butte, Humboldt, and San Luis Obispo), while activists in dozens of counties across the country are beginning to organize to create &quot;GE Free&quot; Zones.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;BioDemocracy is spreading throughout the California and the United States,&quot; said Ronnie Cummins, director of the Organic Consumers Association, a national network of 500,000 organic consumers and spokesperson for the BioDemocracy Alliance. &quot;In light of the lack of regulation at both the federal and state levels of these increasingly controversial GE crops, Trinity's Supervisors have taken an important step to protect their communities.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Trinity County's ban goes into effect 30 days from its passage.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Contact information for Trinity County representatives:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Drew Franklin: 530-623-2656</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Joseph Bower: 530-628-5004</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
