<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NEW YORK - August 24 - Several peace and other socially progressive organizations will hold a press conference on 11 am on Wednesday, August 25 at 241 Thompson St. (&quot;Garden Room&quot; of Judson Memorial Church) in Manhattan to announce plans for a nonviolent civil disobedience action at the Republican National Convention.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The planned nonviolent civil disobedience, which includes a solemn procession from &quot;Ground Zero&quot; and die-in at Madison Square Garden, is part of a full day of nonviolent direct actions happening all over Manhattan next week on August 31. No permits have been granted nor have they been sought from the city of New York by the organizers of these events, which include the War Resisters League, School of Americas Watch, and the Socialist Party.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among those speaking at the press conference will be Frida Berrigan of the War Resisters League, Megan Bartlett of Ground Zero for Peace, 9/11 Rescue and Recovery Workers Against War, Jennifer Schockemoehl of School of Americas Watch, and David McReynolds, the Green Party candidate for the U.S. Senate.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These organizations and the individuals involved feel the need to engage in civil disobedience in order to dramatize their vigorous opposition to United States government's wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, and President George W. Bush's &quot;war on terror.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ruth Benn, long-time War Resisters League activist, argues &quot;The bloodshed has already cost the lives of thousands of Americans, Iraqis, Afghanis, and others, and is hemorrhaging vast sums of money vitally needed to improve lives in this country and abroad. At the same time half the people in the U.S. feel less safe while the government has ignored calls from experts and activists for a foreign policy that rejects war.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For more details, please come to 241 Thompson St. (across from Washington Square Park between W. 3rd St. and Washington Sq. S.) on August 25 at 11 am.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
