<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - March 11 - The General Accounting Office (GAO) report on the Bush administration&#146;s Medicare ads highlights the waste and deception that characterize the Medicare prescription drug bill and its corporate giveaways. The GAO said it best when it noted that despite &quot;[Health and Human Service&#146;s] stated interest in informing beneficiaries of changes to Medicare, we observe several noteworthy omissions in HHS&#146;s materials.&quot;</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">While the GAO found that the ads&#146; &quot;political tone&quot; did not &quot;constitute a purely partisan message,&quot; the taxpayers deserve their wasted money back.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">How can Bush possibly justify placing ads in the Washington-insider newspaper Roll Call, given that people eligible for Medicare &#150; 65 and older &#150; constitute just 3 percent of its readership? How can Bush call this an education campaign when the GAO found &quot;noteworthy omissions&quot; in the ads that &quot;may lead beneficiaries to underestimate the amount they will need to pay for prescription drugs&quot;?</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">It is ironic that while Bush chastises Congress to be &quot;wise with the people&#146;s money,&quot; he spends more than $22 million of the people&#146;s money on inaccurate political advertisements. His campaign should refund the taxpayer&#146;s money for these political advertisements and he should pull the ads.</FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
