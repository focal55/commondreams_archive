<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">AR RAM, JERUSALEM - July 9 - We, the women and men on hunger strike, protesting the continued construction of the Israeli &quot;Separation wall&quot;, raise our voices in welcoming the ruling handed down by the International Court of Justice [ICJ] in the Hague, and which unequivocally declares its illegality.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The wall, which is being built on occupied Palestinian land, separates Palestinian families from one another, children from their schools, farmers from their lands, and the sick from the medical facilities they need. In essence, the wall imprisons an entire population, substituting the conventional metal bars of a prison with an 8-meter high cement wall, razor wire, trenches, lookout towers and gates, controlled by the wardens of the Israeli Occupying Army.    </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">We assert that this ruling is an affirmation of the demands of the Palestinian people who are defending their freedom, land and families. We furthermore call upon the General Assembly of the United Nations as well as the Security Council, to work faithfully to implement its unambiguous decisions, and which represent the highest legal authority in the UN.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Security Council must take immediate and binding concrete action in order to undo the injustices endured by the Palestinian people as a result of Israel's illegal occupation. In this regard we look to the example set by the international community in confronting the racist policies of the Apartheid regime in South Africa in years past.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">There is no doubt that in order to reverse the grave injustices inflicted upon the Palestinian people and to bring about the conditions for a genuine peace, Israel must abide by international law and international resolutions, including those resolutions which call for a full end to the occupation, and the right for Palestinian refugees to return to their lands and homes.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In this regard, we demand that the existent double standard pertaining to Israel and its flagrant disregard of international law, be put to an immediate end. Israel is not and cannot be a country above the law.  </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">We consider the ICJ ruling a victory for the voices of justice and humanity, but is short of being complete until Israel is forced to abide by it. We call upon all countries of the world, including the United States of America, not to provide Israel with political immunity while it continues to adhere to disregarding international law and the will of the international community.  </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">This ruling has done away with all of Israel's lies and excuses regarding the pretexts for the wall's construction and reaffirms the just cause of the Palestinian people, their right to defend their land against the brutal assaults of the occupier, and their right to receive compensation from Israel for the damages inflicted.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">We once again affirm and commend this decision, which is in-synch with the laws of justice and human rights, and shall continue to resist this wall until its ultimate demolition, calling upon all people of conscience to join us in this struggle.     </FONT></P><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
