<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">NEW YORK - February 6 - Ms. Yanar Mohammed, founder of the Organization for Women&#146;s Freedom in Iraq, recently received a death threat from Islamist militants.  Ms. Mohammed is one of numerous Iraqi women who has spoken forcibly against the US-appointed Iraqi Governing Council&#146;s Resolution 137, which seeks to impose arbitrary interpretations of Islamic law on Iraq and strip Iraqi people of basic human rights. </FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Shortly after initiating a campaign for the repeal of the Resolution, Ms. Mohammed received an email to her personal account, with the title: &#147;Killing Yanar Mohammed Within a Few Days.&#148;  The message demanded that she stop her activism on behalf of women&#146;s rights, described by the authors as &#147;psychologically disturbed ideas about women&#146;s freedom.&#148; The group, Army of Sahaba, has threatened to kill her if she persists.  </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">MADRE, an international women&#146;s human rights organization, has initiated an international campaign to bring this threat to public attention.  As part of this campaign, MADRE has issued the following open letter to Coalition Provisional Authority Chief Paul Bremer.  As MADRE Associate Director Yifat Susskind commented, &#147;Ironically, Paul Bremer himself helped create the current climate of extreme hostility towards women&#146;s rights in Iraq by appointing a group of reactionary clerics to the Governing Council.  The inclusion of these men &#150; who authored Resolution 137 &#150; on the Council has galvanized anti-democratic forces in Iraq, including those who are now threatening to kill Ms. Mohammed.&#148;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">For more on MADRE&#146;s campaign to ensure the safety of Yanar Mohammed and defend Iraqi women&#146;s rights to political participation and the full range of human rights, visit <A HREF="http://www.madre.org" TARGET="_new">www.madre.org</A></FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
