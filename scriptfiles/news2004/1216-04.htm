<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- December 16 --  The National Organization for Women will join a coalition representing millions of people to expose the privatization of Social Security - an overt attempt by the right-wing to fill corporate coffers by looting our national trust fund. One hour before George W. Bush addresses the White House Economic Summit, where he is expected to reiterate his determination to privatize Social Security, coalition leaders will expose how this scam disproportionately hurts women. Ultimately, privatization places more money in the pockets of Wall Street brokerage firms, while destroying this vital and reliable family security insurance.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The group will launch an aggressive campaign to stop President Bush's effort to dismantle Social Security, mobilizing grassroots action in every community nationwide. Coalition leaders include National Organization for Women President Kim Gandy, Campaign for America's Future Co-director Roger Hickey, John Sweeney of the AFL-CIO, Julian Bond of the NAACP, George Kourpias of the Alliance for Retired Americans, and Marty Ford of the Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities, none of whom were invited to participate in the president's economic summit.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHEN:      Thursday, December 16, 2004, 12:30 p.m.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHERE:    National Press Club - First Amendment Lounge<br>                  529 14th Street, NW, Washington, D.C.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHO:        Kim Gandy, President, National Organization for Women<br>                  Roger Hickey, Co-Director, Campaign for America's Future<br>                  John Sweeney, President, AFL-CIO<br>                  Julian Bond, Chair, NAACP<br>                  George Kourpias, President, Alliance for Retired Americans<br>                  Marty Ford, Director of Legal Advocacy, The Arc, and<br>                     Treasurer, Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NOTE: Televisions will be available to watch President Bush's 1:30 p.m. remarks following the news conference.
