<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- November 17 -- The Sierra Club today released documents showing that the Bush administration gave special treatment to Texas-based Davis Brothers Oil Producers, Inc., when it reversed a longstanding policy in order to allow oil and gas drilling underneath certain national parks, preserves and refuges regardless of potential environmental impacts.  More than a dozen National Park Service areas could be impacted by the rule, including Big Thicket National Preserve and Padre Island National Seashore in Texas, New River Gorge in West Virginia, and Big Cypress National Preserve in Florida.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Documents obtained by Sierra Club through the Freedom of Information Act show that the Bush administration changed the rule specifically at the request of Ross Davis, who runs Davis Brothers Oil Producers. Moreover, the administration made its decision in secret and bypassed the regular rulemaking process, which allows for public input and a high degree of transparency.  </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;These documents show that the Bush administration bent over backwards to help its friends in the oil and gas industry even when the facts showed that its policy would harm national parks,&quot; said Brandt Mannchen of the Sierra Club&#146;s Lone Star Chapter, who has been tracking drilling problems around Big Thicket National Preserve in Texas.  &quot;This administration seems to think there are two sets of rules, one for oil and gas companies and one for everyone else.&quot;  </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In an effort to right the wrong, the Sierra Club today took legal action to overturn this new rule, asserting that the Bush administration broke the law by cutting the public out of a back-door process of adopting a new rule.  The group filed a complaint in federal district court arguing that the Bush administration adopted the new rule in blatant disregard of its obligations to protect America&#146;s National Parks. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In November 2003, the NPS issued a new policy that allows private companies unrestricted access to oil and gas underneath NPS units so long as they drill for it at an angle from outside park boundaries using &quot;directional drilling.&quot;  This new rule ties the National Park Service&#146;s hands, forcing them to turn a blind eye to the destruction that may occur around the Park Service areas as a result of the drilling.  Prior to the new rule, the National Park Service required oil and gas companies to prove that proposed drilling would not harm the National Park Service unit.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The Bush administration broke the law. Now they must reinstate the Park Service&#146;s authority to require full environmental review and approval of oil and gas companies&#146; drilling operations adjacent to park boundaries,&#148; said Pat Gallagher, Sierra Club legal director.  </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Private oil and gas development is generally prohibited within the National Park system.  However, more than a dozen specific areas are unique in that the Park Service only owns the surface rights, while private entities hold title to the subsurface minerals.  </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Areas that are affected by the new rule include: </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Gulf Islands National Seashore &#150; Alabama</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Big Cypress National Preserve &#150; Florida</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Tallgrass Prairie National Preserve -- Kansas</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Big South Fork National River and Recreation Area -- Kentucky</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jean Lafitte National Historic Park and Preserve -- Louisiana</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Aztec Ruins National Monument -- New Mexico</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cuyahoga Valley National Park -- Ohio</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Obed Wild and Scenic River -- Tennessee</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Big Thicket National Preserve -- Texas</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Alibates Flint Quarries National Monument -- Texas</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lake Meredith National Recreation Area -- Texas</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Padre Island National Seashore -- Texas</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Gauley River National Recreation Area -- West Virginia</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">New River Gorge National River -- West Virginia.</font></p>
