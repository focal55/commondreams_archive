<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - September 17 - Congressman Dennis J. Kucinich, Ranking Member of the House Government Reform Subcommittee on National Security, Emerging Threats and International Relations, today called on Subcommittee Chairman Shays to hold hearings on the future of Iraq after the release of the latest National Intelligence Estimate.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">        Kucinich, in a letter to Chairman Shays, states, &quot;As recent reports in the media have disclosed, this classified document is the first formal intelligence estimate on Iraq in two years.  As you are aware, the October 2002 NIE estimate on Iraq focused on Iraq's alleged program to reconstitute its weapons of mass destruction program.  That document, which was declassified by the Bush Administration, reflected the consensus of major American intelligence agencies, and I believe that the July 2004 NIE should also be declassified.  Congress, the public, and particularly U.S. military troops, should have the same awareness of the challenges confronting the U.S. in Iraq in the near future.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">        Kucinich continues in the letter, &quot;The July 2004 NIE is reported to be highly pessimistic regarding Iraq's progress towards a free and democratic government.  This contrasts with the rosy public statements that continue to be made by the President and his advisors, optimism that may be hiding the dangerous reality which awaits us there.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The disclosure of the July 2004 NIE would provide the Subcommittee with an opportunity to clarify conflicting positions of the current Administration on Iraq and terrorism.  Vice President Cheney famously made the prediction prior to U.S. military operations that Iraqis would greet U.S. troops as liberators.  Yet anti-American opinion and insurgencies have increased in recent months, and Iraq has become a haven for terrorist groups.  The July 2004 NIE appears to support the view that the stability of the Iraqi government is precarious at best.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">        Kucinich, today, called on Chairman Shays to hold hearings on this matter before Congress adjourns for the election. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Complete copy of the letter is <a href="http://www.house.gov/kucinich/issues/shayletter.PDF" target="_new">attached here</a>.</font></p><p></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
