<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - April 22 - An international social justice organization says that statements made at a recent joint press conference by President Bush and Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon contravene international law.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The American Friends Service Committee (AFSC), which provided humanitarian aid to thousands of Palestinian refugees on behalf of the United Nations during the Arab-Israel War, announces it &#147;is deeply troubled over the Bush Administration&#146;s abandonment of the long understood and accepted principles underlying a just and lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians.&#148;&nbsp; &nbsp;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Mary Lord, AFSC assistant general secretary for peace and conflict resolution, says that statements made at Wednesday&#146;s joint press conference reverse long-standing U.S. policy.&nbsp; That policy opposes building and expanding Israeli settlements in the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip.&nbsp; The settlements contravene principles expressed in UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, numerous other resolutions, and international law, the group states.&nbsp; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In accord with those laws and resolutions, the United States has long held that it is illegal for Israel to build or expand its settlements in the West Bank, East Jerusalem or Gaza Strip past the 1967 borders. Upholding these long-established principles is the best option to ensure peace and security for all people involved.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;For President Bush to openly endorse Israel&#146;s illegal settlement policy in the Occupied Territories is very troubling,&#148; says Lord. &#147;By declaring that Israel can keep lands captured in the 1967 war, President Bush not only ignores the will of the United Nations but also tramples the rights of the Palestinian people. This will strongly impede peace efforts in the region.&#148;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Israel&#146;s 37-year old policy of settling its own population in the Occupied Palestinian Territories is in direct conflict with international law, which outlaws the acquisition of territory by force and forbids an occupying power to settle its civilian population in occupied territory. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;The &#145;demographic realities&#146; the president speaks of are in essence &#145;illegal realities,&#146;&#148; Lord continues.&nbsp; &#147;For 37 years Israel has settled civilians in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, in violation of treaties against this practice.&#148;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Comments made about the U.S. position with respect to Palestinian refugees in particular are very disturbing. Palestinian refugees have legitimate rights under international law, as represented in UN General Assembly Resolution 194.&nbsp; These rights must be protected and implemented as part of a just and lasting peace.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Lord adds that given such stances by the U.S. government, Palestinians will inevitably conclude that the rights and aspirations of the Palestinian people are no longer a concern of the United States. She predicts that President Bush's statements will further marginalize moderate voices in the Palestinian community and give Israel license to further expand its settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.&nbsp; These settlements have already gravely undermined the ability of Palestinian communities to work their land, develop their own institutions and infrastructure, and engage in commerce.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;It is ironic that one day after declaring that the U.S. is &#145;not a colonizer but a liberator&#146; and that the Iraqi people would rightly resent a continued U.S. occupation, President Bush has effectively endorsed a 37-year Israeli project of occupation and colonization,&#148; Lord concludes.&nbsp; &#147;Why wouldn't Palestinians, any less than Iraqis, resent and resist such policies?&#148;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">She adds: &#147;By not simply embracing but exceeding Prime Minister Sharon&#146;s requests, President Bush has put the United States on a collision course with the requirements of justice and international law, undermined voices of reconciliation and coexistence in Israel/Palestine and further isolated the United States from the international community.&#148;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The American Friends Service Committee is a faith-based organization working for peace, justice and reconciliation in 22 countries of the world. With national headquarters in Philadelphia and regional offices in Atlanta, Baltimore, Chicago, Des Moines, New York, San Francisco, Seattle, Pasadena, California; and Cambridge, Massachusetts, AFSC emphasizes people, not politics or ideology &#150; upholding the dignity and promise of every person.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Service Committee has a long history working for peace and reconciliation.&nbsp; Quaker work in the Middle East dates back to 1875, with the establishment of a Friends school in Lebanon. &nbsp;AFSC launched massive programs to feed millions of starving children in post-war Germany.&nbsp; &nbsp;In 1949, the United Nations asked the Service Committee to provide relief assistance to more than 200,000 Palestinian refugees entering the Gaza Strip during the Arab-Israel War.&nbsp; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In 1947, the American Friends Service Committee and its European counterpart, the British Friends Service Council, accepted the Nobel Peace Prize on behalf of Quakers worldwide for humanitarian relief efforts. </FONT></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
