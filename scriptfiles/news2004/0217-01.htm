<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - February 17 - Who said that Republican rhetoric isn't radical and extremist? They should read the following sample quotations from Take Them at Their Words, a new collection of more than a thousand GOP right wing pronouncements that challenge the notion of civil discourse:</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><I>&quot;Sarah Brady ought to be put down. A humane shot at a veterinarian's would be an easy way to do it</I>.&quot; -- Talk Show Host Bob Mohan, KFYI, Phoenix, AZ, 2-29-95</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><I>&quot;I want you to just let a wave of intolerance wash over you. I want you to let a wave of hatred wash over you. Yes, hate is good</I>.&quot; Randall Terry, The New Republic, 8-1-94</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;<I>We need to execute people like John Walker in order to physically intimidate liberals, by making them realize that they can be killed too</I>.&quot; Ann Coulter, 2-26-02</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">'<A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/089733521X/commondreams-20/ref=nosim/" TARGET="_new">Take Them at Their Words: Shocking, Amusing &amp; Baffling Quotations from the G.O.P. and Their Friends</A>' 1994-2004 by Bruce J. Miller with Diana Maio (Academy Chicago Publishers, 396pp, Paperback, 51/2X81/2, $15.95, 0-89733-521-X, Introduction by Sidney Blumenthal, cartoons by Mike Luckovich) contains quotes culled from hundreds of newspapers, magazines, Web sites, the Congressional Record, Talk Show hosts, television programs, etc -- over the past ten years -- which reveal a remarkable consensus amongst Republican politicians and sympathetic print and electronic media.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;There may not be a vast Right Wing conspiracy,&quot; author Bruce Miller says, &quot;but there is an undeniable consensus of language and ideas which have the effect of a litany--repeated over and over again.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Miller got the idea originally when in 1996 he self-published a small booklet entitled'When Right is Wrong', a selection of about one hundred quotes he had heard on talk radio as he traveled in his car on business throughout the Midwest. It was only two years after the so-called Republican Revolution of 1994 and he distributed a few hundred copies to his bookseller-customers, which they sold quickly.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">'Take Them at Their Words' is a ten-fold expansion of that slim volume and its subject matter ranges widely over all the hot political issues of the day.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Many of these quotes,&quot; Miller continued, &quot;are startling, some are amusing or simply incomprehensible and, most shocking of all, too many of them advocate violence against Democrats and other perceived enemies of the Republicans and their friends.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;As Sidney Blumenthal points out in his introduction, 'It is a volume that reveals an unabashed worldview that today holds sway in the White House, the Congress and much of the media. You may read and laugh, but, remember, they mean it.'&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">'Take Them at Their Words' includes a name index and is divided into nine more or less thematic parts. Also included are eleven political cartoons by Mike Luckovich of the Atlanta Constitution. </FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
