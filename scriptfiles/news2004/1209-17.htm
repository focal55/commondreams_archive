<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- December 9 -- One of the most controversial and provocative films of the year, Fahrenheit 9/11, has been nominated by the People's Choice Awards as the American public's &quot;Favorite Film of the Year.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The five nominees were chosen from a poll of thousands of Americans during November. The other nominees for best film are Spiderman 2, The Incredibles, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (with Jim Carrey), and Shrek 2.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In considering Moore's film, it is the first time a documentary has been nominated for &quot;best film&quot; by the People's Choice Awards.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The People's Choice Awards are considered, among all the awards shows, to be the one which most accurately reflects the &quot;mainstream&quot; public opinion in the United States.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to a letter published on Moore's <a href="http://www.michaelmoore.com/" target="_new">website</a>, a group of Republicans have taken out a full page ad in USA Today (and placed a similar one in the Hollywood trade magazine, Variety) proclaiming that &quot;An election is over, but a war of ideas continues.&quot; The point of the ad, according to Moore, was to say that while they, as right wing conservatives, were proud of getting rid of Kerry, there was still one more nuisance running around loose they had to deal with&#151;Moore himself!</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Moore states that these Republicans have issued a not-so-subtle threat to the Academy Awards voters that, in essence, said don't even THINK about nominating &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; for Best Picture. According to Moore, Bill O'Reilly recently said that if the Oscars recognize his work this year, Middle America will boycott Hollywood.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Moore's letter ends with the promise to be &quot;nice and polite&quot; if his film is selected.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;I promise, if we win, to give a nice and polite speech,&quot; Moore wrote.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hopefully, that's one promise Moore won't keep.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To vote for Fahrenheit 9/11 visit <a href="http://www.pcavote.com/" target="_new">www.pcavote.com</a>.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Voting is currently underway and will continue through this coming Monday, December 13. Winners will accept their awards live on CBS on January 9, 2005.</font><br></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
