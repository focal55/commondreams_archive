<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- November 30 -- A program manager who has devoted a quarter century to women&#146;s health education will receive the second annual Phyllis McCarthy Annual Public Interest Service Award today from Public Citizen.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Public Citizen created the award after Phyllis McCarthy, a 24-year employee of its Health Research Group, died in November 2002. The award is intended to recognize people who have worked long and hard in a public interest group, performing critical functions, as did McCarthy, but who have not received public credit commensurate with their contributions.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The recipient is Sally Whelan, a founder and 25-year staff member of the leading international women&#146;s health education and advocacy organization, the Boston Women&#146;s Health Book Collective, which produces the bestselling &#147;Our Bodies Ourselves.&#148;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Whelan ran the Boston&#146;s Women&#146;s Health Book Collective&#146;s Women&#146;s Health Information Center and for six years coordinated the International Women and Health Documentation Center Project, which provided a computer and communications infrastructure for women&#146;s health information centers in Brazil, Chile, Malaysia, Mexico and the United States.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Sally Whelan has very little public visibility although she has been key to the women&#146;s health movement in so many ways for 25 years,&#148; said Judy Norsigian, executive director of the Boston Women&#146;s Health Book Collective. &#147;She is a great team player and has been incredibly committed to improving the health of women and families for more than three decades.&#148;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Phyllis McCarthy began her career with Public Citizen&#146;s Health Research Group in 1978 as a typist, intending to devote her career to public interest work. She became the group&#146;s detail-oriented office manager and managing editor of all of the Health Research Group&#146;s publications, ensuring that the group&#146;s many publications &#150; which included books, monthly newsletters and more than 1,000 reports, medical journal articles and petitions to governmental and health safety agencies &#150; were error-free and published on time.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The award will be presented at a 4 p.m. reception today at Public Citizen&#146;s office at 1600 20th Street NW.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
