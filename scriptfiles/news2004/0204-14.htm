<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">NEW YORK - February 4 - The Bush administration's budget proposal slashed funding for programs designed to promote workers' human rights in developing countries, Human Rights Watch said today.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">U.S. President George W. Bush's proposed budget would endanger labor rights monitoring and enforcement, programs to eliminate child labor, worker education projects and workplace HIV/AIDS initiatives around the world.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The budget would also undercut the Bush administration's promise to promote workers' rights under the U.S.-Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA). The Bush administration has stated that its &quot;strategy on worker rights&quot; in CAFTA would &quot;establish a cooperative program to improve labor laws and enforcement and build the capacity of Central American nations to monitor and enforce labor rights.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">According to the U.S. Department of Labor, however, the budget for fiscal year 2005 proposes only $18 million for international labor rights programs, an 82 percent drop from the $99.5 million Congress appropriated for the current fiscal year.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The Bush administration tries to talk a good game on protecting workers' human rights,&quot; said Carol Pier, labor rights and trade researcher for Human Rights Watch. &quot;But the paltry sum it seeks for international labor rights programs tells a different story.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">CAFTA, whose text was made public on January 28, was recently negotiated among the United States, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua. It has yet to come to a vote in the countries' legislative branches.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">If CAFTA passes, full funding of its &quot;strategy on worker rights&quot; would depend largely on the U.S. Congress's willingness to transfer money from elsewhere in the 2005 budget. The recently awarded U.S. grant of $6.75 million to strengthen Central America's labor systems, or roughly $1.7 million a year for four years, hardly offsets the labor rights aid that Central American countries could lose under the proposed budget.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">This is not the first time the Bush administration's budget proposals have shown a lack of commitment to strengthening workers' rights around the world. Last year, for example, its proposed 2004 budget sought only $12 million for the Department of Labor's international technical assistance programs. Congress, however, ultimately appropriated an additional $87.5 million. Nevertheless, the total $99.5 million reflected a 26 percent decrease from the 2003 budget. Moreover, it included a dramatic 93 percent decrease-from $37 million to $2.5 million-for bilateral and multilateral activities designed to help resource- strapped nations improve respect for a range of workers' human rights.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The administration's budget proposal is just one more example of its willingness to shortchange workers' rights in its free trade strategy,&quot; said Pier. &quot;Congress should reject such a cynical and shortsighted approach.&quot;</FONT></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
