<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- December 10 -- New evidence suggests that prisoners at the infamous Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq were subjected not only to torture and psychological abuse, they were underfed, malnourished and made to eat food so bad it inspired riots. A little-known private contractor, run by an American civilian, is said to be to blame.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An exclusive new story by CorpWatch military correspondent David Phinney, describes the food and the reaction of military officials who were running the prison.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Contract meals Disaster,&quot; one army official said in an e-mail. &quot;That is the best way to describe this issue. As each day goes by, the tension within the prisoner populations increases,&quot; he continued. &quot;For the past two days prisoners have been vomiting after they eat.&quot;<br>One interrogator said that the conditions were so bad that it was hard for them to extract information from detainees. &quot;Anything that affects the morale of the locals affect our mission.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The food was largely to blame for two prison riots in which Army guards shot four detainees after the prisoners failed to comply with commands to stop and disburse.
