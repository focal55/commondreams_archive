<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - April 28 - Yesterday, the Sierra Club submitted comments in response to the Bush Administration's proposed changes to Corporate Average Fuel Economy Standards (CAFE) - the nation's most successful oil savings law. These proposed changes, issued through the Department of Transportation, would weaken existing fuel economy standards. The administration's new proposal will make it easier for auto companies to qualify gas-guzzling SUVs and other &quot;light&quot; trucks for weaker fuel economy standards. In addition to its official comments, the Sierra Club delivered 16,000 postcards calling on Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta to raise CAFE standards to 40 miles per gallon within ten years. Taking this step would save more oil than the U.S. currently imports from the entire Persian Gulf or could ever take out of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, combined. </FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The Bush administration's proposal will cost consumers more at the pump, increase our oil dependence, and increase pollution,&quot; said Daniel Becker, Director of Sierra Club's Global Warming and Energy Program.. &quot;It's time for the Bush administration to stop making it easier for irresponsible automakers to get around these necessary standards.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Bush Administration's proposed changes to Corporate Average Fuel Economy Standards (CAFE) would close a loophole that exempts 8500 pound to 10,000 pound trucks from CAFE standards. However, the proposal would create an incentive for automakers to add weight to their other trucks, qualifying them for weaker standards. The proposal would create more truck weight classes, with different fuel economy standards for each classification. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Currently, CAFE standards only address two automotive classes: cars and light trucks (SUVs, pickups and vans). The Bush administrations proposal would divide the light truck fleet into additional classes with different fuel economy standards for each class.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Auto companies already add weight to trucks to place them over the current 8500 pound weight, which exempts them from CAFE standards. SUVs such as the Hummer, Suburban, Tahoe, and Excursion weigh 8600 pounds or more to utilize this loophole. By creating more truck weight classes, automaker will have new opportunities to fatten their vehicles to take advantage of weaker standards. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The Bush administration is proposing to manipulate the law to benefit auto and oil industry polluters,&quot; said Becker. &quot;The loophole the Bush administration proposes to close may move us one step forward, but the one they propose to open for the auto industry will likely move us three steps back.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">There is a better way. Instead of weakening existing standards, the Bush Administration should be putting American innovation to work by requiring automakers to make all of their vehicles - from sedans, to SUVs, to pickup trucks - go farther on a gallon of gas. The technology exists today to make all new vehicles average 40 miles per gallon within ten years. Taking this step would save consumer's money at the gas pump, cut America's oil dependence, and curb global warming. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Copies of Sierra Club's submitted comments are available upon request.</FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
