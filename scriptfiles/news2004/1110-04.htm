<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LAKE SUCCESS, NY -- November 10 -- Seeking answers to such scientific and conservation questions as the effects of fire suppression on a lizard and the population dynamics for a marmot, the doors of advanced study have opened for eight new Ph. D. students who are entering the scientific research field as 2004 Canon National Parks Science Scholars. </font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Each student is awarded a US$78,000 scholarship that will support research and education expenses during the next three years. The Canon National Parks Science Scholars Program helps develop the next generation of scientists working in the fields of conservation, environmental science and national park management. The scholarship program is a collaboration among Canon U.S.A., Inc., the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) and the National Park Service (NPS). </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While welcoming the class of 2004 that includes students from throughout the Americas, the participating organizations also officially opened competition for the 2005 Canon National Parks Science Scholars Program. Details of the 2005 competition are available at www.nature.nps.gov/canonscholarships </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;As a global leader in environmentally conscious management and technological innovation, we value the importance of scientific exploration and the protection of the global environment,&quot; said Kinya Uchida, president and CEO, Canon U.S.A., Inc. &quot;We are proud to be a founder of this unique scholar program.
