<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON -  January 9 - A new television commercial debuting this week will alert Vermonters that now is the time to let lawmakers know they want the pending medical marijuana bill to become law.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">   The commercial, sponsored by the Marijuana Policy Project, features Debbie Ramsdell of Charlotte, Vermont, discussing how medical marijuana helped her late husband Bob during his battle with the cancer that finally killed him in May 1999. &quot;How can you be against this when it helps people are who ill, who are dying?&quot; Ramsdell asks in the ad, which will air widely in Vermont starting this week. The commercial urges viewers to call Gov. James Douglas (R), who has expressed opposition to the bill.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">   The medical marijuana bill, S. 76, passed the Senate by a veto- proof 22-7 margin last year, but it then stalled in the House Health and Welfare Committee. In 2002, a similar bill easily passed the Republican-controlled House, but it died in the Senate due to the opposition of then-Gov. Howard Dean (D).</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">   A February 2002 poll by the Lucas Organization found that 75.7 percent of Vermont voters -- including 65.9 percent of Vermont Republicans -- support legal protection for medical marijuana patients.</FONT></P><P>   <FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Marijuana helped Bob when he was suffering, but both he and I could have gone to jail because of it,&quot; Ramsdell said. &quot;That's not right.&quot;</FONT></P><P>   <FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Vermonters overwhelmingly support the medical marijuana bill, but it appears to have stalled in the House,&quot; said Neal Levine, director of state policies for the Marijuana Policy Project. &quot;House Republicans may not want to buck a governor from their own party, just as Senate Democrats didn't want to confront Governor Dean two years ago. All of these officials should listen to Vermonters, who don't want cancer or AIDS patients to have to risk jail for using medical marijuana.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">   To view the new commercial on-line, please visit <A HREF="http://www.mpp.org/VTcommercial" TARGET="_new">http://www.mpp.org/VTcommercial</A> .</FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
