<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - June 15 - Leaders in the House of Representatives are attempting to use the excuse of current high gasoline prices to bring five  - and potentially more - extremely damaging energy bills to the floor for votes this week.  These bills will do nothing to bring down energy prices. They are a transparent bow to big oil companies who are already making record profits.  As some of these bills have been rejected repeatedly by the Senate, we can see this is not a serious attempt by the House to enact real energy solutions.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">These bills will threaten our public lands and coastlines with more oil and gas drilling, threaten our health with more air and water pollution, restrict states and citizens from voicing concerns about energy projects, shortcut environmental review when siting energy facilities, threaten consumers by allowing more Enron-like market manipulations, and hand billions of dollars in taxpayer money to energy companies in the form of subsidies.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">There is a better way to formulate energy policy.  The Bush Administration and Congressional leaders stubbornly trot out these backwards proposals again and again in the face of solutions that are available to us and that can actually move us forward in a responsible way.  We need policies that improve the efficiency of our cars, appliances, and homes; that really will reduce our dependence on oil; that will produce more of our electricity from clean, renewable energy, protect our lands and coastlines and keep consumers safe from market manipulation and abuse.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In another potential blow to public lands protection, the House is also voting on Interior Appropriations this week. Three important conservation amendments will be offered during floor consideration. Adoption of the amendments is critical to protecting America's great icons - Yellowstone National Park, Alaska's Tongass National Forest - and conserving our nation's wildlife for future generations.</FONT></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
