<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - September 30 - The National Organization for Women and its hundreds of thousands of members and supporters are calling on the press corps to report substance over style in the 2004 presidential debates. This trio of &quot;made for TV&quot; political theatrics may be the only opportunity to see the candidates free from scripts, aids and handlers. It is vital for the public to see and hear George W. Bush and John F. Kerry talk openly about the issues facing our country and the world. The media's sole responsibility is to provide us with a &quot;spin free&quot; account of the debates. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Take the time to fact-check,&quot; said NOW President Kim Gandy, &quot;and expose misrepresentations or misstatements by either candidate. Give us all the facts, good or bad&#151;just give us the truth. We'll know what to do with it.&quot; </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Millions of undecided votes may hinge on the outcome of these debates. NOW asks the media to remain aware of their power to influence these votes and exercise restraint. If there must be commentary, limit it to the issues, not an account of irrelevant fashion blunders or lazy body language. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;With the facts, we can choose a candidate who will help us achieve full equality for all women and girls everywhere,&quot; said Gandy. </font></p><p></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
