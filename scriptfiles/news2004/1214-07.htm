<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- December 14 -- The Pentagon is moving to sharply reduce its environmental duties, according to a draft directive released today by Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER). The proposed policy excludes anti-pollution work that does not directly &#147;sustain the national defense mission.&#148;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This new &#147;Department of Defense Directive&#148; would replace a Clinton-era directive on &#147;Environmental Security.&#148; The new directive trims a listing of Pentagon policy elements by eliminating provisions for &#151;</font></p><ul><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Reducing risk to human health and the environment by identifying, evaluating, and where necessary, remediating contamination resulting from past DoD activities&#148;;</font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Protecting, preserving, and, when required, restoring, and enhancing the quality of the environment&#148;; and</font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Conserving, and restoring where necessary, the natural and cultural heritage represented on DoD installations within the United States.&#148;</font></li></ul><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The Pentagon is transforming itself into an entity concerned only about its own logistics and facility management &#150; and the public be damned,&#148; stated PEER Executive Director Jeff Ruch, pointing to the Pentagon&#146;s recent efforts to exempt itself from an array of environmental laws. &#147;Under this new policy, who will protect America&#146;s waters, air and soil from the Pentagon?&#148; </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The new policy would also significantly cut Pentagon compliance with anti-pollution rules by dropping requirements that it obey &#147;regulations, Executive orders, binding international agreements&#148; and other federal &#147;environmental, safety, occupational health, explosives safety, fire and emergency services, and pest management policies.&#148; In its place, the Pentagon would pledge to only abide by &#147;applicable law and DoD policy.&#148;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In stripping away promises to improve or protect the environment, the new Directive instead says that the Pentagon &#147;will evaluate all activities&#133;and make prudent investments in initiatives that support mission accomplishment, enhance readiness, reduce future funding needs, prevent pollution, ensure cost effective compliance, and maximize the existing resource capability.&#148;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The Pentagon is preparing this self-serving shift without public debate or Congressional review,&#148; added Ruch. &#147;Under the new Directive, the Pentagon answers only to itself.&#148;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Department of Defense Directives define the agency&#146;s mission and responsibilities. By its terms, this Directive covers all &#147;DoD operations, activities, and installations worldwide, including Government-owned/contractor-operated facilities.&#148;</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
