Exxon has failed to meet its promise of cleanup and restoration or to settle with over 30,000 residents. From studies following the Exxon Valdez spill, scientists have found that oil at least 1000 times more toxic than previously thought. New information reveals that hundreds if not thousands of oil spill cleanup workers are suffering debilitating illnesses as a result of their exposure to highly toxic oil and solvent mixtures. Presenters will present evidence that the unanticipated long-term impacts of the oil spill dictate that Exxon pay the additional $100 million &quot;Re-opener for Unknown Injury,&quot; as required by the 1991 legal settlement, and call on Congress to respond with more stringent policies.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Visuals: Large format photos; jars of oiled rocks taken from the beaches of Prince William Sound in last week; B-roll video available.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Interviews available at any time with fishermen, community representatives, scientists, oil industry experts, advocates, Alaska Natives, chemically-injured workers and Alaska high schools students.</FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
