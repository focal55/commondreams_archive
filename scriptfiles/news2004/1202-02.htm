<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MILL VALLEY, CA -- December 2 -- Organic Bouquet.com, the nation's first online organic florist announces today that its new Peace Wreath, a peace sign made from wild-crafted Long Needle Pine, will benefit Adopt-A Minefield&reg;.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Adopt-A-Minefield is a program of the United Nations Association of the USA, which engages individuals, community groups and businesses in the United Nations effort to resolve the global landmine crisis.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Peace Wreath is made from Long Needle Pine, a traditional holiday evergreen that grows in the Pacific Northwest. It is sixteen inches in diameter and sells for $49.95 plus $9.95 for overnight shipping anywhere in the United States. The Company will donate 15% from the sale of each wreath purchased at www.organicbouquet.com to Adopt-A-Minefield <a href="http://www.landmines.org/" target="_new">(www.landmines.org</a>)</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to Organic Bouquet&#146;s CEO Gerald Prolman, &quot;Peace on earth is a universal theme that speaks to the one of the deepest wishes of humankind today. It is rewarding and purposeful for Organic Bouquet to dedicate a portion of the proceeds from our Peace Wreath to Adopt-A-Minefield who is performing such a critical humanitarian service. It can be a heart warming experience for our customers to know that this wreath not only fulfills the joy of giving, it also helps make the world a safer place.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The idea behind Adopt-A-Minefield is both powerful and simple. Designed to move beyond political and policy debates, the Campaign seeks national and international sponsors to adopt minefields that the United Nations has identified as being in urgent need of clearance. Cliff Bryant, Adopt-A-Minefield&#146;s Marketing Manager, sees this as a natural alliance. &quot;Both organizations are concerned with the quality of the environment, with making the world a safer, saner place to live. We are delighted to partner with Organic Bouquet, giving us the opportunity to reach and engage even more people directly in our mission.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Organic Bouquet's mission is to set a new standard for the floral industry that upholds the well-being of farm workers, the protection of eco-systems, and the preservation of our planet. The Company ships it floral products directly from the grower, guaranteeing long-lasting wreaths and fresh flowers.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
