<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - November 15 - There will be a recount of the presidential vote in Ohio.</font></p>
<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On Thursday, David Cobb, the Green Party&#146;s 2004 presidential candidate, announced his intention to seek a recount of the vote in Ohio.  Since the required fee for a statewide recount is $113,600, the only question was whether that money could be raised in time to meet the filing deadline.  That question has been answered.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Thanks to the thousands of people who have contributed to this effort, we can say with certainty that there will be a recount in Ohio,&#148; said Blair Bobier, Media Director for the Cobb-LaMarche campaign. </font></p>
<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The grassroots support for the recount has been astounding.  The donations have come in fast and furiously, with the vast majority in the $10-$50 range, allowing us to meet our goal for the first phase of the recount effort in only four days,&#148; said Bobier.</font></p>
<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bobier said the campaign is still raising money for the next phase of the recount effort which will be recruiting, training and mobilizing volunteers to monitor the actual recount.</font></p>
<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Ohio presidential election was marred by numerous press and independent reports of mis-marked and discarded ballots, problems with electronic voting machines and the targeted disenfranchisement of African American voters.  A number of citizens&#146; groups and voting rights organizations are holding the second of two hearings today in Columbus, Ohio, to take testimony from voters, poll watchers and election experts about problems with the Ohio vote.  The hearing, from 6-9 p.m., will be held at the </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Courthouse, meeting room A, 373 S. High St., in Columbus.  The Cobb-LaMarche campaign will be represented at the hearing by campaign manager Lynne Serpe.             </font></p>
<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A demand for a recount in Ohio can only be filed by a presidential candidate who was either a certified write-in candidate or on the ballot in that state.  Both Green Party candidate David Cobb and Libertarian candidate Michael Badnarik will be demanding a recount.  No other candidate has stated an intention to seek a recount and no other citizen or organization would have legal standing to do so in Ohio.  The Cobb-LaMarche campaign is still exploring the possibility of seeking recounts in other states but no decision has been made yet.</font></p><p align="CENTER">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
