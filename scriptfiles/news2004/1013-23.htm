<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>What: </b>Judge Joyce Hens Green will conduct the first open court proceedings for the prisoners interned at Guantanamo Bay since the United States Supreme Court ruled on June 28, 2004, that the Constitution requires the government to justify the detentions.</font>
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Immediately following the hearing, counsel for the petitioners - including the only two lawyers involved in the habeas cases who have actually been allowed to travel to Guantanamo to see their clients- will meet the press on the steps of the courthouse.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>When:</b> Wednesday October 13 at 10 a.m. Spokespersons will meet press as soon as hearing adjourns.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Where: Courtroom 2 of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, 333 Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, D.C. 20001. (Located at Third Street and Constitution Avenue, Northwest, one block west of the United States Capitol.) (202) 354-3000.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Who:</b> Lawyers for several of the detainees will be available for comment:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Muneer Ahmad, Associate Professor, American University Washington College of Law, counsel to O.K., a Canadian citizen detained as a minor.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Joshua Colangelo-Bryan, Dorsey &amp; Whitney LLP, counsel for six Bahraini nationals who had been working in Pakistan when they were jailed by Pakistani authorities. Subsequently, they were transferred to U.S. authorities in Afghanistan and then Guantanamo Bay. Published reports have described that at least two of the Bahrainis have been subjected to serious physical abuse while at Guantanamo Bay.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Gitanjali S. Gutierrez, Gibbons, Del Deo, Dolan, Griffinger &amp; Vecchione, counsel to Mozaam Begg and Feroz Abbasi, both British detainees.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Robert C. Kirsch, Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP, counsel to six Bosnian-Algerian detainees who were working and living in Bosnia when they were jailed by Bosnian authorities. The six were taken into custody by the United States after the Bosnian Supreme Court ruled there was insufficient evidence to justify their further detention, and ordered their release. The Bosnia-Herzegovina Human Rights Chamber Court later determined that the Bosnians' rights under the European Convention on Human Rights had been violated.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- George Brent Mickum, IV, Keller and Heckman, LLP, counsel to three businessmen taken into custody in The Republic of The Gambia while working to establish a peanut oil processing facility there.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Barbara Olshansky, Deputy Director for Litigation and Organizing, Center for Constitutional Rights, counsel to detainees in the Habib, El Banna, Begg, and O.K. actions.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Tom Wilner, Shearman &amp; Sterling LLP, counsel to twelve Kuwaiti detainees who won a landmark Supreme Court victory in June holding that US federal courts must hear challenges to the legality of his clients' detention.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Background: Since June, a dozen habeas actions filed on behalf of over sixty detainees from around the world-some of whom have been held for almost three years - are now pending before the court. The arguments being heard on Wednesday concern a series of motions designed to obtain open access to the petitioners and to implement the ruling of the Supreme Court by forcing the government to explain the bases for the detentions fully and publicly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Commenting on the hearing, Professor Eric M. Freedman, a habeas corpus expert at Hofstra Law School who is assisting the detainees, said, &quot;In the three and a half months since the Supreme Court ruled that Guantanamo is not a legal black hole, the government has been doing everything possible to make it blacker.&quot; &quot;This massive resistance to the rule of law must end,&quot; he continued. &quot;It is long since high time for President Bush to order Attorney General Ashcroft to step aside from the courtroom door.&quot;</font></p>
