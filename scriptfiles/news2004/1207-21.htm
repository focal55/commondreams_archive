<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- December 7 -- Today, the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers sued the California Air Resources Board (ARB) over ARB's rule implementing the state's vehicle global warming law.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It is disappointing - though not surprising - that the same automakers buying ads touting their environmental commitments are suing to prevent California from protecting its citizens from the effects of global warming,&quot; said Dan Becker, Washington Director of the Sierra Club's Global Warming Program.  &quot;If these automakers are so committed to reducing global warming emissions, why are they suing to prevent California from doing just that?&quot; continued Becker.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Recently, General Motors has run ads promoting its diesel-electric &quot;magic bus.&quot;  Additionally, Ford has recently committed to cutting 45% of its global warming emissions from all its cars by 2030.  And Fujio Cho, Toyota's President, has said &quot;if automakers don't reduce smog-forming emissions, greenhouse gases, and the need for petroleum, I believe we won't be in business.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Assembly Bill 1493 - sometimes known as the Pavely Law, after its lead sponsor - would require automobile makers to reduce global warming emissions from new cars and light trucks beginning in 2009.  The Pavely Law is a large step in the right direction because it delivers clean car choices for consumers, and encourages cost-effective, currently available technology to reduce global warming emissions.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Auto companies should give their lawyers a break and instead put their engineers to work doing what their ads claim - protecting people from global warming,&quot; continued Becker.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Pavely Law has widespread support from Californians, a majority of the California legislature, and Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Seven other U.S. states and Canada are in various stages of adopting California's global warming law.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers is a trade association that includes all of the major automobile manufacturers except for Honda Motor Car Company.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
