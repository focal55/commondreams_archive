<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - February 5 -  Americans for Democratic Action (ADA), the nation's oldest independent   liberal political organization, along with numerous coalition partners  expressed concern this week with regards to the President's decision  to establish a commission to investigate prewar intelligence on Iraq.</FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> The Education For Peace in Iraq Center, the Council for a Livable  World, NETWORK: A National Catholic Social Justice Lobby, and others  joined ADA in sending letters to President George W. Bush, Speaker of  the House J. Dennis Hastert, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist and Senate Minority Leader Thomas Daschle.</FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> The letter states: &quot;the type of inquiry outlined by the White House  may fail to address many critical issues in an open, independent, and  timely fashion.  Such a failure could further undermine the U.S.  government's credibility at home and abroad, impacting our nation's  ability to work effectively with the international community and address current and future threats to our national security.&quot;</FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> The group councils that the investigation must examine both the  Administration's prewar intelligence assessments on Iraq and the  representation of those assessments by senior Administration officials. The scope of the investigation should include the substance,  interpretation, and presentation of the intelligence by administration  officials.  Any investigation should be conducted by truly independent  and qualified experts and be appointed by Congress and White House,  and requiring the consent of the minority leadership. Bi-partisan  balance and diversity should be considerations.</FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> The commission must operate as openly and transparently as possible.  Trust and credibility with the U.S. public is essential. Additionally,  the commission must begin this inquiry quickly and present clear  findings without delay.</FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> To restore public trust, rebuild U.S. credibility abroad, and ensure  government accountability on decisions of war and peace, the  investigation into the quality of U.S. intelligence and the use of  that intelligence in making the case for war must be truly independent  and as prompt, thorough and open as possible.</FONT></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
