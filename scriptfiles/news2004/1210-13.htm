<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- December 10 -- On December 10, the Task Force signed on to the letter below to all members of Congress. The letter was prompted by a front page article in the New York Times entitled &quot;Groups Debate Slower Strategy on Gay Rights&quot; (available at <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/09/national/09gays.html" target="_new">http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/09/national/09gays.html</a>).</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On December 11, the Washington Post featured a story about the issue on page 2 entitled &quot;Gay Rights Activists Refuse to Bargain Away Rights&quot; (available at <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A53579-2004Dec9.html" target="_new">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A53579-2004Dec9.html</a>).</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If you would like to sign onto this letter, please visit our online action center and send a copy to your Senators and Representative. We will send another copy of the letter to Congress next week with all of our names.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thank you as always for your support.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Matt Foreman</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The following letter was sent to all members of the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Where We Stand</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">December 9, 2004</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dear Member of Congress (or Senator) ___________:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">First, know that we appreciate and value the thoughtful and visionary leadership so many of you have provided. As a community, we are proud to have allies in both parties.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There has been much speculation over the last month about the meaning of the results of the last election and its impact on the future of American politics. Some have even suggested that same-sex marriage was a major factor in the outcome. Upon reflection, thoughtful analysts have come to dismiss that notion and realize that terrorism and the War in Iraq were uppermost on people's minds.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The powerful and revealing fact is that that over 60% of voters in November 2 exit polls said they supported either marriage or civil unions for gay and lesbian couples. What remarkable progress we have made over these last years.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The New York Times today reported that some in the LGBT community are ready to pull back on our struggle for freedom to make everyone more comfortable politically, or willing to bargain away the rights of others to make a deal for themselves. Specifically, the notion was advanced that we could make gains at the expense of senior citizens by privatizing Social Security.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For our part, we want to be absolutely clear and on the record: We specifically reject any attempts to trade equal rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, a group that includes many elders, for the rights of senior citizens under Social Security or, for that matter, the rights of any other group of Americans.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Finally, although the struggle for freedom can be difficult and painful for those without full equality, it would be an historic mistake to grow tired of the battle or surrender basic rights and equality in order to make the road easier. We have made it through some extremely harsh and challenging times, including losing thousands and thousands of our friends and family to HIV/AIDS. This is a community that has heroically walked its own path of tribulations and travail, determined to be free and proud American citizens.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We will not sacrifice our rights - or the rights of others like senior citizens  on the altar of political expediency. Most of us, if confronted with that choice, would not even know where to begin. Which right would we give up? The right to adopt children? The right to serve our country proudly and with honor? The right to be at our partners bedside in death? And how much would we be willing to hurt others like seniors as part of a cynical deal to help ourselves? We are not for sale to those who would undermine Social Security and we are not prepared to walk away from political leaders who have stood with us.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nothing short of full equality and protection granted to all other American citizens is acceptable. We know that these are times that require wise and brave people who believe and love justice and freedom.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Given recent events, we wanted to restate our determination to do whats right  for our community, for senior citizens, and for America. With the greatest respect,</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sincerely,</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Diane Abbitt, Co-Chair, Equality California<br>David Barr<br>Roberta Bennett<br>Betty Berzon, Ph.D.<br>Steve Black, Political Director, The Pennsylvania Gay And Lesbian Alliance (PA-GALA)<br>David Bohnett<br>Craig A.
