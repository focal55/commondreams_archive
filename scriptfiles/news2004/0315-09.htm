<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - March 15 - The drumbeat for censure of the President grows for his reckless refusal to tell the Congress and the American people the truth about his reasons for invading Iraq.  </FONT></p><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Win Without War and its member organizations, including MoveOn.org, True Majority and Working Assets, together have gathered more than 600,000 petitions and messages urging censure.  Many of the participating organizations have seen explosive growth since the rev-up to the war began.   MoveOn.org alone has increased its membership from 400,000 to more than 2 million, largely on the strength of its opposition to the Bush war effort.  </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;Win Without War organizations and their members are highly motivated and mobilized over the Iraq misadventure.  In addition to the campaign to censure the president, they will be part of a continuing set of actions through 2004, and their numbers will continue to grow,&#148; said Tom Andrews, National Director of Win Without War, which led a massive &#147;Virtual March on Washington&#148; and several thousand vigils last year to try to stop the attack on Iraq.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">TV ads will run this week in Washington and New York, along with a full-page New York Times.  Additional ad buys around censure and other actions will follow.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">These experts are available to discuss the war and provide alternative voices for your programming to the Bush Administration happy talk about the Iraq fiasco:</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Tom Andrews -- Former Congressman (D-ME) and member of the House Armed Services Committee, National Director of Win Without War, a coalition of national organizations that has challenged the invasion from the beginning and continues to confront the recklessness of the Bush Doctrine  of unilateral engagement.

Bush for misleading it and the country about weapons of mass destruction, misstating the truth about Iraq&#146;s nuclear weapons capability and inventing ties between Iraq and Al Qaeda.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Larry Johnson - Larry C.
