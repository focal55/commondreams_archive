<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SAN FRANCISCO -- December 2 -- The New York Times will today publish a full-page open letter from Michael Brune, executive director of Rainforest Action Network, to Bill Ford, Jr., chairman and CEO of Ford Motor Company, highlighting the automaker&#146;s longstanding last place EPA fuel efficiency ranking, broken promises and greenwashing.  Under the headline &#147;Gas guzzling is un-American,&#148; the letter calls on Ford to reclaim its spirit of innovation and lead the United States to a future free from oil.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the letter Mr. Brune reminds Mr. Ford that more than 50 percent of America&#146;s oil supply now comes from conflict regions like the Middle East and that more that 100 million Americans currently live in cities that exceed federal health guidelines for air quality. &#147;We&#146;ve cured polio, put a man on the moon and decoded the human genome,&#148; writes Mr. Brune. &#147;Surely the car company that revolutionized transportation in its first decade in business can produce a fleet of zero emission vehicles by 2020.&#148;<br> <br>Today&#146;s open letter is the latest in a series of ads aimed at debunking Ford&#146;s misleading multimillion dollar marketing blitz to &#145;green the blue oval.&#146;  Publications including Mother Jones, Utne and The Progressive are running full-page color ads featuring a fleet of flag-draped Ford SUVs under the headline &#147;The ultimate price of oil addiction.&#148; A July 4th outdoor advertising campaign in major auto markets earlier this year depicted the Statue of Liberty struggling to breath free through a military-grade gas mask and called on Americans to declare independence from oil and demand zero emission cars from Ford.<br> <br>&#147;Something has gone terribly wrong in Detroit,&#148; said Sarah Connolly, a grassroots leader with the Jumpstart Ford Campaign.  &#147;The year Mr. Ford took the helm, America&#146;s flagship automaker started sinking to the bottom of the EPA&#146;s fuel efficiency rankings where it remains today.  Polls show that Americans are growing extremely concerned about the devastating effect that oil addiction and global warming will have on their children&#146;s future.  The time is long overdue for Americans to see Ford take immediate action to improve its fleet-wide fuel efficiency and ultimately eliminate tailpipe emissions.  If the global thermostat isn&#146;t turned down now, future generations will face almost unthinkable consequences.&#148;<br> <br>&#147;According to the EPA, Ford has been on an oil binge for decades,&#148; said Jennifer Krill, director of the Zero Emissions Campaign at Rainforest Action Network. &#147;Hybrid and all-electric vehicles of all makes and models are famous for their long waiting lists, yet Ford blames lack of consumer demand for the under-production of its one hybrid model.  Americans want clean cars so much that we are willing to wait for them, but global warming can&#146;t be put on Ford&#146;s waiting list.  Human-induced climate change is already causing the Arctic ice-cap to melt at such an unprecedented rate that by the summer of 2070 it may have no ice at all.&#148;<br> <br>&#147;Polls shows that we have a mandate to connect the dots between Ford&#146;s addiction to oil and the ultimate price that Americans are paying at home and abroad,&#148; said Michael Brune, executive director of Rainforest Action Network. &#147;Ford needs to move beyond its one green roof and build a fleet of green cars now.  Real leadership from Ford means ending an oil addiction that is destroying our environment, economy, health and national security.&#148;<br> <br>Rainforest Action Network campaigns for the forests, their inhabitants and the natural systems that sustain life by transforming the global marketplace through grassroots organizing, education and non-violent direct action.<br> <br>Hi-res PDFs for reproduction available.
