<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">LA FARGE, WI - May 3 - For safe, nutritious food, Americans place more trust in smaller scale family farms than in large scale industrial farms, according to a national consumer opinion poll conducted by Roper Public Affairs on behalf of Organic Valley Family of Farms, the largest and only independent national organic farmers&#146; cooperative.</FONT></p><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Americans overwhelmingly say that smaller scale family farms are more likely to care about food safety than large scale industrial farms by a 71% to 15% margin. More than eight in ten consumers (85%) say they trust smaller scale family farms to produce safe, nutritious food.  Almost twice as many consumers (45%) place a lot of trust in smaller scale family farms compared to large scale industrial farms (24%).</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;Once again, the American public has placed their trust in the family &#150; the family farm.  Small and mid-sized family farmers take great pride in the integrity and quality of the food they produce.  We are farming for the next generation and not solely for this year&#146;s profits. Our children and yours are our utmost concern and that is why we do everything we can to avoid polluting our bodies, our animals and the earth.  Thank you America for your vote of confidence!&#148; said George Siemon, founding farmer and CEO of Organic Valley. </FONT></P><P> </P><P><B><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Survey Indicates Smaller Family Farms are Better for People, Planet</FONT></B></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Nearly seven in ten Americans (69%) say smaller scale family farms are more likely than large scale industrial farms (22%) to use techniques that won&#146;t harm the environment. Farming techniques today, such as the use of pesticides and genetic engineering, can have many effects on the natural environment.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Overall, seven in ten Americans express at least moderate concern about the health risks of pesticides, hormones, antibiotics and other chemicals used in food production (70%), with just over one in four (28%) saying these chemicals pose a high risk to human health.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Women (79%) are significantly more likely than men (61%) to say the pesticides, hormones, and antibiotics used to produce many foods pose a moderate or high risk to human health. Men (32%) are nearly twice as likely as women (17%) to say those chemicals pose minor or no risk to human health.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><B><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Other highlights of the Organic Valley-Roper Food and Farming Survey include:</FONT></B></P><P> </P><P><B><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&middot;         Consumers Will Pay More </FONT></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Two-thirds of Americans say they would pay more for foods produced without chemicals such as pesticides, antibiotics and hormones. Women (71%) are more likely than men (62%) to say they&#146;d pay more. About half of those surveyed (51%) say they would be willing to pay a premium for foods produced with humane treatment of animals. Four in ten (42%) would not.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><B><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&middot;         Decline of U.S. Farms is Troubling</FONT></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the number of U.S. farms has dropped from seven million in the 1930&#146;s to about two million today, and 330 farmers leave the land every week. The public is troubled by this pattern. Fully 82% say they are at least somewhat concerned with the decline in the number of American farms; nearly half (46%) are very concerned.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><B><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&middot;         Important to Know if Food is Grown Locally</FONT></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Most consumers find it important to know whether food is grown or produced locally or regionally. Overall, 73% of them find this information important, with 38% saying it is very important. Americans living in the Northeast (83%) were more likely to say this was important than those in the South (71%), West (70%) or Midwest (70%).</FONT></P><P> </P><P><B><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&middot;         Labels Would Have an Impact</FONT></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Most Americans (73%) report that having food labels specify whether a product was produced with pesticides, hormones, antibiotics or genetically modified ingredients would have an impact on their product choice. </FONT></P><P> </P><P><B><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Methodology</FONT></B></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Food and Farming 2004 study was conducted by Roper Public Affairs via telephone among a nationally representative sample of 1,000 adults, age 18 or older.  Interviews were conducted from March 26 to April 10, 2004, using a Random Digit Dialing (RDD) methodology to include both listed and unlisted phone numbers. The margin of error due to sampling is plus or minus three percentage points at the .95 confidence level, although it is larger for the results for smaller subgroups of the public. The demographic characteristics of the random sample were compared with the most recent Census Bureau estimates and corrective weights were applied to ensure proper representation based on age, gender, education, race and region.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><B><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">About Roper Public Affairs</FONT></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Roper Public Affairs, a NOP World company, is a leading global marketing research and consulting firm with headquarters in New York and offices in London, Manila and throughout the U.S. NOP World is among the ten largest global market research companies in the U.S. and the world.
