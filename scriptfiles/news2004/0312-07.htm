<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">NEW YORK - March 11 - Today, attorneys with the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) reacted to the news that two of their clients were among the five British men released from. Guant&aacute;namo and subsequently, British detention yesterday. Shafiq Rasul and Asif Iqbal are both named in a pending Supreme Court challenge brought by the CCR challenging the indefinite detention of Guant&aacute;namo detainees.</FONT></p><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;While we are thrilled that our clients and the others who, after two years of unjustified detention have finally been released, we continue to be disturbed by the actions of the U.S. government. After calling them the &#145;worst of the worst,&#146; the U.S. interrogated these men for more than two years and found nothing, yet the British Government can determine their innocence within 24 hours and return them to their families.&#148; said Barbara Olshansky, Deputy Legal Director of the Center.  &#147;The Administration deprived them of access to a court, a lawyer, and their families.  After all of this, no charges were ever made against them.  If our government had initially done what it was legally bound to do &#150; give these people the opportunity to challenge their detention from the outset &#150; we would not have caused the grievous error of wrongly imprisoning people in violation of U.S. and international law.&#148;</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Rachel Meeropol, a military justice expert at CCR, stated, &#147;The lack of judicial process at Guant&aacute;namo violated not only U.S. constitutional law and international humanitarian law, but also our own Uniform Code of Military Justice. The absence of any judicial process places our country in the position of providing an unacceptable example for the rest of world in terms of willful disregard for the rule of law.&#148;</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Added, Michael Ratner, President of CCR,  &#147;These British releases show that the entire Guant&aacute;namo detention scheme is a lawless fraud. It may well be that  most of those held at that off-shore interrogation camp should be freed immediately. These releases demonstrate the importance of adherence to law and the inhumane folly of the Bush Administration&#146;s reliance on executive fiat.&#148;</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The case before the Supreme Court is Rasul v. Bush and will be argued on April 20th, 2004.</FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
