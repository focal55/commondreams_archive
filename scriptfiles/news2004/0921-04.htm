<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BOSTON - September 21 - <i>&quot;I personally think that society is responsible for a very significant percentage of what I&sup1;ve earned.&quot; -- </i>Warren Buffett, No. 2 on the Forbes 400.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHAT: Expert analysis of Forbes 400 richest Americans (to be released this week), illustrating how society has helped them become wealthy, spotlighting selected individuals, and discussing policies that support or undermine broad wealth creation.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHO:  Responsible Wealth Founders and Directors, Chuck Collins, Scott Klinger, and Mike Lapham. They co-authored the recent report, &quot;I Didn't Do It Alone: Society&sup1;s Contribution to Individual Wealth and Success.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHY: Year after year, the Forbes 400 includes many whose wealth is called &quot;self-made.&quot; But this perpetuation of the Horatio Alger myth is destructive to our society and to wealth creation itself.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Whether helped by public research and government contracts, public education, wide-ranging taxpayer-financed infrastructure, or the myriad publicly supported and regulated institutions, no one can claim they did it alone. And yet, the myth persists.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A growing danger is that the myth can be used to justify reducing public investment in the very institutions and infrastructure that not only enable more Americans to become wealthy, but maintain a strong economy.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Some of these billionaires want to pull up the ladder behind them. They received government help but don&sup1;t want anyone else to.&quot; &shy; Scott Klinger, Co-Director of Responsible Wealth.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Responsible Wealth is a national network of business people and affluent Americans concerned about deepening economic inequality who advocate for widespread prosperity. <a href="http://www.responsiblewealth.org" target="_new">www.responsiblewealth.org</a>.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
