Was it fairly counted? What do the results mean to progressive politics in the US and around the world? </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As part of its DEFINING THE ISSUES SERIES, on Wednesday, November 3, 2004 --one day after the election-- the Institute for Policy Studies will convene a Town Hall Meeting so that progressive political leaders can express their views on the election results and plans for the future.  During the two hour discussion, a panel of experts will join an audience of political activists from the peace and global justice movements to explore the electoral process and the vote counting.  There will also be an exploration of what impact the winners of the election will have on foreign and domestic policies, and what activists can do to influence these policies.  Please come and let your voices be heard. The discussion will be carried live on WPFW-FM in Washington, D.C. and other Pacifica stations. <br> <br><b>Panel:</b></font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jamin Raskin, Professor, American University Washington School of Law, and author of several    books on elections and democracy </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Karen Dolan, Fellow, Institute for Policy Studies and coordinator of Cities for Peace</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Steve Cobble, strategist for presidential campaigns of George McGovern, Jesse Jackson and Rep.
