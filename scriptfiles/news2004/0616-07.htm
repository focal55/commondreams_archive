<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - June 16 - The United States has established a global network of detention facilities holding suspects in the &quot;war on terror.&quot; Some are known, including prisons at Guantanamo Bay, Bagram Air Force Base, and Abu Ghraib. Less well known are additional facilities reported in Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Jordan, and aboard U.S. ships at sea. All of these facilities operate without the openness and disclosure required by law.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">A new report by Human Rights First outlines the known and suspected detention facilities maintained by the United States in the global &quot;war on terror,&quot; and explains the rules that mandate greater disclosure and monitoring of how many are detained at these facilities and why they are there.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WHAT: Press briefing on what is known about U.S.-operated detention facilities. Release of new report &quot;Ending Secret Detentions.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WHO:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">-- Deborah Pearlstein, director, U.S. Law and Security Program, Human Rights First</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">-- Lt. Gen. Robert Gard (USA-Ret.), former president, National Defense University</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WHERE: National Press Club, Zenger Room, 529 14th St., N.W., Washington, D.C.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WHEN: Thursday, June 17, 12 pm</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WHY: Currently, U.S.-operated detention facilities function with excessive secrecy and inadequate oversight -- even the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is not given adequate access to check on the status, health and treatment of detainees. Given the current scandal of abuses at Abu Ghraib and information contained in a series of leaked Justice and Defense Department memos counseling how U.S. officials might avoid laws prohibiting torture, the U.S. needs to openly discuss its detention policies and shed light on the many areas of darkness that remain. Openness will ensure prisoner safety, help protect American troops abroad, and ultimately strengthen U.S. national security.</FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
