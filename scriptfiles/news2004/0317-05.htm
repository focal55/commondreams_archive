<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Executive director of the People's Opinion Project, Bice said today: &quot;International public opinion polling shows continued strong opposition to U.S. foreign policy among the people of the world... The Pew Center poll released yesterday found majorities in all foreign countries surveyed, except Britain, had unfavorable views of the U.S. and 'believe that controlling Mideast oil supplies is an important reason why the U.S. is conducting the war on terrorism.' In all foreign countries, majorities had an unfavorable opinion of President Bush and 'believe that America pays little or no attention to their country's interests in making its foreign policy decisions' -- in contrast, 70 percent of Americans think the U.S. takes other nations' interests into account.&quot; [See:<A HREF="http://people-press.org/reports/display.php3?PageID=795" TARGET="_new"> http://people-press.org/reports/display.php3?PageID=795</A>]</FONT><br>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Normand is executive director and Zaidi is research director of the Center for Economic and Social Rights. They are currently working on a book about the U.N. and human rights. Normand said today: &quot;By hastily, and apparently falsely, condemning the bombings in Spain as 'perpetrated by the terrorist group ETA,' [see: <A HREF="http://www.ipsnews.net/interna.asp?idnews=22887" TARGET="_new">www.ipsnews.net/interna.asp?idnews=22887</A>] and by ignoring an unconstitutional coup against President Aristide with the astonishing claim to 'support the constitutional succession and political process now underway in Haiti,' the Security Council has acted openly as a vehicle for narrow great power interests.&quot; The center released the report &quot;Tearing Up the Rules: The Illegality of Invading Iraq&quot; just before the invasion of Iraq.

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">President of TransAfrica Forum, Fletcher said today: &quot;To encourage a multinational force to enter Haiti after the overthrow of a legitimately elected government as the U.N. Security Council has done, without the slightest condemnation of the actions of the opponents of democracy, is not only misplaced but encourages the flouting of constitutional rule....&quot;</FONT><br>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Author of Full Spectrum Dominance: U.S. Power in Iraq and Beyond, Mahajan said today: &quot;While Hans Blix has at times disagreed with the U.S. government, he has peddled falsehoods at crucial times on its behalf. For example, when he arrived in Baghdad to begin the UNMOVIC inspections, in November 2002, the Washington Post reported: 'Had Iraq complied with a U.N. order to disarm after the Persian Gulf War in 1991, Blix said, &quot;then 10 years of sanctions would have been unnecessary.&quot;' This is false -- for over a decade the U.S. insisted that crushing economic sanctions be maintained regardless of Iraqi disarmament. [See: <A HREF="http://www.accuracy.org/iraq" TARGET="_new">www.accuracy.org/iraq</A>] Now Blix has been claiming that if the U.S. government knew that Iraq had no WMDs it would not have moved toward invasion. But the administration was shown to have lied about Iraqi WMDs before the invasion began. [See: <A HREF="http://www.accuracy.org/press_releases/PR031803.htm" TARGET="_new">www.accuracy.org/press_releases/PR031803.htm</A>] IAEA head Mohamed El Baradei said on March 7, 2003: 'There is no indication of resumed nuclear activities.' But Cheney on March 16, 2003, claimed Iraq 'reconstituted nuclear weapons.' More deeply, Blix's book is entitled Disarming Iraq, but a recent U.N. report finds that Iraq was disarmed by 1994. [See: <A HREF="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines04/0302-07.htm" TARGET="_new">www.commondreams.org/headlines04/0302-07.htm</A>] This is what Iraqi defector Hussein Kamel had told the U.S. years ago.&quot; [See: <A HREF="http://www.fair.org/press-releases/kamel.html" TARGET="_new">www.fair.org/press-releases/kamel.html</A>]</FONT></li>
