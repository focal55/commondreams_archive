<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- December 10 -- The National Organization for Women remains deeply committed to equal marriage rights for every committed couple in the United States. Our goal to achieve marriage equality has not been changed by the outcome of the 2004 election, and post-election data proves that the marriage issue did not the cost Sen. John Kerry the presidency.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We are committed to seeing that full marriage and social equality are a reality for same-sex couples,&quot; said NOW President Kim Gandy. &quot;We are asking our allies not to cave to pressure created by the radical right. We will not compromise our values. We will not allow discrimination to be written into the Constitution.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Ensuring equal marriage rights will demonstrate this country's commitment to diversity, equality, tolerance and respect - ideals that we continue to promote throughout the world,&quot; said Gandy. &quot;The civil rights movement fought for interracial couples to be able to marry - and we won. We're fighting for marriage rights again, this time for same-sex couples. Again, we will win.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Moving further to the center or the right is a faulty tactic,&quot; said Gandy. &quot;We must stand firm in who we are and continue fighting until our vision for marriage equality is won.&quot;<br></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
