<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NEW MEXICO -- December 28 -- Attorneys for Green Party presidential candidate David Cobb 
will 
file a Notice of Appeal on Tuesday from a District Court decision which 
rejected Cobb's request to start the New Mexico recount without paying 
the 
entire cost of it in advance.  Last week the New Mexico Supreme Court 
declined to hear the case.  Since the Supreme Court did not rule on the 
merits of the case, it can be heard by the New Mexico Court of Appeals.
          <p>  The Notice will be filed on behalf of Cobb and Libertarian 
presidential candidate Michael Badnarik who are both seeking a recount 
of 
New Mexico's presidential vote.  The candidates paid the state a 
deposit of 
over $100,000, and say that New Mexico law does not require that the 
entire 
amount of the recount be paid in advance.
           <p> "We believe the law is on our side and look forward to a 
full 
recount of the presidential vote.  There are still many unanswered 
questions 
about provisional ballots, missing votes and the integrity of voting 
machines which don't produce a paper trail.  The people of New Mexico 
deserve to know that their votes will be counted fairly and 
accurately," 
said Cobb.
           <p> On Tuesday, Cobb and Badnarik's attorneys will also be 
notifying 
the New Mexico Secretary of State, the Attorney General and the Clerks 
for 
all of New Mexico's 33 counties, that the Notice of Appeal prevents 
them 
from "opening and clearing" voting machines throughout the state.
          <p>  "Although, generally, voting machines can be cleared 30 
days 
after the official certification of the vote, New Mexico law is clear 
that 
this can't happen when a recount has been initiated.  The candidates 
have 
paid the deposit for the recount and we expect it to go forward, so any 
adjustment to the machines would be clearly inappropriate until the 
recount 
has been concluded," said Lowell Finley, one of the attorneys 
representing 
the candidates.
