<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">NEW YORK - May 31 - The War Resisters League, the 80-year-old peace organization, is proud to announce that its 2004 Peace Award will be given to Fernando Suarez del Solar.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Fernando Suarez del Solar paid the highest price for &quot;regime change&quot; in Iraq. His son, Jesus Alberto Suarez del Solar Navarro, was a Marine killed at the beginning of the war last year. He was killed not by the Republican guard or Saddam loyalists, but by a U.S. cluster bomb.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Mr. Suarez del Solar mourns the death of his son in an immoral war and is working with <A HREF="http://www.mfso.org/" TARGET="_new">Military Families Speak Out</A>, a network of families opposed to the war in Iraq. In December 2003 Mr. Suarez de Solar took his grief to Iraq. With other military families, he went to see where his son died and to try and understand why.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WRL bestows the Peace Award annually on activists who have generously contributed their time, hard work and creative energies to the movement for peace and justice. WRL honors people who may not be well known in the media as movement leaders, but who are carrying out important work behind the scenes or at the grassroots community level.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Please join us to honor Fernando Suarez del Solar</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WRL Annual Dinner and Peace Award</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Friday, June 11, 2004 at 6:30 p.m.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Cyril and Methodius Hall</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">502 W. 41st Street (at 10th Avenue) New York, NY</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Tickets (sliding scale): $25 and $45 (No one turned away)   To reserve you seat, please call 212-228-0450.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Ellen Barfield, member of War Resister League's Board and the National Vice President of Veterans for Peace, will present the Peace Award to Fernando.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Entertainment will be provided by Harmonic Insurgence, an acappella vocal ensemble singing music for unsettled times, and Chris Brown and Kate Fenner.
