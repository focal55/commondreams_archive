There, State Parties to the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty will assess their progress in provision of assistance to survivors and devise ambitious plans for more comprehensive and sustained assistance for all, including access to emergency medical care, rehabilitation and income generation opportunities. Also to be discussed is the question of how to embed participation of landmine survivors in the work of the Treaty.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Afghanistan is sending two disabled athletes to compete in the 2004 Paralympic Games. Both belong to AABRAR (Afghan Amputee Bicyclists for Rehabilitation and Recreation), a member of the Afghan Campaign to Ban Landmines.  Qaher Gulam Hazarat, 22 years old, will compete in the 50 km cycling event (LC3). Qaher, a double amputee, was injured in a land mine incident in 1996 when he was 14 years old. In 1997 Qaher saw a boy riding a bicycle with one leg, asked him where he learned to do this and the boy led him to AABRAR. Qaher participated in their Bicycle Rehabilitation Program in Jalalabad and has worked as a messenger for AABRAR's Disabled Cyclist Messenger Service since 2001, where he is still currently employed. Qaher is the major provider for his family of 11, including his parents and 8 other siblings.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bosnia-Herzegovina (BiH) will send a total of eight athletes to the Athens Paralympics who are landmine survivors.

Ali is from a small village in South Lebanon, Ayta al Chaab, and is the seventh child of a family of 10.  After his injury in 2001, when he lost his left leg below the knee, he insisted on continuing his education, and went on to university studies. Ali has been involved in a preparatory program for Athens, including raising awareness of landmine issues in his home country.  &quot;When running, I forget everything. I have just one target in my mind: I need to succeed. Meanwhile I know that initially my success is in my participation rather than anything else. I really feel I did something different but similar in fact to all those other &quot;normal&quot; people who worked hard to participate in these international sport games&quot;.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For additional information visit: <a href="http://www.icbl.org/news/paralympics" target="_new">www.icbl.org/news/paralympics</a></font></p><p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">###</font></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
