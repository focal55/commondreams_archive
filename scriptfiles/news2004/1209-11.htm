<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- December 9 -- One day before the world marks International Human Rights Day, the death penalty system in Texas continues to execute many more people than any other state in the U.S. and operates on the very outer bounds of legality, the Texas Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty warned Thursday. Rick Halperin, TCADP president, said Texas has executed more than the next five highest-executing states combined: Texas has executed 336 since 1976, while the next states &#150; Virginia, Oklahoma, Missouri, Florida and Georgia &#150; have executed a combined total of 325 people. At the same time, eight people on Texas death row have been found to be completely innocent of the crime for which they were convicted and walked free from death row. And during this time, the U.S. Supreme Court continued to rebuke the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals and Fifth Circuit of the U.S. for repeatedly failing to follow Supreme Court edict in the administration of the death penalty.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Already this year, the U.S. Supreme Court has reversed two death sentences in Texas, including one summary reversal, and is expected to issue a strongly worded opinion in the case of Thomas Miller-El, whose case was heard earlier this week. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Because of malignant indifference on the part of Texas officials, </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">this state&#146;s death penalty system is on the verge of collapsing under </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">the weight of its blunders, biases and bureaucracy,&#148; Halperin said. &#147;The </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">irony here is that we may be headed toward a court-enforced moratorium &#150; </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">which would at least temporarily save the lives of those on death row &#150; b</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ecause of Texas&#146; ignorance and incompetence. Our death penalty system </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">is truly an embarrassment beyond relief and beyond repair.&#148;</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Halperin noted that Texas has the dubious distinction in leading the nation in the number of people it has executed, the number of juvenile offenders on death row and the number of juvenile offenders it has executed. In addition, the state ranks second in the overall number of people on </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">death row and second in the number of women on death row.</font></p><p align="CENTER"> ###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
