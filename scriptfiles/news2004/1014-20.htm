<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - October 14 - Following last night’s presidential debate where George Bush offered more of the same failed vision on health care, <a href="http://www.upforvictory.com/" target="_new">United Progressives for Victory</a>  today released a letter signed by national and state health care advocates urging potential Nader voters to support John Kerry this election.  The letter states:

 

</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Four more years of the current administration is four more years of an administration determined to privatize Medicare, limit Medicaid and undermine the entire public health infrastructure in this country.  It is four more years of no limits being placed on companies that profit at the expense of the health of our people.  It is four more years of standing by while the ranks of the uninsured in this country continue to grow dramatically.

 

</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We share Ralph Nader’s passion to protect America's citizens, and we have stood with Ralph in demanding health care for everyone, but we will not vote for him this election.  We will not risk the health of our citizens in order to support him.

 

 </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">           UPforVictory.com includes progressives who have worked with Nader in the past and leaders with years of experience working on progressive causes including peace and foreign policy, the environment, consumer rights, women’s issues, civil rights and constitutional rights, health care and workers’ rights, and social and economic justice.  For more information about the organization, please go to www.upforvictory.com.  UPforVictory.com has organized state and national letters signed by progressives, peace activists, and women leaders all urging potential Nader voters to oppose his candidacy this election and to unite to defeat Bush.

</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An Open Letter from Health Care Advocates to Potential Nader Voters

 

</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We are in the final month of the presidential election, and it is essential to our very wellbeing that George W. Bush be a one-term President.  A vote for Nader in this election is a vote for Bush, and we cannot afford to return Bush to office.  Four more years of the current administration is four more years of an administration determined to privatize Medicare, limit Medicaid and undermine the entire public health infrastructure in this country.  It is four more years of no limits being placed on companies that profit at the expense of the health of our people.  It is four more years of standing by while the ranks of the uninsured in this country continue to grow dramatically.  

 

</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today, after three consecutive years of increases, the number of uninsured in this country is now at a staggering 45 million and 18,000 Americans die each year based solely on the fact they have no health insurance (Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured, The Cost of Care for the Uninsured: What Do We Spend, Who Pays, and What Would Full Coverage Add to Medical Spending? Issue Update May 10, 2004).  During this same time, health care costs have grown at three times the rate of our wages and the Supreme Court has ruled that HMOs can no longer be held liable for improper denials of health care.  The Bush administration has “solved” the prescription drug problem by creating a drug discount for seniors that does nothing at all to contain prescription drug costs and has “helped” children by removing $1.1 billion dollars from SCHIP this year alone. 

 

</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The right wing will use whatever means are necessary to retain the White House.  They have collected ballot signatures across the nation for Ralph Nader and sent him thousands of dollars in campaign contributions.  In Florida alone, one third of Nader’s funding comes from Republican donors (Tampa Tribune, 7/15/04).  They are trying to divide and conquer the progressive vote through their support for Nader, and we cannot let them win.

 

</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For years, we have fought for a world where access to affordable health care is the norm. We share Ralph Nader’s passion to protect America's citizens, and we have stood with Ralph in demanding health care for everyone, but we will not vote for him this election.  We will not risk the health of our citizens in order to support him.

 

</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If you care about the health of our citizens, vote for Kerry this November.
