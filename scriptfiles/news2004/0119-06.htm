<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - January 19 - Breaking a silence shared with almost all major U.S. media outlets, the New York Times on Monday (Jan. 19) for the first time informed its readers about Katharine Gun -- thanks to a column on its op-ed page. As the British press began reporting two months ago, Gun is a former UK intelligence agency employee now facing charges that she violated the Official Secrets Act.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Katharine Gun has a much better grasp of the true spirit of democracy than Tony Blair,&quot; writes Times columnist Bob Herbert in today's piece. &quot;So, naturally, it's Katharine Gun who's being punished.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Herbert's column, titled &quot;A Single Conscience v. the State,&quot; goes on to explain: &quot;Ms. Gun, 29, was working at Britain's top-secret Government Communications Headquarters last year when she learned of an American plan to spy on at least a half-dozen U.N. delegations as part of the U.S. effort to win Security Council support for an invasion of Iraq.&quot; The plan &quot;included e-mail surveillance and taps on home and office telephones.&quot; It was outlined &quot;in a highly classified National Security Agency memo. The agency, which was seeking British assistance in the project, was interested in &#145;the whole gamut of information that could give U.S. policymakers an edge in obtaining results favorable to U.S. goals.'&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><A HREF="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/19/opinion/19HERB.html?ex=1075490497&ei=1&en=11973e164e33f4d7%20" TARGET="_new">http://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/19/opinion/19HERB.html?ex=1075490497&amp;ei=1&amp;en=11973e164e33f4d7 </A></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Gun's latest court appearance in London was today. On Sunday, the Observer newspaper in London published an in-depth news article that shed additional light on the prosecution of Gun, who has said that disclosure of the NSA memo &quot;exposed serious illegality and wrongdoing on the part of the U.S. government.&quot; She plans to invoke a necessity defense -- arguing that she had sought &quot;to prevent wide-scale death and casualties among ordinary Iraqi people and UK forces in the course of an illegal war.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><A HREF="http://observer.guardian.co.uk/iraq/story/0,12239,1125812,00.html%20" TARGET="_new">http://observer.guardian.co.uk/iraq/story/0,12239,1125812,00.html </A></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">On Dec. 17, the Institute for Public Accuracy issued a news release about the prosecution of Katharine Gun (&quot;New Developments in Case of U.S. Spying on U.N. Security Council&quot;). An article about her, written by IPA Executive Director Norman Solomon, appeared in the Baltimore Sun on Dec. 14 and a few other newspapers, including the Boston Globe (Dec. 20).</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><A HREF="http://www.accuracy.org/NS121403.htm%20" TARGET="_new">http://www.accuracy.org/NS121403.htm </A></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><A HREF="http://www.accuracy.org/press_releases/PR121703a.htm" TARGET="_new">http://www.accuracy.org/press_releases/PR121703a.htm</A></FONT></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
