<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">HOUSTON - February 1 - What:  Aerial Advertising Banner:  &quot;HOLD BUSH ACCOUNTABLE ON IRAQ&quot;</FONT></p><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Where:  Above Super Bowl events, exhibitions and stadium prior to game.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">When:  THIS MORNING  Sunday February 1, 2004 for approximately two hours between 10:30am and 12:30pm (weather and security conditions permitting)</FONT></P><P> </P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">(Houston)  Feb 1 -- Aerial advertising carrying the call to &#147;Hold Bush Accountable on Iraq&#148; will be in the skies over Houston, Texas during today&#146;s Superbowl pre-game celebrations.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">While a political message may seem out of place with the beer and soft drink ads that traditionally dominate the Super Bowl, organizers think the timing is right to promote the no-nonsense investigation of US entanglement in Iraq that a growing number of Americans support.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">A small group of private citizens was inspired to invest the $1800.00 for Sunday&#146;s advertising flight by calls for an investigation into &#147;poor pre-war intelligence&#148; in Washington last week.  &#147;Poor intelligence&#148; is only half the story and a potential red herring.  The real issue is how the Bush administration misused and distorted whatever intelligence they had to mislead Americans into an unjust, unnecessary, and costly invasion of Iraq.  </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;Who can forget the exaggerations, threats, and scare tactics that President Bush and senior administration officials used to bully dissenters in the US and abroad that their view was the only accurate and acceptable one as they rushed blindly to war,&#148; said Creighton Peet, a sponsor of the Superbowl aerial advertising.  &#147;Dissenting members of the US Congress were labeled &#147;unpatriotic,&#148; Bush ridiculed protesters as a &#147;focus group,&#148; and anyone who wouldn&#146;t &#145;connect the dots&#146; in the narrow-minded Bush way was ignored.&#148; </FONT></P><P>  </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Now is the time for all Americans who love our democracy to draw the line and demand a full investigation of how the Bush administration misused the intelligence they were given to justify their selfish ends, mislead Americans into an unnecessary war, and alienate most of the world community in the process.  Or like the plane says,   &#148;HOLD BUSH ACCOUNTABLE ON IRAQ!&#148;</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Security Reminder:  A seven mile radius &#147;no-fly&#148; zone around the stadium goes into effect at 12:30pm. Sunday.   No unauthorized aircraft will be allowed to fly over the stadium during the game.</FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
