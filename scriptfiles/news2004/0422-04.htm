<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - April 22 - Off the heels of their &#147;Bake Back the White House&#148; cookie sales that brought in three-quarters of a million dollars in one day, MoveOn PAC announced today an unprecedented campaign to raise $50 million to defeat President Bush and elect progressive candidates.  </FONT></p><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The group hopes to reduce the historical financial advantage of the Republicans and their ability to bundle big contributions from wealthy donors and corporations, exemplified by the Bush/Cheney campaign&#146;s &#147;Ranger&#148; program.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;This is hundreds of thousands of Davids against Goliath,&#148; said MoveOn PAC Executive Director, Eli Pariser.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">He said the campaign between now and the November election would focus heavily on local fundraising events and on-the-ground activities in cities and towns around the country.  On Saturday, over 500,000 Americans took part in over 1,100 bake sales in communities around the country that raised $750,000 for MoveOn PAC.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">No outside group has ever raised $50 million in hard money.  It is more than the national Democratic party raised in the last year and is more than the National Rifle Association and Emily&#146;s List raised in the 2002 election cycle, combined.  </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;MoveOn members are re-writing the political play book, and, together, we are evening the playing field against the wealthiest Presidential campaign in history,&#148; said Pariser.  </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The money will be spent approximately as follows:</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&middot;        $10 million to support the biggest get-out-the-vote drive in American history; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&middot;        $20 million for independent advertisements to reach millions of voters in swing states &#150; ads that will cut through the spin and set the record straight on the issues facing ordinary Americans; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&middot;        $20 million in contributions collected by MoveOn PAC directly to candidates from state senators to John Kerry, giving them the resources they need to compete.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Bush campaign director Ken Mehlman complained to The Hill newspaper on Monday that TV ads and other criticisms of President Bush--sponsored by MoveOn.org Voter Fund and MoveOn PAC--have had an impact on their campaign.  &#147;MoveOn.org is a huge threat and has hurt the President,&#148; Mehlman told The Hill. </FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
