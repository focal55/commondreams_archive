<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">BUJUMBURA, BURUNDI - February 20 - At the opening of a roundtable discussion on landmines in the Central Africa region, the International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL) urged rapid implementation of key clauses in a ceasefire agreement in Burundi that prohibits mine-laying, requires marking and mapping of minefields, and the initiation of humanitarian mine clearance throughout the country.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;We are very pleased that peace is taking hold in Burundi, but the antipersonnel mine recognizes no ceasefire or peace agreement.  This issue should be addressed without delay,&#148; said Ms. Susan Walker, spokesperson for the International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL).  &#147;We urge Burundi to address the humanitarian consequences of the recent antipersonnel mine use by locating and destroying these despicable weapons as quickly as possible.&#148;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Burundi ratified the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty on 22 October 2003.  Globally, 150 countries have joined the agreement including every sub-Saharan African state except Somalia.  On 2 December 2002, the transitional government of Burundi and the the Conseil National pour le D&eacute;fense de la D&eacute;mocratie - Forces pour la D&eacute;fense de la D&eacute;mocratie (CNDD-FDD) signed a ceasefire agreement that includes a prohibition on mine-laying and requirements for mine action activities.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;We urge Burundi to address the needs of its growing number of mine victims and urge appropriate and comprehensive assistance for them over the long-term,&#148; said Mr. Charles Ndayiziga of the Bujumbura-based Centre d'Alerte et de Pr&eacute;vention de Conflits Research, the ICBL&#146;s country representative.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In 2002, there were at least 114 new civilian mine/unexploded ordnance casualties reported in Burundi. Burundi is mine-affected as a result of its internal conflict.  According to the ICBL&#146;s Landmine Monitor, as recently as 2002, there were credible allegations of antipersonnel landmine use by government and opposition forces. The government strongly denies the charges. The government has declared holding a stockpile of 1,200 antipersonnel mines, which it intends to retain for training in demining, as permitted by Article 3 of the Mine Ban Treaty.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;As one of the most recent countries to join the Mine Ban Treaty, we call on Burundi to adhere to the obligations contained in this important agreement,&#148; said Ms. Mary Wareham, Global Research Coordinator for the ICBL&#146;s Landmine Monitor initiative.  &#147;Burundi needs to enact domestic legislation to make this treaty binding law.&#148;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The roundtable takes place in the lead-up to the 2004 Nairobi Summit on a Mine Free World, the First Review Conference of the Mine Ban Treaty, to be held in Kenya from 29 November to 3 December 2004. &#147;It is critical that States Parties, especially those in Africa, follow through on the obligations contained in the treaty ahead of this crucial meeting,&#148; said Walker. &#147;We are disappointed that so few have enacted domestic legislation to implement the treaty.  This is essential if the ban provisions are to have any teeth.&#148;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">ICBL members from Francophone Africa have been in Burundi this week for their annual meeting.</FONT></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
