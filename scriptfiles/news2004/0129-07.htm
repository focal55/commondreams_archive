<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - January 29 - Kay J. Maxwell, President of the League of Women Voters of the United States (LWVUS), will announce A Time for Action: A New Vision of Participatory Democracy, at a press conference in Chicago on Thursday, January 29, 2004. The report, sponsored by Boeing, is a culmination of a year-long study on youth civic participation by the League of Women Voters of Chicago.  </FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">A Time for Action analyzes the long-term decline in voting, focusing on young adults as the group with both the lowest participation and the greatest potential for re-engagement. The report also highlights what every public official needs to know and do to connect with young constituents. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;It's time that candidates give young voters the attention they deserve,&quot; stated Maxwell.  &quot;Candidates must recognize that young voters can no longer be dismissed as apathetic, and will in fact be instrumental to 2004 and all future elections,&quot; Maxwell concluded.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The press conference will begin at 10:00am at the Cook County Clerk's office in Chicago. Along with Maxwell, the scheduled speakers will include: Cook County Clerk David Orr and Leo Burnett Vice-President Kerry Stranman.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The report is available at: <A HREF="http://www.lwv.org/join/elections/lwvil_nvopd.pdf" TARGET="_new">http://www.lwv.org/join/elections/lwvil_nvopd.pdf</A></FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
