<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TUSCON, AZ -- October 25 -- </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On Thursday, millions of American children and teenagers will take part in the single largest voter education exercise in the country, National Mock Election Day. The nation's youths will make their pick for U.S. President -- as well as weigh in on the Congresspersons, Senators and Governors they think should represent them.</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">More than 10 million youths in the last two presidential year Mock Elections combined have participated in the event, organized by the non-profit, non-partisan National Student/Parent Mock Election (NSPME) since 1980. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Over the past 24 years, 40 million youths have discussed, debated and then voted with their parents and teachers in the National Mock Election on the same candidates that appear on state ballots in the real election. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For this election year, thousands of school districts, schools, and youth groups have registered students grades K-12 across the 50 states, Washington D.C., Puerto Rico, and around the world wherever Americans are based. This year for the first time six colleges have joined, with Cornell University taking the leadership. Students utilize free educational materials and support provided by such NSPME partners as USA TODAY, ABC TV, CNN, educational publisher Pearson Scott Foresman, and American Happenings, a long-time sponsor of NSPME. NSPME receives its basic funding from Congress.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Registration will remain open until National Mock Election Day, Oct. 28 -- for details, please visit <a href="http://www.nationalmockelection.org/" target="_new">http://www.nationalmockelection.org</a>, fax 520-742-3553, or email <a href="mailto:nspme@aol.com/" target="_new">nspme@aol.com</a>.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This year, the National Mock Election unveils a new online 'e- voting' system that can handle more than five million secure votes. The system is provided by Everyone Counts, a leading provider of Internet voting systems. (Registration for online voting closes Oct. 27)._</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From its inception in 1980, the National Student/Parent Mock Election has operated on the idea that informed kids grow up to become informed voters. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Each generation must win its democracy anew,&quot; says Gloria Kirshner, president of NSPME. &quot;If we are going to send young Americans to teach democracy abroad, we must first teach them how to 'preserve and protect' their democracy at home.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;There is no tool more powerful than their ballot,&quot; says Kirshner.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By participating in the National Mock Election, youths learn how to read a ballot and to think critically about the same weighty issues such as national security, education, and healthcare that will influence their parents and other adult voters at the polls on Nov. 2.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Voting requires basic levels of reading comprehension, yet millions of Americans are unable to read an election leaflet or newspaper stories about political issues,&quot; says John Herklotz, chairman of American Happenings and Vice-Chairman of NSPME.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to a 2003 study by Rutgers University, eight out of ten 15- to 26-year olds know that the animated Simpsons family lives in Springfield, but less than half know the political party of their State's governor. Only 40 percent can say which political party controls Congress. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">International observers from Japan interested in establishing a similar program will be present at National Election Headquarters as the results are tabulated by the New Jersey Division of Elections, Office of the Attorney General. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Election results will be available online at http://www.nationalmockelection.org. Just as in the real election, state and national provisional results will be posted throughout the day, with final results announced at 10 p.m. Eastern Time on Oct. 28. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Educators and parents can register and learn more about National Mock Election Day at <a href="http://www.nationalmockelection.org/" target="_new">http://www.nationalmockelection.org</a>.<br></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
