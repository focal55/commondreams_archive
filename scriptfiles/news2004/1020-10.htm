<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- October -- More than 75 former Nader's Raiders and Nader associates today announced an effort opposing Ralph Nader's 2004 candidacy. The group released a letter to voters urging them not to support Nader, and said it would conduct a campaign of earned and paid media in battleground states where Nader may act as a spoiler in the election outcome.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In its letter to voters, the group said, &quot;This November, none of us will vote for Ralph. We believe there is nothing more important than defeating George W. Bush.&quot;</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The letter's signatories have worked with Nader in public interest advocacy during the last 35 years, and many supported Nader's 2000 campaign.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">They said in their statement: &quot;We know Ralph Nader better than anyone else. We were inspired to public service by his vision and his integrity. Now we are disappointed and saddened to see him embrace the support of reactionary forces who oppose everything we and Ralph have fought for and whose real agenda is to reelect George Bush.&quot;</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;I supported Ralph in 2000 because he was building an alternative to corporate business as usual: the Green Party,&quot; said Ken Ward, who organized the letter and has served as Executive Director of Rhode Island PIRG and New Jersey PIRG. &quot;This year, sadly, he is willingly aligning himself with right-wingers and offers nothing that's worth the risk of another four year of Bush.&quot;</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nader has received tens of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions, as well as legal support and aid in gathering ballot signatures from right-leaning groups intent on undermining support for John Kerry. </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Complete text of the letter and a list of signatories is attached.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">{Attached}</font></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;An Open Letter to Ralph Nader Voters&#148;</font></p><p> </p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dear Voters,</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many of us &#150; former Nader&#146;s Raiders and leaders of his organizations &#150; voted for Ralph Nader in 2000. Many did not.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This November, none of us will vote for Ralph. We believe there is nothing more important than defeating George W. Bush.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ralph argues that he is creating an independent political voice. In 2000, when he ran as the Green Party candidate, that may have been true.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 2004, as the candidate of the increasingly reactionary, anti-immigrant Reform Party, and the recipient of financial and political support from right-wing funders and operatives, it is not credible. Unfortunately, Ralph is party to a disingenuous effort to split the progressive vote in key states.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With the major party candidates in a dead heat, Nader is poised to tip the election to Bush &#150; again.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We do not agree with Ralph that there is little difference between the Republicans and the Democrats. We know that the country cannot afford another four years of Republicans controlling the White House, both chambers of Congress, the Supreme Court and the entire federal Judiciary. The price of a protest vote is too high for families who live from paycheck to paycheck, for those concerned about the realities of war, for those who lack decent jobs and access to health care, and for the environment.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While Ralph has pursued politically expedient alliances with the right wing, truly progressive leaders &#150; from peace activists to unions to former Dean supporters &#150; have made substantial progress organizing within the Democratic Party.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">United, progressives can build a base for a transformed party funded by small donors, imbued with progressive values and energized by a vision of a democratic majority. Divided, we will give four more years to George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, and John Ashcroft. The progressive vote can be the key to this election.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We know Ralph Nader better than anyone else. We were inspired to public service by his vision and his integrity.  Now we are disappointed and saddened to see him embrace the support of reactionary forces who oppose everything we and Ralph have fought for and whose real agenda is to reelect George Bush. </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Join us. Cast your vote for a progressive future and support John Kerry.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nader&#146;s Raiders,</font></p><p></p><p></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Brian Ahlberg &#150; MN PIRG<br>Judy Appelbaum &#150; Public Citizen&#146;s Congress Watch, Summers 1974, 75</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Matt Baker &#150; Organizing Director, NJPIRG 1992-98<br>Sheila Ballen &#150; Executive Director, Pennsylvania PIRG <br>Samuel Boykin &#150; Field Director, NJPIRG 2000-03</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Michael Berg &#150; Congress Project 1972<br>Robert Brandon &#150; Director, Public Citizen&#146;s Tax Reform Research Group 1972-77<br>Mike Calabrese &#150; Former Director, Public Citizen&#146;s Congress Watch 1980 <br>Marc Caplan &#150; Executive Director, CCAG 1974-80<br>Michael Caudell-Feagan &#150; USPIRG 1985-86; Nat&#146;l Assoc. for Pub Interest Law 1986-91<br>Nancy Chasen &#150; Lobbyist, Public Citizen&#146;s Congress Watch 1973-75</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sarah K.
