<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - May 12 - In perhaps the ultimate example of taking a political message to the streets, a blubbery, grunting, and eye-popping pig mobile is rolling across America, and will be in Parkersburg on Thursday, May 13th at SOUTH Parkersburg High School at 1:10pm.</FONT></p><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The &#147;Pig Mobile,&#148; conceived of by Ben Cohen, co-founder of Ben and Jerry&#146;s, consists of three different-sized piggy banks strung together to illustrate just how big a financial disaster the Iraq war has turned out to be.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The largest pig (by far) shows the financial cost ($200 billion)[1] of America&#146;s attack on Iraq, including the projected minimum cost of reconstruction. The smaller pig illustrates how much the federal government spends on K-12 education ($34 billion)[2]. And the third pig, which is a wee little pig, shows America&#146;s dedication to lessening world hunger and poverty ($10 billion).[3]</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">These piggies, all built out with striking pink fiberglass and featuring an oinking soundtrack, are pulled by a full-sized Chevy van towing a trailer.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The pig mobile is sponsored by the TrueMajority, a free e-service that monitors Congress. Twice a month, at critical moments, TrueMajority members receive a short e-mail alert about an important issue pending in Washington. By simply clicking &#147;reply&#148;, members can send a fax to their Congressperson. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">West Virginia members of TrueMajority.org volunteered to drive the protest vehicle in Parkersburg.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;Citizens should be given the facts on the costs of the Iraq war,&#148; says Ben Cohen, co-founder of Ben and Jerry&#146;s and President of the TrueMajority. &#147;And there&#146;s no better way to understand the giant numbers involved than to compare them to spending on stuff we all care about&#151;like schools and world hunger.&#148;</FONT></P><P></P><P></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">[1] Eric Schmitt and Robert Pear, New York Times, Feb. 3, 2004.
