<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - September 8 - Statement of Ivan Maluski, Oregon Chapter Sierra Club forest policy staff.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;A three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals yesterday issued an emergency injunction against logging of certain old growth forests as part of the Bush administration's &quot;Biscuit&quot; salvage logging project in the Siskiyou National Forest in southern Oregon, one of America's wildest, most pristine places. The injunction was in response to a lawsuit filed by Sierra Club and other conservation organizations.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The 'Biscuit Fire Recovery Project' is one of the largest and most destructive logging projects in the history of the Forest Service. A logging project of this size will cause irreparable harm to old growth forests, roadless areas, wild salmon and clean water while diverting federal resources away from real community protection. It is a classic example of a Bush administration logging project that rewards timber industry allies and contributors instead of protecting communities from the threat of wildfires.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The administration pushed a divisive and harmful policy that drastically increases logging in the backcountry far from people's homes and businesses. There is a better way. We can responsibly manage Oregon and America's National Forests and protect communities and our nation's wild heritage.&quot;</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
