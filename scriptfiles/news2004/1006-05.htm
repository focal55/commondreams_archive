Thier was a legal advisor to Afghanistan's constitutional
and judicial reform commissions. He is currently a fellow at the Hoover
Institution and the Center on Democracy, Development and the Rule of Law at
Stanford University. He said today: &quot;By most measures, Afghanistan seems
far from ripe for democracy. As President Hamid Karzai struggles to build a
government in Kabul, much of the country remains under the control of warlord
armies. ... Factional fighting has touched every corner of the country, and more
soldiers and aid workers have been killed this year than in the previous two.
It will be difficult to ensure free and fair elections in this environment.
More than 10 million Afghans have registered to vote, many at great personal
risk. But the United Nations, which is helping organize the elections, recently
released a report warning that many Afghans would be unable to freely exercise
their political rights owing to warlord intimidation. ... On his first major
campaign trip outside Kabul, Karzai was nearly assassinated. Concerns about
fairness are muted because the outcome of the elections seems assured. There
are 18 candidates for the top spot, but there is little doubt U.S.-backed
Karzai will win.&quot;</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He added: &quot;Elections themselves are only a small part
of democracy. Effective government service, protection of individual rights,
accountability -- these are the true fruits of democracy. Holding elections
without the rule of law can undermine democracy by sparking violence, sowing
cynicism and allowing undemocratic forces to become entrenched.&quot;</font></p><P><LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RAHUL MAHAJAN, <A HREF="mailto:rsm4@nyu.edu">rsm4@nyu.edu</a>, <a

Rahul Mahajan is an adjunct professor at New York University
and publisher of the weblog Empire Notes. He has been to Iraq twice and
reported from Fallujah during the siege in April. He said today: &quot;Be it in
Iraq or Afghanistan, the Bush administration has a track record of fixing
elections to produce the winner it desires. ... The Bush administration has
pressured the Afghan Electoral Commission to delay the parliamentary elections
until next April but push through the presidential elections in October. The
plan is clearly to ensure that there will be no time for anyone to emerge as a
national-level alternative to Hamid Karzai as the president. ... The U.S.
record in Iraq is not much different. The administration has touted the local
elections held under the aegis of the U.S. occupation as evidence of its
democratic intentions. However, in many instances, the 'election' consisted of
the appointment of the mayor and/or city council members by the local U.S.
commander, sometimes to disastrous effect. Just this past August, a national
conference of nearly 1,300 delegates met to determine the makeup of the
100-member interim National Assembly, whose formation was mandated by the
'transfer of sovereignty' process. However, the delegates at the conference
soon learned that the entire process of selection was a giant sham, and that
they would be presented with a pre-selected slate of 81 candidates chosen as a
result of back-room negotiations between the major U.S.-affiliated parties.
Attempts by small parties to form an alternative slate fell through. In the
end, the U.S.-backed slate was not even presented to the delegates for formal
approval.&quot; Mahajan's latest book is <i>Full Spectrum Dominance: U.S. Power
in Iraq and Beyond</i>.</font><P><LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SONALI KOLHATKAR, <A HREF="mailto:sonali@afghanwomensmission.org">sonali@afghanwomensmission.org</A>, <a

Co-director of the Afghan Women's Mission, Kolhatkar is
co-author of the article &quot;Afghan Elections: U.S. Solution to U.S.
Problem.&quot; She said today: &quot;Even though many Afghans will risk their
lives to vote, most of them took no part in decision-making regarding the
schedule and structure of the elections. ...&nbsp; As part of Bush's 'War on
Terror,' the U.S. made deals with Northern Alliance warlords in his crusade
against the Taliban, appointed them to high-level government posts, allowed
them to regain regional power and watched idly as they fought one another. When
aid agencies and even Hamid Karzai asked for the International Security
Assistance Forces to be expanded from Kabul to the rest of the country, the
U.S. responded by saying that such an expansion would interfere with their
operations&nbsp; -- thereby closing a crucial window of opportunity to
undermine the warlords early on. Only now, as warlords threaten to spoil the
carefully staged demonstration of 'democracy' via elections, is the U.S.
putting any pressure on them -- and that is mostly to ensure that they don't
spoil the show.&quot;</font><p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">###</font></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
