<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - September 21 - Today, the U.S. Department of Justice faces off against Big Tobacco in the long-awaited federal trial that could fundamentally change the business of the tobacco industry.  In a show of support for the lawsuit, the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids has launched <a href="http://www.DontPardonBigTobacco.org%20" target="_new">www.DontPardonBigTobacco.org</a>, an online campaign calling on President Bush to make sure the American people get their day in court and the tobacco industry doesn&#146;t buy a sweetheart deal with its millions in campaign contributions.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to William V. Corr, Executive Director of the Campaign For Tobacco-Free Kids, &#147;The Justice Department&#146;s lawsuit against Big Tobacco is a landmark case that holds great potential for improving health in our country. Tobacco companies have donated millions of dollars to politicians with the hope that they will get off with a slap on the wrist.  In fact, over the last five years, the lawsuit has been threatened by inadequate funding and settlement talks.  Our activists have fought hard to get this case to trial.&#148; </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In fact, over the past four years, the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids has recruited 190,000 activists who have sent letters to President Bush. And today, the www.DontPardonBigTobacco.org campaign will reach out to millions of activists via online promotion and grassroots organizing.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Filed in September 1999, the federal government&#146;s lawsuit seeks to hold the tobacco industry legally accountable for decades of illegal and harmful practices, including marketing to children and concealing the health risks and addictiveness of its products.  In its filings in the case, the Justice Department has indicated that it will seek fundamental changes in the manufacturing, marketing and sale of tobacco products; the recovery of $280 billion in illegal tobacco industry profits; and funding for tobacco prevention, cessation and research programs.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By logging on to <a href="http://www.DontPardonBigTobacco.org%20" target="_new">www.DontPardonBigTobacco.org</a>, activists can send a free message to President Bush asking him to see the lawsuit through.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 2001, the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids helped prevent a weak settlement of this case.  The <a href="http://www.DontPardonBigTobacco.org%20" target="_new">www.DontPardonBigTobacco.org</a> campaign is now making a final push for the public health community and tobacco-control advocates to get involved and make sure Big Tobacco doesn&#146;t get off with a sweetheart settlement.    </font></p><p></p><p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">###</font></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
