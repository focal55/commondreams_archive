Goodman is a senior fellow at the Center for International Policy and an adjunct professor of government at Johns Hopkins University.  He recently retired with 41 years of service with the Central Intelligence Agency (senior analyst and division chief) and the National War College (professor of international relations).  His recent books include &quot;Bush League Diplomacy: How the Neoconservatives are Putting the World at Risk&quot; and &quot;The Wars of Eduard Shevardnadze.&quot;  He has testified to the Senate Select Committee for Intelligence, the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, and the Senate Armed Forces Committee.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">FAA- Bogdan Dzakovic is a former Coast Guard Officer, Federal Criminal Investigator and has a graduate degree in Security Administration.  He has worked for the Security Division of the Federal Aviation Administration since 1987 as a Special Agent, as a Team Leader in the Federal Air Marshals, and from 1995 until September 11, 2001 was a Team Leader of the Red Team (terrorist team). He tried for several years prior to the 9-11 attacks to improve aviation security in the face of the ever-increasing terrorist threat.  This including working through the established chain of command, with the Department of Transportation's Office of Inspector General, with the General Accountability Office, and with members of both the House and Senate of the Congress of the United States.  He filed a Whistleblower Case against the Federal Aviation Administration and testified at the 9-11 Commission.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">FBI- Sibel Edmonds worked as a language specialist for the FBI's Washington Field Office. During her work, she discovered and reported serious acts of security breaches, cover-ups, and intentional blocking of intelligence that had national security implications. After she reported these acts to FBI management, she was retaliated against and ultimately fired in March 2002. Since that time, all her court proceedings have been blocked by the assertion of &quot;State Secret Privilege&quot; by Attorney General Ashcroft; the Congress has been gagged and prevented from any discussion of her case through retroactive re-classification by the DOJ; and the report on her case issued by the DOJ-IG has been entirely classified. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">FBI- John M. Cole, Former Veteran Intelligence Operations Specialist (Bio to come)</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">US Customs- Diane Kleiman was a Special Agent with US Customs assigned to JFK International Airport. While investigating a drug smuggling case she observed and reported serious security breaches by airlines employees. Her supervisors feared the information, if it got out, would embarrass the Agency. They ordered Kleiman not to speak to anyone about what she knew, and even to lie to the grand jury considering indictments in her investigation. Six months prior to the attacks on September 11th, Kleiman had warned the US Attorney's office that a tragedy would occur because of the lack of security at American Airlines. The US Attorney's Office dismissed her by saying they would look into it and never got back to her. Customs fired Kleiman for raising these issues.</font></p><p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">###</font></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
