<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- November 2 --  </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;This campaign has always been about building and growing the Green Party and that&#146;s just what we&#146;ve succeeded in doing.  We&#146;ve registered more Green voters, we&#146;ve boosted local campaigns, we&#146;ve garnered fantastic media coverage and we&#146;ve put Instant Runoff Voting in the forefront as a solution for the &#145;spoiler&#146; voting dynamic.  When our local candidates win election in record numbers today, that will be the icing on the cake,&#148; said Cobb-LaMarche Media Director Blair Bobier.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">             The Cobb-LaMarche campaign has been the subject of front page news stories across the country and has helped the Green Party grow in places as far flung as Nebraska, Oklahoma, Corvallis, Oregon and San Luis Obispo, California.  In Arkansas, Green Party vice presidential candidate Pat LaMarche&#146;s visit produced truckloads of donations of food and essentials to the Salvation Army Shelter.  In Wisconsin, David Cobb&#146;s campaign swing there generated dozens of news stories and a rousing speech to over three thousand people.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">            Cobb also campaigned with two Green candidates who have broken barriers by being endorsed by major newspapers.  The Fort Collins Coloradoan has endorsed Green Party 4th Congressional candidate Bob Kinsey and the Iowa City Press Citizen gave its endorsement to U.S. Senate candidate Daryl Northrup.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">            The Cobb-LaMarche campaign has also made great strides towards reforming the archaic U.S. election process by focusing on the need for Instant Runoff Voting and unrestricted debates open to more than just two presidential candidates.  Numerous editorials and columns including one by David Broder, the dean of Washington political columnists, were published during the campaign supporting more inclusive debates.  A number of commentaries and editorials about instant runoff also appeared, including two within the past several days in The Oregonian:  </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/search/index.ssf?/base/editorial/109913768849470.xml?oregonian?edgc" target="_new">http://www.oregonlive.com/search/index.ssf?/base/editorial/109913768849470.xml?oregonian?edgc</a> </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/search/index.ssf?/base/editorial/109896678034940.xml?oregonian?edc" target="_new">http://www.oregonlive.com/search/index.ssf?/base/editorial/109896678034940.xml?oregonian?edc</a>.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">            Today&#146;s election will produce a number of firsts for the Green Party, including the first Green elected to office in Mississippi.                   </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For more information about the Cobb-LaMarche campaign, see <a href="http://www.votecobb.org/" target="_new">http://www.votecobb.org</a>. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Information about the Green Party of the United States can be found at <a href="http://www.gp.org/" target="_new">http://www.gp.org</a>.</font></p><p></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
