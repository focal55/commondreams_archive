<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MEXICO -- December 2 -- </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Mexican authorities cannot dismiss the complaints of abuse against protestors in Guadalajara during the Third Summit of Heads of State and Government of Latin America, the Caribbean and the European Union in May 2004. The open refusal of the Jalisco state authorities to comply with its responsibility to investigate what happened during the demonstrations perpetuates a climate of impunity, said Amnesty International in a report published today, more than six months on.</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">More than one hundred people were arrested in the city of Guadalajara between 28 and 29 May 2004 in the protests being held during the closing ceremony of the Summit. Amnesty International&#146;s report documents serious abuses committed by municipal and state agents both during and after the demonstrations, including torture and ill-treatment of those arrested.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The way in which many of the arrests were made, the treatment received by those arrested, the complaints of torture and ill-treatment and the lack of an independent investigation brings into doubt the criminal proceedings being implemented to prosecute those accused,&quot; said Amnesty International.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to information received by Amnesty International several detainees were coerced, beaten or threatened into making confessions or implicating those suspected of having carried out acts of violence. To date, forty-five people are facing different charges for their alleged involvement in the events, fifteen of whom remain in prison. The eight foreign nationals arrested were expelled from the country at the beginning of June without leave to re-enter for a period of three years.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Amnesty International is aware of the difficulties involved in maintaining public order during a summit, particularly when some groups cause violence. The organization condemns all violence against the police but the security forces must nevertheless always act in accordance with international human rights standards.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The arrests of various people that took place in raids following the disturbances, simply on the basis of the clothes they were wearing or their suspicious appearance, are worrying and contravene international standards protecting personal freedom.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It is deplorable that complaints of human rights violations on the part of law enforcement officers against those arrested have not yet been fully and impartially investigated,&quot; said Amnesty International. &quot;This once more demonstrates that the authorities, particularly a number of state authorities bodies, continue to ignore their obligation to respect human rights.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Amnesty International stresses the Mexican State&#146;s obligation to investigate what happened and bring those responsible to justice. The report also highlights the urgent need to promote reform of the criminal justice and public security system at all levels of the State in order to guarantee effective protection of human rights and avoid a repetition of the events in Guadalajara.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Background information<br>On 28 May 2004, around three thousand people took part in protests in Guadalajara, state of Jalisco. Although the demonstration was largely peaceful, there were violent incidents when one group of people clashed with the security forces, causing injury.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A special report of the National Human Rights Commission Comisi&oacute;n Nacional de Derechos Humanos (CNDH) concluded that the Public Security forces of the city of Guadalajara and of the state and officers of the Jalisco State Public Prosecutor&#146;s Office had been involved in serious human rights violations both during and after the detentions, reporting, among other types of abuse, a total of 19 cases of torture. To date, the recommendations contained in the report have been rejected.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For a copy of the report: &quot;Mexico: Allegations of abuse dismissed in Guadalajara: reluctance to investigate human rights violations perpetuates impunity&quot;, see: <a href="http://web.amnesty.org/library/index/ENGAMR410342004" target="_new">http://web.amnesty.org/library/index/ENGAMR410342004</a></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
