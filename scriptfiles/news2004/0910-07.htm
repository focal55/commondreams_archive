<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - September 10 - The new &#147;Ask A Lawyer&#148; and overtime quiz websites designed to help workers worried about losing their overtime protection under the Bush Administration&#146;s new regulation have attracted more than 45,000 visitors since its inception August 19 &#150; four days before the regulation took effect. The interest in the websites indicates the level of concern and the need for a resource to help workers understand and protect their rights to overtime pay. The websites can be found at <a href="http://www.workingamerica.org" target="_new">www.workingamerica.org</a>. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hundreds of workers across the country have submitted questions to &#147;Ask A Lawyer&#148; attorney Baldwin Robertson about the new regulation and whether they may be at risk of losing their overtime protections. Workers from different occupations &#150; nurses, production line supervisors, service consultants, medical technologists and retail employees &#150; are seeking information about the regulation&#146;s impact. Nurses have expressed their concerns that the new rule will affect patient care since fewer nurses will probably work overtime. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;If our overtime pay is taken away we will have more of a shortage and more nurses will refuse to work overtime,&#148; said a nurse who visited the &#147;Ask A Lawyer&#148; website. Even union members who have overtime protection in their current contracts have said they&#146;re concerned their employer will try to take away their overtime pay when their contract expires. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Up to six million workers are at risk of losing their overtime protection under the Bush Administration&#146;s new regulation and some workers who submitted questions to the &#147;Ask A Lawyer&#148; website say their employers have already stopped their overtime pay because of the regulation.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;I have been informed by my immediate supervisor that&#133;I will no longer be an hourly employee but rather an &#146;exempt status employee&#146; and have essentially lost the rights to overtime,&#148; said an information technology worker from Pennsylvania. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A bipartisan majority in the House of Representatives yesterday approved a measure to repeal portions of the regulation that restrict overtime eligibility, but President Bush has threatened to veto the measure if it becomes law. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The &#147;Ask A Lawyer&#148; website was launched by Working America, a community affiliate of the AFL-CIO that represents non-union workers and retirees who want to make sure the nation&#146;s economy and politics work for all Americans. </font></p><p></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
