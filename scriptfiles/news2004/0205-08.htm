<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - February 5 - Today&#146;s finding by the Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board (CSB) that OSHA&#146;s failure to act to prevent reactive chemical explosions is &#147;unacceptable&#148; is a serious indictment of the Bush Administration&#146;s dismal worker safety and health record. It shows that even in the case of deadly hazards the Bush Administration sides with giant corporations and refuses to act to protect workers. </FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Two years ago the CSB found that reactive chemicals posed a &#147;significant safety problem&#148; responsible for hundreds of accidents and scores of fatalities, and recommended immediate action by OSHA to strengthen the Chemical Process Safety Management standard. The CSB findings reinforced union calls for OSHA to regulate these imminent hazards. </FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">But the Bush Administration has refused to act. In 2002, it stopped work on a reactive chemicals rule and in 2003, OSHA announced it would address the problem solely through outreach and voluntary cooperatives programs with the chemical industry. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Putting corporate interests over worker safety is leaving workers in serious danger. The Bush Administration should act now to regulate reactive chemicals before more workers&#146; lives are lost.</FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
