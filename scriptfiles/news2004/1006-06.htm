A fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies, Bennis is
author of the book <i>Before and After: U.S. Foreign Policy and the September
11th Crisis</i> as well as the article &quot;Veto&quot; about the U.S.
government's repeated use of its veto of U.N. Security Council resolutions
critical of Israel. She said today: &quot;The U.S. veto yesterday is only the
latest example of a long history of U.S. protection of Israel's occupation and
Israeli violations of international law and UN resolutions. During the
vice-presidential debate, it was clear that both Cheney and Edwards, and their
respective parties, are trying to out-do each other in embracing Sharon's
expansionist goals. While Israel has the right to protect its own civilian
population on its own territory, it does not have the right to impose
collective punishment on the entire Palestinian people. As the occupying power
in an illegal occupation, Israel has the obligation to protect the Palestinian
civilian population -- and sending Israeli forces into Palestinian territory to
kill Palestinians, including many children, demolishing houses, imposing
curfews and closures on whole towns, cities and refugee camps, is completely
illegal. The U.S. should pressure Israel to stop the attacks and to end the
occupation. But instead the U.S. remains complicit in Israel's violations --
not only by extending diplomatic protection to Israel through use of its
Security Council veto, but also by providing Israel with the Apache helicopter
gun-ships, the Hellfire missiles, the armored Caterpillar bulldozers Israel
uses against Palestinians in the occupied territories. Paid for with the
billions of dollars in U.S. economic and military aid to Israel, sending those
weapons violates the U.S. Arms Export Control Act.&quot;</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a <i>New York Times</i> oped on Monday, PLO legal adviser
Michael Tarazi proposed solving the deadlocked Palestinian-Israeli conflict
through &quot;a one-state solution in which citizens of all faiths and
ethnicities live together as equals.&quot; [See: <a

Author of the book <i>The Obstruction of Peace</i>, Aruri is
chancellor professor emeritus of political science at the University of
Massachusetts at Dartmouth. He said today: &quot;Washington has never predicted,
nor even contemplated that its own policies, subsumed under the misleading
title 'peace process,' might someday prove to have been a contributory agent to
a single state in [the area of] pre-1948 Palestine. U.S. accommodation of
Israeli settlement policies and creeping annexation over several decades has
created facts and conditions that could initially make a bi-national,
multi-ethnic state (leading hopefully to a secular democracy) the only viable
resolution, should apartheid and ethnic cleansing be deemed unacceptable
options in the 21st century.&quot;</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Aruri added: &quot;The derailment of the two-state solution
was accomplished through the accumulated effect of fruitless diplomatic efforts
carried out by numerous U.S. presidents from Nixon to Clinton and Bush II.
Between the signing of Oslo in 1993 and the present, the two strategic allies,
Israel and the U.S., succeeded in creating their own rules of diplomatic
engagement, which removed the Palestinians from the negotiating table and
transformed the 'honest broker' to co-belligerent. Similarly, they created
their own jurisprudence for an Israeli-Palestinian deal, which arbitrarily
bestowed the West Bank on Israel, leaving Bush's vision of a sovereign,
contiguous Palestinian state a mere rhetorical exercise, a fact that has been
confirmed by Sharon's senior adviser, Dov Weisglass, in today's Ha'aretz.&quot;</font></p><P><LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">HANI ABU NAHLA, <A HREF="mailto:hanian2001@yahoo.com">hanian2001@yahoo.com</A>, <a
