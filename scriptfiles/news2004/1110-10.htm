<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- November 10 -- Army Specialist Megan Ambuhl has become the third military police reservist and fourth U.S. soldier convicted over Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse.  For standing by while abuse occurred and failing to intervene or report it, Ambuhl was convicted on Oct. 30, 2004, of dereliction of duty and sentenced to reduction in rank to private and loss of a half-month&#146;s pay. </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Additional charges brought against Ambuhl but dropped under the pretrial agreement had included allegations of conspiracy, maltreatment, and indecent acts.  In addition to having the charges reduced, Ambuhl was subjected to a summary court martial under which any imprisonment that might have been imposed would have been limited to thirty days.  </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ordinarily the summary court martial, limited to enlisted personnel, is reserved for minor disciplinary offences, in contrast to the potentially more punitive special court martial and general court martial.  At a background briefing in May 2004 prior to the first Abu Ghraib court martial, a senior military lawyer explained:</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The summary court martial.  Maximum punishment is 30 days.  Officers don&#146;t go to summary court martials, because, one, they can&#146;t be confined in a summary court martial.  It&#146;s generally considered for minor disciplinary-type procedures, minor military-type offenses; UA, unauthorized absence, for example, smart-mouth at your commander, et cetera.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Senior Military Lawyer, &#147;Background Briefing &#150; Uniform Code of Military Justice and Court Martial Procedures,&#148; DoD News Transcript, May 19, 2004, <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/transcripts/2004/tr20040519-0785.html" target="_new">http://www.defenselink.mil/transcripts/2004/tr20040519-0785.html</a></font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ambuhl reportedly was present during sexually humiliating abuse including the formation and photographing of a human pyramid of nude detainees, and was partially visible in a photograph of Pfc. Lynndie England holding a leash attached to a nude detainee.  At the same time, several detainees reportedly praised Ambuhl for treating them humanely, and she apparently came to the aid of a detainee who had difficulty breathing after being punched by another soldier.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dereliction of duty, the sole remaining charge against Ambuhl, is governed by Article 92  of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) governing the failure to follow orders or obey regulations:</font></p><p></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">892. ART. 92. FAILURE TO OBEY ORDER OR REGULATION <br>Any person subject to this chapter who-- <br>(1) violates or fails to obey any lawful general order or regulation; <br>(2) having knowledge of any other lawful order issued by any member of the armed forces, which it is his duty to obey, fails to obey the order; or <br>(3) is derelict in the performance of his duties; <br>shall be punished as a court-martial may direct. <br>10 USC &sect;892, UCMJ Article 92, <a href="http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/ucmj2.htm#892.%20ART.%2092.%20FAILURE%20TO%20OBEY%20ORDER%20OR%20REGULATION" target="_new">http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/ucmj2.htm#892.%20ART.%2092.%<br>20FAILURE%20TO%20OBEY%20ORDER%20OR%20REGULATION<br></a>Because it was Ambuhl&#146;s duty to intervene to stop the prisoner abuse, her failure to do so was akin to disobeying orders.<br>While admitting the wrongfulness of Ambuhl&#146;s failure to intervene, Ambuhl&#146;s attorney also has argued that she neglected to report the abuse because of the involvement of superiors and military intelligence personnel.  </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thus far, all four Abu Ghraib prosecutions have resulted in plea bargains and three have been brought under either a summary court martial or special court martial, with only former Army Staff Sergeant Ivan Frederick being subjected to a general court martial, resulting in an eight-year prison sentence.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Remaining Abu Ghraib courts martial include those of Pfc. England, scheduled to stand trial Jan. 17, 2005, Specialist Charles Graner, whose trial is set to begin Jan. 7, 2005, and Sgt. Javal Davis, who goes on trial starting Feb. 1, 2005.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sources and further reading:</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Abu Ghraib Article 39A Hearings Held in Germany,&#148; Armed Forces Press Service, Aug. 25, 2004, <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Aug2004/n08252004_2004082503.html" target="_new">http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Aug2004/n08252004_2004082503.html</a></font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Abu Ghraib guard agrees to plea bargain,&#148; UPI, Nov.
