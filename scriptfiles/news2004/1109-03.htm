<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- November 9 -- &quot;The President&#146;s first term in office certainly proved disastrous for our environment.  But the election results should not be seen as a vote of confidence from the American people in the President&#146;s environmental policies.    </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Polls consistently show large, bipartisan majorities of Americans disapprove of this president&#146;s treatment of our land, air, water and wildlife during his first term.  Now that President Bush has won reelection, we believe he has an opportunity to heed those voices at long last, and give common-sense conservation a seat at the table in his administration.   </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;At Defenders, we have fought a three-year battle to blunt a string of radical environmental attacks by this administration and we&#146;re not about to stop now.  Though we fully realize that those fights may get harder in the next Bush term, we stand ready to meet the challenge, and to protect our natural heritage for our children and grandchildren.&#148; </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Defenders of Wildlife is one of the nation's most progressive advocates for wildlife and habitat, and was named as one of America's Top 100 Charities by Worth magazine.
