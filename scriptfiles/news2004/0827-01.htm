<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NEW YORK - August 27 - </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CODEPINK: Women for Peace matches Mayor Bloomberg&#146;s incentive program</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHEN: Friday, August 27, 11:30 AM</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHERE: Police station at 357 W. 35th Street (btwn. 8th and 9th Avenues), NYC</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHAT: Peaceful police officers will receive smiles and positive responses from RNC protesters, as well as discounts at several New York City stores, if they pledge to remain peaceful during demonstrations that are planned during the Republican National Convention. CODEPINK: Women for Peace obtained the discounts and designed the &#147;peaceful New York police buttons&#148; in an effort similar to the &#147;peaceful political activist&#148; program that was launched by Mayor Bloomberg last week.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Ours is not a fight with the police; it&#146;s a deeply felt opposition to the Bush administration&#146;s policies,&#148; said Andrea Buffa of CODEPINK, who was arrested last week during an attempted banner hang during Mayor Bloomberg&#146;s press conference &#147;welcoming&#148; peaceful protesters to New York. &#147;We thought we could ease the tension before the demonstrations begin by asking New York police officers to help us exercise our First Amendment rights by remaining peaceful during the protests.&#148;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Police officers who choose to wear the buttons can receive discounts from such businesses as ABC Homes and Carpets (20 % off); Axis Gallery (10 % of art work); The Culture Project (50 % off on any performance); Angelica&#146;s Kitchen (5 % off on meals); and screenings of the movie &#147;Uncovered&#148; at the Angelica Theater (10 % off).</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CODEPINK: Women for Peace began in October 2002 as an effort by women to stop the war on Iraq, and in a short time has become a vibrant presence in the peace and social justice community. The group is know for its clever and witty actions, like handing pink slips to Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and other prominent administration officials to &#147;fire&#148; them for dragging the country into war and economic hardship. Since its inception, thousands of women have been inspired by CODEPINK to go to Washington to protest the war with Iraq and start CODEPINK chapters in their own cities. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CODEPINK plans to hold frequent protests before the Republican National Convention. In the coming days, CODEPINK is sponsoring a &#147;Women Against War&#148; event to be held at the historic Riverside Church on Saturday, August 28 as well as a women&#146;s rally and march that will join with the massive United for Peace and Justice anti-war march on Sunday, August 29. On Tuesday, August 31, they are co-sponsoring a &#147;Shut-up-a-thon&#148; outside Fox News.</font></p><p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">###</font></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
