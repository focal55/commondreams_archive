<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - February 25 - A national coalition of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender youth and youth-serving organizations condemned President Bush&#146;s support for a proposed Constitutional marriage amendment against same sex couples, and questioned the president's priorities of meeting the needs of all Americans.</FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Our troops continue to be sent abroad, millions of Americans have problems making it by on a daily basis, which young people feel the brunt of &#133;Amid all of this, is this truly the most pressing issue Bush sees in the United States?,&quot; asked Craig A. Bowman, executive director of the National Youth Advocacy Coalition (NYAC).  Bowman said, &#147;It scares us that this administration&#146;s priorities could be so out of touch with the daily reality of Americans.&quot;  </FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Bowman said, &quot;What does Bush want to gain from this?  Although Bush gave his support for the proposed amendment, he plays no formal role in the constitutional amendment process, which can take up to seven years and will actually burden the states and their legislatures.&quot;</FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Recent national surveys show the majority of young people ages 15-29 support the rights of same-sex couples to marry, according to polls by New York Times/CBS News and CIRCLE.  NYAC is mobilizing youth nationwide to fight the amendment through its website, www.nyacyouth.org</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">NYAC says that Bush's condemnation of same-sex marriage will ultimately hurt young people, especially those who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and questioning (LGBTQ).</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;For LGBTQ young people who are struggling to survive in a hostile, homophobic world, the public discourse around civil marriage for same-sex couples has very real implications,&#148; said Beth Beck, NYAC&#146;s Director of Health Programs. &#147;When faced with the hatred and ignorance which has characterized much of this public debate, the isolation LGBTQ young people already face can quickly turn to desperation, hopelessness, and unhealthy decision-making,&#148; added Beck.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">  NYAC has consistently heard from LGBTQ young people around the country that equality is an important issue for them. The following are just a few of their quotes:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;I want to be able to marry my partner when I grow up; and have the comfort of knowing that future generations of LGBT youth will be safe from violent, ignorant people.&#148;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;I believe I should have the right to get married to whomever I want and that it should be called marriage and not something else.&#148;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;I want to have my committed relationship be a matter of public record and share the same rights as heterosexual couples.&#148;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;We should have the right to openly express our love in public and in private, to marry and divorce who we choose, and to feel safe being ourselves without fear of retribution.&#148;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In not allowing same-sex couples the basic right to codify their union through civil marriage, states (and the federal government) deny LGBT individuals more than 1,000 federal protections and responsibilities and countless more at the state level&#151;protections which make it possible for married people to visit one another in the hospital; make important healthcare and financial decisions for one another in times of crisis; or share custody and responsibility for their children.</FONT></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
