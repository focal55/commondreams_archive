<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - April 15 - Statement of CSPI Executive Director Michael F. Jacobson </FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The McDonald&#146;s announcement advances public relations more than it does public health. The company&#146;s small steps seem more designed to forestall the big steps that government should be taking to prevent obesity and heart disease. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Government should be pushing big-step solutions like requiring nutrition information on menus and menu boards, getting junk-food ads off kids&#146; television, and getting junk food out of schools. Government&#151;-Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson in particular&#151;-should be pushing these big steps instead of playing pattycake with one of the world&#146;s biggest junk-food producers. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Consumers have good reason to be skeptical about the company&#146;s latest promises, since the company broke its promise to reformulate its trans-fat-laden cooking oil. By frying in partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, McDonald&#146;s recklessly promotes heart disease among its consumers. It could prolong the lives of its customers by simply switching to liquid vegetable oil. It should also use lower-fat meat, lower-fat cheese, lower the salt content in many of its products, and continue to expand the number of healthful items on its menu. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">I&#146;m glad that McDonald&#146;s says it will promote its salads, and hand out step meters, and so on. Those are all good things. But if McDonald&#146;s were sincere about promoting healthy eating, it would put calorie counts right on menu boards. </FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
