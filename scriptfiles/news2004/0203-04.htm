The campaign already calls those who collect $100,000 'Pioneers' and those who bring in $200,000 'Rangers.' The Bush/Cheney campaign's sophisticated tracking system provides each fundraiser a number, and those who send in checks are encouraged by the fundraiser to put this individualized tracking number in the memo line on their checks.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;We know that President Bush knows who raises half a million dollars,&quot; said Nick Nyhart, executive director of Public Campaign Action Fund. &quot;We're going call attention to the brazen pay-to-play politics encouraged and condoned by the Pioneer and Ranger system by naming this next category of super-mega-fundraisers.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Public Campaign Action Fund also announced the timeline and schedule for the contest. After being flooded with early entries, the organization set the following deadlines for entries, voting, and selecting a winner.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">All entries must be submitted by Wednesday, February 11th at 5:00 p.m. EST.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">1. Judges will select the top five finalists on Monday, February 16th. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">2. The public will have until Sunday, February 29th at 12:00 midnight EST to cast a vote for their favorite name for the category. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">3. The winning entry will be announced on March 1st. Public Campaign Action Fund will also unveil a secret plan to do something with the winning entry. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">4. Finalists and those who recruit five new entrants will receive prizes, including a &quot;Fat Cat&quot; t-shirt and a $tate of the Union poster.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;We have chosen to reward not just creativity in this contest, but  outreach,&quot; continued Nyhart. &quot;We value participation in politics, and we're encouraging contestants to get others involved. We call it a 'friend-raiser' to highlight to the special interest fundraising.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Public Campaign Action Fund is a non-partisan, non-profit organization working to reduce the influence of special interest money in politics and to advance comprehensive campaign finance reform at the federal and state levels.</FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
