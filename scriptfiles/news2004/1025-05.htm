<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- October 20 -- Sinclair today responded to public opposition to their plans to air an anti-Kerry documentary days before the election by denying they ever intended to air it.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thousands of citizens protested Sinclair's plans as an abuse of the public airwaves. &quot;Citizens have roundly rejected the use of a broadcast station to insert bias into election coverage,&quot; said Free Press executive director Josh Silver. &quot;It is unacceptable for the owners of broadcast stations to use the public airwaves to advocate for the candidate they support.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pressure has been mounting on Sinclair for days, with financial analysts projecting that the controversy would hurt Sinclair's lobbying efforts to lift media ownership caps &#151; as well as the company's stock values, which are at a 52-week low. Shareholders have reacted aggressively to Sinclair's actions, perceiving that their investment in the integrity of this publicly licensed broadcaster has been undermined.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a thinly veiled attempt at damage control, Sinclair claimed Tuesday that they never intended to air 'Stolen Honor,' and announced plans to air a one-hour news program entitled &quot;A POW story: Politics, Pressure, and the Media.&quot; The program will feature extended clips from 'Stolen Honor.' It is unclear to what extent this program will carry a one-sided message.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We will watch with great skepticism to see that 'A POW Story' is not a wolf in sheep's clothing,&quot; continued Silver. &quot;We must continue to hold all broadcasters accountable for airing accurate, balanced presentations of the issues from both sides of this presidential race.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite this latest twist, as of 6:30pm EST October 19, several local affiliates in swing states (including WVAH in Charleston, WV; WTTA 38 in Tampa, FL; KMWB 23 in Minneapolis, MN; WPGH 53 in Pittsburgh, PA; WSTR 64 in Cincinnati, OH; and WSYX 6 in Columbus, OH) still have &quot;Stolen Honor&quot; listed to air this week.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
