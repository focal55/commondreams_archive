<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - September 14 - The Gay &amp; Lesbian Victory Fund and Leadership Institute announced the selection of Sen. Edward M. Kennedy as the fourth recipient of its Oates-Shrum Leadership Award for his decades of work for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) equal rights. The ceremony will take place on September 22 at 6 p.m. at the Washington Court Hotel on Capitol Hill and is open to ticket holders and the media.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">First awarded in 2001, the Oates-Shrum Leadership Award bares the names of its inaugural honorees, Marylouise Oates and Robert Shrum, early pioneers in the straight community for LGBT equal rights and the fight against HIV/AIDS. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It's a privilege to receive an award named in honor of Marylouise and Bob and their impressive work to achieve full equality for the LGBT community,&quot; said Senator Edward M. Kennedy. &quot;Bigotry is the enemy of our democracy, and that is why the Victory Fund's work is so important. No Americans deserve to be the victim of discrimination because of their sexual orientation.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From authoring the first comprehensive national AIDS research funding legislation and fighting for passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act, to leading the charge for both national hate crimes and employment non-discrimination legislation, Senator Kennedy has been a national champion for LGBT equality and steadfast leader in the battle against HIV/AIDS for over thirty years. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Each year, the Gay &amp; Lesbian Victory Fund and Leadership Institute bestows the Oates-Shrum Leadership Award upon an individual whose outstanding work for justice and equality exemplifies the Victory Fund's vision of a society that embraces LGBT individuals as valued and empowered participants in all aspects of public life.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Previous Oates-Shrum Award honorees have included 2003 recipients Anne Wexler and Dr. Joseph Duffey for their groundbreaking efforts in American politics on behalf of LGBT equality and 2002 recipient Leo Hindery, Jr. for his critical work to further corporate America's support of lesbian and gay rights and the battle against HIV/AIDS.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Grammy-nominated composer and saxophonist Dave Koz will perform at the event and additional special guests will be announced. Each year the event draws dozens of members of Congress and such premiere sponsors as American Airlines, Showtime, See See Eye communications, PlanetOut, Comcast, Washington Blade, Duplex Diner, Witeck Combs Communications, Steptoe &amp; Johnson LLP, Human Rights Campaign, AFSCME, AFT, NEA, and Corporate Executive Board.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For tickets or more information, visit <a href="http://www.victoryfund.org" target="_new">http://www.victoryfund.org</a></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
