This most recent investment brings total charitable investments in the country to approximately $1 million since 2001. The recipients of this year's grants include:</font></p><ul><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">EngenderHealth, Inc., which received a two-year grant totaling $141,370 for a program aimed at improving the quality of maternal and child health services offered in the Boke prefecture.</font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">International Rescue Committee (IRC), which received a $57,700 grant to partner with Today's Women International Network (TWIN), a Guinean organization that provides training to young women vulnerable to abuse and exploitation.</font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> School-to-School International, which received a $45,300 grant to improve teaching conditions in primary schools near Conakry so that future generations can break the cycle of poverty prevalent in Guinea.</font></li></ul><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The grants are part of Alcoa Foundation's commitment to improving the quality of life of Alcoa communities worldwide. Alcoa's presence in Guinea includes acting as managing partner of Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee (CBG) and holding an equity position in Halco Mining, which is a majority owner of CBG. With operations in Kamsar and Sangaredi, CBG serves the alumina and chemicals market through the mining of bauxite. In addition, Alcoa World Alumina LLC is exploring the possibility of jointly developing a 1.5 million metric ton per year (mtpy) alumina refinery in Guinea with Alcan Inc. and the Government of the Republic of Guinea. A feasibility study for the refinery is expected to be completed by mid-2005.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;With the active involvement of Alcoa management, we have built private-public partnerships with the Ministry of Health, The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and non-governmental organizations to develop systemic and sustainable solutions in Guinea,&quot; said Ibrahima Danso, managing director of Alcoa-Guinea. &quot;Alcoa has worked closely with NGOs to build a better quality of life in Guinea, and our commitment is further demonstrated by these most recent grants from Alcoa Foundation.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The grant to EngenderHealth, a non-profit organization based in New York City, will go toward implementing a Safe Motherhood Program at five health centers and their satellite health posts in the Boke district in Guinea. The program will educate participants about modern family planning methods, infectious diseases and complications that can arise during child birth. Approximately $75,000 in grant money will be distributed this year and $67,000 will be distributed in 2005.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The grant to the IRC, also based in New York City, will fund the second phase of a program that aims to prepare participants to begin their own businesses as a sustainable means of supporting themselves. In 2005, the women will receive business training that will build on the vocational training and health education that they received during the first phase of the project.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The grant to School-to-School International, a non-profit organization based in San Francisco, will fund the Alcoa School Health Education project at approximately 16 elementary schools in the Kamsar and Sangaredi areas. The project - which will involve teachers, parents, community members, and local education and health officials - will address issues such as nutrition, hygiene, school sanitation, malaria, and HIV/AIDS.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>About Alcoa Foundation</i></font></p><p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 2003, Alcoa Foundation made $15 million in grants around the world.
