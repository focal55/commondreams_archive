<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- November 17 -- </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>WHAT:</b>  More than 10,000 people from across the US&#151;including actors Martin Sheen and Susan Sarandon and musician Amy Ray of the Indigo Girls&#151;will gather at the gates of Fort Benning this Saturday and Sunday to call for the closure of the US Army&#146;s School of the Americas (SOA).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The gathering will culminate on Sunday with a solemn &#147;funeral&#148; procession to the gates of Fort Benning. Many will negotiate a barbed-wire fence to enter the military base in an act of nonviolent civil disobedience. Since protests against the SOA/WHINSEC began more than a decade ago, over 170 people have served federal prison sentences of up to 18 months.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>WHEN:</b>	Rally to &#147;Close the SOA&#148;:  Saturday, Nov. 20, 11:30 am &#150; 5:00 pm<br>
   	Vigil and Funeral Procession:  Sun., Nov. 21, 2004, 8:30 am &#150; 4:00 pm<br>	Press Conference:  Sat., 10:30 am, behind main stage on Ft. Benning Road<br>	Press Briefing:  Sunday, 2:30 pm, in front of Media Office, Southgates Apartments, Building 26</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>WHERE:</b>  Main gates of Fort Benning, Fort Benning Road, Columbus, Georgia</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>WHY:</b>  The SOA, recently renamed the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation or WHINSEC, is a combat-training facility for Latin American security personnel located at Fort Benning, Georgia. The school has trained over 60,000 Latin Americans since its inception in 1946 in courses such as counter-insurgency techniques, sniper training, commando and psychological warfare, military intelligence and interrogation tactics. Graduates of the facility return to their countries to utilize their training domestically and are consistently cited for human rights violations throughout Latin America.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>SOA Watch, a grassroots organization working to close the school, has gathered at the gates of Fort Benning every November since 1990. The vigils commemorate the anniversary of the 1989 assassinations of 14-year-old Celina Ramos, her mother Elba and six Jesuit priests in El Salvador; 19 of the 26 officers found responsible for the murders by the United Nations were trained at the School of the Americas.</i></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
