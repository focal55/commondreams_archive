<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - February 3 - 20/20 Vision, a national, nonpartisan public education organization, today launched an on-line petition calling on Congress to create a truly independent commission to investigate the Iraq war intelligence failure before the November elections. &#147;The White House is pulling a fast one on the American people,&#148; said Tom Z. Collina, 20/20 Vision Executive Director.  &#147;By launching a probe under his control, President Bush is trying to kick this issue past the November elections.  The American people deserve an honest, timely review, not a whitewash.&#148;</FONT></p><P></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">To demonstrate public support for a truly independent and timely investigation, 20/20 Vision has launched an on-line petition that asks Congress to create a separate commission not under the administration&#146;s control.  &#147;The White House should never investigate itself&#151;it would be like Nixon investigating Watergate,&#148; said Collina. &#147;And it cannot be trusted to deliver results by Election Day, when American voters need this information.&#148; </FONT></P><P></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The petition is located at <A HREF="http://www.2020vision.org/peace/wmdpetition.html" TARGET="_new">http://www.2020vision.org/peace/wmdpetition.html</A>.</FONT></P><P></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Bush administration announced that it will establish a commission&#151;made up of members of its choosing and covering a broad range of intelligence topics&#151;that will continue into 2005.  The Democratic leadership of the House and Senate sent a letter to the President yesterday stating that: &#147;A commission appointed and controlled by the White House will not have the independence or credibility necessary to investigate these issues.&#148;</FONT></P><P></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">According to Collina, a congressionally appointed commission should focus on the issue of the White House&#146;s role in hyping the Iraqi threat and report back before the election.  &#147;Some say we should not politicize this issue by mixing it with the 2004 elections,&#148; said Collina.  &#147;But this is inherently a political issue.  America went to war&#151;at a cost of hundreds of lives and billions of dollars&#151;based on President Bush&#146;s exaggerated case that Iraq was an imminent threat.  He was wrong&#151;there is no debate about that.  The question is, did he know he was wrong?  For America to be a truly informed democracy, we need the truth before November 2.&#148;</FONT></P><P></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Collina added, &#147;if I was your stock broker, and I lost your life&#146;s savings on a bad deal, wouldn&#146;t you want to know that before you renewed my contract?&#148;</FONT></P><P></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
