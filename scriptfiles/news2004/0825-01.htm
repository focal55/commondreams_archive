<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NEW YORK - August 25 - An open letter released today urges media to ensure fair, balanced and accurate coverage of the RNC demonstrations.  Responding to a slew of recent media reports that have distorted the aims and intents of citizen-protesters at the upcoming Republican National Convention, demonstration organizers are appealing to members of the news media to cover the upcoming protests with the utmost care and diligence. The appeal comes in the form of an open letter that the activists will use to reach out to the media and will post on their websites.</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The letter begins:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;We write as representatives of peace and justice organizations that will convene in New York City during the Republican National Convention to express our dissent to the current administration&#146;s policies and practices, including the occupation of Iraq, attacks on our civil liberties, the impoverishment of our communities and the destruction of our environment. We are concerned by the slant of some of the media coverage that has focused on potential violence or made unsubstantiated and sensationalist claims about the activists who will be demonstrating during the Convention.&#148;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The letter is signed by more than 50 prominent individuals representing peace, environmental, religious, immigrant, youth and community organizations ranging from the Sierra Club to the National Organization for Women to Military Families Speak Out. The letter suggests several ways for journalists to ensure the most fair and balanced coverage of the dissent in the streets. It urges reporters to:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#133; not repeat unsubstantiated allegations; <br>&#133; scrutinize the behavior of law enforcement officials as well as demonstrators; <br>&#133; depict the diversity of those in the streets; <br>&#133; seek out personal stories that best convey the activists&#146; issues; <br>&#133; and to emphasize the actions and sentiments of the many, not the few. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;In the past, the media has focused on a few people burning an American flag or smashing a Starbucks window instead of the creative and non-violent actions of tens of thousands of concerned citizens,&#148; says Medea Benjamin of the women&#146;s peace group CodePink. &#147;We are urging the media to provide coverage that reflects the passionate, but non-violent commitment of the majority.&#148;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;We understand that the job of reporters is to provide interesting, compelling stories,&#148; says Andrea Buffa of the human rights group Global Exchange. &#147;Our movement is full of fascinating people with compelling stories, and we have happy to help journalists find those people.&#148; Such compelling stories could include:</font></p><ul><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Marchers from Iraq Veterans Against the War, former soldiers who are aghast at how their comrades are dying for what they say is a war built on lies.</font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Demonstrators from September 11 Families for Peaceful Tomorrows, who decry what they say is the Bush Administration&#146;s cynical attempts to reap political gain from their personal losses.</font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Women from the peace group CodePink, who organize creative, colorful actions to express their opposition to the Bush Administration&#146;s policies of naked aggression.</font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Workers from the Communications Workers of America, who oppose the Bush Administration&#146;s policies that favor giant corporations over working families. </font></li></ul><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The letter concludes: &#147;What [the public] sees should be an honest reflection of the issues that will determine the future of our country and our role within the world. We hope you will step up to the task that lies before you. The future of our public discourse, which is the basis for democracy, depends on it&#148;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To read the full text of the open letter, see <a href="http://www.codepinkalert.org" target="_new">www.codepinkalert.org</a>.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">###</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AN OPEN LETTER TO MEDIA COVERING THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We write as representatives of peace and justice organizations that will convene in New York City during the Republican National Convention to express our dissent to the current administration&#146;s policies and practices, including the occupation of Iraq, attacks on our civil liberties, the impoverishment of our communities and the destruction of our environment.  </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We are concerned by the slant of some of the media coverage that has focused on potential violence or made unsubstantiated and sensationalist claims about the activists who will be demonstrating during the Convention.  </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We know that your goal is to provide interesting, compelling coverage. We hope you will work with us to make sure that your coverage also reflects the real sentiment and values of the demonstrators.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We offer the following suggestions as a way to ensure fair, balanced and accurate coverage of our issues and activities during the Republican Convention:</font></p><ul><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PLEASE DO NOT REPEAT UNSUBSTANTIATED ALLEGATIONS.  The police and other authorities have made declarations about our plans at events in the past and during the lead up to this one.  Many claims have later been proven unfounded and serve only to distort our legitimate concerns and suggested solutions.  Journalists should practice due diligence by exploring the source of those claims and speaking with representatives of our various groups before reporting them.<br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">FIND THE COMPELLING, PERSONAL STORIES:  Many of us have firsthand experience with regard to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the erosion of women&#146;s rights, the struggle to combat poverty, and so many other issues that are of critical interest to Americans.  As those of you who have covered our stories well know, your readers and viewers will find them interesting and informative. We are happy to connect you with people and groups that can provide unique angles on our issues.<br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PLEASE DEPICT US AS THE COMPLEX AND DIVERSE GROUPS WE ARE.  We are grandparents, teachers, students, business people, and military families.  We come from the working class and the affluent class.  We are people from all ethnic and religious backgrounds; we reflect a range of political ideology.  Coverage of demonstrations often reflects greater biases in journalism, with a disproportionate focus on a white, male demographic.  We encourage you to provide your readers and viewers with an understanding of the full diversity of who is participating and why. <br> </font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">EMPHASIZE THE ACTIONS AND SENTIMENTS OF THE MANY, NOT THE FEW:  In past demonstrations, the creative and non-violent actions of tens of thousands have been downplayed or ignored in the media in favor of covering a few individuals who have chosen tactics that involve property destruction.  We ask that you devote space in accordance with the numbers of people participating in different actions. <br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RESPONSIBLY SCRUTINIZE THE ACTIONS OF THE POLICE TOWARD DEMONSTRATORS.  In our experience, the violence that has occurred at some events has often been provoked by the police, either in uniform or undercover.  We ask that you offer coverage of police violence to the same extent that you would scrutinize violence incited by others.<br></font></li></ul><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some media outlets have, in hindsight, acknowledged a failure of accuracy in the coverage leading up to the Iraq war. The media&#146;s repetition of the administration&#146;s claims of Iraq&#146;s weapons of mass destruction and Al-Qaeda links was instrumental in drumming up political support for the war and squelching meaningful debate. Largely uncovered were the basic messages of the peace and justice movement that America&#146;s war in Iraq would lead to untold death and destruction, serve to further marginalize the United States in the global community and fill the ranks of our enemies with willing volunteers. The peace movement&#146;s claims have weathered the test of time far better than the Bush administration&#146;s claims.  Meanwhile, buried deep in the news lies the plight of communities worsening as health care, education, environmental programs, and even veteran benefits have been gutted. Our hope during the Republican Convention is to uncover these stories. Our goal is to show the American public and the world community that we are appalled by the actions of this administration and determined to hold them accountable.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The whole world will be watching what happens in New York during the Republican Convention. What they see should be an honest reflection of the issues that will determine the future of our country and our role within the world.  We hope you will step up to the task that lies before you. The future of our public discourse, which is the basis of our democracy, depends on it.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thank you.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*Organizations for identification purposes only.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Partha Banerjee<br>New York Immigrant Rights Activist</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mavis Belisle<br>The Peace Farm</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Medea Benjamin<br>Co-Founder, Global Exchange</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Andrew Boyd <br>Billionaires for Bush</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Michael Brune<br>Executive Director, Rainforest Action Network</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Leslie Cagan<br>National Coordinator, United for Peace and Justice</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Kelly Campbell<br>Co-founder, Sept 11th Families for Peaceful Tomorrows</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Marilyn Clement<br>National Coordinator, The Campaign for a National Health Program NOW</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">David Cline<br>National President, Veterans For Peace<br>Coordinator, Vietnam Veterans Against the War</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Larry Dansinger<br>Resources for Organizing and Social Change</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sam Diener<br>Editor, Peacework Magazine</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jodie Evans<br>Co-Founder, CODEPINK: Women for Peace</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">FAIR, Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lisa Fithian<br>Root Activist Network of Trainers/Co-Chair, United for Peace and Justice</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Beth Fitzgerald<br>Peace Action*</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Marvin Feldman<br>Tikkun Community</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Henry and Jackie Florsheim<br>Brooklyn Peace Action</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Kimberly Flynn<br>9/11 Environmental Action</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Kim Gandy<br>President, National Organization for Women</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Van Gosse<br>Co-Chair, Historians Against the War<br>Assistant Professor, Franklin and Marshall College</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">G.
