<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - September 7 - The League of Women Voters of the United States (LWVUS) today announced the beginning of a voter education and public awareness campaign with nationwide reach &#150; <a href="http://www.lwv.org/elibrary/pub/vote_palmcard.pdf" target="_new">5 Things You Need to Know on Election Day</a>.  This effort familiarizes voters with new election procedures and ways they can take action to ensure their votes are counted.  </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Voters need to know that there are simple steps they can take to protect their votes in November,&#148; said Kay J. Maxwell, LWVUS President.  &#147;Changes have been made since the last presidential election to protect voters.  All citizens need to be aware of what they are and what to expect on Election Day.  The 5 Things card is a handy reference &#150; a last minute checklist &#150; to help voters to prepare to vote and participate in this election,&#148; Maxwell stated.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The League is distributing more than half a million <a href="http://www.lwv.org/elibrary/pub/vote_palmcard.pdf" target="_new">5 Things voter cards</a> through its 900 state and local Leagues, more than 2,000 public libraries and numerous election reform partner organizations.  Today also marks the kick-off of the 5 Things fall tour with President Maxwell on the road for the remaining weeks before Election Day.  Maxwell will visit six states &#150; Iowa, Wisconsin, Illinois, Ohio, Florida and Missouri &#150; to reach out to voters and the media across the country with this important voter education message.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;In addition to the new federal reforms, election rules and procedures vary from state to state, county to county,&#148; added Maxwell.  &#147;While some districts will have new voting machines, a majority of this fall&#146;s voters will use the same machines they did in the 2000 election.  There is a new federal identification requirement for first-time voters who register by mail, but some states have broadened this to apply to all voters,&#148; Maxwell said.  &#147;In addition, all states must provide provisional ballots for voters who find themselves not on the list of registered voters,&#148; stated Maxwell.  &#147;But in some states election officials will allow voters to cast these provisional ballots, but then not count them if, for instance, they are cast at the so-called &#145;wrong&#146; polling place.&#148;</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Voters need to ask how these new rules are being applied in their cities and states, so they can prepare themselves, and protect their votes,&#148; Maxwell said.  &#147;The League is urging voters to learn the 5 Things they need to know on Election Day to make sure their votes are counted.&#148;</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The 5 Things cards give voters the knowledge to look out for themselves and their votes on Election Day.  Armed with this information, the League hopes to create positive expectations, improve voter confidence and encourage people to participate and vote,&#148; concluded Maxwell.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Related League Election and Voting Resources Available Online at <a href="http://www.lwv.org" target="_new">www.lwv.org</a>:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Top Five Risks to Eligible Voters in 2004 (5/04) </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Helping America Vote: A Guide to the Implementing the New Federal Provisional Ballot Requirement (9/03) </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Helping America Vote: Safeguarding the Vote (7/04)</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">VOTE Brochure (10/03) </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Navigating Election Day (Revised 10/03 Online Only) </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="http://www.dnet.org" target="_new">www.dnet.org</a></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="http://www.lwv.org/voter" target="_new">www.lwv.org/voter</a></font></p><p></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
