<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - August 26 - &quot;In only three and a half years, George W. Bush and the right wing leadership in Congress have undermined and eroded more than four decades of advancements for women,&quot; said NOW President Kim Gandy, on the 84th anniversary of Women's Equality Day. &quot;We are declaring a State of Emergency for women's rights and calling upon all of our allies and supporters to get involved in the election process to put an end to the relentless attacks on women.&quot; </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Most recently, the Bush administration&#151;with the help of its Congressional stronghold&#151;imposed drastic changes to the overtime pay law. The new regulations empty the pockets and limit the livelihoods of millions of working women. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;They redefined the Fair Labor Standards Act to the liking of their biggest donors in Corporate America&#151;just as they rewrote domestic violence laws, birth control laws, and saw to the appointment of judges that are committed to turning back the clock. Those in power have made it clear that they have complete disregard for the best interests of women in this country,&quot; said Gandy. &quot;The personal freedom and rights of women are under attack. I urge every person in this country who cares about women's reproductive rights and health, economic justice, and equal rights for all, to decry these attacks by getting out the vote.&quot; </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;November 2 will be the most important election of our lifetimes,&quot; said Gandy. &quot;Do your part and get involved so that we can get back on track toward achieving full equality for ourselves, our sisters, and our daughters.&quot; </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;By working together, we can reverse this calculated strategy to erode women's rights,&quot; said Gandy. &quot;Celebrate Women's Equality Day by working for change&#151;whether it's registering voters through NOW's <a href="http://www.10forchange.org/" target="_new">10forChange.org</a>, knocking on doors, or making calls on behalf of pro-woman's rights candidates&#151;your hard work will result in a victory for all of us in November.&quot; </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NOW's Petition to the Candidates: <a href="http://www.now.org/issues/election/equality-day-petition.html" target="_new">A Call to Action on Women's Equality Day </a></font></p><p></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
