<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - July 12 -  While the Senate continues to debate the issue of blame for the false information that was used to justify the war in Iraq, the fact remains that the two primary justifications -- Iraqi weapons of mass destruction and a link between Al Qaida and Iraq -- have been shown by the Senate report to be without merit.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">To date, 887 U.S. troops; 60 troops from the UK; 60 from other &quot;coalition&quot; forces and over ten thousand Iraqi men, women and children have been killed as a result of the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in March, 2003.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Military Families Speak Out is an organization of over 1,500 military families with loved ones who have been killed in Iraq, who are serving in Iraq, who have been wounded physically and/or psychologically by the war in Iraq, and who may deploy or redeploy to Iraq. We demand an immediate and personal apology by the Bush Administration to all those whose lives have been damaged by this war, beginning with those families in the U.S., in Iraq and around the world who have lost loved ones as a result of this war based on lies. Furthermore, funds must be made available to assist families whose loved ones have been killed or wounded physically or psychologically by this war based on lies. Finally, Military Families Speak Out demands an immediate end to the war and the return of U.S. troops to their home duty stations.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Through their grief, military families who have suffered unbearable loss say: not one more family should suffer what we have suffered, for a war that should never have happened, for a war based on lies. Military Families Speak Out asks the United States Senate: How can you ask a soldier to be the last to die for a lie?</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Available for Interview:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The following Military Families who have lost loved ones in Iraq are available for interview.
