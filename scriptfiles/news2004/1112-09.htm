<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LYNCHBURG, VA -- November 12 -- In response to continued attacks against gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender (GLBT) individuals and couples, over 50 Soulforce volunteers from as far away as Hawaii and Seattle, will gather in Washington, DC November 14 &#150; 17, in protest of the Roman Catholic&#146;s spiritually violent rhetoric against gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender (GLBT) people.  The purpose of this direct action is to try to dialogue with Catholic Bishops, change their hearts and minds regarding homosexuality, and beseech them to stop the spiritual violence perpetuated by Roman Catholic religious policies, teachings and anti-gay rhetoric against GLBT people.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This will mark the fifth year in a row that Soulforce has had a presence outside of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops&#146; (USCCB) annual meeting.   Last week, 150 people vigilled outside local Catholic chanceries in 11 cities across the United States, to increase the pressure on Bishops to meet with supporters of Soulforce to discuss the Catholic Church&#146;s misguided and antiquated policies against GLBT people and couples.  The Catholic Church was one of the main proponents of the proposed anti-gay Federal Marriage Amendment that sought to limit the civil rights of GLBT people and write discrimination into the U.S. Constitution.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHO:  Over 50 Soulforce supporters from all across the United States </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHAT: Direct Action and vigils (with signs and banners) <br>during the annual meeting of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHERE:  Hyatt Regency on Capitol Hill, 400 New Jersey Avenue, in Washington DC</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHEN: Sunday, November 14, 2004, beginning at 5pm, and continuing through Wednesday afternoon, November 17. <br> Nov. 14 (Sunday) vigil: 5pm &#150; 7pm (Hyatt Regency)<br> Nov. 15 - Nov. 17 (Mon., Tues., and Wed.) vigils:  7:15am &#150; 9:15am, and 11:30am &#150; 1:30pm (Hyatt Regency)<br> Nov. 15 &#150; Nov. 16 (Monday and Tuesday) vigils:  8pm &#150; 10pm (Hyatt Regency)<br>Nov. 15 (Monday) vigil before the Mass at the National Basilica at 5pm  <br>and vigil at Papal Nuncio (3339 Massachusetts Ave, NW) immediately following the Mass at National Basilica</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHY: To try to dialogue with Catholic Bishops, concerning the devastating effects of their anti-gay rhetoric and their outspoken support of the now-defeated Federal Marriage Amendment, to change their hearts and minds regarding homosexuality, and beseech them to stop the spiritual violence perpetuated by Roman Catholic religious policies, teachings and anti-gay rhetoric against GLBT people.  Additionally, by standing up to one&#146;s oppressors, supporters renew their spirits and empower others to do the same.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MEDIA:  This is an excellent photo-op and controversial story.  Excellent footage for news video, shots for still photos, and story for newsprint.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Soulforce, Inc. is a national interfaith movement committed to ending spiritual violence perpetuated by religious policies and teachings against gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender individuals.
