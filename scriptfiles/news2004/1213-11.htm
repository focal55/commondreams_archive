<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- December 13 -- Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA) today urged newly nominated Secretary of Health and Human Services Michael Leavitt to commit to valuing science over ideology in his potential new role and reminded the Senate of its duty to thoroughly investigate the qualifications and experience of every nominee for government office.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;America deserves a secretary of health and human services who understands the value of objective science and who will not put men, women and teens at risk just to further an ideological agenda,&quot; said PPFA President Gloria Feldt. &quot;America's pro-choice majority deserves an HHS secretary who will do everything in his power to protect their rights and improve their health by promoting -- instead of hindering -- access to health care services and sound public health practice for all.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Michael Leavitt was nominated today by President Bush to head the Department of Health and Human Services. He formerly served as the head administrator at the Environmental Protection Agency and as the governor of Utah for 11 years.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Planned Parenthood Federation of America is the nation's largest and most trusted voluntary reproductive health organization. PPFA believes that everyone has the right to choose when or whether to have a child - and that every child should be wanted and loved. Planned Parenthood affiliates operate nearly 850 health centers nationwide, providing medical services and sexuality education for millions of women, men, and teenagers each year. </i></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
