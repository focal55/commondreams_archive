<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- November 10 -- The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has announced its release of the draft environmental impact statement (DEIS) on the proposed Cape Wind Project, a huge private energy facility to be located in a narrow band of federal waters in Nantucket Sound.  The project would take up over 24 square miles of the Sound for 130 415-foot tall turbines and other facilities used for the storage and transportation of oil and electricity.  The surrounding waters under the control of the State of Massachusetts are designated as sanctuary and would prohibit such a project, but the developers are seeking to avoid those protections by placing the project in federal waters.  The project proponents claim that nothing more than a navigability permit from the Corps of Engineers is required.  </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Oceans Public Trust Initiative (OPTI) criticized the Corps for releasing the DEIS.  OPTI's Director, Cindy Lowry, stated:  &quot;The DEIS process is flawed in many ways, and this document never should have been released.  By far, the most serious problem is the fact that the Corps of Engineers has never answered the underlying question of whether a mere navigability permit can allow private developers to take personal control of the ocean resources that belong to all citizens.  For over one year, OPTI has attempted to gain clarification on this point from three federal agencies, and all of them have refused to provide an answer.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The procedure being used by the Corps to entertain the permit application presents a significant threat to ocean management.  It has already spawned a rash of other wind project proposals along the east coast from Massachusetts to Virginia.  It also opens the door to other types of ocean development, such as liquefied natural gas and aquaculture.  Worst of all, these permits are being processed by an agency that has itself admitted that it lacks the experience or knowledge to review energy projects for ocean development activities.  </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ms. Lowry stated:  &quot;It should be clear to everyone that this procedure is a serious threat to ocean resources everywhere in the country.  If this developer can build the largest offshore wind project in the world in an area that is as important as Nantucket Sound under a Corps navigation permit, then no ocean area is safe from exploitation.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In issuing the DEIS, the Corps has failed to follow the practice for other energy programs in the United States and wind energy in European countries, where offshore projects already exist.  No comprehensive review of offshore wind has occurred in the U.S., even though such a program is now underway for onshore wind projects on federal lands.  There also has been no effort made by the Corps to recover from the private developer compensation to the U.S. taxpayer for making use of federal land and resources, as in the case for every other development activity in the country.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ms. Lowry explained the defects with this approach:  &quot;The U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy already has noted the serious flaws in the approach being used by the Corps of Engineers for this project, yet the Bush Administration is proceeding with this project like it is nothing more than private home construction on private land.  The oceans off the coast of the United States are the public heritage of all citizens, and the federal government violates the most basic principles of environmental law when it threatens to give them away to a single developer for personal gain without authorization from Congress to do so.&quot;  </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">OPTI is concerned that the permit review is just the first step in an effort to open the oceans up to development.  Ms. Lowry stated:  &quot;Less than one week after the election, the Bush Administration has already renewed its assault on our oceans.  Make no mistake about it; this permit application for wind energy is the proverbial Pandora&#146;s box.  It threatens to open the door to a massive give away of federal lands with no compensation to the taxpayer or adequate environmental review.&quot;  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>OPTI is a program of the International Marine Mammal Project of the Earth Island Institute (EII).  EII is based in San Francisco and is a strong proponent of alternative energy and ocean protection.  It believes that both of these goals can be advanced expeditiously through proper procedures.  Those procedures are nowhere in evidence for the review of the Cape Wind Project</i></font></p>
