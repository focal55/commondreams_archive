<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BOSTON - September 14 - The international aid organization Oxfam today welcomed reports that the United States intends to rejoin the International Coffee Organization (ICO), marking an important step toward international cooperation to address the global crisis facing coffee farmers in poor countries. In recent years, coffee prices have plunged to historic lows, causing increased poverty, hunger, and dislocation among coffee farmers around the world. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;There can be no solution to global economic problems without the US,&quot; said Seth Petchers, Coffee Program Coordinator for Oxfam America. &quot;We look forward to working together to develop programs that can help alleviate the crisis for more than 25 million small coffee farmers throughout the world.&quot; </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As the world's largest coffee importer, the United States will play a crucial role in the ICO. Its re-entry will come amid an economic and humanitarian crisis facing small coffee farmers. Triggered by plunging coffee prices and a glut of low-quality product on the coffee market, the &quot;coffee crisis&quot; has ravaged coffee-growing communities in developing countries since 1999. After hitting a 30-year low in 2001, the price of coffee still remains below the cost of production for millions of farming families. As a result, millions of families lack basic necessities such as health care, education, and in some cases, adequate food. Many coffee farmers have been forced to abandon their land and migrate elsewhere in search of employment. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Coffee plays a crucial role in the economic health of communities in poor countries all over the world,&quot; said Petchers. &quot;With the US coming back to the table, the next step is development of a meaningful and comprehensive strategy to address the coffee crisis.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a 2002 report, Oxfam called on the US to rejoin the ICO as a key element of its coffee rescue plan. Now that the US intends to rejoin, Oxfam America calls on the U.S. to:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- commit to technical assistance for coffee farmers who are able to improve crop productivity and quality;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- support crop diversification for less competitive coffee farmers;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- expand access to rural financing and micro-credit for coffee cooperatives and farmers affected by the global coffee crisis;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- and assist in developing public-private partnerships that will strengthen market access for growers.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Background information available at: <a href="http://www.oxfamamerica.org/campaigncoffee" target="_new">http://www.oxfamamerica.org/campaigncoffee</a></font></p><p></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
