<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">PHILADELPHIA - May 14 - Far from the aberration painted by the Bush Administration, abuse is widespread in American prisons. It is also widespread in the U.S. military. Incredibly, women soldiers are not safe in their own ranks.</FONT></p><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Reports coming out of the Abu Ghraib prison tell a horrific tale of sexual abuse of male Iraqi prisoners at the hands of both men and women solders. Yet in the United States, torture of prisoners is frighteningly widespread.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> The United States has been cited by the United Nations as a human rights violator &#151; noting egregious violations, including the use of electric stun belts and restraint chairs on prisoners, prison chain gangs, sexual assault of female prisoners and detention of minors. </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Prisons are one of the largest growth industries in the United States. While the United States has 5 percent of the world's population, it holds an astounding 25 percent of the world's prisoner population.   </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;Reports of torture devices in prison largely come from the isolation units, called &#145;control units&#146;,&#148; adds Tonya McClary, national director of the AFSC criminal justice program. &#147;Torture devices commonly used in U.S. prisons are four-point restraints, restraint hoods, belts and beds, stun grenades, belts and guns, tethers, waist and leg chains and air tasers.&#148;</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Add to this the U.N. treaty positions on the racially biased death penalty, abuses involving the mentally ill, prison labor, children's rights and the shocking treatment of people in Immigration and Naturalization Service detention centers. </FONT></P><P> </P><P> <FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;U.S. prisoners are mostly poor and working-class people who need jobs and education,&#148; McClary concludes.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">It also should not be forgotten that, historically, it is women who have borne the brunt of sexual abuse whether in prison or a military barracks. All too often, their stories go untold and unreported.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">There are more than 100,000 women in state and federal prisons, where inmates are totally dependent on guards and other officers for their basic necessities. According to Amnesty International, records show correctional officials have subjected female inmates to rape, other sexual assault, sexual extortion and groping during body searches. Male officials watch women undressing, in the shower or the toilet. Female inmates who complain may subject themselves to brutal retaliation.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Women who join the military face a similar atmosphere of brutality and misogyny.  In the current war on Iraq, women have seen more combat, from more angles, than ever before. War and militarism increase violence against women: civilian women in war zones, wives and daughters of men returning from war zones, and women serving in the military themselves. </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In March, the Department of Defense admitted that there had been 112 reported sexual assaults among American troops recently in the Middle East. Approximately three quarters of the assault victims known to the Department of Defense are women in the Army.  Additionally, that same month the Miles Foundation, a private nonprofit that provides support for military assault victims, had received reports of 129 cases of sexual assault in the Middle East, only twenty percent of which had been reported to the military.  Historically, far more female service members have been abused by their fellow U.S. soldiers than will probably ever be killed or wounded by Iraqi defense forces.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Rapes and assaults in the military are not a new or isolated trend. The Miles Foundation also reports that one-third of all women veterans reported being sexually assaulted or physically harassed during their service &#151; for many, more than once. One hundred six Air Force members serving in the Pacific were accused of rape between 2001 and 2003. At the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado, 139 sexual assaults on women have been reported in the past ten years. At Texas&#146;s Sheppard Air Force Base, 24 women reported assaults that took place in 2002.</FONT></P><P> </P><P> <FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;For women in the military the pain and humiliation of rape is aggravated by the pain and humiliation often inflicted after the assault by their superior officers, some of whom are more likely to punish the victim &#151; whether officially or unofficially &#151; than the accused attacker,&#148; says Oskar Castro, national coordinator of the AFSC youth and militarism program. &#147;Instead of charges being filed against the attacker, married rape victims, for example, have been accused of adultery.  Many victims are forced to continue to live and work among their attackers.  Others are transferred against their will.&#148;</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">On the battlefield and off, women are at too great a risk of being victimized, and their stories an all-too easily forgotten casualty of wars at home and abroad. </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;Assault victims serving in the Middle East or other combat zones have a particularly difficult time because they are far from loved ones and do not have access to adequate medical treatment or psychological counseling,&#148; Castro adds.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Internationally recognized world wide for its contributions to civilian public service during World Wars I and II, the American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) is an international social justice organization that, along with the British Friends Service Council, won the Nobel Peace Prize on behalf of Quakers worldwide. </FONT> </P><P>                                                                        </P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
