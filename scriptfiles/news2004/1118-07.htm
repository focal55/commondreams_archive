The event has been organized by the Committee to ReDefeat the President, a federal political action committee, which is organizing citizens via a Web site called BeAmerica.org. It is holding a demonstration against the suspcious and highly selective mismanagement of the 2004 election by local authorities in Florida, Ohio and elsewhere on Friday November 19th from Noon to 2 p.m. in LaFayette Park in front of the White House.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Our goal is to expose the crimes against democracy committed in Ohio and Florida and show them as part of a pattern designed to benefit Bush rather than as isolated, local, minor 'glitches,' &quot; said ReDefeatBush founder David Lytel. &quot;There is compelling evidence that the voting 'irregularities' last week were not random, and we are calling upon state and local law enforcement authorities to investigate. We would not expect either the Congress nor the U.S. Department of Justice to take effective action -- as they failed to act in 2000 -- because the leaders of these institutions place loyalty to their political party above their love of their country, its laws, and the Constitution, which specifically sets out penalties for states that disenfranchise citizens.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We are calling upon concerned citizens to get off of the Internet and into the streets,&quot; said Lytel.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ReDefeatBush's list of the Top Ten Questions about the Legitimacy of the Presidential Election is available online at <a href="http://www.redefeatbush.com/downloads/tenquestions.pdf" target="_new">http://www.redefeatbush.com/downloads/tenquestions.pdf</a></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ReDefeatBush's petition calling for peaceful protests of the crimes against democracy and other updates are available online at <a href="http://www.beamerica.org/" target="_new">http://www.beamerica.org</a></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>ReDefeatBush is a political action committee formed in October 2003. It operated ReDefeatBush Calling Crews around the country in 2004 and generated tens of thousands of new registered voters in Pennsylvania and Oregon. Founder David Lytel holds a PhD in government from Cornell, served in the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy in President Clinton's first term, and is a former Democratic elected official. ReDefeatBush reaches approximately 50,000 Democratic activists on a regular basis with its Web site and e-mail newsletters, with its greatest strengths in the National Capital Region and the San Francisco Bay area.</i><br></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
