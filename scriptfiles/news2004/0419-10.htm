<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - April 19 - An estimated 500,000 Americans took part in MoveOn PAC's Bake Sale for Democracy. More than 14,000 volunteer bakers for MoveOn PAC, the online advocacy group, took their activities &#147;offline&#148; on Saturday, organizing over 1,100 bake sales to raise money for MoveOn PAC&#146;s campaign to &#147;Bake Back the White House.&#148; With an average of nearly $700 raised per bake sale, cookie sales will yield over $750,000 to support the group&#146;s efforts to remove George Bush from office in November.</FONT></p><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">As dawn swept across America, it cast light on preparations busily underway: a Nashville man who baked 30 key lime pies after work on Friday. Al Franken selling baked goods at Moby&#146;s caf&eacute; in NYC. Signs reading, &#147;Bake Back the White House&#148; plastered around Washington, DC&#146;s Adams Morgan neighborhood.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">While the results are still being tallied, current results suggest that the MoveOn PAC will have raised over three quarters of a million dollars, registered 4,750 citizens to vote, and distributed 43,000 pieces of literature encouraging the support of John Kerry.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;The sales were as easy as pie,&#148; said Adam Ruben, Field Director of MoveOn PAC and the event&#146;s organizer. &#147;We&#146;ve been overwhelmed by our members&#146; response to an email only a week ago. We wanted to hold an event contrasting President Bush&#146;s high-rolling backers with our regular Americans, and obviously people liked the idea. Winning an election has never tasted so sweet!&#148;</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Henri Spiegel, a MoveOn PAC volunteer in Miami Beach, FL, was proud to hold a bake sale. &#147;It's inspiring to see so many friends and neighbors express interest in this Bake Sale for Democracy-- a creative outlet to voice frustrations with the Bush Administration.  In Florida, we are going to show George Bush that every brownie&#151;like every vote&#151;counts,&#148; Spiegel said.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Battleground states experienced great activity over the weekend: a bake sale in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida reported raising $1,200 in its first three hours. All funds raised will go to support MoveOn PAC&#146;s efforts, including both advertising, like the group&#146;s recent ad highlighting Richard Clarke's statements to the 9/11 Commission, as well as grassroots mobilization to register voters and get out the vote in November.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The idea for the bake sale came after MoveOn PAC learned that more than 75% of the Bush campaign&#146;s fundraising came in contributions of $1000 or more. &#147;Those people are CEOs, lobbyists, wealthy people who benefited from Bush's tax cuts,&#148; Ruben said. &#147;By contrast, our members are regular Americans&#151;teachers, veterans, retired seniors, construction workers. They can&#146;t afford $1000 checks, so we wanted to give them a way to raise some dough and change the direction of our country.&#148;</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Volunteers were eager to chip in. &#147;I stand behind grassroots democracy-building efforts throughout America,&#148; said Warren Brown, owner of Washington, DC pastry store Cakelove. &#147;I&#146;m happy to bring attention to November 2nd through participating in MoveOn PAC&#146;s Bake Sale for Democracy.&#148;</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;Where else can someone make a one-dollar political contribution and make a difference?&#148; asked Adam Luna of Washington, DC. &#147;I live in Washington, DC, hear the sirens and see the warnings every day - George Bush has made life here a little more scary, but the bake sale made everyone smile.&#148;</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">A map of the bake sales, a list by neighborhood, updated tallies, and photos can be found at <A HREF="http://www.moveonpac.org/" TARGET="_new">www.MoveOnPAC.org</A>.</FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
