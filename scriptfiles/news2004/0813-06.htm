<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DEERFIELD, MA - August 13 - Veterans, military families, activists and interested individuals can now order an English version of a documentary film produced for German television by Freider Wagner and Valentin Thurn. This stunning new video, has just been released by Ochoa-Wagner Produktion in 2004 in Germany and is available through Traprock Peace Center in Deerfield, Massachusetts through the website, <a href="http://www.traprockpeace.org" target="_new">www.traprockpeace.org</a>.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Doctors, the Depleted Uranium, and the Dying Children&quot; exposes the use and impact of radioactive weapons during the current war against Iraq. The story is told by citizens of many nations and opens with comments by two British veterans, Kenny Duncan and Jenny Moore, describing their exposure to radioactive, so-called 'depleted uranium' (DU), weapons and the congenital abnormalities of their children. Dr. Siegwart-Horst G&uuml;nther, a former colleague of Albert Schweitzer, and Tedd Weyman of teh Uranium Medical Research Center (UMRC) traveled to Iraq, from Germany and Canada respectively, to assess uranium contamination in Iraq.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Weyman led the investigative team that gathered samples for analysis for the UMRC&shy; <a href="http://www.umrc.net" target="_new">http://www.umrc.net</a>  He discusses startling findings of the 2003 field investigations in Iraq. &quot;The human and environmental samples have been found to contain depleted uranium and abnormally high levels of the artificial transuranic isotope, 236U. ... Viewers will see in the film, evidence of a new class of uranium weapons.&quot; These include &quot;bunker defeat&quot; bombs.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As an M.D., Dr. G&uuml;nther is especially interested in the health effects that can be caused by such contamination. At a hospital in Basra, Dr. Jenan Hassan revealed an on-going health catastrophe--a ten-fold increase in cancers and a twenty-fold increase in congenital deformities. The grisly realities of the cancer ward provide an appropriate alarm that could help to stop the use of these weapons unless it can be shown they will not harm civilians for generations to come.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dr. Duracovic, founder of the Uranium Medical Research Centre, and formerly a Colonel in the U.S. Army, says that the Canadian government has wasted a million dollars on tests provided to Canadian veterans, using faulty methodology that looked for uranium in the hair, where uranium will not accumulate.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To purchase &quot;The Doctors, the Depleted Uranium, and the Dying Children&quot; (VHS NTSC format) go to <a href="http://www.traprockpeace.org/depleted_uranium_iraq.html" target="_new">http://www.traprockpeace.org/depleted_uranium_iraq.html</a> The purchase price is $25.00 for non-commercial, non-institutional use and includes first class mail within the US.
