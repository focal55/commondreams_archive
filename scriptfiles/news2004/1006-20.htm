<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BANGKOK - October 2 -Ahead of today's opening of the 13th Meeting of the <a href="http://www.cites.org/" target="_new">Conference of the Parties to the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species </a>(CITES), Greenpeace reminds delegates of their task to safeguard the future of the world's wildlife.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The world's oceans and forests are in crisis and many species are close to disappearing.  One of the greatest  threats to wildlife is unregulated trade,&quot; said Nathalie Rey of Greenpeace.  &quot;Governments meeting here in Bangkok must recognise that CITES regulations are a vital tool to fight illegal trafficking of plants and animals and ensure that trade does not compromise their future existence.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During the 13th Meeting of the Parties to CITES, Greenpeace is calling on governments to support the proposal for the listing of the high-value timber species, Ramin on Appendix II(1). Greenpeace is also seeking support for Appendix II listing for the giant reef fish Humphead Wrasse, the notorious Great White Shark; the transfer of the Irrawaddy Dolphin from Appendix II to Appendix I  for CITES trade regulation; and to uphold the listing of Minke whales on Appendix I.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Trade in species such as Ramin and Humphead wrasse not only impacts on the species itself, but also affects surrounding species. Orang-utans, which live in forests where ramin grows, are rapidly losing their forest homes. The use of cyanide to capture humphead wrasse to feed the wealthy few is destroying delicate coral reefs.</font></p>
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;If the Convention is to maintain any credibility, then delegates must vote for the survival of species and not for those who benefit from this multibillion dollar destructive and often illegal trade.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greenpeace is an independent campaigning organisation that uses non-violent, creative confrontation to expose global environmental problems and to force solutions that are essential to a green and peaceful future.</font></p>
