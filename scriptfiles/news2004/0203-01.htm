<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - February 2 - Both Straight and Gay parents are refusing to enroll their children in the Boys Scouts of America. The only youth program in America not run by a religious organization that discriminates against GLBT gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, and atheist youth, as well as girls. Don't allow yourself to be fooled by the misinformation of the BSA. Contrary to what they'll leave you to believe, the BSA is not a religious organization. In its own bylaws it says the BSA is a non-sectarian organization. This means that it is not to be driven by any particular religion, but should embrace the diversity of religious belief. Scout Units are chartered by religious groups, service organizations and schools. About 60% of chartering organizations are religious groups. The Mormons have pressured the BSA to continue with its discrimination by threatening to leave the BSA if it rescinded its policy of discrimination. </FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Roy Williams, Chief Scout Executive, BSA National sent out a recent memo asking scout executives, that they &quot;fix cub scout membership&quot;.

Unless the Boy Scouts of America rescinds it's policy of discrimination against gay and atheist youth and adults it will continue to lose membership and become an exclusive scouting organization for religious fundamentalists. The Boy Scouts of America will continue to become increasingly supported financially by religious fundamentalist groups such as the Mormons. Traditional scouting as it was founded by Lord Baden Powell in 1907 will be destroyed in America. An outdoor program meant to be for all youth will become an exclusive youth program encouraging homophobic bigoted values against those who don't adhere to its particular religious driven ideology.. </FONT></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
