<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - February 6 - &#147;Today, President Bush just announced the establishment of a so-called &#147;independent&#148; White House commission to investigate the Iraq war intelligence failure.  Yet by naming the commission himself and controlling its mandate and timetable, the President ensures that this commission will be anything but independent.  A truly independent commission would be created by Congress, not the White House, and would have the power to decide for itself what to investigate and when to report its findings.&#148;</FONT></p><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;Sadly, the President&#146;s self-appointed commission is nothing more than a White House whitewash, intended to create the impression that the administration is taking the Iraq intelligence issue seriously.  In reality, by launching a probe under his control, President Bush is trying to kick this issue past the November elections.  The American people deserve an honest, timely review&#151;not a whitewash.&#148;</FONT></P><P></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;The White House should never investigate itself&#151;it would be like former President Nixon investigating the Watergate scandal.  And it cannot be expected to deliver results by Election Day, when American voters need this information.&#148; </FONT></P><P></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;Some say we should not politicize this issue by mixing it with the 2004 elections.  But this is inherently a political issue.  America went to war&#151;at a cost of thousands of lives and hundreds of billions of dollars&#151;based on President Bush&#146;s exaggerated case that Iraq was an imminent threat.  He was wrong&#151;there is no debate about that.  The question is, did he know he was wrong? To be a truly informed democracy, America needs the truth before November 2.&#148;</FONT></P><P></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;After all, if I was your stock broker, and I lost your life&#146;s savings on a bad deal, wouldn&#146;t you want to know that before you renewed my contract?&#148;</FONT></P><P></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">20/20 Vision has launched an on-line petition asking Congress to establish a truly independent commission to investigate the Iraq war intelligence failure.
