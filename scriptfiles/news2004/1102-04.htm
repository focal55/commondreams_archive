<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- November 2 -- Four years ago, the presidential election laid bare the shortcomings of our nation's electoral system for all to see. Badly designed ballots, outdated vote-counting technology and confusing registration and voting procedures all combined to produce a contentious election unlike any the United States had seen in more than a century.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today, as we face the potential of record numbers of citizens going to vote, there are signs that things may not have improved, in fact they may be worse. </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">More than 122,000 calls so far to our 1-866-MYVOTE1 voter alert line show that weaknesses remain in our election system. Over the past 10 days, thousands of voters have called to complain about not receiving registration cards and absentee ballots, of being unable to find their polling place, and of worrying that electronic voting machines may not record their vote accurately. Thousands have called in to report long lines, and many others are concerned about intimidation or fear narrow interpretations of elections procedures will cost them the right to vote today.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For centuries, Americans have talked about voting as a right. But we have instead treated voting as a privilege to be extended to some Americans and denied to others. In this closely contested election, where every vote will make a difference and unprecedented numbers of voters are standing in long lines today to vote, some groups in our society are in jeopardy of being denied the right to vote. The calls we have received on our voter alert line make that truth abundantly clear: We have much reforming to do if we are to make voting the right we have long professed it to be.</font></p><p align="CENTER">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
