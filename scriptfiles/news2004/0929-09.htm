<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - September 29 - Moving Ideas, the leading source for progressive public policy on the net, has released an analysis of how elections are being manipulated in America, including through outright intimidation and lies.  &quot;MANIPULATING ELECTIONS: Voter Intimidation and Suppression,&quot; the final installment in a four part series on voter protection this month, includes resource links and ways to get involved.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Jim Crow laws are off the books, but those who wish to diminish the power of certain voting populations have always found ways to manipulate elections,&quot; asserts Moving Ideas Director Melanie Alston-Akers.  &quot;Districts are gerrymandered, precincts vote on unequal voting technologies, dorms are labeled 'temporary' housing, voters are told the wrong election date, elderly voter registration volunteers are intimidated by law enforcement officials, African American felons but not Hispanic felons are purged from the voting lists, and fake law enforcement cars patrol minority precincts.  Sadly, the list goes on.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report, which includes various resources, focuses on 1) background on voter intimidation and manipulation of elections in the U.S., 2) examples from the 2000 election, 3) stories of minority and student voters being misled and intimidated, 4) resource links, 5) online actions, and 6) a list of organizations working on this issue.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">View the entire article at <a href="http://www.movingideas.org/activism/networks/voter_intimidation.html" target="_new">http://www.movingideas.org/activism/networks/voter_intimidation.html</a></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
