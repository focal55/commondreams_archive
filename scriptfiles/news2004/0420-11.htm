<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - April 20 - Statement of Carl Pope, Sierra Club Executive Director, on US Oceans                             Commission Report</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Sierra Club welcomes the report of the US Oceans Commission, the second major report by a distinguished panel in less than a year to draw urgent attention to the growing crisis in the seas around us.  This report confirms that America's oceans are in trouble, and we hope the Bush administration uses the release of this report, two days before Earth Day, to actively engage in healing our marine environment.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Both today's US Commission and last summer's Pew Oceans Commission reports should underpin and inform a healthy debate within Congress, the administration, state and local governments and among the American people themselves, all of whom have an enormous stake in the state of our oceans. The Sierra Club has been deeply involved across America in efforts to preserve our fragile and threatened coral reef systems, to develop sustainable fishing practices and regulations, reduce pollution of coasts and estuaries, and protect threatened populations of marine mammals.  We are optimistic that the Commission emphasized maintaining or recovering our extraordinary marine biodiversity and its insistence that we must move to ecosystem-based management for all our coastal and ocean resources.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Unfortunately the report does not address in depth the potential for balancing any perceived need for additional offshore oil and gas with improvements to fuel efficiency standards for cars and light trucks or the use of renewable sources throughout the transportation sector. We also regret that the report did not explicitly call for a continued moratorium on oil and gas development and exploration in most coastal waters surrounding the United States.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The Bush administration has a historic opportunity to seize upon the recommendations of the Commission and lead America's oceans policy for the 21st century. Unfortunately, many of the administration's previous actions have placed America's coastal waters at risk. The removal of protections for coastal waters in Alaska's Bristol Bay - the first ever such removal by an American President stretching back to President Reagan - sets a dangerous precedent. In addition, the changes to the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) in the Administration's flawed National Energy Policy could greatly undermine many recommendations of the Committee. In fact, the Committee recommends reauthorization of the CZMA with strengthening provisions, not limitations to the act as the Bush administration supports.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;America's oceans harbor a rich variety of wildlife and represent our last wilderness frontier. We can only restore and maintain the health of our oceans if we embrace the stewardship ethic that the US Oceans Commission calls one of its guiding principles in the nearly 500-page report.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">For more information, please visit: <A HREF="http://www.sierraclub.org/marine/" TARGET="_new">http://www.sierraclub.org/marine/</A>.</FONT></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
