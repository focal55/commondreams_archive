<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- November 16 -- The Green Party of the United States has launched its first-ever ad campaign with a full page ad to run in the New York Times on Tuesday, November 16.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Sick of cleaning up after other people's parties?&quot; asks the ad, which depicts the back ends of a donkey and an elephant.  &quot;Join the party that won't make a mess of things.&quot;  The ad encourages citizens to &quot;Register Green.  Vote Green.  Give Green.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;In the wake of the 2004 election, it's clear that America needs a strong independent, noncorporate party more than ever,&quot; said Jody Grage Haug, co-chair of the national party.  &quot;America can do better than widespread election fraud, ballooning deficits, massive job losses, and a disastrous war in Iraq that has made the world less safe.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The full-page New York Times ad, a first for the Green Party, is an unusual choice for the noncorporate Greens. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We're reaching out with this campaign because the American people deserve to know that there are progressive political voices and choices in this country,&quot; said Kara Mullen, national fundraising director for the Green Party.  &quot;The Green Party is rolling up its sleeves in communities across the country to clean up the mess left by Democrats and Republicans.&quot; </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One such action has been undertaken by Green presidential nominee David Cobb, who recently announced his intention to file a formal demand for a recount of presidential ballots cast in Ohio, due to widespread reports of voting irregularites there.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A series of Green election successes in 2004, including Maine Legislator John Eder and San Francisco Board of Supervisors Ross Mirkarimi, show that the Greens are building the party from the grassroots up. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We're growing in number, running better and stronger campaigns, and winning key elections across the U.S.,&quot; said Brent McMillan, the Green Party's national political director. <br> <br>Ms. Mullen said that the national Green Party will continue to place &quot;Morning After&quot; ads in other national publications to promote the party and raise issues that are not adequately covered by the American media.<br> <br>For a list of story ideas about Green Party election successes in 2004, visit &lt;<a href="http://www.gp.org/" target="_new">http://www.gp.org</a>&gt;.</font> </p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
