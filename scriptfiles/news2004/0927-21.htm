<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CHERBOURG, NORMANDY, FRANCE -  September 27 - The Greenpeace ship MV 
Esperanza has arrived at the French port of Cherbourg, where it will 
await the arrival of a weapons-grade plutonium shipment from the United 
States .</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The Esperanza will support the Atlantic Nuclear Free 
Flotilla yachts, which are planning to demonstrate against the deadly 
nuclear shipment.

Expected to soon arrive in Cherbourg, the cargo of 140kg of plutonium 
oxide will then travel 1000km overland to the Cadarache nuclear complex, 
near Aix en Provence. At Cadarache, it will be fabricated into 
experimental plutonium nuclear reactor fuel  before being shipped 
back to the U.S. next year.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The US and France are unnecessarily threatening international security 
and the environment. There is no conceivable justification for this 
transport,&quot; said Shaun Burnie of Greenpeace International in Cherbourg.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Every year in France, more than 10,000 kilograms of plutonium are 
transported from the La Hague reprocessing plant in Normandy to nuclear 
fuel fabrication plants elsewhere in France. In stark contrast to 
stringent security surrounding U.S, plutonium transports, the weekly 
French transports of weapons-usable plutonium are carried out in 
non-armoured vehicles under low-level police protection.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

"The French government now has a real dilemma: if this shipment is 
conducted with US style military security then how will state nuclear 
industry Areva be able to continue justifying the paltry protection for 
the thousands of kilos of plutonium transported around the country each 
year?" said Burnie.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Last week, the international environmental organization Greenpeace 
submitted technical studies to the French and U.S. Administration, 
members of Congress and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in 
Vienna, citing violations in security and safety regulations by the 
French authorities carrying out the transport.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Rather than shipping plutonium around the world, presenting a target for 
terrorists and placing people and the environment en-route at an 
unacceptable risk, Greenpeace believes it should be mixed with highly 
radioactive waste, solidified or vitrified, and
stored. This technically feasible option, opposed by the plutonium 
industry, would be quicker, minimize transports, cost less and be far 
more secure.

A briefing to media on this deadly cargo and the French plutonium 
industry will be held in Paris on Tuesday 28 September.</font></p>
