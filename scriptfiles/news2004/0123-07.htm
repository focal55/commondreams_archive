<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - January 23 - Today Dr. William F. Schulz, executive director of Amnesty International USA, released the following statement regarding the Supreme Court of Illinois' decision to uphold former Gov. George Ryan's decision to commute the sentences of all death row inmates:</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Amnesty International USA applauds today's decision by the Supreme Court of Illinois to uphold former Gov. Ryan's commutation of all death sentences in the state. While the court's decision is significant, it is important not to lose sight of fact that the death penalty system is irrevocably broken. The 13 wrongfully convicted death row inmates in Illinois are only a fraction of the more than 100 individuals, nationally, who have been freed from death row. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Amnesty International USA also supports Gov. Blagojevich's efforts to maintain the state moratorium on executions. But, the legislative package aimed at reducing the likelihood of executing the innocent is an attempt to avoid the inevitable conclusion that the only way to guarantee that no innocent person is executed in Illinois or anywhere else is to abolish the death penalty.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><I>Amnesty International opposes the death penalty in all cases without exception as it is the ultimate denial of human rights, and will continue to demand unconditionally its worldwide abolition.
