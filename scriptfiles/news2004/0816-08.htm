<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - August 16 - The Florida Court of Appeals ruled 2-1 today to uphold a lower court decision striking down the country&#146;s first state-wide voucher program.  The Court affirmed the lower court ruling that the Florida voucher law violated the &#147;no aid&#148; clause of the state constitution providing that public funds cannot be used to aid sectarian institutions.  People For the American Way Foundation, along with the Florida Teaching Profession-NEA, the ACLU, the American Jewish Congress, and other organizations filed suit in state court on behalf of parents and other taxpayers challenging the constitutionality of the voucher program. </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;This is a great victory for the students, parents and taxpayers of Florida,&#148; said Ralph G. Neas, president of People For the American Way Foundation.  &#147;Governor Bush and his cohorts in the state legislature have blindly supported this voucher program even though it has been proven a failure.  Now that two state courts have declared it unconstitutional, the Governor and his allies should turn to the work of ensuring every Florida child a quality public education.&#148;</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The authors of the Florida state constitution were very clear: public funds cannot be given to religious institutions,&#148; said Judith Schaeffer, Deputy Legal Director at People For the American Way Foundation.     &#147;In today&#146;s ruling the court reaffirmed the plain language of this important constitutional provision protecting religious freedom in Florida.&#148; </font></p><p></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
