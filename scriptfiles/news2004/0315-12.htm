The bombings also triggered a national debate on how to prevent terrorism for the long term.&quot;</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">BEAU GROSSCUP, <A HREF="mailto:bgrosscup@csuchico.edu">bgrosscup@csuchico.edu</A></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Grosscup is author of the book The Newest Explosions of Terrorism and professor of international relations at California State University in Chico.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">AMY GOODMAN, [via Denis Moynihan or Jeremy Scahill, <A HREF="mailto:jeremy@democracynow.org">jeremy@democracynow.org</A>], <A HREF="http://www.democracynow.org" TARGET="_new">www.democracynow.org</A></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Host of the radio and TV program &quot;Democracy Now,&quot; Goodman is currently on an airplane with Jean-Bertrand Aristide which is scheduled to land in Jamaica early this afternoon.

She lived most of her life in Israel and is the daughter of a Holocaust survivor. She said today: &quot;Tuesday marks the one-year anniversary of the death of Rachel Corrie, who was a student of mine killed by an Israeli military bulldozer in Rafah, in the Gaza Strip. She was there as an observer with the International Solidarity Movement to prevent Israeli abuses of Palestinians. If the international community had the will to send observers, this would not have been necessary; but the U.S. vetoes such resolutions at the U.N. Security Council just as it facilitates the continuation of the Israeli occupation of Palestinian land, which is in violation of international law. Now Israel is not allowing members of the ISM into the occupied territories, putting Palestinians at even greater risk.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">SEUNG HYE SUH, <A HREF="mailto:ssuh@scrippscol.edu">ssuh@scrippscol.edu</A>, <A HREF="http://www.nodutdol.com" TARGET="_new">http://www.nodutdol.com</A></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Suh is an organizer with the group Nodutdol for Korean Community Development and an assistant professor at Scripps College. She said today: &quot;Conservative lawmakers' move last week to impeach South Korean President Roh Moo-Hyun may backfire against those who led the 'gunless coup.' Koreans took to the streets by tens of thousands. The Korean Bar Association denounced the impeachment, 70 per cent of constitutional law experts don't believe it will pass muster in the Constitutional Court, and 500 civic organizations are protesting. Shoe store owner Paek Eun Jong slammed the hypocrisy of the opposition parties, then immolated himself in an attempt to stop the ouster. Citizens' outrage may sweep conservative lawmakers out of the Assembly in the upcoming elections April 15, reaffirming Koreans' support for Roh's more open stance toward North Korea.&quot;</FONT></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
