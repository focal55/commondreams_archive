<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - April 14 - The Federal Election Commission on April 14 opened two days of hearings on proposed regulations that would drastically restrict the ability of nonprofit organizations to comment on public policy issues, and could silence criticism of public officials&#146; actions by imposing new rules on political speech in the midst of an election year. Advocacy groups spanning the political spectrum will be testifying in opposition to the proposed restrictions.  People For the American Way Foundation Vice President and General Counsel Elliot Mincberg will testify on April 15.</FONT></p><P> </P><P>            <FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;Advocates and activists of all political stripes agree that the proposed rules would be a disaster for free speech and for the nonprofit sector,&#148; said People For the American Way Foundation President and Coalition to Protect Nonprofit Advocacy Co-chair Ralph G. Neas. &#147;Getting such a diverse set of groups to agree on anything, especially during an election year, takes some doing.  That&#146;s how draconian these proposed restrictions are.&#148;</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">According to Mincberg, &#147;The proposed rules go far beyond the authority that Congress has granted the FEC, and they represent a radically unfair attempt to change the rules for political advocacy in the middle of an important election year.&#148; Mincberg called on the FEC to reject the proposed rules outright.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">            Mincberg&#146;s prepared testimony (see attached) notes that more than 670 nonprofit organizations have joined PFAWF in support of comments submitted by the Coalition to Protect Nonprofit Advocacy.  His testimony also rebuts claims by some proponents of new FEC restrictions that the concerns raised by nonprofit organizations would be taken care of if the FEC would restrict the new rules to political advocacy by so-called 527 groups and exempt other nonprofits.  Among the fallacies in that approach, says Mincberg&#146;s testimony, is that allowing the FEC to exceed its authority regarding 527 groups would set a precedent for future restrictions on other nonprofits.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">For more information, see <A HREF="http://www.pfaw.org/" TARGET="_new">http://www.pfaw.org/</A>.  </FONT></P><P ALIGN="CENTER"> </P><P ALIGN="CENTER"> </P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">PREPARED STATEMENT OF ELLIOT M. MINCBERG<BR>VICE PRESIDENT AND GENERAL COUNSEL<BR>PEOPLE FOR THE AMERICAN WAY FOUNDATION</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION<BR>April 15, 2004</FONT></P><P>  </P><P>            On behalf of People For the American Way Foundation, as well as more than 670 nonprofit organizations that have joined in comments submitted by the Coalition to Protect Nonprofit Advocacy to the FEC, I call upon the FEC to withdraw the notice of proposed rulemaking and not adopt the proposed rules on political committee status. An incredibly diverse collection of nonprofit groups have opposed these proposed rules, from the Presbyterian Church to Rock the Vote, from Planned Parenthood to the National Right to Life Committee.  We all agree that the proposed rules would be devastating to freedom of speech and to the nonprofit community and should be rejected.</P><P> </P><P>            As others have already testified, the proposed rules would seriously impede issue advocacy, nonpartisan voter participation activity, and even communication by nonprofit groups with their own members. For example, People For the American Way Foundation, the NAACP, and other civil rights groups would have to stop non-partisan voter registration campaigns on July 5. The NRA could not urge its members to oppose a gun control bill being sponsored by a member of Congress running for re-election. People For the American Way and the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights could not criticize President Bush if he makes another recess appointment of an anti-civil rights judge this summer. These intolerable restrictions on civic participation and public debate - and many more - would result it the proposed rules were adopted.</P><P> </P><P>            Some advocates of new FEC regulations on political advocacy have wrongly suggested that restricting the proposed rules to so-called 527 groups and exempting (for the time being) other nonprofit 501(c) groups would resolve the concerns that so many organizations have raised.  In reality, this approach fails to address many concerns.</P><P>   </P><P>1.         Central to the protections of the First Amendment is freedom of speech concerning public policy issues, a core activity engaged in by many types of nonprofit groups across the ideological spectrum. </P><P> </P><P>For the FEC to restrict freedom of speech for 527s, without specific congressional authorization based on a careful and extensive record, would clearly be improper and would threaten all other nonprofit groups.  The rationale that 527s are allegedly being used to &#147;evade&#148; legal limits placed on political parties by the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act could then be applied to 501(c) groups.  The only restriction on non-party and non-candidate speech in BCRA was the ban on &#147;electioneering communications&#148; in the period shortly before elections. If there is to be consideration of any additional restriction on free speech by nonprofits, it should be by Congress.</P><P> </P><P>2.         527s cannot be completely separated from 501(c) groups. An FEC rule &#147;limited&#148; to 527s would in fact harm many 501(c)(4) groups that have set up &#147;connected&#148; 527 funds . Such 527 funds engage in activities that are perfectly legal for 501(c)(4) groups (e.g. production of some types of voter guides and legislative scorecards and some kinds of voter registration and GOTV work) but are done through 527 funds in order to better comply with the Internal Revenue Code. For example, a 501(c)(4) with substantial investment income would risk charges of tax evasion if it attempted to conduct such activities other than through a 527 fund without paying taxes. But if the proposed rule applied to all 527s, the result would be to prohibit 501(c)(4)s from directly funding such activity through connected 527s, since 501(c)(4) funds would be considered &#147;soft&#148; money. This &#147;Catch-22&#148; would seriously harm many 501(c)(4) groups that have such 527 funds.</P><P> </P><P>3.         As Vice Chair Weintraub has suggested, a rule limiting only 527s could well result in attempts to fund many of the same activities through 501(c)(4) groups. This would not only put pressure on the FEC to improperly regulate and restrict all 501(c)(4)s, but would also produce less disclosure of campaign-related contributions and expenditures than at present, since 527 groups are required by Congress to disclose all their contributions of at least $200 and expenditures of $500 or more, while 501(c)(4)s are not. </P><P> </P><P>In short, the FEC should not rush in the middle of an election year to adopt new rules and should not usurp the proper role of Congress to consider and decide on proposals that so seriously threaten First Amendment rights. The proposed rules should be rejected.   </P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
