<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- December 13 -- AP reported this weekend that &quot;Gary Webb, a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter who wrote a controversial series of stories linking the CIA to crack cocaine trafficking in Los Angeles, has died at age 49...of an apparent suicide.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AP wrote: &quot;Webb's 1996 series in the Mercury News alleged that Nicaraguan drug traffickers had sold tons of crack cocaine in Los Angeles and funneled millions of dollars in profits to the CIA-supported Nicaraguan Contras during the 1980s.&quot; The Mercury News backed away from the series and Webb resigned from the paper. Webb went on to write the book Dark Alliance: The CIA, the Contras, and the Crack Cocaine Explosion which laid out his case in more detail.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"># ROBERT PARRY, <a href="mailto:secrecyprivilege@aol.com" target="_new">secrecyprivilege@aol.com</a>, <a href="http://www.consortiumnews.com/" target="_new">www.consortiumnews.com</a><br>Parry broke many of the Iran-Contra stories in the 1980s for the Associated Press and Newsweek; he and Brian Barger broke the story of contra-cocaine smuggling for AP in December 1985. He is author of the book Lost History: Contras, Cocaine, the Press &amp; &#147;Project Truth.&#148; Today he wrote the article &quot;America's Debt to Journalist Gary Webb.&quot; Parry said: &quot;Webb's editor at the Mercury News sold out the story and demoted Webb, causing him to quit the paper. Even Webb's marriage broke up.... Webb's contra-cocaine series prompted internal investigations by the Central Intelligence Agency and the Justice Department, probes that confirmed that scores of contra units and contra-connected individuals were implicated in the drug trade. The probes also showed that the Reagan-Bush administration frustrated investigations into those crimes for geopolitical reasons.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Parry's latest book is Secrecy &amp; Privilege: Rise of the Bush Dynasty from Watergate to Iraq.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
