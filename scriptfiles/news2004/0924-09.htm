<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - September 24 - A full-page advertisement in USA Today challenges cosmetics companies to come clean about whether they plan to remove toxic chemicals that are banned in the European Union from products sold on American shelves. The advertisement was placed by the Campaign for Safe Cosmetics, a coalition of US health and environmental groups.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This month, a law requiring cosmetics companies to stop using chemicals that are known or highly suspected of causing cancer, impaired fertility or birth defects &#150; such as the phthalates DBP and DEHP used in some fragrance, hair spray and nail polish &#150; entered into force in 25 EU countries. Cosmetics companies must remove the proscribed chemicals from products in Europe by next spring.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Which company do you trust with your daughter?&#148; asks the provocative advertisement, which depicts a young girl applying lipstick. The ad berates industry leaders L&#146;Oreal, Revlon and Unilever for ignoring requests to remove toxic chemicals from US products. </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Today we are releasing correspondence from these companies showing that they have failed to respond in good faith to the legitimate concerns of American consumers,&#148; said Jeanne Rizzo, executive director of the Breast Cancer Fund, a founding member of the coalition.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;People are putting chemicals on and into our bodies every day, though use of shampoo, deodorant, face cream, hairspray and all of the other bottles, jars and cans that fill our bathrooms. Chemicals linked to cancer and birth defects do not belong in these products, period.&#148;</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to the letters released today by the group:</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">L&#146;Oreal failed to respond to letters requesting meetings and information about chemical usage, but the company did find the time to write a letter from their lawyers demanding that the Campaign for Safe Cosmetics stop using the slogan, &#147;Because We&#146;re Worth It!&#148; -- a play on L&#146;Oreal&#146;s &#147;Because I&#146;m Worth It!&#148; tagline. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Revlon sent the Campaign for Safe Cosmetics a form letter from an industry trade association, implying phthalates are &#147;perfectly safe&#148; &#150; a claim refuted by government panels in several countries.   </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Unilever failed to respond to repeated requests for dialogue, even though the company&#146;s Korean subsidiary has already pledged to remove all phthalates from products sold in South Korea. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Product tests show that all three companies make products with phthalates &#150; including Maybelline Express Finish Fast Dry Nail Enamel with DBP, Fire and Ice Cologne Spray with DEHP, and Aqua Net Professional Hair Spray with DBP. The companies also make similar products without phthalates. </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Correspondence with all these companies is posted at <a href="http://www.safecosmetics.org" target="_new">http://www.safecosmetics.org</a> &#150; along with the USA Today ad and a list of 32 companies that have signed a pledge to make safer products available worldwide.</font></p><p></p><p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">###</font></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
