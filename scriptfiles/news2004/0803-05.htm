<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> SACRAMENTO - August 3 - The California Legislature will be considering a record number of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) civil rights bills and resolutions in the next four weeks.  The legislation under consideration ranges in subject from employment protections and insurance equality to hate crimes and same-sex relationships.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We are confident that the entire group of bills will pass and optimistic that the Governor Schwarzenegger will sign all of them,&quot; said Equality California Executive Director Geoffrey Kors.  &quot;Our coalition in support of equality has grown stronger as a result of President Bush's attacks on LGBT families.  LGBT and non-LGBT organizations have joined together in support of a simple principle: equal rights for all Californians.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Equality California currently has five pieces of pro-LGBT legislation near final passage in the state legislature.  All of the legislation has received broad legislative and community support.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The challenge in the next month is to make sure that the Governor knows how much our community and our allies support these bills,&quot; said Steve Hansen, EQCA Legislative Advocate. &quot;We are hopeful that when these bills reach Governor Schwarzenegger that he will sign them, which advances the goal of equality under the law for LGBT Californians and their families.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The five EQCA bills pending are:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1. California Insurance Equality Act (AB 2208 | Kehoe) -- This bill will amend the Insurance and the Health &amp; Safety Codes to prohibit insurance providers from issuing policies or plans that discriminate against domestic partners. It will require all insurance policies and plans that include coverage for spouses -- including health, life, auto, and homeowners insurance, among others -- to include the same coverage for domestic partners. Status: Passed by Assembly 46-31. On State Senate Floor for Early August Vote.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2. Omnibus Labor and Employment Non-Discrimination Act (AB 2900 | Laird) --   This bill amends existing labor and employment non-discrimination provisions in California law to be consistent with the non-discrimination provisions in the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA). Status: Passed Assembly 48-32. Pending in Senate Appropriations Committee with Vote Scheduled on August 4.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3. Omnibus Hate Crimes Act (SB 1234 | Kuehl) -- This bill would standardize Penal Code sections relating to hate crimes. It would also change policies and procedures related to the treatment of victims, plus the training of law enforcement. Status: Passed State Senate 22-10. Pending in Assembly Appropriations Committee for Early August Vote.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">4. Permanent Partners Immigration Act (PPIA) Resolution (AJR 60 | Lieber) -- This resolution encourages the passage of PPIA by the US Congress. Family unification is a basic principle of US immigration law, but same-sex bi-national couples are not covered under federal law. Status: Passed Assembly 42-31. Pending in Senate Judiciary Committee for Early August Vote.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">5. Resolution Opposing A Federal Marriage Discrimination Amendment (AJR 85 | Leno) -- This resolution opposes the proposed federal amendment that would discriminate against gay and lesbian Americans. This resolution denounces attempts to amend the Constitution to prohibit lesbian and gay Americans from ever obtaining marriage equality and equal legal protections for their family relationships.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Status: Passed Assembly 44-28. Pending in Senate Judiciary Committee for Early August Vote.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For more information, please visit <a href="http://www.eqca.org/" target="_new">www.eqca.org</a> </font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
