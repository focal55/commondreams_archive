<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">OAKLAND, CA - May 4 - Representatives Luis Gutierrez (IL-D), Bob Menendez (NJ-D) and Senator Kennedy (MA-D) today introduced the Democrats&#146; immigration reform proposal,  &#147;Safe, Orderly, Legal Visas and Enforcment Act of 2004&#148; or &#147;SOLVE.&#148; Unlike the immigration proposal outlined by President Bush in January, this proposal came in the form of a substantive legislative bill that addresses legalization, family reunification and an immigrant worker program with access to permanent residency.</FONT></p><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The National Network for Immigrant and Refugee Rights (NNIRR) joined other immigrant community, labor and advocacy groups in welcoming this initiative. NNIRR Director Catherine Tactaquin stated, &#147;SOLVE is an important step towards genuine and fair immigration reform. Immigrant communities have been seeking access to permanent residency and more opportunities to unify families because doors have been closing on them for so many years. It&#146;s been almost twenty years since we last saw a legalization program &#150; it&#146;s long overdue.&#148;</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The new bill proposes access to legal status through &#147;earned&#148; legalization for undocumented immigrant workers currently in the U.S. It also specifies immigration law changes to address the backlog of potential immigrants seeking visas and would remove the barriers to visa applications, such as the &#147;3 and 10 year re-entry bars&#148; that have been added during the last decade. </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In a step to address the problems of worker abuse and exploitation that have characterized &#147;temporary worker&#148; programs, proponents of SOLVE are including labor protections, job portability and access to permanent residency in a new &#147;future worker&#148; provision of the legislation that would expand temporary worker options for low-skilled workers.  In recent years, many immigrant workers and their families, desperate for work and economic security, have crossed the U.S.-Mexico border under conditions made even more dangerous by increased border security. The death of many migrants and their abuse at the hands of &#147;smugglers&#148; has emerged as a serious human rights crisis in the border region. </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Tactaquin added, &#147;Although the legislation is unlikely to pass in this congressional session, we hope that after the this election-year proposal will come around for action and improvement in the next session. Many immigrant workers and their families, now and in the future, could benefit from new legislation that boldly addresses their needs as human beings and as members of our communities in this country.&#148;</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;While we are very cautious about temporary worker programs, this future worker proposal promises remedies to the problems of abuse and exploitation that have historically plagued temporary worker programs. However, it is not a substitute for much-needed reform and expansion of our current legal immigration program.&#148; Tactaquin noted that many migrant-receiving countries have been resisting programs that provide opportunities for legal permanent residency for migrants, despite the growing trends in international migration that include workers and their families.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In the meantime, according to Tactaquin, &#147;The Democrats need to work with their Republican colleagues to take immediate action on bipartisan proposals, such as the DREAM Act, which is still pending in Congress.&#148; Undocumented immigrant students, many of whom have lived in the U.S. most of their lives, have been urging Republican leaders in Congress and President Bush to support DREAM, which would provide them with access to permanent residency and a future free from fear of deportation.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The National Network for Immigrant and Refugee Rights was founded in 1986 among diverse immigrant community, faith, labor and othe rights advocate groups. It provides information and analysis, educational resources, community organizing and advocacy initiatives.</FONT></P><P ALIGN="CENTER"> </P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">4/29/04</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Democratic Comprehensive Immigration Reform</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">OVERVIEW OF LEGISLATION</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">EARNED ADJUSTMENT</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#149; Immigrants who have been here for five (5) or more years on date of introduction and can demonstrate 24 months in aggregate of employment (including self-employment) in the U.S. and payment of taxes would be eligible for legalization.
