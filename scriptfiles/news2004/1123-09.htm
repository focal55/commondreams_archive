<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SAUSALITO, CA -- November 23 -- In response to the recent release of the European Social Investment Forum's official SRI Transparency Guidelines (<a href="http://www.eurosif.org/transparency-guidelines-retail" target="_new">www.eurosif.org/transparency-guidelines-retail</a>), Natural Capital Institute&#146;s Director, Paul Hawken, spoke strongly in support of the organization&#146;s initiative, calling it &#147;an important and timely move.&#148;  </font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a letter to Tim Smith, President of the U.S.-based Social Investment Forum, Hawken noted that Eurosif deserves congratulations for its initiative as being a step in the right direction for socially responsible investment.  He also cautioned, &#147;It doesn't seem appropriate for the North American industry to say we don't need such guidelines when clearly the industry has none.&#148;  Hawken was referring to Smith&#146;s comments in an article last week at SocialFunds.com (<a href="http://www.socialfunds.com/news/article.cgi/article1572.html" target="_new">www.socialfunds.com/news/article.cgi/article1572.html</a>), in which the SIF President said, &quot;I don't believe there's a huge vacuum on this side of the ocean just because such standards don't exist here&#133;&#148;.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Natural Capital Institute&#146;s October 2004 report, &#147;Socially Responsible Investing: How the SRI Industry Has Failed to Respond to People Who Want to Invest With Conscience and What Can Be Done to Change It,&#148; provides recommendations to help the SRI industry improve its transparency and social responsibility.  The report presses for more complete transparency than presented in Eurosif&#146;s guidelines, encouraging mutual funds to fully share with investors the findings of their social and environmental research on individual companies.  The full report can be downloaded at www.responsibleinvesting.org.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>About Paul Hawken <br>Paul Hawken is an environmentalist, entrepreneur, journalist, and best-selling author of The Ecology of Commerce: A Declaration of Sustainability and co-author of Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution.
