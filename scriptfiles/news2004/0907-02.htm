<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - September 7 - The House of Representatives today passed HR 4654 by a unanimous vote, reauthorizing the Tropical Forest Conservation Act (TFCA) of 1998 for another three years. Over that period the bill authorizes appropriations of $75 million. Since 1998 TFCA has funded conservation activities on more than 8,000 square miles of forest in developing countries, an area larger than New Jersey, and wiped out millions of dollars in debt.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Conservation International, The Nature Conservancy, World Wildlife Fund and the Wildlife Conservation Society praise the House of Representatives for reauthorizing the bill and U.S. Congressmen Rob Portman (R-Ohio) and Tom Lantos (D- Calif.) for their efforts to ensure that the legislation continues to be a cost-effective way to protect the world's tropical forests. These groups are proud to have participated in the protection of millions of acres of environmentally significant tropical forests and watersheds that this act has enabled and are enthusiastic about what can be accomplished in the future. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since its enactment, the TFCA has been a valuable tool for achieving important conservation outcomes in some of the world's most biodiverse regions while simultaneously easing the foreign debt burden of developing nations. The tens of millions of dollars -- including more than $5 million from private donors -- that have been channeled into conservation as a result of the act have served to better protect millions of acres of tropical forests, from the Philippines to Peru.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The funds generated by the act are used for a variety of conservation activities including: </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- the establishment, restoration, protection and maintenance of parks, protected areas and reserves, </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- the development and implementation of scientifically sound systems of natural resource management, including land and ecosystem management practices, </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- training programs to increase the scientific, technical and managerial capacities of individuals and organizations involved in conservation efforts; </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- restoration, protection, or sustainable use of diverse animal and plant species; </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- research and identification of medicinal uses of tropical forest plant life to treat human diseases, illnesses, and health- related concerns; or </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- the development and support of the livelihoods of individuals living in or near a tropical forest in a manner consistent with protecting such tropical forest. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Earlier this year a debt-for-nature swap using TFCA funds was signed with Colombia, which has pledged to invest at least $10 million over the next 12 years to protect nearly 11 million acres of its tropical forests. Among the areas that will benefit is Tuparro National Park, a UNESCO Natural Biosphere Reserve in the Orinoco River basin. The park is home to dozens of unique species including jaguars, river dolphins, the endangered giant armadillo and the critically endangered Orinoco crocodile, which is found only in this part of South America. The area is also a major nesting ground for migrating bird species from North America.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Reauthorization of the TFCA ensures conservation of threatened tropical forests in many more countries around the world. </font></p><p></p><p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">###</font></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
