<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - September 10 - On Monday, the federal ban on the sale of certain types of military-style firearms, otherwise known as assault weapons, will expire. The debate over whether Congress ought to renew the assault weapons ban or let it lapse has sparked a furious lobbying campaign by gun rights and gun control groups, which have battled each other for years on gun ownership issues.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In advance of Monday's deadline, the non-partisan Center for Responsive Politics has updated its Web-based profile of the money behind the debate over gun control: <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/news/guns/index.htm" target="_new">http://www.opensecrets.org/news/guns/index.htm</a></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The profile includes an analysis of:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*Campaign contributions -- Gun rights groups, led by the National Rifle Association, have given more than $17 million in individual, PAC and soft money contributions to federal candidates and party committees since 1989, far more than the nearly $1.7 million contributed by gun control groups. Gun rights groups have sent 85 percent of their contributions to Republicans during that time, while gun control groups have supported Democrats with 94 percent of their contributions.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*Lobbying -- Gun rights groups are even more dominant in lobbying expenditures than they are in campaign contributions. The NRA alone spent nearly $11 million on lobbying from 1997 to 2003. But it wasn't the gun rights lobby's biggest spender. That was Gun Owners of America, which spent more than $18 million on lobbing over the same period. By contrast, the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence spent under $2 million on lobbying from 1997 to 2003, and the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence spent $580,000.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*Independent expenditures and communications costs -- Gun rights groups have spent far more than gun control advocates on independent expenditures, which are aimed at the general public and expressly advocate the election or defeat of a candidate, and communications costs to their members about candidates. (Independent expenditures must be paid for with limited &quot;hard&quot; money contributions, while groups can spend unlimited funds on internal communications costs.)</font></p><p></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
