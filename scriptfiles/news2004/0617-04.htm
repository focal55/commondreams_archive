<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - June 17 - With gas prices still hovering near record highs, drivers paying closer attention to their mileage are discovering that their vehicles' fuel economy is a lot worse than advertised. That's because the Environmental Protection Agency's 30-year-old testing system overestimates fuel economy, leading American consumers to spend about $20 billion more on gasoline each year than they would assume from their window stickers.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">To provide consumers and lawmakers with more accurate information, the Union of Concerned Scientists has launched a &quot;citizen survey&quot; to discern the true gap between the fuel economy stickers consumers see in dealer showrooms and the real fuel economy autos get on the road. UCS is asking drivers around the country to monitor their own gas mileage and driving habits, then send that information to UCS and the EPA.  </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The EPA's fuel economy tests are as old as a '70s Pinto,&quot; said David Friedman, Research Director of UCS's Clean Vehicles Program. &quot;The numerical adjustments the agency makes are a band-aid on tests that no longer have any bearing on current driving habits, conditions, and technologies.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The agency is in the midst of a public comment period on their testing procedures. The survey will be conducted through July 19th in order to allow UCS analysts time to process the data before the EPA's comment period ends on July 27.  Drivers can participate in the survey online at <A HREF="http://www.suvsolutions.org" TARGET="_new">www.suvsolutions.org</A>.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Keeping track of your gas mileage is as easy as filling up your tank and monitoring your odometer,&quot; Friedman said.  &quot;Americans participating in the survey will help reform a federal testing system that impacts our pocketbooks, the environment, and our security.&quot;</FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
