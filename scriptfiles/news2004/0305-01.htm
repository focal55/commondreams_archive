<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - March 5 - Twice in the days before right wing activist Kay Daly published stolen Democratic documents on her web site, Senator Orrin Hatch appeared on fringe internet radio shows with her.  On October 29, 2003, he appeared on her Free Republic radio &#147;Daly Show&#148; and on November 11, 2003, he appeared on another Free Republic radio show with her.  Manuel Miranda appeared on Ms. Daly&#146;s radio show just two weeks earlier.  </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Kay Daly was the first person to publish complete versions of the stolen documents.  Miranda still denies leaking the stolen documents.  Orrin Hatch denies having any knowledge of the stolen documents.
