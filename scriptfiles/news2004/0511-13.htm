<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">SAN FRANCISCO - May 11- Many U.S. residents carry toxic pesticides in their bodies above government assessed &quot;acceptable&quot; levels, according to a report released today by Pesticide Action Network North America (PAN). <A HREF="http://www.panna.org/campaigns/docsTrespass/chemicalTrespass2004.dv.html" TARGET="_NEW">'Chemical Trespass: Pesticides in Our Bodies and Corporate Accountability'</A>, makes public for the first time an analysis of pesticide-related data collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in a study of levels of chemicals in 9,282 people nationwide. </FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;None of us choose to have hazardous pesticides in our bodies,&quot; said Kristin Schafer, PAN Program Coordinator and lead author of the report. &quot;Yet CDC found pesticides in 100 percent of the people who had both blood and urine tested. The average person in this group carried a toxic cocktail of 13 of the 23 pesticides we analyzed.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Many of the pesticides found in the test subjects have been linked to serious health effects including infertility, birth defects and childhood and adult cancers. &quot;While the government develops safety levels for each chemical separately, this study shows that in the real world we are exposed to multiple chemicals simultaneously,&quot; explained Margaret Reeves, Ph.D., Senior Scientist at PAN. &quot;The synergistic effects of multiple exposures are unknown, but a growing body of research suggests that even at very low levels, the combination of these chemicals can be harmful to our health.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Chemical Trespass found that children, women and Mexican Americans shoulder the heaviest &quot;pesticide body burden.&quot; For example, children are exposed to the highest levels of nerve- damaging organophosphorous (OP) pesticides. The CDC data show that the average 6 to11 year-old sampled is exposed to the OP pesticide chlorpyrifos at four times the level U.S. EPA considers &quot;acceptable&quot; for long-term exposure. Chemical Trespass argues that pesticide manufacturers are primarily responsible for the problem of pesticide body burden. &quot;The pesticides we carry in our bodies are made and aggressively promoted by agrochemical companies,&quot; stated Skip Spitzer, Corporate Accountability Program Coordinator at PAN. &quot;These companies also spend millions on political influence to block or undermine regulatory measures designed to protect public health and the environment.&quot; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The fact that our children carry dangerous pesticides in their bodies represents a dramatic failure in the way our government protects us from toxic pesticides,&quot; said Monica Moore, PAN Program Director. &quot;We must stop this toxic trespass by shifting the burden from our bodies back to the corporate boardroom where it belongs.&quot; </FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
