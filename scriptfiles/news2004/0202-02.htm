<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - February 2 - While promoting his new book The Ten Offenses: Reclaim the Blessings of God's Eternal Truths, Pat Robertson has asserted that People For the American Way Foundation, and other organizations working to defend the separation of church and state, are &quot;attempting to take away the religious freedom of Christians.&quot;  Robertson's definition of &quot;religious freedom&quot; is allowing government officials to use the power of their office and taxpayer dollars to promote their own brand of religion. These comments are an abomination and a clear reflection of continuing attempts by right-wing politicians, televangelists, and activists to use government to promote and endorse religion, and to cast aside real religious freedoms outlined in the Constitution.  </FONT></p><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">PFAWF is a strong defender of the fundamental right to worship as one chooses, and strives to maintain a powerful national voice on church-state issues.
