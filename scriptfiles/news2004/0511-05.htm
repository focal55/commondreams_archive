<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">MIDLAND, MI - May 11 &#150; As Dow Chemical prepares to hold its annual general meeting here on May 13th, survivors of the 1984 Bhopal gas leak prepare to protest the chemical giant&#146;s ongoing refusal to address its pending liabilities in Bhopal. 2004 Goldman Environmental Prize Rashida Bee and Champa Devi Shukla, two women survivors who are key organizers in the International Campaign for Justice in Bhopal (ICJB), will lead protests outside the shareholders meeting.  Meanwhile inside the meeting shareholders, led by Boston Common Asset Management, will present a resolution calling on Dow to prepare a report describing the initiatives it has instituted to address the specific health, environmental and social concerns of the Bhopal survivors. Influential investors including CALPERS have indicated their intention to vote for the Bhopal resolution.</FONT></p><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The 1984 Union Carbide gas disaster in Bhopal &#150; known as the Hiroshima of the Chemical Industry &#150; has claimed more than 20,000 lives to date and left an estimated 150,000 people chronically ill, 50,000 of whom are too sick to earn a living. &#147;In acquiring Union Carbide, Dow Chemical has inherited a fugitive from justice, a company wanted for manslaughter in India,&#148; said Satinath Sarangi, a spokesperson for the ICJB. &#147;Dow&#146;s refusal to hand over Union Carbide to face trial in India exposes the company&#146;s blatant disregard for law,&#148; he added. &#147;</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Members of the Bhopal Campaign warn that Dow&#146;s refusal to honor Indian Courts and address pending liabilities in Bhopal will affect the company&#146;s business prospects in India and Asia.  Commenting on Dow Chemical&#146;s plans to slash 3000 jobs in the US, and transfer production to Asia and the Middle East, Rashida Bee stated:  &#147;Dow&#146;s commitment to its workers and its community in the United States appears to be secondary to its profits.  We want Dow to clean up its act and take care of its workers here rather than shift its toxic production to poor nations where they can exploit cheap labor and lax environmental standards.&#148;  Bee added that the ICJB will oppose Dow Chemical&#146;s transfer of toxics-producing technology to Asia.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Union Carbide&#146;s $470 million compensation package covered only civil awards for the half million people exposed, leaving unresolved the potential damages for criminal charges and for punitive damages and environmental contamination unrelated to the disaster.  </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The protest and shareholders resolution are part of a multi-faceted campaign aimed at increasing pressure on Dow to meet the demands of the survivors.  Those demands include that Dow face trial on criminal charges, provide long term medical care for survivors and their children, support economic and social rehabilitation, and clean up the chemical contamination in and around the abandoned Union Carbide factory site. </FONT> </P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
