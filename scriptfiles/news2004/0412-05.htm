<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - April 12 - Groups and states raised alarms today over a report made public to the National Advisory Council on Environmental Policy and Technology (NACEPT) about the future of America's Superfund toxic waste cleanup program. The report from the subcommittee on Superfund of the NACEPT omits vitally needed community health and safety protections fitting a common Bush administration pattern of industry weighted decision-making. The final report also fails to call for restoring the &quot;polluter pays&quot; fees which would ensure that polluters, not taxpayers pay for the cleanup of abandoned toxic waste sites.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Five members on the Subcommittee, including the representatives from the Sierra Club, the Mineral Policy Center, and Center for Public Environmental Oversight, an environmental attorney, and a representative from the New Jersey Department of Environmental Quality dissented from the final report. A coalition of Community, tribal and environmental justice representatives signed on amid reservations and strong protests.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">EPA created this federal advisory committee to guide the future of the Superfund program. However, after 22 months of deliberation, industry representatives blocked a critical recommendation for increased funding. The subcommittee, which reportedly cost taxpayers more than $1 million, was heavily weighted with industry representation. Approximately two-thirds of committee members represented the interests of corporations responsible for toxic waste sites listed on the National Priorities List, including corporate officers, contractors, lobbyists, insurers, legal representatives, developers and business associations.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Near the end of the subcommittee deliberations, when it became apparent that members were struggling to reach consensus on major issues within the time remaining, EPA encouraged the subcommittee to submit a range of views. In the final months, approximately one third of the proposed consensus recommendations were replaced with &quot;ranges of views.&quot;  The final report required no attribution to individuals or interests for these views.  The general public, Congress, EPA, and even other subcommittee members themselves will not know which or how many members held the views discussed in the report.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The report is flawed in several ways:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">*    Fails to recommend an increase in appropriations for cleanup at National Priority sites that are backlogged due to insufficient funding, such as New Bedford Harbor.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">*    Fails to acknowledge the need for a significant, stable funding sourcenow and into the future. Environmentalists, community, environmental justice and state representatives called for the reinstatement of the &quot;polluter pays&quot; fees, which expired in 1995 and, as a result, the program ran out of polluter-contributed money last fall.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">*    Lacks accountability for its &quot;ranges of views&quot; and appears to put them on equal ground with consensus recommendations.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">*    Fails to recommend measures to prevent the creation of new Superfund Sites.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">*    Considers listing only small portions of larger sites on the Superfund National Priority List, which would likely delay cleanup of the more difficult problems and could prevent meaningful community participation. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">*    Abandons principle of listing sites on the National Priority List (NPL) based on threats, not cleanup costs or budget constraints.  Fails to disavow EPA's new policy of using cleanup costs or budget constraints to defer listing sites on the National Priorities List (NPL) as the first step towards protecting public health or environmental quality.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">*    Considers limiting the listing of new sites to those that pose a &quot;current risk.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">*    Ignores the impact that ongoing pollution at facilities around the country could have on the Superfund program in the future.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In contrast, a coalition of NACEPT members worked together to craft a set of  10 proactive recommendations designed to strengthen the Superfund program.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">               Statements from NACEPT subcommittee members:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Doris Cellarius, Sierra Club toxics activist: &quot;The protests to this report should serve as a wake-up call to the Bush administration.  Without adequate funding, we will continue to delay Superfund site listings, and slow down the pace of cleanups, jeopardizing American's health and safety. We must restore the &quot;polluter pays&quot; fees in order to restore the Superfund, get these sites on the National Priority List, and get cleanups moving again.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Lexi Shultz, Mineral Policy Center: &quot;The failure to provide increased funding to perform cleanups is particularly troubling given the additional failure to adopt measures that would prevent the creation of new sites. Pollution prevention should be the gold standard to which all federal environmental agencies and private companies are held. This report falls far short of that goal.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Aimee Houghton, Center for Public Environmental Oversight: &quot;In my experience, bad process leads to bad outcomes. EPA does not need to know how polarized people's views are.  They need to know how they might bring those different views together to craft solutions that will strengthen the Superfund program to protect human health and the environment today and into the future.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Grant Cope, environmental attorney: &quot;I could not endorse a report that included unattributed views that could weaken Superfund.  I served on this Subcommittee to make Superfund stronger, not to give EPA political cover to weaken protections.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Dolores Herrera, community activist: &quot;The impressive alliance of representatives from community groups, Native American tribes, environmental organizations, states, and the environmental justice fully endorsed  the 'Top 10 Issues to Protect Public Health &amp; the Environment at Superfund Sites' to show where we stood on cleaning up communities.  These are the kind solutions that will give communities hope where now there is frustration and despair.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">For More Information, Contact: Doris Cellarius, Sierra Club toxics activist (928) 778-6724 Grant Cope, Environmental Attorney (206) 427-3886 Lexi Shultz, Mineral Policy Center (202) 249-2516 Aimee Houghton, Center for Environmental Public Oversight (202) 297-8226 Dolores Herrera, Environmental Justice, Charter Member NEJAC (505) 246-0201</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">For more information on the Superfund program, please visit <A HREF="http://www.sierraclub.org/superfund" TARGET="_new">www.sierraclub.org/superfund</A> or <A HREF="http://www.makepolluterspay.org" TARGET="_new">www.makepolluterspay.org</A>.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">2.  TOP 10 ISSUES TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH &amp; THE ENVIRONMENT AT SUPERFUND SITES</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">This document represents a consensus of the representatives listed below on key issues on which the report by EPA's National Advisory Committee on Environmental Policy and Technology's Superfund Subcommittee report contains a &quot;range of views.&quot;  These members agreed upon the following pro-active positions that maintain or increase Superfund's ability to protect public health and environmental quality.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">I.   A Weakened Superfund Cleanup Program</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In recent years, the Superfund program has suffered severe funding shortfalls, dramatic declines in the pace of cleanups, and an inability to conduct cleanups at some of the nation's most contaminated toxic waste sites.  Program funding has declined from $1.7 to $1.3 billion-over 30% using inflation adjusted dollars-between 1993 and 2003.  Since 1995, with the expiration of Superfund's dedicated funding mechanism, taxpayers have increasingly paid for the cleanup of abandoned Superfund sites and the running of the Superfund program.  Now, in 2004, taxpayers, rather than industries, will pay 100% of such costs.  The number of annual cleanup completions has fallen over 50% since the last half the 1990s.  The following list built upon consensus contains ten concrete steps to address these problems.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">II.  Pro-active Initiatives to Protect Public Health and Environmental Quality</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">1)   Increase Funding and Reauthorize Superfund's Fees: The Administration and Congress should agree to increase funding for the Superfund program by $300-$800 million annually , and should support and sign into law a reauthorization of Superfund's polluter pays fees;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">2)   List Sites for Clean Up: EPA headquarters should not consider the potential costs of a cleanup or budgetary shortfalls in making listing decisions.  However, EPA headquarters should generally defer to regional proposals to list toxic waste sites on Superfund's national priorities list;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">3)   Better Integrate Stakeholders:  EPA should increase its outreach to affected and impacted communities, tribes, states, and EJ groups during the listing process, including providing funds for Technical Assistance Grants (TAGs) at non-NPL (National Priority List) sites where such funds do not reduce the availability of funding at NPL sites;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">4)   Promote Protective Listing Decisions:  The HRS and listing process should capture the core value of tribal concerns and environmental justice principles, such as ecosystem protections and consideration of cumulative impacts, as well as nontraditional threats such as vapor intrusion and explosives;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">5)   Strengthen Long-Term Protections:  EPA should bolster the long-term management of toxic waste sites by reducing the reliance on Institutional Controls (ICs), including land use controls, wherever possible.  At the same time, EPA should also strengthen the enforceability and tracking mechanisms for institutional controls and expand resources for long-term stewardship;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">6)   Improve Institutional Coordination on behalf of Public Health:  To address the concerns of impacted communities and states by increasing responsiveness, accountability, and funding for the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS).  As part of this effort, the agencies should also create guidance on declaring a &quot;public health emergency&quot; that details when citizens can obtain health services and craft community report cards;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">7)   Prevent Future Sites:  To stem the continued creation of Superfund sites, EPA should strengthen pollution prevention efforts by creating financial assurance regulations and expanding prevention activities at facilities at risk of creating NPL sites;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">8)   Increase Funding To Other Programs:  The federal government should increase funding to state and tribal programs to help them maintain and increase their capacity to clean up toxic waste sites;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">9)   Use Effective Measures of Success:  EPA should use clear, verifiable,performance measures that are based on readily available data and that reflect progress in the actual cleanup of sites not elaborate calculations of exposure control or risk reduction; and</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">10)  Quickly Address Threats:  EPA should use Superfund's existing legal authorities to prevent and clean up contamination threatening public health and the environment, including at Federal facilities.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Signed,</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Aimee Houghton<br>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">State of Colorado</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">  Three reports provide the factual foundation for this range.  First, Resources For The Future reported that the Superfund Program would likely need level or increased funding throughout this decade to adequately fund cleanups.  Katherine Probst, et al., Superfund's Future; What Will It Cost? (1999).  However, actual appropriation have been $300 to $800 million below RFF's inflation adjusted base and high estimates.  Second, EPA's 2004 Inspector General report released agency documents demonstrating that the resource needs for activities included in the FY 2002 Remedial Action Advise of Allowance (i.e. remedial actions; long-term response actions; five-year reviews; enforcement fairness projects; above-the-base removal actions; and redevelopment/reuse projects) is nearly three times the budgeted amount of $224 million.  (EPA Inspector General, Congressional Request on Funding Needs for Non-Federal Superfund Sites, Rpt. 2004-P-00001 (Jan. 7, 2004); EPA, Memorandum from Elaine F. Davies to Superfund National P rogram Managers, OSWER 9275.1-04 (Jan. 3, 2002).  Third, the General Accounting Office also recently reported that over the last ten years the Superfund Program has suffered a decline in funding of $672 million adjusted for inflation.</FONT></P><P></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">3. Fact Sheet on Superfund Funding</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Increased Funding is Needed to Protect Communities from Toxic Waste Sites,            but Industry Demands Derail Funding Recommendation</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Toxic waste sites threaten public health and environmental quality. Congress created the Superfund program, financed by polluter pays fees, to clean up the nation's worst toxic waste sites.  Superfund's polluter pays fees expired in 1995, and the program has suffered reductions in funding through cuts in appropriations and declines in inflation-adjusted dollars. The result, EPA must now forgo or slowdown the listing and cleaning up of Superfund sites in communities across the country.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The NACEPT Superfund Subcommittee was close to agreeing to a consensus recommendation on a modest, time-limited increase in funding at listed sites where federal work is currently slowed down or stopped due to under-funding.  However, representatives from industry demanded that any increased funds only be used at sites where EPA declared a need for &quot;orphan share&quot; funding.  This restriction ignored the need to protect communities near other sites; prioritized funding based on EPA's designation of a PRP's financial status, not protections for public health and the environment; and weakened liability standard.  Industry's demand effectively killed the recommendation.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Please see the following websites for the types of Superfund sites that need funding;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">-  Sierra Club Website: <A HREF="http://www.sierraclub.org/superfund" TARGET="_new">www.sierraclub.org/superfund</A></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">-  U.S. PIRG Website:  <A HREF="http://www.makepolluterspay.org" TARGET="_new">www.makepolluterspay.org</A></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Toxic Waste Site Threaten Public Health and The Environment</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">There are more than 1,300 Superfund sites in the nation.  One in four Americans lives within four miles of a Superfund site. Eight-five percent of all Superfund sites have contaminated groundwater.  Fifty percent of the nation, and 100% in many rural areas, rely on groundwater for drinking water.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Superfund Program Is Under-Funded</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In the years following expiration of Superfund's polluter pays fees, EPA relied on fairly stable funds from the surplus of money that built up when the government was collecting revenue from the fees.  However, program funding failed to keep pace with need as the surplus diminished.  The program needs increased annual appropriations of between $300 to $800 million dollars.  Three reports demonstrate the need for increased funding:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">   The General Accounting Office concluded that levels of appropriations for Superfund between 1993 and 2004 diminished from $1.9 B in FY 1993 to 1.3 B in 2004, or $672 million or 30% of its budget, adjusted for inflation.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">   In a Congressionally requested report, Resources For The Future concluded that Superfund needed level or increased funding during this decade to meet cleanup needs.   Comparing the report's base and high estimates to appropriations shows that Superfund has been under-funded by $300 to $800 million per year; equally a $2-3 billion deficit from 2001 to 2005.  </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Chart 1.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">   The Inspector General of the EPA released agency documents demonstrating a $600 million dollar shortfall in resource needs for activities included in the FY 2002 Remedial Action Advise of Allowance (i.e. remedial actions; long-term response actions; five-year reviews; enforcement fairness projects; and other actions).  Resource needs were nearly three times the budgeted amount of $224 million. Subcommittee Almost Reached Consensus on a Modest, Time-Limited Funding Increase</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Environmental justice and community groups, state and tribal representatives, and environmental groups recognized the needs for significant increases in funding.  However, these organizations were willing to accept a modest, time-limited funding increase (i.e. at least $175 million) directed at sites where clean up actions are stalled or stopped due to under-funding.  Industry demanded that any increased funds only be used at sites where EPA declared a need for &quot;orphan share&quot; funding. Industry's unwavering demand for this restriction killed the funding recommendations.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Problems with Orphan-Share Restrictions on Funding</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">EPA uses &quot;orphan shares&quot; to describe the amount of money that the agency will credit (i.e. not seek to recover) to PRPs at a site based on EPA's assessment that certain non-viable PRPs are or may be responsible for a set amount of a site's contamination. Industry representatives wanted EPA to initiate a new process of formally designating certain sites or parts of sites as &quot;orphan shares.&quot;  This restriction could force EPA to forgo recovering costs against PRPs or their insurance companies, in order to use the money to clean up contamination, likely benefiting PRPs that EPA has not yet found or intransigent parties who argue that a cleanup is too expensive.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">This list describes a few problems with an orphan share funding restriction:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">   Excludes Communities From Getting Much-Needed Clean Up Funds:  This restriction would exclude funding for cleanups needed in communities near other Superfund sites, and prioritize use of these funds based on the potential financial status of PRPs, not the threats posed by a site.  Thus, it ignores communities who need clean up activities.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">   Contravenes Superfund:  Superfund does not limit EPA's use of funding to pay for cleanups at only orphan-share fund-lead sites. Industry's proposal violates Superfund by precluding EPA's ability to seek recovery after paying out taxpayer funds.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">   Weakens Enforcement:  This restriction eliminates EPA's ability use the money in enforcement actions.  This dramatically weakens EPA's ability to get sites cleaned up, since EPA gets $7 of clean up for every $1 spent on enforcement actions;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">   Establishes a Dangerous Precedent:  Congress could apply this restriction in the future. This year, industry got members of the Senate put a restriction into an appropriation bill that mandated a percentage of funds only be used for specific activities, which could have weakened EPA's ability to investigate sites, maintain the protectiveness of cleanups, and address other threats.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">1   Slows Down The Pace of Cleanups:  Superfund gives EPA the authority to issue a clean up order, clean up a site if a PRP refuses to obey such an order, and then pursue cost recovery against the intransigent the PRP. However, this threat only works if PRPs believe that EPA has the money to clean up a site and then undertake cost recovery.  By stopping EPA's use of funds to clean up such a site, the restriction eliminates EPA's most effective tool for increasing cleanups.</FONT></P><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
