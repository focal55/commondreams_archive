<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - August 12 - Twelve years ago, George W. Bush was one of the first to speak out against Republican smear tactics against then candidate Bill Clinton, who was challenging Bush&#146;s father in the presidential campaign.  Fast forward to 2004, and Bush appears to have changed his tune, refusing to denounce an unfair attack ad made by one of his top donors criticizing Sen. John Kerry&#146;s military record.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite ongoing rhetoric about restoring &#147;civility&#148; to the election process, Bush has refused to censure his top Texas Fundraiser Robert Perry who bankrolled the ad. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many top Republicans, including Sen. John McCain have called on Bush to denounce the ad and the dishonest attack against Kerry which independent academic institutions have discredited. Yet during this close and critical election, Bush remains mute. </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the past, according to the July 14, 1992 Washington Post, George W. Bush authored a letter to more than 85,000 Republican donors on behalf of his father&#146;s presidential campaign urging them to stop funding sleazy and dishonest attacks on Bill Clinton.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now that his own job is on the line it appears that George Bush has changed his mind about the appropriateness of attack ads and &#147;smear tactics&#148;.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For full citations and referenced material, visit <a href="http://www.Misleader.org" target="_new">www.Misleader.org</a>.</font></p><p></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
