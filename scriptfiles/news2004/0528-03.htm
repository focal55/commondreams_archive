<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - May 28 - Greens from throughout the United States announced today they will seek the endorsement of Ralph Nader for President at the upcoming Green Party national convention June 24-27 in Milwaukee.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The group, Greens for Nader, also hopes that Nader will select a prominent Green member as his vice-presidential running mate in light of Nader's historical ties to the Greens and the Greens' status as the third largest party in the country.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Nader is by far the strongest peace candidate that the Greens can support in the upcoming election. Nader has done a tremendous job over the last eight years in helping to build the Green Party. While we would prefer that Nader would accept an outright nomination, supporting Ralph in the 2004 Presidential election is the best way to ensure that the issues we are concerned about are part of the Presidential debate,&quot; stated Peter Camejo, a spokesperson for Greens for Nader who was the Green candidate for California governor in 2003 election and the 2004 recall election.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Camejo has a large bloc of favorite son delegates from California pledged to him going to the Green Party's June 24-27 convention in Milwaukee.   All the announced Green candidates for President in the Green Party are leaning towards a Nader endorsement except David Cobb..</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Hundreds of Green candidates will be running for local, state and federal office this fall throughout the country. The group said it will be mutually beneficial for these candidates to work cooperatively with the Nader candidacy.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Throughout the Bush administration, we have seen the Democrats join the Republicans in launching wars, cutting taxes for the rich, and curtailing civil liberties. We need to defeat not only Bush, but the Bush policies the Democrats have also embraced. For example, Nader is the only high-profile candidate with a real jobs program. Bush wants to cut personal income taxes and Kerry wants to cut corporate income taxes, both of them hoping for an indirect trickle-down economic stimulation to create jobs. Nader calls for repealing the Bush tax cuts for the rich and investing the restored revenues in public works that directly create living-wage jobs in infrastructure renewal and public services,&quot; said Howie Hawkins, a Teamster and Green congressional candidate in Syracuse, New York.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The group hopes to convince Nader to run on as many Green Party state lines as possible in the upcoming election. Nader has said that he is willing to run on the Green Party line in both New York and California if it is offered.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The support for Nader is very strong among the grassroots of the Green Party. Like me, many Greens are ready to accept Nader's challenge and forge a broad-based coalition with other third parties and independents to reclaim democracy in America. We hope to arrive in Milwaukee with enough delegates committed to the Nader candidacy and the results to date are leaning our way. We expect lively debate at the Milwaukee convention,&quot; stated Carol Miller, Co-Chair of the New Mexico Green Party and a favorite daughter candidate in the New Mexico Primary Election on June 1. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Greens are committed to ecology, grassroots democracy, nonviolence and social and economic justice. </FONT></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
