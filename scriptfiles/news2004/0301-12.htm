<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - March 1 - Last week, the LA Weekly published a letter from ABC News correspondent John Stossel questioning the accuracy of a 1996 story we ran in Corporate Crime Reporter about a speech Stossel gave to the Federalist Society in Washington, D.C. </FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">At the time, we reported that Stossel, who started his television career as a consumer reporter and now spends his time attacking government and trial lawyers as co-host of ABC&#146;s 20/20, was asked during the question-and-answer period after his 1996 speech: </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;If you believe that consumer reporting works, and is a better regulator than regulation or lawsuits, why did you stop doing it?&quot; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;I got sick of it,&quot; Stossel responded. &quot;I also now make so much money I just lost interest in saving a buck on a can of peas. Twenty years was enough. But mainly, I came to realize that the government was doing far more harm to people than business and I ought to be reporting on that. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Nobody else was.&quot; (&#147;ABC&#146;s Stossel Spouts Libertarian Views to Federalist Society,&#148; 10 Corporate Crime Reporter 36(1), September 23, 1996). </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The LA Weekly ran a story earlier this month about book party in Los Angeles for Stossel and his new best-selling book, Give Me a Break : How I Exposed Hucksters, Cheats, and Scam Artists and Became the Scourge of the Liberal Media (HarperCollins, 2004) LA Weekly&#146;s Greg Goldin, relying on our story, reported that &#147;Years ago, when he quit exposing consumer rip-offs, he (Stossel) told a Federalist Society audience, &#145;I got sick of it. I also now make so much money, I just lost interest in saving a buck on a can of peas.&#146;&#148; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Stossel wrote a letter to the LA Weekly arguing that Goldin &#147;used a quote that has been attributed to me over the years that I don&#146;t recall ever uttering.&#148; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Stossel wrote: &#147;The alleged source of that quote was a 1996 speech I gave to the Federalist Society in which I supposedly said that I stopped consumer reporting because &#145;I got sick of it . . . I also now make so much money, I just lost interest in saving a buck on a can of peas.&#146; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">That doesn&#146;t sound like anything I&#146;ve said and certainly doesn&#146;t reflect the reasons I shifted my focus from consumer reporting to government programs and lawyers (I shifted because I concluded they do more harm to consumers than business). The transcript of this speech that the Federalist Society supplied does not include the quote.&#148; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">We attended Stossel&#146;s speech to the Federalist Society in September 1996. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">We taped his speech and made a transcript. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">We reported the speech in Corporate Crime Reporter. After reading Stossel&#146;s letter to the LA Weekly, we started digging around the office. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">And lo and behold, we found the transcript of the speech. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">And then, unbelievably, in a stroke of sheer luck, we found a copy of the seven-year-old tape of the speech. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">So, John &shy; if you would like us to refresh your recollection, give us a call and we&#146;ll play the &#147;can of peas&#148; segment for you. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">We&#146;ve always wondered why you moved from being an aggressive consumer reporter to attacking those who seek to crack down on corporate crime. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">You now say it had nothing to do with money. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Back in 1996, the truth slipped out. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">We have it on tape. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Apologies are in order. </FONT></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
