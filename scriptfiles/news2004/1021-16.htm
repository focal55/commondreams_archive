<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- October 21 -- With the largest member mobilization and political program in its history, the union movement has more than tripled its mobilization efforts over 2000, and is positioned to be one of the most important voices among voters in key states, including Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin and Florida.</font></p><p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Everywhere I visit, I find that union members are motivated as never before to bring about a change in the direction of our nation&#146;s leadership,&#148; said AFL-CIO President John Sweeney. &#147;They want good jobs, affordable health care and a real future for their families, and they&#146;re willing to walk in the cold and spend their evenings phone calling in order to secure that better future. I&#146;ve never seen anything like it.&#148;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Union household members are one out of four voters. There were 27 million union household voters in 2000.Union members voted for the working family ticket by at 63 to 32 percent margin in 2000, according to election night polling by Peter D. Hart Research Associates. Union household members were 36 percent of the electorate in Ohio and 30 percent in Pennsylvania in 2000.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The union movement has escalated its Labor 2004 program on every front, with more full-time staff in the field, more volunteers, and more member contacts than in years past. There are 4500 paid staff working full-time on the program now and that number will increase to 5000 by election day &#150; up from 1500 in 2000. The numbers of staff in only three states in 2004 - - Ohio (539), Pennsylvania (662) and Florida (414) - - exceeds the total number nationwide in 2000.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Over 113,000 volunteers have participated in the Labor 2004 program so far, and that number will double by election day.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The volunteers are knocking on doors seven days a week, phone calling hundreds of thousands of their co-workers and passing out millions of leaflets at their workplaces. Union members are reaching out at 257 phone banks with 2322 lines running in 16 states. Union members have passed out more than 32 million leaflets at workplaces &#150; including 885,000 in Wisconsin alone.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Research shows the union program is effective. In 2004, more than 90 percent of union members will receive information through multiple contacts. In 2000, 62 percent of union members decided their vote based on the issues, compared to 12 percent who vote by party.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Working America, the AFL-CIO&#146;s new national organization for working people, is making a significant impact on voters. Working America has 750,000 members, and is in touch with a total of 1.1 million members of working family households, offering information on where the candidates stand on such key issues as jobs, health care and overtime pay. In Ohio, for example, Working America is reaching out to 340,000 members. That is in addition to 892,000 &#147;traditional&#148; union members in Ohio.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The AFL-CIO is the umbrella organization for America&#146;s union and represents 13 million working men and women nationwide.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A sampling of the hundreds of upcoming labor walks and events include:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Date               City                      Time              Event</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">October 21     Orlando, FL           5 p.m.            Walk                  (Event will include national labor leader)</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">October 23     Jacksonville, FL    12 noon          Walk         (Event will include national labor leader)</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">October 23     Las Cruces, NM     3 p.m.            Walk         (Event will include national labor leader)</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">October 23    Cleveland, OH      10 a.m.            Walk</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">October 23    Philadelphia, PA     9 a.m.            Walk</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">October 23    Milwaukee, WI     10 a.m.            Walk</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">October 23    Las Vegas, NV     10 a.m.             Walk</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">October 30    York, PA                9 a.m.           Rally and walk (Event will include national labor leaders and mayor)</font></p><p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">###</font></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
