No matter what the ruling, we&#146;ll see you in the Park!&#148; said Tanya Mayo, national coordinator for the Not In Our Name project. </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mayo said, &#147;People from all over the country want to be in the streets and in Central Park on August 29th to be a part of this massive protest.  Mayor Bloomberg needs to decide what side of history he wants to be on.  Does he want to be remembered as the man who channeled Mayor Daley, Chicago&#146;s infamous mayor during the 1968 Democratic National Convention who ordered police to attack protesters?  Or does Bloomberg want to be remembered as the man who finally listened to reason and the First Amendment?&#148; </font></p><p></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
