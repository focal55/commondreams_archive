<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- October 29 -- Common Cause, the national non-partisan advocacy organization, announced today that it will provide information, updated throughout Election Day, on voting trouble spots in key states, based on its voter alert line, 1-866-MYVOTE1 and on-the-ground monitoring. More information is available at <a href="http://www.commoncause.org/" target="_new">www.commoncause.org</a>. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Creating a one-stop source on voting trouble spots, Common Cause announced the following activities:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">National, toll-free non-partisan telephone line, 1-866-MYVOTE1, sponsored by a consortium of groups. More than 33,500 citizens have already phoned in to obtain their polling location, record a message about their voting experience or get patched through to local elections officials. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Released advisories laying out voting landscape in 23 states to voters and members of the media. Also published guides to the 2004 election for reporters and citizens, all of which are available on the website. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Common Cause and the consortium will have a team of analysts, including election experts and political scientists, at the Constitution Center in Philadelphia, where the voter alert line is located. The team will be listening to messages left on the phone line, collecting anecdotal information throughout the day on issues such as whether polls opened on time, long lines at precincts, registration problems, mechanical problems and voter identification issues, among others.  We will also include information from field volunteers and Common Cause&#146;s 38 state offices, as it becomes available. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Election Day Media Briefings scheduled for 10 a.m., 3 p.m. and 8 p.m. ET to inform reporters, producers and editors about information coming in from voters on the voter alert line nationally and on-the-ground polling station volunteers in states that may include Ohio, Florida, New Mexico, Wisconsin, Colorado and Pennsylvania. Common Cause will have both aggregate data and anecdotal information.</font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Call in #: 800-247-9979    </font><br>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ask for the Election Day Monitoring call (there is no password).</font></li>
