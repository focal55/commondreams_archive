<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - April 8 - Chemical facilities owned by companies enrolled in an industry-sponsored voluntary safety program have had more than 1,800 accidents per year since 1990, according to a new report released today by the U.S. Public Interest Research Group. </FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The U.S. PIRG report, &quot;<A HREF="http://www.pirg.org/alerts/route.asp?id2=12860" TARGET="_new">Irresponsible Care: How the Chemical Industry Fails to Protect the Public From Chemical Accidents</A>,&quot; analyzes the history of accidents at the facilities that implement Responsible Care&reg;, a voluntary security code subscribed to by companies that are members of the American Chemistry Council, the largest industry lobbying organization and loudest opponent of mandatory safety standards. The report criticizes Bush Administration plans to address safety and security at chemical facilities by industry self-regulation.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The chemical industry's so-called Responsible Care plan lets the fox guard the chicken coop,&quot; said Meghan Purvis &quot;The Bush administration's inaction is a clear example of looking for security threats in the wrong places.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">U.S. PIRG analyzed accident data compiled by the National Response Center, the sole national point of contact for reporting oil and chemical discharges into the environment in the United States, from 1990 through 2003. U.S. PIRG looked specifically at ACC member companies, who are required to adopt the Responsible Care&reg; guidelines as a condition of their membership in the trade association.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The safety record of ACC member companies since the inception of Responsible Care&reg; shows that voluntary measures do not work,&quot; added David LeGrande, health and safety expert with the Communications Workers of America. &quot;To protect both workers and the public, safety measures must be improved.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Among the key findings in the report:</FONT></P>
<ul>
  <li><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Facilities across the country that are owned by ACC member companies have had 25,188 accidents since 1990, two years after the voluntary security measures were put in place.<br>
  </FONT></li>
  <li><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">BP, Dow, and DuPont ranked first through third, respectively, for the most accidents at their facilities since 1990. Facilities owned by these companies had nearly one third of the accidents at ACC member companies since 1990.<br>
  </FONT></li>
  <li><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">There were at least 500 accidents at ACC member facilities since 1990 in the following states: Texas, Louisiana, Alaska, Ohio, South Carolina, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, New York, Indiana and New Jersey.<br>
  </FONT></li>
  <li><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Between 1990 and 2003, there has been no downward trend in the number of accidents at facilities that have implemented Responsible Care&reg;. </FONT></li>
</ul>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">U.S. PIRG criticized ACC's voluntary code because it ignores the best option for chemical safety and security&#151;substituting safer chemicals and processes wherever possible, thereby eliminating the possibility of serious consequences from an accident. Citing numerous high profile security breaches at chemical plants, the group also criticized the single-minded focus on perimeter security since September 11th shifted security concerns to preventing a terrorist attack at chemical facilities.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;It is unacceptable that chemical facilities continue to threaten so many lives across the country,&quot; said Meghan Purvis. &quot;A comprehensive approach to security that substitutes safer technologies is imperative because fences and guards alone are not enough to protect the public.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has identified more than 120 chemical facilities that each put more than one million people at risk of injury or death because of the hazardous chemicals they use and store onsite. No federal government regulation requires industries to consider implementing inherently safer technology. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">U.S. PIRG urged the Bush administration to use EPA's existing authority under the Clean Air Act to mandate that chemical facilities substitute safer chemicals and processes where possible. Barring such action from the Bush administration, U.S. PIRG urged Congress to pass legislation introduced earlier this year by Senator Corzine (NJ) and similar legislation by Congressman Pallone (NJ) that would require facilities to consider changing their chemicals and processes where available. </FONT></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
