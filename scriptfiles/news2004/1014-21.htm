<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MINNEAPOLIS - October 14 - The Presidential and Vice Presidential debates helped 
voters decide which candidate's style they prefer.  They were less 
helpful in identifying policy differences.  How can a busy voter get 
behind the 20-second soundbites, and focus-group-vetted slogans and 
discover the candidates' stand on key issues?
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to the <a href="http://www.ilsr.org/" target="_new">Institute for Local Self-Reliance</a>, a non-partisan group 
advocating an informed citizenry, the answer is to focus on the party. 
Political parties matter, especially today when one party controls both 
the executive and legislative branches.  &quot;And despite the cynical 
rhetoric of Ralph Nader,&quot; says ILSR Vice President David Morris, &quot;profound differences exist between the Republican and Democratic parties.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The best way to discover these differences is to examine party voting 
records.  For those with access to the Internet, this is relatively 
easy.  For those relying on the media it is impossible. T.V., radio and 
newspapers rarely if ever give voting breakdowns by party.  When a bill 
passes by a wide margin the reader, unsurprisingly, assumes both parties 
supported it.  Indeed, says ILSR researcher, Becca Vargo Daggett, &quot;the 
media often uses the term 'bipartisan' to describe a bill that passes 
withthe support of 100 percent of one party and only 20 percent of the 
other.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It would take only a few seconds for the media to insert this 
information,&quot; says Morris, &quot;and it would build a more informed electorate.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To demonstrate the policy differences, ILSR has compiled party votes on 
10 key issues.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1. Fuel Efficiency. 81 percent of Republicans voted to prohibit an 
increase in fuel efficiency standards for pickup trucks; 68 percent of 
Democrats voting against.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2. Estate Taxes.  98 percent of House Republicans voted in favor of 
eliminating the estate tax; nearly 70 percent of Democrats voted against.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3. Same-sex Marriage. 90 of Senate Republicans voted to approve a 
Constitutional Amendment to prohibit same-sex marriages (in the form of 
a vote on cloture). Over 90 percent of Democrats voted against.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">4. Minimum Wage.  Some 78 percent of House Republicans opposed raising 
the minimum wage from $5.15 to $6.15 an hour; 98 percent of Democrats 
voted in favor.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">5. Patriot Act.  Some 93 percent of Democrats voted to restrict 
authorities' ability to force libraries and bookstores to give them 
customer lists; 90 percent of Republicans voted against.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">6. Global Warming. About 85 percent of Republicans voted against a bill 
to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. About 75 percent of Democrats 
voted in favor.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">7. Prescription Drugs. Some 60 percent of Republicans voted against 
allowing the import of prescription drugs; 75 percent of Democrats voted 
for it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">8. Assault Weapons. By a vote of 41-10 Senate Republicans voted against 
extending the assault weapon ban.  The Democrats voted in favor of the 
ban, 41 to 6.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">9. Unemployment Benefits. Republicans voted 179-39 against extending 
unemployment benefits for 13 weeks.  Democrats voted 187-0 in favor.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">10. Country-of-Origin Labeling. Democrats voted 37-7 to implement a 
country-of-origin labeling program for beef.  Republicans voted 29-20 
against.</font></p>
