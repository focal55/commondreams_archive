<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">BOISE, ID - April 13 - After more than two years of work, volunteer members of the Owyhee Initiative announced a ground-breaking proposal today to protect wilderness, to ensure the economic viability of ranching families and to tackle land management issues throughout Owyhee County.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;This joint proposal represents a lot of hard work to meet many peoples' interests and to craft a well balanced plan leading to legislation and into the future,&quot; said Fred Kelly Grant, initiative chairman.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Owyhee Initiative is a citizen-led effort to resolve some long-standing public land issues. The group formed at the invitation of the Owyhee County Commissioners, to seek a cooperative solution. The Initiative brought together ranchers, conservationists, county officials, recreationists, scientists, agency officials and others to do research and to negotiate a proposal.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The first year of discussions covered a wide range of topics, and broad information sharing. The second year focused on steps to take, leading toward resolution of some issues and setting the stage for further work. The group's next step is to meet with interested groups and the public to seek their views on the proposal.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The initiative will also begin discussions with Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, and the full Idaho Congressional Delegation to craft legislation. Sen. Crapo stepped forward at the beginning of the initiative to provide assistance and to carry a citizen proposal to Congress.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The Owyhee Initiative proposal represents the best in collaborative efforts, where diverse groups work together to produce a package of value to everyone,&quot; Sen. Crapo said. &quot;I look forward to working with the group on the next steps.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The groups represented were the Owyhee County Soil Conservation Districts, Sierra Club, Owyhee Cattlemen's Association, Idaho Conservation League, Owyhee Borderlands Trust, the Nature Conservancy, Idaho Outfitters and Guides Association, the Wilderness Society, People for the Owyhees, and the Owyhee County Commissioners. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the U.S. Air Force from Mountain Home also participated in the Owyhee Initiative but did not vote in decisions.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Conservation representatives applaud the 510,000 acre Wilderness proposal and 392 miles of river protections. &quot;This is a great opportunity to permanently protect the wild canyons, sagebrush sea, juniper hills and free-flowing rivers of the Owyhees,&quot; said Roger Singer, local representative of the Sierra Club. &quot;We have set aside years of conflict to accomplish something of real value to everyone who appreciates the wonders of Owyhee country.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Our proposal will move toward greater economic and ecological certainty for Owyhee County,&quot; said Chad Gibson, Owyhee Cattle Association representative. The ranchers who Gibson represented support moving 205,000 acres of Wilderness Study Areas into non-wilderness, multiple use management, while retaining all environmental laws.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The effort includes six focus areas: establishment of an ongoing, advisory Owyhee Initiative Board of Directors, establishment of an advisory Science Review Process, establishment of a Conservation and Research Center, designation of Wilderness and Wild &amp; Scenic Rivers, starting a recreation management plan on public lands for the whole county and commitment to cultural and historic protection.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;We're taking major steps to settle conflicts and we're committed to work together on continued problem solving,&quot; said John McCarthy, of the Idaho Conservation League.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The science review process will allow any citizen interested in an important decision by the BLM to call for a quick, independent science study, to see if the best available science is understood and being used,&quot; said Inez Jaca, a local rancher and representative for the Owyhee County Commissioners.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The first step in the recreation plan will be to end cross-country travel, off trails and off roads, by motorized and mechanized vehicles throughout public land in the county. The next step will be a designation of specified open routes for all recreation users, including routes for motorcycles, all-terrain-vehicles, mountain bikes, horses, and hikers. Existing routes will remain open in the interim.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The countywide recreation plan will provide a wide range of recreational opportunities and experiences for all users,&quot; said Cindy Bachman, a rancher and representative of both Owyhee County Soil Conservation Districts.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Recreation has expanded greatly in Owyhee County over the last decade and it is of critical importance to ensue recreational use is maintained and responsibly managed,&quot; said Sandra Mitchell, representative of the People for the Owyhees with many motorized recreation members.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The groups also agreed to establish some Wilderness that will not be grazed by livestock, through a voluntary agreement with ranchers, in two locations of about 35,000 acres. In another agreement the county will withdraw its R.S. 2477 rights-of-way assertions within areas designated as wilderness.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;We started this collaboration as an effort to protect our rural way-of-life here in Owyhee County and this proposal will be a big help,&quot; said Hal Tolmie, Owyhee County Commissioner. &quot;The proposal protects the lands we all care about, safeguards ranching in the region and ensures our children and grandchildren will be able to enjoy the Owyhee Canyon Country for years to come.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The proposal strives to balance local and national interests. &quot;We met and talked with both local people and with representatives of national groups to come up with a proposal meeting all current environmental laws and the standards set by both the Wilderness Act and the National Environmental Policy Act,&quot; said Craig Gehrke, Idaho representative for the Wilderness Society.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">More than 392 miles of rivers are also proposed to be designated Wild and Scenic Rivers, to protect both recreational and ecological values. &quot;The spectacular river systems in the canyons will gain more protection, while allowing continued use, which is good for our businesses and good for water quality,&quot; said Grant Simonds, of the Idaho Outfitters and Guides Association who also represented other sporting interests. Representatives of Idaho Rivers United, a river conservation group, helped craft the Wild and Scenic River proposal.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The proposed conservation and research center will undertake new projects on wildlife habitat protection, invasive species and water quality throughout the county, as well as coordinate current studies. &quot;The research center will pay long-term dividends to maintain a viable ecosystem at a landscape level,&quot; said Lou Lunte, representative for the Nature Conservancy.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Senator Crapo has been supportive of our efforts throughout this process,&quot; said Brenda Richards, a rancher and representative for the Owyhee Borderlands Trust. &quot;We look forward to working with his office and the rest of the delegation to make this proposal a law. This is an Idaho effort, with Idaho ideas and Idaho solutions we hope that everyone will embrace this proposal and help us make it a reality.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">For More Information</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The full proposal is available on the Owyhee Initiative website: <A HREF="http://www.owyheeinitiative.org/" TARGET="_new">http://www.owyheeinitiative.org/</A></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Factsheet: <A HREF="http://www.wilderness.org/Library/Documents/loader.cfm?url=/commonspot/security/getfile.cfm&PageID=8747" TARGET="_new">What the Owyhee Initiative is protecting</A> (PDF)</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Factsheet: <A HREF="http://www.wilderness.org/Library/Documents/loader.cfm?url=/commonspot/security/getfile.cfm&PageID=8748" TARGET="_new">Roads, access, and Owyhee County, Idaho</A> (PDF)</FONT></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
