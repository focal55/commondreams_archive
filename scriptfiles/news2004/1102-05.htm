<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- November 2 -- We all remember the votes that were never counted in Florida 2000.  While we are all working hard for a positive outcome on November 2nd, we also have to be prepared for a repeat of a 2000 stolen election. By signing the No Stolen Election pledge, you will be joining with tens of thousands of others in the November 3rd Urgent Response Network. Please sign the pledge at <a href="http://www.Nov3.US" target="_new">http://www.Nov3.US</a> and pass it around far and wide.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A Fair Elections Advisory Council made up of US and international elections experts will give us their assessment on Election Day itself.  If the Council finds significant fraud, the Urgent Response Network will be  activated on or immediately after November 3rd, calling on people everywhere to engage in protest, including non-violent civil disobedience,in front of their local federal buildings and other appropriate places. Those who can should converge in the states where the most serious fraud occurred, as well as in Washington D.C..</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition to signing the pledge, please work with other people and groups in your area to protect the vote on Election Day on November 2nd and to build the Urgent Response Network.
