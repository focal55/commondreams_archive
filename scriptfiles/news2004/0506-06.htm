<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - May 6 -  A new online tax-cut calculator gives taxpayers an accurate picture of their personal tax savings from the federal tax cuts enacted in 2001 and 2003 (as well as the capital gains cut in 1997).</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Most of the financial benefits that individuals received from the recent federal tax cuts are hidden within arcane calculations of taxes on wages, capital gains and dividends.  But, especially during an election year, individuals may want to know exactly how much they personally benefited from the recent tax cuts.  By inputting figures from their 1040 forms into the online calculator, individuals can see automatically what their tax savings were in total, and broken out by wages, capital gains and dividends.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Responsible Wealth, the group that created the online calculator has asked recipients of large tax cuts to donate some or all of their savings to fight the economic disparity that has increased to its highest point since the robber baron era of the 1920s.  Whether taxpayers agree with the tax cuts or not, they owe it to themselves to learn what their personal benefits from the tax cuts are.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The online tax-cut calculator can be found at <A HREF="http://www.responsiblewealth.org" TARGET="_NEW">http://www.responsiblewealth.org</A>.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">As an alternative to the detailed calculator, Responsible Wealth has created the following table to estimate personal gains from tax cuts:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">AVERAGE VALUE OF 2001- 2003 TAX CUTS IN 2003</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Income Group     2003 Adjusted Gross Income    Share of 2001-2003 Tax Cuts</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Average 2003 Tax Cut</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Top 1%     $337,000 or more    28%    $51,627</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Next 4%     $145,000 - 337,000    15%    $6,829</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Next 15%     $73,000 - 145,000    26%    $3,144</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Fourth 20%     $45,000 - 73,000    16%    $1,469</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Middle 20%     $28,000 - 45,000    9%    $827</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Second 20%     $16,000 - $28,000    5%    $443</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Bottom 20%     less than $16,000    1%    $87</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Source: Citizens for Tax Justice, July 2003.
