<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- October 28 -- Moving Ideas, the leading source for progressive public policy on the net, has released an analysis of recent trends in the job market, household income and other economic indicators. &quot;On the Minds of Americans: Jobs and the Economy,&quot;(<a href="http://www.movingideas.org/issuesindepth/jobs.html" target="_new">http://www.movingideas.org/issuesindepth/jobs.html</a>) is the final installment in a three-part series about issues on the minds of Americans today.</font></p>
<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;President Bush's tax cuts don't seem to be helping the economy,&quot; states Moving Ideas Director Melanie Alston-Akers.  &quot;Wages are stagnating, families have less income, and American jobs are being outsourced.  What's worse, the deficit is ballooning out of control because no one ever decided how we were going to pay for these tax cuts for the wealthy.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The analysis includes resource links to organizations working on these issues, as well as leading research and analysis in the field including the latest Bureau of Labor statistics, the Economic Policy Institute study, &quot;Income Picture: Weak 2003 labor market leads to lower incomes and higher poverty,&quot; and the University of California at Berkeley report, &quot;The New Wave of Outsourcing.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The complete &quot;On the Minds of Americans&quot; series on Homeland Security, Health Care Costs, and Jobs and the Economy can be viewed at <a href="http://www.movingideas.org/issuesindepth/american_minds.html" target="_new">http://www.movingideas.org/issuesindepth/american_minds.html</a>.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Moving Ideas is the leading source for progressive policy on the net, featuring resources from more than 130 research and advocacy organizations.
