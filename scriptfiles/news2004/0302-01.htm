<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->NEW YORK - March 1 - Right in time for Women's History Month, I'm pleased to announce the publication of '<A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1859845878/commondreams-20/ref=nosim/" TARGET="_new">BUSHWOMEN: Tales of a Cynical Species</A>', my new book on the women in Bush's Cabinet and inner circle.<P>As journalist Greg Palast puts it, &quot;Laura Flanders' cool book shows that Bush's women are to feminism what his election was to democracy. Every stupid white man should read this book, and every one else too.&quot;</P><P>Comprehensively footnoted, BUSHWOMEN blows the lid on Condoleezza Rice and Karen Hughes, and cabinet secretaries Gale Norton, Elaine Chao and the rest. Learn how Bush uses women and people of color as identity politics puppets while his administration's policies leave Americans -- and the world -- more divided than ever. </P><P>Publisher's Weekly calls BUSHWOMEN, &quot;Fierce, funny and intelligent.&quot; &quot;Reporting that matters, delivering information necessary to make knowledgeable decisions at the voting booth,&quot; says Kirkus Reviews. </P><P>Even with glowing reviews, there is a big job ahead. To break through the corporate media machine, we need to use grassroots activist tactics - word-of-mouth, bookstore readings, e-mail, placement in organizational newsletters and giveaways for public radio fundraising drives.  </P><P>Here's where you can help.  Rapid sales in short period of time move a book up the bestseller list.  It's not just the number of books sold, it's how fast people buy them. </P><P>If we can get every person who wants to support BUSHWOMEN to buy it or order it now, we can push it quickly up the bestseller list. </P><P>Buy books, pass on this email, post reader-reviews on-line, and urge your friends to do the same. You can find <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1859845878/commondreams-20/ref=nosim/" TARGET="_new">BUSHWOMEN</A> at your local independent book seller, or use this link to purchase directly from Amazon and, while you're about it, you'll help &quot;Your Call,&quot; our KALW radio show: BUSHWOMEN: Tales of a Cynical Species.</P><P>Books by and about women face extra challenges when it comes to getting fair play, review space, and media time. Can you help us beat the odds this women's history month?</P><P>You can find out more about BUSHWOMEN and read more reviews at <A HREF="http://yourcallradio.org/laura/pages/contact.html" TARGET="_new">Lauraflanders.com</A>, my new website. You can also see the schedule of my upcoming national book tour. Email me there if you know a group that might be interested in partnering with this book. </P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
