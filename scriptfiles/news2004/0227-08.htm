<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - February 27 - On February 16, a FAIR action alert called on ABC World News Tonight and the New York Times to offer a more nuanced explanation of the possible effects of a proposed constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage. While some proponents of the amendment claim it would allow states to offer same-sex civil union arrangements, some legal experts suggest that the vague language of the amendment could actually ban civil unions.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In response to emails from FAIR activists, New York Times public editor Daniel Okrent wrote on his web journal (2/19/04): &quot;I urge The Times to report on it more fully -- not just on what the amendment really means, but also on the debate over what it really means.&quot;  On February 25, the Times did just that, offering a short piece on the legal debate over theamendment: &quot;Some conservative scholars who oppose gay unions and some gay scholars who oppose the amendment are arguing that it might effectively block any marital benefits for same-sex couples, no matter what name is used.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The piece did tilt in favor of the amendment's proponents, offering two responses to a single comment from a critic of the amendment.  The Times story is also unfortunately framed to suggest that criticism of the amendment's language is relegated to just two small groups of legalscholars-- &quot;a handful of conservatives&quot; who oppose gay unions, and &quot;a few gay legal advocates&quot; who oppose the amendment.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In their February 24 broadcast, ABC World News Tonight also changed the way they reported on the amendment.  Correspondent Terry Moran ended his report with this: &quot;The president says he supports states deciding for themselves whether they want to establish so-called civil unions for same-sex couples, though gay rights advocates say the constitutional amendment he is backing might ban even those arrangements.&quot;  This explanation is an improvement over Moran's earlier description of the amendment, which he said &quot;would define marriage as a union between a man and a woman, but allow states to establish civil unions for gay couples.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">FAIR's criticism was taken seriously by ABC and the Times thanks to the efforts of activists who contacted the outlets in response to the alert.</FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
