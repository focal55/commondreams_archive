<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - August 25 - A team of Democrats today announced the launch of  ZELLOUT.com (<a href="http://www.zellout.com" target="_new">www.zellout.com</a>), an online campaign that calls on Senator Zell Miller to declare himself a Republican and switch parties.  Signing the online petition automatically sends an email to Sen. Miller's office.  The group is urging Democrats to flood the faux Democrat with demands that he finally admit what is obvious to all -- &quot;Democrat&quot; Zell Miller is a Republican.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Just think how desperate the Bush Republicans are,&quot; said Eric Carbone, founder of Zellout.com.  &quot;The Republicans are using Zell Miller to give their convention a veneer of bipartisanship, when in fact Zell Miller is as much a Democrat as George W. Bush is,&quot; says Carbone. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Zell Miller's decision to accept the invitation to give the keynote speech at the Republican National Convention next week has angered many Democrats.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;I voted for Zell Miller based on his long record of service to all Georgians, and I feel betrayed,&quot; said Rich Mintz, a Democratic voter in Atlanta's Ormewood Park neighborhood.  &quot;Sen. Miller has cast aside the honest values that he built his career on, in order to serve the most divisive and extremist President in American history.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Let's be honest,&quot; says Carbone.  &quot;Miller talks like a Republican, he votes like a Republican, he is a Republican.  So let's end the charade.   Miller's masquerade as a Democrat is an insult to every Democrat in the country.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The group promises to deliver a &quot;Big Red Elephant&quot; to Miller's Washington office for every thousand signatures it collects.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The senator can use them to redecorate his office when he comes home from the convention.  No doubt they'll go well with all the Republican signs and banners he brings back,&quot; added Carbone.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Carbone recently served as Director of Internet Communications for Wesley Clark's presidential campaign. He creates projects that use the Internet to engage people in the political process.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
