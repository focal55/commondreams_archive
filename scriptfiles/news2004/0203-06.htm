<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">ST. PAUL, MN - February 3 - On Thursday February 5th at over 650 locations in 41 states, thousands of Americans will gather to discuss &quot;Conscience of a Liberal,&quot; by Paul Wellstone to launch Wellstone Action's Civic Dialogue Project. Meeting in homes, libraries, coffee shops, bookstores, community centers and houses of worship, people will share their own ideas about solving public problems and moving the country in a more humane direction. This project is part of the rapidly growing phenomenon of organizing efforts that use the Internet and email to encourage face-to-face dialogue about important social and political issues.</FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The Civic Dialogue Project is a perfect outgrowth of Senator Paul Wellstone's own way of practicing politics,&quot; said Jeff Blodgett, Executive Director of Wellstone Action. &quot;Paul believed in and promoted the idea that ordinary people can and should take part in the political life of this country. He believed in large-scale civic engagement, a politics of hope and the idea that average citizens would solve the problems facing our society.&quot;</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">All discussions in the Wellstone Civic Dialogue Project are led by volunteer facilitators who have agreed to convene the groups and provide an open format for the discussion. The first night of discussion will focus on the topic &quot;Can We Dream Again?&quot;. It is intended to be a discussion about the gap between personal values and the values that are reflected in the public arena. It addresses the cynicism and sense of disempowerment permeating much of our society at this time. Eight additional discussions are available to groups who want to continue to meet and discuss specific policy issues. They cover a range of topics such as education, health care, economic justice, domestic violence, money and politics, Iraq and more.
