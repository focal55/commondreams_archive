<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TAKOMA PARK, MD -- November 9 -- At a time of thinning wallets from high gas prices and rising alarm over global warming, a growing number of Americans are lining up at their local car dealers for the latest hybrid electric cars. Accelerating into the mainstream, fuel-efficient hybrids are no longer--as many automakers have portrayed them--just a boutique item.  </font><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Demand is outstripping supply to such a degree that some consumers are waiting up to nine months for a hybrid.  In response to growing frustration with the long waits and an eagerness for fuel-efficient choices that fit a variety of needs, the Center for a New American Dream is launching a campaign to convince automakers to deliver more hybrid vehicles to the market.  Unlike some campaigns, this one doesn&#146;t focus on attacking the companies but on organizing their customers!  The Center is generating thousands of letters to the auto manufacturers and offering a free hybrid car to the person who comes up with the best campaign slogan that will encourage automakers to increase production of hybrids in the U.S. and give consumers more choices.  Amateur sloganeers can visit <a href="http://www.NewDream.org/Prius" target="_new">http://www.NewDream.org/Prius</a> to take their best shot at crafting the winning entry.  The author of the most clever and creative slogan, as determined by an independent panel of judges, will receive a 2005 Toyota Prius.  </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Americans are fed up with the long wait for fuel-efficient hybrid cars and now they have a chance to do something about it,&#148; said Betsy Taylor, president of the Center for a New American Dream, a national nonprofit organization that helps Americans consume wisely.  &#147;By entering our contest, people can help us design a campaign to urge automakers to bring more hybrids to the market at an affordable price.&#148;</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Amidst encouraging signs--the auto industry planned to put 100,000 hybrids on American roads in 2004 compared to 40,000 the previous year--this contest offers citizens an opportunity to collectively send a loud, clear message to the industry to step up production even more and make hybrids widely available.  &#147;In light of ever-increasing gas prices, widespread desire to reduce our oil dependence, and the need for cleaner air, it makes good sense for automakers to meet the demand for hybrid cars,&#148; said Taylor.  &#147;Our wallets - and the environment - will be helped!&#148;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Center will take the winning slogan and use it in a national media campaign designed to influence the auto industry. Submissions will be judged on creativity, catchiness, positive tone, and clarity of message. Participants have until January 14, 2005 to enter their slogans. Runners up will receive travel insurance through Better World Travel.
