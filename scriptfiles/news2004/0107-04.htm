-  
January 6 - &quot;When the Constitution was written, a strange formula to determine taxes and representation declared that the Negro was 60% of a person. Today another curious formula seems to declare he is 50% of a person. Of the good things in life he has approximately one-half those of whites; of the bad he has twice those of whites.&quot;&shy; Dr. Martin Luther King, &quot;Where Do We Go from Here?&quot;</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Today&sup1;s black-white divide is strikingly similar to when Dr. King wrote those words in 1967, according to a new report from United for a Fair Economy entitled &quot;The State of the Dream: Enduring Disparities in Black and White,&quot; by Dedrick Muhammad, Attieno Davis and Meizhu Lui, to be released on January 15.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The report looks at the divide between African American and white Americans on more than a dozen indicators and concludes that the United States has failed to reach Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.&sup1;s vision.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Some progress has been made in narrowing the gap over the last 35 years, in areas such as education, poverty, homeownership, and income. But the gap has narrowed at such a slow rate that it would take black Americans centuries to reach complete parity with whites.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In some areas, such as infant mortality and imprisonment, the black-white gap is actually wider than in 1968, when Dr. King was killed. In other areas, such as unemployment, the gap has not narrowed.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;As President Bush prepares his State of the Union address, we hope he takes into account the disunion between the lives of black and white Americans,&quot; said Dedrick Muhammad, Racial Wealth Divide Coordinator at United for a Fair Economy.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Meizhu Lui is Executive Director of United for a Fair Economy, a national nonprofit that raises awareness of growing economic inequality. Attieno Davis coordinates UFE&sup1;s Racial Wealth Divide education work.</FONT></P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p></font><!-- #EndEditable -->
