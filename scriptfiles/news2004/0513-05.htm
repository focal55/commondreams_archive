<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">PHILADELPHIA, PA - May 13 -  The American Friends Service Committee (AFSC), an international social justice organization, announces a new online dialogue designed to help faith communities transform the acrimonious &#145;cultural conflict&#146; over the issue of marriage for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people into a respectful and constructive exchange.</FONT></p><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Peace Building Dialogues will allow ordinary people from diverse faith traditions to bring their perspectives into a discussion that has been dominated by pundits, politicians and their sound bites. The small chat groups, each between no more than 30 people, will run over the Internet for two weeks beginning the week of May 17.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Through Peace Building Dialogues, people from many faith and spiritual traditions can find ways to acknowledge their differences, affirm their commonly-held values, and continue to engage each other with respect and love.  </FONT></P><P> </P><P> <FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;So far, the marriage debate has grabbed the headlines while offering little opportunity for people of good will to learn from each other,&#148; says Kay Whitlock, AFSC national representative for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender issues.   &#147;Instead, our country has seen an often polarizing collision of conflicting beliefs over the true meaning of family, marriage, morality, and the role of law in a religiously diverse society.&#148;</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Peace Building Dialogues project is a collaboration between AFSC and Web Lab, a New York-based non-profit think tank that encourages and supports innovation on the Web.  Web Lab places a special emphasis on developing the potential of the medium to bring people together to explore both personal and public issues in powerful, transforming ways. It was created on the premise that the Web can be more than an efficient place to find and buy commercial products or to access information on any topic. It is also an extremely powerful communications medium that provides unprecedented opportunities for people with diverse backgrounds and experiences to connect with, and learn from, each other. </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Space is still available for the online discussions next week.
