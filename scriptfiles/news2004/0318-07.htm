<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - March 18 - On Friday, a Loudon County (TN) Sheriff&#146;s Deputy became the latest victim of assault weapons on the streets of our nation. Three-year veteran Deputy Jason Scott, 25, was gunned down by 16-year-old Michael Harvey in Loudon County, Tennessee, in a bloody standoff involving over 150 officers that ultimately ended with the suicide of the teen. </FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;Our sincere condolences go out to the family and friends of the officer,&#148; said Chris McGrath, executive director of Handgun-Free America. &#147;Far too many law enforcement officers are killed on the streets of our country with these weapons of war, and this tragic shooting shows us that the problem continues every day.&#148; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;The shooting came only one day before the six-month deadline for Congress to extend the current ban on assault weapons,&#148; notes McGrath. &#147;The ban, which has been in place for just under 10 years, contains a sunset clause that will force it to expire automatically on September 14th, unless Congress and the President act. This terrible tragedy ending in the death of a Loudon County Sheriff&#146;s Deputy should serve as a stark reminder to Congress that civilian access to military-style weapons is something that must be addressed and not ignored.&#148; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Deputy Jason Scott was killed after being the first to respond to a 911 call from the teen&#146;s mother, Ann Harvey, following a fight between the woman and her son. As Scott arrived, the teenager opened fire with an SKS semiautomatic assault weapon, striking the officer four times. Scott was rushed to the University of Tennessee Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;The SKS, a military-bred assault weapon, was used to kill eight law-enforcement officers between 1998 and 2001 alone,&#148; notes McGrath, citing a study by the Violence Policy Center. &#147;While the SKS is not banned by name under the current assault weapons law, depending upon how the weapon was configured it may be covered under Section (B) of the law, which defines an assault weapon based on whether it has two or more specific design features. Under legislation to improve the assault weapons ban currently pending in Congress, the SKS would be explicitly banned by name.&#148; The bill, the &#147;Assault Weapons Ban and Law Enforcement Protection Act of 2003&#148; is sponsored by Senator Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ) and Representative Carolyn McCarthy (D-NY). </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;The SKS is clearly an assault weapon and should be banned under federal law. According to a recent study by the Violence Policy Center, one in five law-enforcement officers killed in the line of duty between 1998 and 2001 was killed with an assault weapon,&#148; states McGrath. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">After the shooting, Loudon County Sheriff Tim Guider was quick to point out how grave the threat of assault weapons is to his officers. He noted that even if the Deputy had been wearing a bulletproof vest, &#147;it would not have stopped the high-powered cartridges&#148; from killing him. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;It is tragically clear that these military-style weapons have no business in the hands of civilians. It is time for Congress and the White House to address the threat posed by semiautomatic assault weapons to officers and citizens alike. Merely renewing the current law is not enough. We need an improved and effective law that truly bans assault weapons,&#148; says McGrath. </FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
