<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- December 2 -- In a remarkable and revealing answer to a hypothetical question from Federal District Court Judge Joyce H. Greene, a U.S. attorney today said that people ranging from a Swiss Grandmother who unknowingly gave funds to an Afghan charity that passed the money on to Al-Qaeda, to a man who thinks his brother might be associated with terrorists and doesn&#146;t&#146; turn him in, could be jailed indefinitely as enemy combatants at Guant&aacute;namo Bay, Cuba.  The question came in the context of today&#146;s arguments before Judge Greene on whether ten Habeas Corpus petitions brought on behalf of men detained at Guant&aacute;namo should be dismissed.  The U.S. argues that the Combatant Review Status Tribunals (CRST) initiated by the Government provide the detainees with sufficient due process to fulfill the mandate of the Supreme Court&#146;s ruling last spring. Lawyers from the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) say that the Supreme Court made clear that the detainees have a right to proper judicial review of their status and that the CRST do not even come close to meeting the standard set.</font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CCR Associate Legal Director for Litigation, Barbara Olshansky, who argued a portion of the case before Judge Greene said, &#147;The Government showed its true colors today: if under this definition of enemy combatant a Swiss granny who gave money to charity can be detained indefinitely at Guant&aacute;namo, then anyone who unintentionally acts in a way the government finds suspicious is in danger of losing their freedom.  The Administration&#146;s position gives too much power to the government to lock people up without having to justify its actions.  It&#146;s an affront to a free and democratic society and another example of just how far they will try to overstep their authority. We sincerely hope their views do not prevail.&#148;</font></p><p> <br></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
