<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - May 7 - The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force Policy Institute released today the first comprehensive analysis of the six most frequently mentioned prospective Democratic vice presidential candidates on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) issues. The six discussed in the report are Senator John Edwards (NC), Representative Richard A. (Dick) Gephardt (MO); Senator Bob Graham (FL), former Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, Governor Bill Richardson of New Mexico, and Governor Thomas J. Vilsack of Iowa. </FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The report is based on an analysis of the voting records and public statements of the prospective candidates in 13 key issue areas, including: sexual orientation and gender identity nondiscrimination laws; HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment; lifting the military's ban on openly gay and lesbian servicemembers; marriage equality for same-sex couples; and, education policy that supports the right of LGBT youth to attend school in a safe and affirming environment.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">According to the report, the most supportive prospective VP candidate is Representative Dick Gephardt, who has taken supportive positions on 11 of the 13 issue areas (and unclear in 1 area, and opposed in 1 area). He is followed by: Senator John Edwards (supportive in 9, unclear in 3, opposed in 1), Governor Richardson (supportive in 8, unclear in 4, and opposed in 1), Senator Graham (supportive in 4, unclear in 6, and opposed in 3), and Governor Vilsack (supportive in 5, unclear in 8). Former Senator Sam Nunn, who led efforts to pass the much-reviled &quot;Don't Ask, Don't Tell&quot; law, ranked last (supportive in only 2, opposed in 4, unclear in 7). None supports marriage equality for same sex couples.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;To win in November, Senator Kerry must have the enthusiastic support of the LGBT community and who he selects as his running mate will have a lot to do with that,&quot; said Matt Foreman, National Gay and Lesbian Task Force Executive Director. &quot;Our community needs to see a vice presidential candidate on the Democratic side whose record shows both a willingness and capacity to fight head on the other side's ugly campaign to use same-sex marriage to wedge the electorate.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">According to exit polls*, the gay, lesbian and bisexual vote comprises at least 5% of the general election vote, and traditionally votes heavily (70%+) Democratic, making the gay community the party's third most loyal bloc of support, behind the African American and Jewish communities. With the electorate being so evenly divided, both parties agree that turning out their bases is critical. Many see President Bush's public call for an anti-marriage U.S. constitutional amendment as an overt play to energize and turn out evangelical Christians, who made up 40% of his vote in November 2000. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Foreman said that Senator Kerry's statement that he - while opposing amending the U.S. Constitution to forbid same-sex marriage - might support amending the Massachusetts Constitution to do just that had caused consternation in the LGBT community and the vice presidential nod could go a long way in either healing or exacerbating the rift.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Picking someone like Sam Nunn would send a terrible message to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people,&quot; Foreman said.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Collectively, the prospective candidates are most supportive of sexual orientation nondiscrimination laws, HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment, inclusive hate crimes laws, and to a lesser degree, domestic partnership. Although they oppose marriage equality for same-sex couples, four oppose the Federal Marriage Amendment (the positions of Bob Graham and Sam Nunn on the amendment are not clear). </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The full report and a chart summarizing the positions of the prospective VP candidates can be downloaded from the Task Force website at <A HREF="http://www.TheTaskForce.org/electioncenter" TARGET="_new">http://www.TheTaskForce.org/electioncenter</A></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">*Exit pollsters have thus far not asked a transgender exit poll question, therefore the Task Force can make no comment on the size or outcome of the transgender vote. </FONT></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
