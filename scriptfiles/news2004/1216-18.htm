<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- December 16 -- Attorneys for Green Party Presidential candidate David Cobb yesterday filed an affidavit which outlines alleged voting machine tampering in Hocking County, Ohio, on the Friday before the recount began.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The document was filed yesterday by Cobb's attorneys in federal district court in Columbus as part of ongoing litigation concerning the recount. It was also the subject of a call for an FBI investigation by Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;These are deeply disturbing allegations that warrant investigation by the FBI, the Attorney General of Ohio, and should be addressed by the federal court,&quot; said Cobb/LaMarche Media Director Blair Bobier.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The affidavit, sworn by Hocking County Board of Elections Deputy Director Sherole Eaton, says that on Friday an employee from the Triad corporation, the voting machine manufacturer, came into a polling place where voting machines were stored awaiting the recount and used tools to reset information stored in the machines. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In his letter to the FBI, Rep. Conyers says he has information that similar &quot;actions of this nature&quot; may have occurred elsewhere in Ohio. He calls for &quot;the immediate impoundment of election machinery to prevent any further tampering.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The allegations were first made public by Cobb during a forum on voting irregularies convened by Rep. Conyers in Columbus earlier this week.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Ohio recount has proceeded at an uneven pace across the state this week, and certified count observers report the gamut from cooperation and smooth operations to outright obstruction. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, a pattern of problems has emerged. &quot;Some of our designated monitors have been denied access to poll books and told they can't ask questions. They report absentee and provisional ballots not being counted, and a lack of random selection in precincts to be examined,&quot; Bobier said.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Cobb-LaMarche website &lt;<a href="http://www.votecobb.org/" target="_new">http://www.votecobb.org</a>&gt; has more information about the campaign and recount efforts, as well as eyewitness reports from the Greens' elections observers.
