<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- November 3 -- The following is a statement by NARAL Pro-Choice America Interim President Elizabeth Cavendish:<br></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;President Bush had to pull out all the stops to beat back the mobilized opposition he faced in this campaign. He will face an even bigger mobilization if he now tries to pack the Supreme Court with new anti-choice zealots. Not even George Bush could keep a straight face claiming that this election gives him a mandate to roll back women's rights.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Pro-choice activists are proud of the work we did in this campaign. NARAL Pro-Choice America mobilized thousands of volunteers, made nearly 12 million direct contacts with targeted voters, and aired compelling advertisements in five key states. We helped John Kerry to narrow victories in the states where we worked the hardest - New Hampshire, Oregon, Washington and Wisconsin - and we helped secure victories for pro-choice congressional candidates like Allyson Schwartz in Pennsylvania and Melissa Bean in Illinois. The Barack Obama/Alan Keyes race demonstrated what can happen when a candidate actually articulates the anti-choice principles by which George Bush has governed. And California's stem-cell research initiative won an important victory.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We are deeply disappointed by these election results -- not just for president but also the election of new senators like Tom Coburn, who advocates the death penalty for doctors who perform abortion, and Jim Demint, who believes single mothers should not be allowed to teach in public schools.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;But through this campaign we have built our strength. We know that President Bush is preparing an even more intense attack on a woman's right to choose. And we are ready to fight him every step of the way.&quot;</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
