<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - April 23 - Kayley Harrington, a 21-year-old American University student and co-coordinator of Advocates for Youth's International Youth Leadership Council, will speak Sunday at the March for Women's Lives rally.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;I'm honored to lend a voice for thousands of young people who will be attending the March for Women's Lives,&quot; said Harrington, who plans on addressing the vital role youth play in the battle to keep reproductive freedoms available for all women. &quot;Young people represent the present and the future of this movement. Today, we march with all of those who have fought for so long to ensure our right to choose. This generation pledges to continue to fight and to preserve that right for future generations.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Following the march, the rally will be held from 1-4 p.m. on the National Mall. This rally will feature some of the biggest names in the field of reproductive rights, all of whom are focused on one goal -- protecting women's rights against an assault from the Bush administration.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The real threat to our reproductive freedom comes from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue,&quot; said Harrington. &quot;Young women my age not only face obstacles in exercising our right to choose, but in obtaining the information and services that make abortion less necessary.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;This march will put politicians on notice,&quot; concluded Harrington. &quot;Young women's reproductive rights -- the right to family planning services, comprehensive sex education, emergency contraception, and, yes, when necessary, abortion -- these rights are not negotiable.&quot;</FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
