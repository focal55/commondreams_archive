<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - April 6 - In a letter delivered today, the Sustainable Energy Coalition called upon congressional appropriators to &quot;substantially increase&quot; federal support for the cross-section of renewable energy technologies.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Providing technology-by-technology recommendations, the 25 business and energy policy organizations proposed increasing the U.S. Department of Energy's renewable energy program budget to $598.5 million in Fiscal Year 2005 (FY05).  That is nearly 60% more than the White House's FY'05 budget request ($374.8 million) and two-thirds more than the actual FY'04 budget ($357.5 million).</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The letter, delivered to the chairmen and ranking members of the Energy &amp; Water Subcommittees of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives Committees on Appropriations, acknowledged &quot;the pressures on the federal budget.&quot;  However, the authors stressed that &quot;renewable energy is growing and will continue to grow as alternatives become less plentiful and more expensive. On a percentage basis, solar and wind energy are the fastest growing sources of electricity worldwide.  Geothermal, hydropower and biomass play an important role in our electricity mix today and will be even more important components of our generation in the future.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Moreover, &quot;the technologies enabling this ongoing renewable energy revolution were developed in the United States.  However, lukewarm domestic support for incentives and research means that market share, technical expertise and thousands of new, local jobs in this sector are increasingly moving overseas.  This accelerating trend must be reversed.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The letter concluded that &quot;each of the renewable energy technologies -- biomass, geothermal, hydropower, solar and wind -- have the potential to contribute enormous amounts of new, domestic energy to our economy.  It is time for Congress to put words into action, and fund the Department of Energy's renewable energy programs so they can achieve their full potential.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The complete text of the letter and specific technology budget recommendations along with the list of signing organizations follows.</FONT></P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">SUSTAINABLE ENERGY COALITION</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">1612 &quot;K&quot; Street, N.W.; #202-A; Washington, DC 20006 202-293-2898, ext.201; kbossong@hotmail.com</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">SUPPORT  INCREASED  FUNDING  FOR  RENEWABLE  ENERGY  PROGRAMS</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">April 6, 2004</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Honorable David Hobson, Chair</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Honorable Peter J.

On a percentage basis, solar and wind energy are the fastest growing sources of electricity worldwide.  Geothermal, hydropower and biomass play an important role in our electricity mix today and will be even more important components of our generation in the future.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The technologies enabling this ongoing renewable energy revolution were developed in the United States.  However, lukewarm domestic support for incentives and research means that market share, technical expertise and thousands of new, local jobs in this sector are increasingly moving overseas.  This accelerating trend must be reversed.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">We recognize the pressures on the federal budget.  However, we are approaching a critical junction in our thinking about renewable energy &#150; either we push these technologies over the last hump to widespread commercial acceptance, or our security and economic well-being remain at the mercy of other nation&#146;s technology and resources.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Following are our specific recommendations for FY 2005 funding for sustainable energy programs in the energy and water bill:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Biomass/Biofuels: $100 Million</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Biomass power funding should support cleaner combustion, gasification, and digestion technologies for electric generation with biomass. A variety of feedstocks should be tested for emissions within these technologies. Distributed generation with small biomass systems should be emphasized as well. The power and fuels programs should work closely together to develop a biorefinery plant that can be operated in the U.S. to produce clean fuel, power and chemicals. The biofuels program should add to the existing biomass options (e.g., corn fiber) with an expanded focus on cellulosic biomass for ethanol as well as biodiesel.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Accordingly, the Coalition seeks $55 million for Biofuels RD&amp;D program that focuses on cost reductions in the production of ethanol through the fermentation of sugars and the gasification of cellulosic biomass and biomass waste streams for the production of syngases and their conversion into biofuels. Areas to be highlighted include:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">1) developing new products for distillers grains and positioning corn-to-ethanol plants to accommodate cellulosic biomass for the production of fermentable sugars and for the use of residuals and lignin to produce both thermal and electrical power;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">2) Accelerating the use of ethanol in E-85 vehicles by optimizing these engines for the higher octane of ethanol;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">3) Continuing to work with USDA and DOI -- in locating and funding RD&amp;D projects that will convert agricultural and forestry crops and residues into biofuels;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">4) Working with EPA in funding their RD&amp;D in developing an advanced biofuels spark-ignited engine;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">5) Working with engine manufactures to optimize the performance of diesel engines using a no-sulfur, middle distillate produced from cellulosic biomass it is possible that this combination will more than favorably compete with hydrogen in terms of costs and environmental benefits; and6) [see item 4) under Biomass Electric with a focus on the production of biofuels].</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Coalition further asks for a $45 million Biomass Electric RD&amp;D program which becomes less line-itemed but directed towards industry commercialization partnerships around five technology areas:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">1) gasifiers - maintain a program to validate and enhance performance on large and smaller-scale generators,</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">2) anaerobic digestion - assist existing industry on standardization, replication and integration with a range of biomass-electric generation technologies,</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">3) heat engines - assist existing industry manufacturers in validating systems using biogas, biodiesel, landfill gas, and waste heat,4) diesel and reciprocating engines using biodiesels, ethanol and other liquids and biogases, and5) utility education programs for independent, cooperative and municipal utilities on utilization of their biomass resources to stabilize electric rates, enhance reliability of the US electric grid, and lower emissions.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Geothermal: $42.5 Million</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The US urgently needs to develop the technology and resource knowledge necessary to tap its extensive geothermal resources base. While the USGS estimates the accessible resource base to be at least 95,000 MW, because of the high risk and cost of production we are tapping only 2% of this potential. Currently, DOE geothermal research program is severely under funded. At one time the geothermal research budget was over $150 million, but today the program struggles to maintain a bare-bones research program.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">When one production well can cost $10 million, a research program that is presently funded at $25.5 million (FY04 budget) is simply below critical mass. The DOE research program lacks funding to support cost-shared research into advanced technologies, cannot support or undertake critical resource assessment, and fails to take the other measures needed to tap the huge identified potential of this resource.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In addition to continuing the base program funding (FY04 budget of $25.5 million), we recommend: an additional $1.5 million for resource assessment - the US geothermal resource assessment is over 25 years old and urgently needs updating and DOE needs to be engaged in that update to ensure that is uses the best science and technology available; $3 million for direct use geothermal efforts, which are directed to expand the utilization of geothermal energy for agricultural, commercial, and other uses by building upon successful efforts of organizations like New Mexico State University; $5 million for an advanced power technology development solicitation, which will seek industry partners to develop the geothermal power system of the future; and, $7.5 million for &quot;enhanced geothermal systems&quot; technology development, work which holds the promise of increasing the geothermal resource base ten-fold.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Hydrogen:  $110 Million</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">While Hydrogen is not a fuel, it represents an important energy carrier. The Coalition stresses that the DOE RD&amp;D be focused on utilizing renewable resources, waste heat, and related clean processes to generate hydrogen, and to de-emphasize the use of coal or nuclear energy, traditional energy resources, for this purpose. Hydrogen RD&amp;D should focus in four primary areas:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">1) Infrastructure and storage to transport, store and safely utilize hydrogen: $40 million,2) Creation of hydrogen from renewable energy and waste heat (CHP) utilizing the many options including novel concepts: $40 million,3) Codes and standards development for hydrogen siting and safety including public education: $15 M, and4) Unique conversion of hydrogen to electricity including primarily fuel cells, but also heat engines and NIMH storage systems: $15 million.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Hydropower: $10.0 Million</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Funding for the Department's hydropower program should be directed to the Department's Advanced Hydropower Turbine (AHT) program and its related activities. The funding should also support the Department's efforts to study other operational and environmental issues related to hydropower production, including the potential integration of hydropower with other renewable energy technologies, as well as efforts focused on new hydropower technologies, such as micro-hydropower and free-flow technologies that require no dams or diversions. Funding should also be made available to conduct research and development that will improve the technical, societal and environmental benefits of hydropower.  The Department should be directed to disperse appropriated money among these program areas as appropriate.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Photovoltaics: $100.0 Million</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">DOE research continues to bring costs down and performance up, fostering a domestic high-tech manufacturing base. However, the US is losing share to Japan and the EU in this rapidly growing market. A 2001 DOE Peer Review concluded that the PV program's work was : &quot;outstanding across all activities. doing an extremely effective job of setting priorities, balancing allocation of available resources, recognizing and addressing critical problems and barriers to progress and commercialization, and supporting the quality of work required to achieve its goals. The panel notes that the consistently high rankings assigned in this evaluation are very unusual, and they are also very deliberate. The panel believes this to be a truly outstanding element of the Department of Energy's programs.&quot; The cost-shared components have been experiencing particular success, doing cost-competitive research in coordination with industry, while keeping solar manufacturing in the United States.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">This program's competitive environment ensures rapid and cost-effective development and adoption of technologies that would not likely emerge otherwise. The Building Integrated PV program has attracted Administration notice. The FY 2003 Congressional Budget Document trumpets &quot;an exciting and rapidly growing solar application which will help cross the profit threshold that holds the key to significant growth.&quot; Meanwhile, the Thin Films Partnership continues to exceed their own worldwide efficiency records, with the real, near-term potential of cutting solar prices by half.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Concentrated Solar Power: $25.0 Million</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Concentrated Solar Power deserves serious consideration and support particularly as a bipartisan promotion of Southwestern Governors supporting a 1000 MW initiative. The advanced trough RD&amp;D program for electric power generation, absorption cooling and water and industrial process heating have shown immense promise and should be aggressively continued. Heat engine work focusing on validating the 1 MW deployment in Nevada of concentrated dish/Stirling engine as well as trough ORC needs broadening deployment, Technology validation of the new 1 MW solar trough/organic Rankin system in AZ and of the potential 50 MW power purchase agreement for solar trough electric generation in Nevada deserves high priority to increase market knowledge and acceptance. Finally, continued work on energy storage for all concentrated solar power technologies, including solar power tower, should received greater RD&amp;D attention and deployment.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Solar Heating and Lighting: $5.0 Million</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Formerly filed under the &quot;solar buildings&quot; heading, is Solar Heating and Lighting. Solar water heating technologies are utilized around the world in quantities far exceeding those in the US. Such systems can significantly reduce the consumption of electricity, and of natural gas - up to several percent in many countries. Within this program, emphasis will be placed on reducing the cost of solar water heating - the goal is to reduce the cost of solar water heating to 4&cent;/kWh in 2004.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Wind Power Technologies: $55 Million.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Funding would be focused on developing a next-generation wind turbine capable of operating in areas with lower wind speeds, thus expanding wind development potential by twenty times as well as allowing placement of turbines closer to existing transmission lines. Funding also would be used to study increased integration of wind energy into the nation's power grid.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In addition, there would be an enhanced focus on utilization of small wind turbines and wind hybrid systems for voltage line augmentation, back-up SCADA and other wireless controls and security, and other applications to strengthen electric grid reliability using distributed technologies.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Distributed Energy Resources: $76 Million</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">This program focuses on developing a variety of technologies that can produce power in buildings and industrial facilities and the additional technology required in integrating these together (and with renewable generation). The program focuses on Gas Turbines, Reciprocating Engines, Microturbines, and Thermally Activated Technologies that utilize waste heat and needs to expand significantly into integrating renewable options and hybrids. Aside from these technology areas, the program must focus on integrated and multi-technology and resource end uses such as fuel cells, desiccants, heat engines, turbines, and absorption chillers) in hybrid and combined heat and power applications. The focus is both on development of the technologies necessary for integration and development of actual packaged systems for customer use. These CHP applications can reach energy efficiencies of upwards of 80%, thereby eclipsing the efficiencies capable in any one technology alone.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Renewable Energy Production Incentive: $40 million</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Department of Energy's Renewable Energy Production Incentive (REPI) program was created by the 1992 Energy Policy Act to provide public power systems and rural electric cooperatives with a counterpart to the tax incentives that are available to for-profit utilities for renewable generation. Under the program, new solar, wind, geothermal, biomass and landfill gas projects are eligible to receive 1.8 cents per kWh of production, payable for ten years. The REPI program is invaluable to not-for profit utilities in helping them to make investments in these costly but critical resources. Over the past decade, however, REPI has been underfunded by more than $60 million. The REPI program must be fully funded to cover all eligible projects in order to realize its objective of spurring increased investment in renewable energy.  Short of providing full funding, the REPI program requires a minimum of $13 million in the E&amp;W bill for FY 2005.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">International Renewable Programs: $10 million</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Department of Energy has maintained a low level of activities in international areas, but in recent years has concentrated primarily on international research efforts of interest to the Department.  We recommend that the Department redirect its efforts towards working to enhance the competitive position of US based firms in international markets.  With the renewable markets being among the fastest growing in the world, DOE should be engaging in collaborative efforts with the Department of Commerce and US Agency for International Development to ensure that US renewable energy products and services are benefiting.  Moreover, simple technology cooperation by the Department without a corresponding understanding of how these efforts affect the competitiveness of US firms may lead to results that damage our country's interests.  Correspondingly, we propose that $10 million be provided for international efforts, and recommend that no less than $7 million of this total be used for efforts aimed at market development conducted collaboratively with other federal and state agencies and US industry.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Public Education:  $20 million</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Government alone cannot solve the nation&#146;s energy problems.  Gaining the cooperation of industry and the public to voluntarily take the action needed to improve energy efficiency and to purchase renewable energy products and technologies would greatly expedite the commercialization of sustainable energy options.  Before such actions can be taken, consumers must know what it is that they can do to help the nation and their communities.  Working with state and local governments and NGOs, and with the advice of the State Energy Advisory Board, the U. S. Department of Energy should be directed to initiate an energy education program to provide consumers with information they need to support sustainable energy development through voluntary action.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Renewable Energy Resource Assessment:  $5 million</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Resource assessment providing a detailed inventory of the amount and characteristics of the various renewable energy resources available is critical to making informed decisions about the potential development of these resources for a more diversified US energy portfolio.  Such assessments are needed on a regular basis to take into account changes in market conditions, available technologies, and other relevant conditions.  Such information is currently not available in an adequately detailed and up-to-date manner to assist decisionmakers.  The provision essentially calls for the inventory of renewable &#147;reserves&#148; similar to the extensive information collected by the federal government regarding fossil energy reserves.  This is an inexpensive investment that can have an enormous impact in leveraging future energy investments.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Conclusion</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">As President Bush recognized in his State of the Union address, we urgently need to develop domestic energy resources.  Each of the renewable energy technologies -- biomass, geothermal, hydropower, solar and wind -- have the potential to contribute enormous amounts of new, domestic energy to our economy.  It is time for Congress to put words into action, and fund the Department of Energy's renewable energy programs so they can achieve their full potential.  We hope our recommendations help you to realize this goal.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Thank you for considering our views.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Sincerely,</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">American Bioenergy Association, American Public Power Association, American Solar Energy Society, American Wind Energy Association, Bob Lawrence &amp; Associates, Breakthrough Technologies Institute, Burlington Electric Department, Business Council for Sustainable Energy, Cascade Associates, City &amp; County of San Francisco, Clean Fuels Development Coalition, Colorado Energy Group, Council for Photovoltaic Research, Environmental &amp; Energy Study Institute, Geothermal Energy Association, Interwest Energy Alliance, National Hydropower Association, New Uses Council, Potomac Resources, Sacramento Municipal Utility District, Solar Energy Industries Association, SustainableBusiness.com, The Stella Group Ltd., Updike, Kelly &amp; Spellacy, Vermont Energy Investment Corp.</FONT></P><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
