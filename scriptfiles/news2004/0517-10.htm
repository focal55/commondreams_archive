<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - May 17 - Today, Massachusetts takes a bold step toward equality for lesbians and gay men, as it becomes the first state to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;NOW leaders and members are overjoyed that thousands of committed couples will now be able to form legal families protected under law in Massachusetts,&quot; said NOW President Kim Gandy. &quot;Same-sex couples deserve the same marriage rights granted to opposite-sex couples, and NOW applauds the Massachusetts Supreme Court for recognizing that fact.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Last November, and again in February, the Massachusetts court determined that the equal protection clause of the Massachusetts Constitution called for full-fledged marriage rights--and nothing less--for same-sex couples. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;However, progress cannot stop at the Massachusetts borders,&quot; said Gandy. &quot;Same-sex couples in all 50 states and the District of Columbia must be allowed to share in the rights and responsibilities available to opposite-sex couples. And full federal and state benefits must be extended to the millions of lesbian and gay couples who wish to marry.&quot; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Heterosexual married couples are afforded over 1,000 legal protections and benefits in state and federal law which are inaccessible to committed same-sex couples. Benefits of civil marriage include access to health insurance and medical decision-making for your partner and your children; parenting rights; Social Security; tax deductions and exemptions, inheritance rights and other government benefits; as well as the simple ability to pool resources to buy or transfer property without adverse tax treatment.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The U.S. Congress and George W. Bush are threatening to permanently withhold these rights from same-sex couples by writing discrimination into the U.S. Constitution.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;My family is no different from any other family,&quot; said NOW Action Vice President Olga Vives, a longtime activist for lesbian rights. &quot;We are all looking out for the health, safety, happiness and legitimate recognition of our families. Same-sex marriage rights can only make this country stronger by making every family everywhere stronger.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">For more information: <A HREF="http://www.now.org/issues/lgbi/marr-rep-2.html" TARGET="_new">Same-Sex Marriage is a Feminist Issue</A></FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
