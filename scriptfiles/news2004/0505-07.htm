<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - May 5 - More than nine percent of ConocoPhillips shareholders today voted in favor of an Arctic Refuge shareholder resolution at the company's annual meeting today in Houston, Texas. The vote ensures that the Arctic Refuge resolution will be voted on again at next year's annual meeting.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;9.25 percent of the owners of the second-largest oil company operating in Alaska just called on ConocoPhillips to stay out of the Arctic Refuge,&quot; said Athan Manuel, author of the resolution and director of the U.S. PIRG Education Fund's Arctic Wilderness Campaign. &quot;From shareholders to Senators, more and more people understand that the Arctic Refuge is a special place that should be protected, not plundered.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The resolution was filed by Green Century Capital Management and co-filed by the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate, Grand Rapids Dominican Sisters, NWCRI, and Socially Responsible Investment Coalition. This is the first Arctic Refuge shareholder resolution ever filed with ConocoPhillips. A first-year resolution needs a minimum of 3.5 percent of the vote in order to be re-filed the following year. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Last month, at its annual meeting, BP announced that drilling in the Arctic Refuge is not part of its current business plan, and in 2002, BP dropped out of Arctic Power, the industry-funded lobbying group that lobbies in support of drilling in the Arctic Refuge. BP and ConocoPhillips are the two biggest oil companies operating on Alaska's North Slope. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;We call on ConocoPhillips to acknowledge the strong shareholder support for protecting the Arctic Refuge,&quot; said Michael Leone of Green Century Capital Management. &quot;Drilling in the Arctic Refuge poses a significant risk to shareholder value, and we look forward to negotiating with ConocoPhillips on canceling their drilling plans or at least dropping out of Arctic Power.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">At the annual meeting, Leone delivered a letter to ConocoPhillips CEO J.J. Mulva urging the company to drop out of Arctic Power. Ten institutional investors and activists from across North America signed on to the letter.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><I>U.S. PIRG is the national lobbying office for the state Public Interest Research Groups. PIRGs are nonpartisan, nonprofit environmental and consumer advocacy organizations that are active across the country.</I></FONT></P><P><I><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Green Century Capital Management is the administrator of the first family of no-load, environmentally responsible mutual funds, the Green Century Funds. Green Century was founded by nonprofit environmental advocacy organizations. </FONT></I></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
