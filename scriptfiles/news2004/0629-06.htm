<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - June 29 - Win Without War, the nation&#146;s largest antiwar coalition, called the Bush administration&#146;s so-called hand-over of sovereignty to Iraq a &#147;deadly deception&#148;, the equivalent of the President&#146;s historic &#147;mission accomplished&#148; declaration on board the USS Lincoln on October 9, 2003.  </FONT></p><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The coalition ran a full-page ad in the New York Times today outlining how the fundamentals of the US military occupation in Iraq have not changed and why the highly touted &#147;handover&#148; will  make matters worse by raising false expectations that will lead to insurgency -- fueling disappointment, resentment and anger.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Former Congressman Tom Andrews, National Director of Win Without War said, &#147;yesterday was not a &#145;day of great hope` for Iraq, as President Bush claimed, it was a day of great hype designed for the presidential election season.&#148;</FONT></P><P> </P><P> <FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;The only true power in Iraq is the 138,000 American soldiers, commanded by US officers.  These troops will be able to go where they want and do what they want whenever they want, whether the &#147;sovereign&#148; Iraqi authorities like it or not,&#148; said Andrews. </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The coalition asserted that yesterday&#146;s handover and the false expectations it could generate will  make America less safe by:</FONT></P><P> </P><UL><LI><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Fueling the insurgency in Iraq and terrorism world-wide;</FONT></LI><LI><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">         Weakening America by diminishing our credibility even further while continuing to isolate us from our allies.</FONT></LI></UL><P> </P><P> <FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;The price of this government-by-hype will be the bitterness Iraqis and Americans will feel when their inflated expectations once again crash on the rocks of Iraq reality&#133;this is what terrorists thrive on and why America continues to lose credibility with the rest of the world,&#148; said Andrews.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Some of the reality being hidden by the hype include:</FONT></P><UL><LI><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Every US soldier, Coalition employee and private contractor will be immune from Iraq law &#150; Halliburton and its employees will remain above Iraqi law;</FONT></LI><LI><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Iraqis will continue to live under US edicts &#150; covering everything from tax law to crime to foreign policy &#150; designed to perpetuate US power for years to come;</FONT></LI><LI><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The US will continue to control the Republican Palace-Iraq&#146;s White House &#150; despite the demand of Iraq&#146;s new &#147;sovereign&#148; president for the Americans to hand it over;</FONT></LI><LI><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">US taxpayers will continue to pay more than all of the coalition nations combined for Iraq security and reconstruction by a margin of 120 to 1;</FONT></LI><LI><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The majority of Iraqis want US troops to leave Iraq, believing that they are an obstacle to their security &#150; not a source of it.</FONT></LI></UL><P> </P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">A year and a half ago the coalition cautioned that a pre-emptive war in Iraq would make America less safe while costing the taxpayers billions.  To date, 857 American soldiers have been killed and the taxpayers have spent over $150 billion.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">View the Ad at <A HREF="http://www.winwithoutwarus.org" TARGET="_new">www.winwithoutwarus.org</A></FONT></P><P> </P><P></P><P><B><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Today, You Still Own Iraq </FONT></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Ad Copy, Sourced</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">MoveOn.org &amp; Win Without War</FONT></P><P> </P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Prior to the invasion of Iraq, Secretary of State Colin Powell reportedly warned President Bush that if he invaded Iraq, &quot;you'll own it all.&#148; [1]  Powell was right. The idea that Iraq achieved sovereignty yesterday is as false as the President&#146;s insistence Iraq had weapons of mass destruction.[2]  Or that our mission was accomplished.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Sovereignty? Today, 138,000[3] American troops are stationed in Iraq. And more may be requested.[4]  The only true power for the foreseeable future will remain those U.S. soldiers, commanded by U.S. officers. This is the definition of occupation, and it will continue to inflame the insurgency.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">We own it. And we&#146;re paying for it. So far, more than $150 billion,[5] and the requests for more just keep coming.[6]</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The old Republican Palace &#150; Iraq&#146;s White House -- is becoming part of the new U.S. embassy,[7] the largest in the world.[8]  This despite an Iraqi government demand[9] that we return the palace to them. (Incidentally, $184 million in embassy construction costs were diverted from programs for safe Iraqi drinking water.)[10]</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Handover? Hardly. Every U.S. soldier, Coalition employee and private contractor will be immune from Iraqi law.[11]  And we&#146;re leaving behind more than 100 U.S. edicts[12] -- covering everything from crime to foreign affairs -- designed to perpetuate U.S. power for years to come.[13]</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Iraqis looking for leadership free from U.S. control will also be sorely disappointed. Prime Minister Iyad Allawi has been on the CIA payroll for years.[14]  Maybe that&#146;s why, in a recent independent poll,[15] Iraqis rated him 16th among 17 of that country&#146;s potential leaders. Last in the poll: the new President Ghazi Ajil al-Yawar.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Perhaps someday, Iraqis truly will enjoy sovereign control of their country. We fervently hope so. In the mean time, yesterday&#146;s hurried handoff is looking more like a fumble. </FONT></P><P></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">[1] Woodward, Bob.  <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/074325547X/commondreams-20/ref=nosim/" TARGET="_new">Plan of Attack</A>.
