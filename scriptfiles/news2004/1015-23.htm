<p>CHINA - October 15 - The possible commercialisation of genetically engineered rice (GE) in China next year is a serious threat to the food safety of the world?s most populous nation, Greenpeace warned today, on the eve of World Food Day.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The possible commercialisation of genetically engineered rice (GE) in China next year is a serious threat to the food safety of the world's most populous nation, Greenpeace warned today, on the eve of World Food Day.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A Chinese scientist involved in the approval process for GE crops in China has told Greenpeace that GE rice cultivation is near.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;While the world is set to celebrate 'Biodiversity for Food Security' on World Food Day tomorrow, few people know that a handful of GE scientists and Chinese government officials are about to jeopardize China's biodiversity, which is fundamental to its agriculture and food, and that GE rice is set to reach China?s rice bowls as soon as next year,&quot; said Sze Pang Cheung, Campaign Manager of Greenpeace China. &quot;This is scandalous; rice is the staple diet for most Chinese people and more than 100 million people rely on it for their livelihoods.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A new report from Greenpeace explains how the commercialisation of GE rice in China threatens the rich biodiversity of local rice varieties. China is the birthplace of rice and still possesses one of the richest genetic resources of rice in the world, with more than 75,000 varieties. If GE rice is grown in the field, it is bound to contaminate local varieties, as seen in Mexico with GE maize.. Research by Chinese scientists has found that the pollen of GE rice may spread as far as 110 meters at high wind speeds. Furthermore, if China proceeds with the commercialization of GE rice, it is likely that other Asian countries, notably Thailand and India, will follow shortly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;GE rice poses risks to human health and irreversible environmental threats. It can reproduce and interbreed with natural organisms spreading to new environments and future generations in an unpredictable and uncontrollable way,&quot; Sze said.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2004 is the UN's International Year of Rice. 'Rice is Life', recognizes that rice is the most important crop for almost 3000 million people in the world. &quot;Rice is life, but GE rice will gamble with lives. And it is a gamble with no way back. The future of rice should stay in the hands of those for whom rice is life, not a few GE scientists and officials,&quot; concluded Sze.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Tomorrow, Greenpeace will launch &quot;The Rice is Life Tour&quot; in Yunnan province which has the richest diversity of rice in China.</font></p>
