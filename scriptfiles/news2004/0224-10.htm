<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">MONTPELIER, VT - February 24 - In the heat of the final week before the mid-session crossover deadline, votes are expected on genetic engineering in both chambers of the Vermont legislature. GE Free VT and National Family Farm Coalition campaigners testified to the Senate Agriculture and Judiciary committees this morning to say, &#147;One Contaminated Farm is One Too Many!&#148; Citing yesterday&#146;s landmark report by the Union of Concerned Scientists showing that federal regulations have failed to prevent contamination by GMOs, advocates showed Vermont lawmakers heirloom organic corn seed from Jack Lazor&#146;s Butterworks farm in Troy, Vermont. </FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Butterworks farmer Jack Lazor was the first organic dairier in the state of Vermont, and Lazor hopes that lawmakers will understand the threat of genetic engineering to his saved seed and vote for a Time Out on GMOs. He gave the seed to Amy Shollenberger of Rural Vermont, who testified in the Senate Agriculture committee this morning with a ceramic bowl full of the golden seed kernels. &#147;Jack said he felt lucky because none of his neighbors are growing GMOs, so he is still able to save his seed without threat of contamination. I am asking you&#151;how much longer will he and other farmers in Vermont and around the world be able to do this?&#148; she asked. Looking at the seeds, she urged, &#147;We know that one farm in Vermont has been contaminated. One contaminated farm is one too many. We cannot afford to risk any more.&#148; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Bill Wenzel, GE campaign director from the National Family Farm Coalition, testified in house and senate committees this morning. &#147;GE crops have resulted in higher costs of production, lower yields in herbicide tolerant varieties, loss of foreign markets, increased use of pesticides, and expensive lawsuits. These problems are compounded by contamination,&#148; he said. &#147;Since Vermont&#146;s economic health is predicated on the vitality and quality of its agriculture, a two-year moratorium on planting GE seeds provides the time necessary to review and assess the impact of these technologies on the family farmers, rural communities, and the overall well- being of the state. I would ask that you pass S.162, the Time Out on GMOs.&#148; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">GE Free VT campaigners shared copies of the new contamination study by the Union of Concerned Scientists with Vermont lawmakers. UCS that revealed federal USDA regulations have failed to protect seeds and the food supply from transgenic contamination by genetically engineered crops. This finding confirms that a Time Out is the common sense solution to a technology that is moving faster than politics-as-usual.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Corporate lobbyists from Monsanto will be testifying Thursday in the House Agriculture committee from 9 AM-12 noon. The GE Free VT Campaign anticipates a strong turn out for an 11:00 AM march to the statehouse and 12:00 noon rally on the statehouse lawn. Messages of support from farmer and consumer groups continue to come in from around the world as eyes are on Vermont this week to make a stand against the corporate biotech industry and for family farmers, safe food, and the environment.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The GE Free Vermont Campaign on Genetic Engineering is a statewide coalition of public interest groups, businesses, concerned citizens and farmers, who are organizing to oppose genetic engineering at the local, state and national level, and calling for a &#147;Time Out&#148; on GMOs.

Many believe it could also gravely harm the domestic market for organic food -- one of the fastest-growing and more lucrative segments of U.S. agriculture.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">And with a growing number of crop varieties now being engineered to produce not just agricultural chemicals, but also potent pharmaceutical and industrial products in their leaves and stems, future incidents of cross-contamination may pose even more serious health and economic risks, the report warns.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;No one wants drugs or plastics in our cornflakes,&quot; said Margaret Mellon, director of the food and environment program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, an environmental and health group that has taken a skeptical stance toward agricultural biotechnology but is generally respected by experts for hewing to science. &quot;Left unchecked, this is a problem that will hurt the U.S. economically, and perhaps even affect our health.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The 70-page report, &quot;Gone to Seed,&quot; recommends that the agriculture department conduct a thorough assessment of the extent of genetic contamination of the U.S. seed industry.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The report also calls for tighter restrictions on the outdoor planting of crops engineered to make drugs and industrial products. It suggests that reservoirs of still-pure seed stocks for major crops be set aside immediately as an &quot;insurance policy&quot; in case gene-altered varieties prove to be environmentally or medically harmful.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Industry officials said the findings were predictable. &quot;We were not surprised by this report . . . knowing that pollen travels and commodity grains might commingle at various places and you may have some mixing in transport or storage,&quot; said Lisa Dry, communications director for the Biotechnology Industry Association. Rather than pursue the unrealistic goal of trying to keep seeds completely free of genetic contaminants, she and other industry representatives said, the United States should work harder to get European and other nations -- many of which have balked at engineered crops and foods -- to be more accepting of the technology.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;It's important for countries around the world to adopt a uniform standard&quot; of acceptable levels of contamination, Dry said.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Dick Crowder, president of the Alexandria-based American Seed Trade Association, agreed, saying he believes U.S. regulators are doing an adequate job of keeping the food supply safe.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Food and Drug Administration and the Department of Agriculture have been developing standards to keep unwanted engineered products out of the food supply. Spokesmen from both agencies said yesterday they would review the report.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Whatever their significance, the findings indicate a remarkable degree of inadvertent DNA redistribution since American farmers started growing genetically engineered crops on a commercial scale eight years ago. Most of the varieties in use today have either a bacterial gene that helps the plant fight insect pests or a gene that makes the crop resistant to a popular weed killer.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> Hundreds of other varieties are in testing. The group could not search for many of those possible contaminants, because more than half of their DNA sequences are trade secrets.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Engineered crops remain highly restricted in Japan, Europe and other regions of the world, but they have become popular with American farmers and accepted by most U.S. consumers. In recent years, about 80 percent of all soy grown in this country has been genetically engineered, as is most canola and about 40 percent of all corn.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Non-engineered products are generally mixed with engineered varieties, except when they are aimed at certain foreign or specialty markets. But plants that are grown specifically to replenish the nation's supply of conventional seeds are carefully segregated to retain their purity and are used to produce &quot;certified&quot; commercial grade seed.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Mellon's group bought certified soy, corn and canola seeds and had six popular varieties of each tested for contaminating DNA sequences at two different laboratories that specialize in such tests -- GeneScan USA of Belle Chasse, La., and Biogenetic Services of Brookings, S.D.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The first lab found engineered DNA in half the corn and soy varieties and in all six of the canola. The second lab, which was given larger amounts with which to work, got positive results on five of six varieties for all three crops.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The molecular test used, known as PCR, is extremely sensitive and is a standard workhorse of molecular biology today, though its use in plant materials is still being perfected. Although PCR does not do a good job of estimating amounts, the scientists estimated that probably 0.05 percent to 1 percent of each batch's total DNA was engineered DNA.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">It remains unclear to what extent the contamination is biological -- the result of pollen spread in the field -- or mechanical, from inadvertent commingling of conventional seeds with engineered seeds in farm equipment or in storage areas, Mellon said.</FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
