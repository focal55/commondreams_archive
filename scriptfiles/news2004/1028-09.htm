<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NEW YORK -- October 28 -- Gloria Grow, Founder and Director of the <a href="http://www.faunafoundation.org/" target="_new">Fauna Foundation</a>, a Montreal-based sanctuary for abused and neglected animals, will speak at an event sponsored by the <a href="http://www.neavs.org/" target="_new">New England Anti-Vivisection Society</a> (NEAVS).</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;In Their Own Words: Stories of Chimpanzees Rescued from Research,&quot; a lecture and &quot;virtual&quot; tour of the Fauna Sanctuary, will be held on Thursday, Oct. 28, from 7 to 9:30 p.m. at the Park Central Hotel, 870 Seventh Avenue at 56th Street.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1997, Fauna rescued 15 chimpanzees from the Laboratory for Experimental Medicine and Surgery in Primates. Today - in the care of Grow, her partner, Richard Allan, D.V.M., and staff - these chimps are recovering from years of pain, fear and trauma. The sanctuary, which occupies 300 acres outside of Montreal, has constructed spacious chimpanzee quarters, complete with decks, overhead chutes for traveling from place to place around the sanctuary; and handicap-accessible railing and ramps.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Having spent most of their lives confined to individual steel cages in a sterile laboratory, the Fauna chimpanzees are now being successfully introduced to group life. They are treated with respect and dignity while enjoying a caring and enriching environment. Through Gloria's stories and through video, the audience will meet the chimpanzees and hear the moving and inspiring stories of their recovery and re-socialization.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Says Dr. Theo Capaldo, NEAVS' President, &quot;We want to inspire people to help end the use of chimpanzees in research. This event promises to bring us a step closer to understanding our 'next of kin.' That knowledge, in turn, will bring us closer to the day when all chimpanzees are freed from all laboratories everywhere.&quot; Founded in Boston in 1895, NEAVS helps fund Fauna and other chimpanzee sanctuaries in the United States including the Center for Captive Chimpanzee Care, home to former &quot;space chimps&quot; and 266 rescued chimpanzees from the notorious laboratory, the Coulston Foundation.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NEAVS invites all to meet Ms. Grow as she shares her unique perspectives on the human-chimpanzee relationship, the effects of their captivity, and their struggles to put the atrocities of their pasts behind them</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
