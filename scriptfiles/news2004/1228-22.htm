<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- December 28 -- In dozens of American  communities this New Year's Eve, overexcited and under- intelligent individuals will welcome 2005 with an act of  stupidity. They may kill an innocent in the bargain, too.</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">   <a href="http://www.bradycampaign.org/" target="_new">The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence</a> and the <a href="http://www.millionmommarch.org/" target="_new">Million Mom  March</a> are joining with America's police departments to urge  Americans not to engage in what police call &quot;celebratory gunfire&quot;  -- the indiscriminate unloading of weapons into the air. On New  Year's Eve and Independence Day each year, scores of people place  others at risk of injury or death as a result of celebratory  gunfire. When a bullet is fired into the air, the bullet has to  come down somewhere.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">   The practice of celebratory gunfire has been a problem in  cities like Miami, New Orleans, Phoenix and Los Angeles and in  towns along the U.S. and Mexico border. Last year, it became such  a problem in Puerto Rico that U.S. Centers for Disease Control  and Prevention were called in for advice.</font></p><p>   <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Every police group in America supports national and local  efforts to educate citizens on the dangers of celebratory  gunfire,&quot; said John Shanks, Law Enforcement Relations Director  for Brady and the Million Moms. &quot;Every police officer in America  would urge people not to do something as reckless as this.&quot;</font></p><p>   <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It makes no sense whatsoever to fire a weapon into the air,  not knowing where the bullet may fall. This is probably the most  unsafe, crazy practice people engage in on New Year's Eve,&quot; said  Steve Lenkart of the International Brotherhood of Police  Officers. And Curt Lavarello, Executive Director for the National  Association of School Resource Officers said, &quot;It would be  horrific if one of our students did not return to school after  the winter break because of this type of reckless behavior with  firearms.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">   Four years ago, Phoenix, Arizona enacted Shannon's Law, in  memory of 14-year-old Shannon Smith, killed by a stray bullet in  June 1999 while talking on her phone in her back yard. The law  makes it a felony to fire a gun into the air within the city  limits. Yet in 2003, there were still 95 cases of random gunfire  successfully prosecuted in the city of Phoenix.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">   How dangerous can it get? Consider one of the risks facing  America's service men and women in Iraq. Last November,  celebratory gunfire in Baghdad following the death of Saddam  Hussein's two sons cost 31 Iraqis their lives, including two  young children. Seventy-six others were wounded.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable --></td></tr>
