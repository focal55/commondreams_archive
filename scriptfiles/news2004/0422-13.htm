<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">SAINT LOUIS, MO - April 22 -   We read, with dismay and anger, in the April 22 Seattle Times, of the firing of Tami Silicio and David Landry from Maytag Aircraft for taking a picture of flag-draped coffins in a military transport aircraft and allowing its publication. Tami is said to have hoped &quot;the publication of the photo would help families of fallen soldiers understand the care and devotion that civilians and military crews dedicate to the task of returning the soldiers home.&quot;</FONT></p><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Veterans For Peace do not believe Tami and David deserve firing for performing an act of pure compassion from which no profit was derived - in contrast, we may say, to organizations like Halliburton, Kellogg, Brown &amp; Root, Dyne Corp, and their former employer, Maytag Aircraft who are doing very well as the result of the conduct of this war. </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">On the contrary, Tami Silicio and David Landry have earned our gratitude for calling attention to the artificial barrier, erected by the Pentagon, against images that poignantly and properly impress us with the deaths of our nation's children and the sacrifices of their families.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">We believe that no policy should stand between our citizens and access to the price they are paying for this war. We believe the Iraqi dead should be seen, counted and acknowledged. We believe our wounded should be allowed to engage the services of organizations designed to help them, like the Disabled American Veterans, who have had such difficulty gaining access. We believe people should be constantly reminded of the lost lives of combatants and non-combatants, of money spent, of international goodwill wasted.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Veterans For Peace, consistent with our statement of purpose which says &quot;We, having dutifully served our nation, do hereby affirm our greater responsibility to serve the cause of world peace..&quot;, believe that an informed public, having knowledge of the true cost of war, is less apt to allow government to use war as an instrument of foreign policy.</FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
