<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">RESTON, VA - January 20 - The American Medical Student Association (AMSA), the nation's largest, independent medical student organization, issues a call for a single payer health care system in response to &quot;Insuring America's Health: Principles and Recommendations,&quot; the Institute of Medicine (IOM) report on America's uninsured. The report, the final in a series of six, is the first by the IOM to formally recommend the United States guarantee health insurance for every citizen, an initiative that AMSA has supported since 1950. </FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Over 43 million Americans go without health insurance. Millions more are underinsured and unable to afford needed services, particularly medications. One in seven Americans, 80 percent of whom are from working families, lack health insurance and consequently risk suffering unnecessary illness and premature death. The report states that to prevent unnecessary illness, death and economic costs to society the United States must find a way to provide universal health insurance coverage by 2010. </FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">AMSA wants to make universal health care a reality by 2005. AMSA believes that equal access to comprehensive health care is a fundamental human right and building on the IOM's recommendations, urges Congress to pass the Health Care Access Resolution (H.Con.Res 99/S.Con.Res. 41), which calls for Congress to enact health care reform that will provide &quot;access to comprehensive health services for all Americans by 2005.&quot; In the 107th Congress, there were 96 co-sponsors of the House version of HCAR. </FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;As a leading advocate for universal health care, AMSA believes that HCAR will be a unifying vehicle for universal health care with bipartisan support,&quot; says Lauren Oshman, M.D., M.P.H., AMSA National President. &quot;While most people agree that it is a basic human right to have health care, many disagree on how to provide such in America today.&quot; AMSA also supports a single payer system as their choice for how to implement universal coverage in the United States, specifically the National Health Insurance Act (H.R. 676), which would control escalating health care costs by eliminating wasteful administrative costs and prioritizing prevention and public health. AMSA urges Congress to keep their promise for advancing efforts to extend health insurance to the nation's uninsured. </FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">According to CongressDaily, Senators at a Democratic Policy Committee hearing [last week] proposed advancing efforts to extend health insurance to the nation's 43.6 million uninsured residents. In the article, Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) was quoted as saying 2004 is the year to end America's health care crisis. For over fifty years, AMSA has advocated on behalf of universal health care, both on a federal and state level. Medical students around the nation are mobilizing on legislation and other grassroots activities around universal health care initiatives during AMSA's Health Care Justice Week, which will take place February 16-20th</FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">.
