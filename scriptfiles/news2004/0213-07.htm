<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - February 13 - The United States Senate passed the federal transportation bill last night, retaining a provision that will reduce water pollution caused by federal roads, conservationists said today.  </FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The stormwater provision of the transportation bill earmarks a portion of federal highway spending -- $958 million over the next six years -- to retrofit federally funded roads to years to reduce the amount of polluted stormwater rushing into nearby streams, river, and lakes. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Most people know that cars cause air pollution, the Senate has recognized that roads cause water pollution,&quot; said Rebecca R. Wodder, president of American Rivers. &quot;We applaud Senators Warner and Chaffee for their leadership to secure this important change in how federal transportation dollars are spent.&quot; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">A portion of federal transportation spending has long been directed to reducing the amount of air pollution associated with federal roads.  Senators John Warner (R-VA) and Lincoln Chaffee (R-RI) introduced a provision into this year's bill that would set aside four pennies out of every ten dollars of federal highway spending to reduce water pollution. The provision was supported by a broad coalition of environmental and &quot;smart-growth&quot; advocates, state water pollution control agencies, floodplain managers, and water and sewer authorities. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;We urge the House of Representatives will act quickly to write a similar provision into their version of the bill,&quot; Wodder said.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The more acres of concrete and asphalt there are in a watershed, the more rain and melting snow is routed into nearby streams and rivers as stormwater. Stormwater carries pollutants such as de-icing chemicals, automotive fluids and fragments, salt, nutrients, and sediment into local waters. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In many urban and suburban areas, stormwater is the leading  source of water pollution. Polluted runoff can be reduced by retrofitting roads and re-landscaping shoulders and medians to create holding areas that capture stormwater and allow it to filter through the soil instead of washing directly into nearby streams, rivers, and lakes. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">According to the American Highway Users Alliance, there are 956,000 miles of federal interstates and surface roads in the United States, amounting to some 9.4 million acres of pavement. Using conservative assumptions, conservationists estimate that this pavement generates enough stormwater to send surprisingly large amounts of pollution into America's waters, including:  </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">More than 150 million pounds of nitrogen and more than 16 million pounds of phosphorous which can cause algae blooms and &quot;dead zones&quot; in lakes and bays</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">More than 3 million tons of stream-choking sediment</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">More than 13 million pounds of zinc and other toxic heavy metals</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">American Rivers warned however, that there is still much to dislike about the transportation bill as a whole. The bill that passed the Senate yesterday contains troubling provisions that would reduce the quality of the environmental analyses conducted before federal roadwork begins. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In particular, one provision would shorten the horizon for examining potential increases in air pollution from 20 years to just 10. Another would set unrealistic deadlines for completing studies of the full range of water pollution, air pollution, and other consequences of highway construction, denying the public access to accurate information about these impacts to their communities.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;We applaud the Senate for recognizing the federal contribution to water pollution in states, but we withhold judgment on the bill as a whole until we see the final product that comes out of Congress,&quot; Wodder said.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">State breakdowns of stormwater funding are available at:<A HREF="http://www.amrivers.org/docs/stormwaterreductionfundingbystate.pdf" TARGET="_new"> http://www.amrivers.org/docs/stormwaterreductionfundingbystate.pdf</A></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">State estimates of the amount of water pollution created by federal roads are available at: <A HREF="http://www.amrivers.org/docs/estimatedpollutionfromfederalroadsbystate.pdf" TARGET="_new">http://www.amrivers.org/docs/estimatedpollutionfromfederalroadsbystate.pdf</A></FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
