<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AUSTIN, Texas -  September 10 - As questions continue to mount over President George W. Bush&#146;s service record during the Vietnam War, <a href="http://www.texansfortruth.org">Texans for Truth</a> will announce a substantial reward to anyone who can offer proof supporting Bush&#146;s claim that he fulfilled his service in the Alabama Air National Guard in 1972 by reporting for duties and drills at all the times he was required. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The announcement comes on the heels of a new advertisement released earlier this week by Texans for Truth, which featured former lieutenant colonel Bob Mintz saying he never saw Bush during the time the President says he served on a Montgomery, Alabama base for the Alabama Air National Guard, despite the fact that he was looking for Bush. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Bush&#146;s dishonesty about missing from service during Vietnam goes to the heart of his presidency,&#148; said Glenn Smith of Texans for Truth.  &#147;He was dishonest then just as he was dishonest leading us into a war with Iraq. He dodged his responsibility then, just as he dodges responsibility for the loss of over 1,000 soldiers in Iraq.</font></p>
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;George W. Bush continues to be dishonest, dodging the truth about his military record. We&#146;ll continue our search for the truth next Tuesday by announcing a major award for anyone who can prove George W. Bush fulfilled his military service in Alabama during the height of the Vietnam War.&#148; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Meanwhile, veteran accounts, Pentagon records and Bush campaign statements challenge Bush&#146;s own account of his service. In his 1999 autobiography A Charge to Keep, George W. Bush wrote that, &#147;I continued flying with my unit for the next several years.&quot; That now appears to be dishonest and misleading. Undisputed Pentagon records and Bush campaign accounts now say Bush stopped flying in early 1972, just before he went missing from service for several months.  Bush hasn&#146;t been able to explain the discrepancy. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Regarding Karl Rove spin that CBS News released falsified records, Smith responded, &#147;the CBS records are insightful, but irrelevant compared to statements that Bush pulled strings to avoid combat duty during Vietnam and the accounts of dozens of veterans from the Alabama Air Guard who say he never showed up.&#148;  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHAT:          Telephone press conference to announce reward for proof that Bush fulfilled his service in the Alabama Air National Guard in 1972-1973.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> WHO:            Glenn Smith, Texans for Truth</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> WHEN:          Tuesday, September 14, 2004, 11:30 a.m., EST</font></p>
