<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - January 12 - The Green Party of the United States formally announced its 2004 National Nominating Convention, to take place in Milwaukee, Wisconsin from June 23 to 28, 2004.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The event will take place at the Midwest Center, Milwaukee Theater, and the Milwaukee Hyatt Regency.  The party has posted an online registration page, with early registration encouraged <A HREF="https://secure.gpus.org/convention/" TARGET="_new">https://secure.gpus.org/convention/</A>.  Media representatives may register at this site; a media credentialing web page will be posted shortly.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;We're looking forward to selecting a presidential candidate, and also to promoting Green congressional, state, and local candidates when we meet in Milwaukee,&quot; said Lynne Serpe, co-chair of the Annual National Meeting Committee.  &quot;We experienced rapid growth in the years following the 2000 campaign, so the challenge for the next four years is to continue growing, getting more state and local Green candidates elected, and establishing ourselves as a lasting noncorporate, independent party.  We're not only opposed to what President Bush stands for -- we oppose the what this entire political system stands for.  We're here to join Democrats and Republicans on the political stage and to replace them in public office.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Four candidates have declared their intention to compete nationally in the Green Party presidential primaries: David Cobb (CA), Paul Glover (NY), Kent Mesplay (CA), and Lorna Salzman (NY).  Two candidates will have their names entered as 'favorite son' and ''favorite daughter' candidates exclusively on their own state's ballots: Peter Camejo in California; Carol Miller in New Mexico.  The first primary will take place on Tuesday, January 13 in the District of Columbia.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;We are very excited to host the 2004 Nominating Convention of the Green Party of the United States here in Milwaukee,&quot; said Ruth Weill, Milwaukee Green and co-chair of the Annual National Meeting Committee.  &quot;Wisconsin has a long history of progressive politics and we are furthering this tradition while building the Green movement.  The Green Party is about real people providing real choices in the political arena.  We want to give government back to the citizens of this country and restore democracy.&quot;</FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
