<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - August 24 - Moving Ideas, the leading source for progressive public policy on the net, has released in depth analysis and resources on the politics of welfare, jobs, earnings, and families.  As a companion to The American Prospect's September Special Report, Bridging the Two Americas: The Politics of Welfare, Jobs, Earnings, and Families, Moving Ideas offers links to reports, facts, resources, and primary sources relating to work and income issues.  </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report focuses on America's failure to provide low-income workers with adequate wages or the tools they need to ascend the career ladder.  From welfare rules that don't provide adequate funding for family support services such as childcare to a dearth of corporate programs that provide flexibility to their workers -- this report delves into problems with our current support system for low-income workers and discusses possible solutions that would truly lift the poor out of poverty.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Moving Ideas resource compilation provides links to these reports, fact sheets, documents and more: .  The articles in The American Prospect's special report .  A Center for Law and Social Policy report on how distribution of employment and welfare support services could be combined and simplified to help low-wage workers navigate program qualifications and paperwork. .  The State of America's Children 2004 from the Children's Defense Fund .  Facts about working women from the AFL-CIO's Working Women Department .  Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) documents and resources from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">View the entire article at <a href="http://www.movingideas.org/issuesindepth/work_income.html" target="_new">http://www.movingideas.org/issuesindepth/work_income.html</a></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
