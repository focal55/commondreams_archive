<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - May 3 - This week, students across the nation served members of the Dow Chemical Board of Directors with an <A HREF="http://www.bhopal.net/article.php?pid=102" TARGET="_new">official summons</A> issued by the Indian Government for Dow&#146;s wholly-owned subsidiary, Union Carbide, to appear for trial in India. The actions were organized by Students for Bhopal as part of an intensifying student movement against Dow, the first since the Vietnam War. The summons, associated with the world&#146;s worst industrial tragedy, the Bhopal disaster, was first published in the Washington Post on February 21st, 1992. </FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">On December 3rd, 1984, a toxic cloud of gas from the Union Carbide plant in Bhopal, India, enveloped the surrounding city, leaving thousands dead. More than 20,000 have died to date and more than 120,000 people still suffer from severe health problems as a result of their exposure. None of Union Carbide&#146;s six safety systems were functional on the night of the disaster. In 1991 both Union Carbide&#146;s former CEO, Warren Anderson, and the corporation itself were charged in Indian courts with culpable homicide, or manslaughter, in connection with the disaster. However neither Anderson nor Union Carbide have appeared to stand trial, and both have been declared &#147;absconders,&#148; or fugitives from justice, by the Indian Government. Dow purchased Union Carbide in 2001. </FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Dow, as the 100% owner of the Union Carbide Corporation, has the exclusive ability to ensure that Union Carbide appears for trial; its continuing refusal to do so is the legal equivalent of harboring a fugitive. Last year <A HREF="http://www.studentsforbhopal.org/Congress.Letter.pdf" TARGET="_new">18 members of the US Congress</A> wrote that Dow&#146;s actions &#147;expose&#133;a blatant disregard for the law&#148; and urged the company to ensure the appearance of a Union Carbide representative before the Chief Judicial Magistrate&#146;s court in Bhopal. Dow has refused. Should Union Carbide be found guilty of the criminal charges in Bhopal, it could be sentenced to a fine which has no upper limit.     </FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> Students from two dozen colleges and universities nationwide participated in the action, mailing and hand-delivering more than two hundred copies of the official paperwork to the homes of thirteen of Dow&#146;s fifteen Board Members. Copies of the Congressional letter on Bhopal and the testimonial of a Bhopal gas victim were also delivered. </FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The action precedes the May 13 Dow Shareholder&#146;s Meeting, at which a resolution on Bhopal is due for a vote, and closely follows the announcement that two gas victims from Bhopal, Rashida Bee and Champa Devi Shukla, have been awarded the <A HREF="http://www.goldmanprize.org/" TARGET="_new">Goldman Environmental Prize</A>, known as the Nobel Prize for the Environment. <A HREF="http://www.innovestgroup.com/" TARGET="_new">Innovest Strategic Value Advisors Inc</A>., a global leader in the analysis of investment risk, issued a <A HREF="http://www.innovestgroup.com/publications.htm" TARGET="_new">report</A> in April that claims pending liabilities, such as those in Bhopal, threaten to overwhelm the company.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;If Union Carbide is truly confident of its innocence, it shouldn&#146;t be afraid to defend itself before a court of law,&#148; said Ryan Bodanyi, the Student Coordinator for the International Campaign for Justice in Bhopal. &#147;As the owner of Union Carbide, Dow has a responsibility to obey the law and ensure that Union Carbide appears for trial in India. The victims of the world&#146;s worst-ever corporate crime have waited long enough for their day in court.&#148;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> For more information or to take part in the action, visit <A HREF="http://www.studentsforbhopal.org/" TARGET="_new">www.studentsforbhopal.org</A>. </FONT></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
