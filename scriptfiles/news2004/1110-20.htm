<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- November 10 -- While Amnesty International USA (AIUSA) takes no position on the appointment of individual nominees, the organization believes that during the nominations process for the office of Attorney General, the opinions produced by Mr. Alberto Gonzales during his tenure as White House Counsel and the resulting policy decisions deserve close and careful scrutiny.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In particular, AIUSA urges that the confirmation process include a detailed examination of the nominee's views on human rights and humanitarian law, with particular reference to the Administration's misguided approach to these in the course of its declared &quot;war on terror.&quot; It is important that any future Attorney General uphold US and international law and seek to ratify, implement, and abide by international treaties.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As part of the confirmation process, Amnesty International calls for the full disclosure of any unpublished measures, directives or memoranda authored by Mr. Gonzales or his staff that discuss the legality of &quot;disappearances,&quot; torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, or extrajudicial executions.  The organization would also welcome an absolute and unequivocal statement by Mr. Gonzales, that in accordance with US and international law, he opposes torture and ill-treatment under any circumstances, including war and any other public emergency.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Additionally, Mr. Gonzales should publicly support the establishment of an independent commission of inquiry, wholly separate from the Department of Justice, which would investigate all aspects of the United States' detention and interrogation policies and practices. Such a commission should consist of credible independent experts, have international expert input, and have subpoena powers and access to all levels of government, all agencies, and all documents whether classified or unclassified.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The confirmation process is an opportunity to examine US policy and practice that helped lead to the scandal of Abu Ghraib, seek testimony on unanswered questions regarding the development of those policies from a key participant, and seek assurances that the future Attorney General will vigorously enforce the universal prohibition on the use of torture,&quot; said Dr. William F. Schulz, Executive Director of Amnesty International USA. &quot;Without such questions being asked of the nominee, the US risks perpetuating a disregard for its international legal obligations that at a minimum sowed confusion among interrogators and at worst gave the green light to torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.  Since 9/11, the Administration has proclaimed its opposition to torture in public, while in private discussing how the President can order torture and how government agents can escape criminal liability for torture.  That must now come to an end.&quot;<br></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
