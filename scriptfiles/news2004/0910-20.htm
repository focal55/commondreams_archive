<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SEATTLE - September 10 - Over 100 libraries and community groups across North America will commemorate 9/11 with an advance screening of a remarkable new documentary film -- <a href="http://www.poetryinwartime.org">POETRY IN WARTIME</a>. This feature-length film looks at war through images and  the words of poets -- unknown and world-famous -- to bring the  experience of war into sharp focus. Soldiers, journalists,  historians and experts on combat provide diverse perspectives on  war's effects on soldiers, civilians and society.</font></p>
<p>   <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This film aims to change the way we all look at the phenomenon  of war," said Director Rick King.  "It uses powerful poetry and  compelling stories to distill the emotional essence of war. The  movie communicates a very clear lesson -- in war, everyone pays a  price. The poetry balances the terrible reality of war with a  humanity that put the experience into a context.  The movie seemed  an effective way to communicate important truths about war -- a  topic of vital importance in the 21st century," King added.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">   The film has a global scope, with participants ranging from the  Superintendent of West Point to long-time peace advocate, Jonathan  Schell; from an American lieutenant dedicated to protecting his  troops in a hostile country to an angry Iraqi poet furious at the  American invasion of his country; from a Vietnam veteran whose  poetry remembers combat second-by- second to a long-time war  correspondent for the New York Times; as well as poets from  yesterday and today, such as Homer, Walt Whitman, Emily Dickinson,  Langston Hughes, Wilfred Owen, and Chris Abani, Emily Warn,  Antonieta Villamil, and Sherman Pearl.</font></p>
<p>   <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Making this film was transformative for all of us, I think,"  said Executive Producer Andrew Himes. "We learned that the core  truths about war are not expressed by any particular political  persuasion, but by the human heart through poetry. We learn  through the poetry and interviews how in war everyone is damaged - - winners and losers, soldiers and civilians. Our hope is that  people who see the film will understand at a deep level just how  serious and deadly it is to wage war, how important it is to go to  war only when absolutely necessary."</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">   The public libraries involved range from Seattle, Wash., to  Black Mountain, North Carolina; from Pittsburgh, Pa., to Oakdale,  Minnesota; and from Weare, N.H., to Boca Raton, Fla. Universities  where screenings will occur include Seattle University, Smith  College, McMaster University in Ontario, Canada, Wayne State in  Detroit, and Duquesne University in Pittsburgh.</font></p>
