<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - July 2 - June payroll figures from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) show that the President's tax cut dominated economic agenda continues to fail America's working families. BLS reported that payroll employment increased by only 112,000 in June, a sharp drop of over 50% from job growth in May. This figure is also far below the 250,000 new jobs that Wall Street economists predicted, and follows last week's downward revision of GDP growth for the first quarter of 2004 by the Commerce Department. </FONT></p><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The unemployment rate remains stubbornly high at 5.6 percent, the BLS also reported. However, the unemployment rate for women actually increased from 4.8% to 5.0% in June.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The BLS data also showed a loss of 11,000 manufacturing jobs in June, a decline in the average work week, and a decline in nominal wages (before adjustment for inflation). Real wages will likely show an even larger decline in June, given the recent acceleration in prices. Last week the Commerce Department reported that the core rate of inflation - which does not include food or energy prices - had increased by 2% in the first quarter. This continues the fall in real wages shown by BLS figures between May 2003 to May 2004.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Fair Taxes for All Coalition, a broad coalition of national, state, and local organizations including labor, civil rights, women's, religious, affordable housing, health, children's, poverty, hunger and other groups - together representing tens of millions of Americans - has spokespeople available to discuss the disconcerting failure of the tax cut dominated agenda to spark an economic recovery that benefits all Americans.  Co-chaired by People For the American Way, National Women's Law Center, AFSCME, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, USAction, and the Campaign for America's Future, Fair Taxes for All is dedicated to promoting a fair tax system that raises sufficient revenue to meet our shared priorities and invest in our common future.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">SPOKESPEOPLE AVAILABLE</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Joan Entmacher is Vice President and Director of Family Economic Security at the National Women's Law Center, a non-profit organization that has been working since 1972 to advance and protect women's rights.
