<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SAN FRANCISCO - August 19 - Earth Island Institute (EII) is pleased to add Reef Protection International to its growing family of projects working for the conservation, preservation, and restoration of the global environment. Reef Protection International will address coral reef conservation by enabling reform in the saltwater aquarium trade. Reef Protection International was formed in March 2004 and has quickly found success in attracting influential advisors and donors to join in the effort to help protect the world's fragile coral reefs.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We are excited by the aggressive goals of Reef Protection International,&quot; says Earth Island Institute Executive Director David Phillips. &quot;Coupled with the energy from other Earth Island Projects, we feel confident that EII's marine conservation efforts will be complemented by the targeted programs of Reef Protection International. The oceans, particularly the world's coral reefs, are in a disastrous state, and urgent help is needed to stop further destruction. It is imperative that organizations like Reef Protection International work to ensure the long-term viability of coral reefs for future generations.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Drew Weiner, Reef Protection International Director, strongly believes in the work of Earth Island Institute. &quot;I have been a long-time fan of Earth Island Institute and am honored to be working side by side with other activists committed to restoring the world's wild places. Having had the good fortune to spend time diving many of the world's beautiful coral reefs, I was compelled to do something to help reverse the damage we are witnessing. To do this under the Earth Island umbrella is exceedingly encouraging. We will make a difference.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Coral reefs around the world are in crisis. Over 25 percent have already died or are severely damaged, and another 30 percent are seriously threatened and may die - from global warming, over-fishing, destructive fishing practices, and unsound coastal development. By one estimate, coral reefs provide economic goods and ecosystem services worth about $375 billion each year to millions of people. Wild collection for the saltwater aquarium trade has far-reaching effects on the health of coral reefs around the world, particularly in areas like Indonesia, the Philippines and the South Pacific. High demand for wild-collected saltwater coral reef species - primarily from the United States, United Kingdom and other EU countries - has caused measurable declines in local populations and intensifies existing pressures stemming from development (causing habitat reduction), coastal pollution and global climate change. This problem is further compounded by wasteful and long-lasting damage from destructive collection methods like sodium cyanide use (illegal in many countries), over-harvesting, and high mortality rates due to insensitive shipping and poor husbandry practices along the supply chain.</font></p><p></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
