<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">BROOKLYN, NY - April 9 - While millions of people in the U.S. are questioning the truth and consequences of the war in Iraq, more and more taxpayers are asking themselves how they can in good conscience pay for it, and many will be taking their protest to the street. On Tax Day, April 15, people around the country will be holding demonstrations and vigils or just leafleting with educational flyers in front of IRS offices and post offices around the U.S.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In Portland, Oregon, protesters will gather at Pioneer Courthouse Square wearing barrels and not much else. Their message: &quot;Military spending has stripped us of our resources for schools, healthcare, etc.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">At the Oakland, California, Federal Building, a press conference and creative nonviolent protest will announce, &quot;We will not fund war and occupation.&quot; Joining this event will be Julia Butterfly Hill, who was recognized around the world for her two-year tree sit in the ancient redwood known as Luna. Last year, Ms Hill announced that she was making the largest single act of war tax resistance in history by reallocating over $100,000 in federal taxes to nonprofit organizations.  Ms. Hill's tax bill was the result of a lawsuit settlement in which she donated 100% of the pro-ceeds to charity.  She says, &quot;Thousands of others before me have taken this stand. I am not avoiding paying taxes. I have thought through this very carefully, and with a clear mind and heart I am humanely re-directing my tax payments to where they belong, because our current federal government refuses to do so.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The office of the National War Tax Resistance Coordinating Committee (NWTRCC) collects a listing of tax day actions, which appears at the bottom of this release. NWTRCC has supported war tax resisters -- people who refuse to pay for killing -- for 25 years, but this year a new group of people are considering resistance for the first time. They are people who want to pay their taxes and are not anxious to tangle with the IRS, but are increasingly troubled by how U.S. tax dollars are being used. &quot;I just can't give them more for this war,&quot; said a caller to NWTRCC from Albuquerque, New Mexico.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Well known poet and Professor Emeritus at the University of Pittsburgh Dennis Brutus is one of these people. In regard to his federal tax bill he says, &quot;I am prepared to pay taxes where these are due but have decided not to pay taxes that will be used to purchase arms for immoral and unjust actions such as the invasion and occupation of Iraq, among many other actions. I am prepared to become a Tax Resister to protest the use of taxes for unjust and immoral military action. I am willing to pay legitimate taxes, if this can be agreed upon and have asked to know what percent-age of my taxes will be used for military purposes and have not yet received information.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">At a time when states and cities are forced to cut services such as meals for the elderly, library hours, and school maintenance, in February the Bush Administration proposed a budget for 2005 that dramatically increased military spending for weapons systems, but didn't even include money for the war on terrorism. While Defense Secretary Rumsfeld testified July 9, 2003, to the Senate Armed Services Committee that the war in Iraq is costing about $3.9 billion a month, the Administration said in February that it could not estimate the cost of war. Instead they an-nounced that a request for paying for the war would come &quot;after the elections&quot; and would be about $50 billion.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><b>Tax Day Actions</b></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Along with individual resisters, people who are just plain mad about federal budget priorities will take action in their communities on April 15, tax day.
