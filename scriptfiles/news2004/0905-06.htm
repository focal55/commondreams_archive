<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SAN FRANCISCO- September 9 - Several individuals who have worked to protect the California coastline are among those being honored with national awards from the Sierra Club this year.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ken and Gabrielle Adelman of Corralitos, California, are the recipients of this year's Ansel Adams Award for conservation photography. The Sierra Club is honoring the Adelmans for their work on the California Coastal Records Project, a massive effort to photograph the entire 1,100-mile California coastline from the air. Their photographs, which now number more than 12,000, have been used by numerous organizations in their efforts to protect the California coastline. They are available free of charge at www.californiacoastline.org</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Peter Douglas, who has served as executive director of the California Coastal Commission since 1984, is also being recognized for his efforts to protect the California coastline. Douglas is receiving the Distinguished Service Award, which honor persons in public service for strong and consistent commitment to conservation. &quot;Peter has improved protection of our coast from pollution, strengthened enforcement under the California Coastal Act, and enhanced public education and outreach about the importance of our marine resources,&quot; says U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Also receiving the Distinguished Service Award is California State Senator Byron Sher, who has been one of the nation's preeminent state legislators on environmental issues. Laws he has authored during his 24-year career in the California State Legislature have served as models for similar legislation in other states around the nation. &quot;Over the years Senator Sher has shown consistent leadership on environmental issues, writing legislation to protect California's air, water, forests and wilderness areas. He has been an inspiration to like-minded state legislators around the country, and he will be deeply missed,&quot; said Sierra Club President Larry Fahn. Sher is retiring in November due to term limits.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Other notable honorees this year include former Secretary of the Interior Stewart Lee Udall of Santa Fe, New Mexico, who is being recognized with the Edgar Wayburn Award for service to the environment by a person in government; and syndicated columnist Molly Ivins of Austin, Texas, who is the recipient of the David Brower Award for environmental journalism.
