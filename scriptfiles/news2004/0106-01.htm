- January 6 - U.S. Rep. Ron Dellums, Tom Joyner, Celinda Lake, Susan Sarandon, Russell Simmons will join hundreds of grassroots groups to announce massive voter turnout effort with the goal of a $10 million mobilization effort. </FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">-- Public opinion research to activate over 1 million low income voters in 18 states in 2004.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WHAT:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Lunch press briefing at Occidental Restaurant to announce a $10 million mobilization effort by hundreds of grassroots groups and their allies to activate over 1 million new voters in 18 key states in 2004. Many of these community-based groups are mounting voter drives for the first time with the goal of this constituency joining &quot;soccer moms,&quot; &quot;suburban and ex urban belt voters&quot; and now even &quot;NASCAR dads&quot; as important voting blocs. The Center for Community Change will announce its official launch of the campaign in South Carolina with its sponsorship of a televised &quot;Presidential Candidate Dialog with America's Families&quot; on Friday, Jan. 30. Low income families will directly pose questions to the candidates, marking the first time a dialog with candidates will be held directly with working poor people. President Bush also has been invited to participate in the dialog. The dialog will be followed by thousands of people from South Carolina and other states boarding buses for a massive door-knocking get out the vote and voter education campaign throughout the state. The lunch briefing highlights recent public opinion research about low income communities across racial and gender lines that reveal increasing evidence that these communities will vote in 2004. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WHO:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">-- U.S. Rep.
