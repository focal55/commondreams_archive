<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - June 16 - The Campaign for America's Future today released a new webmercial that features First Lady Laura Bush setting the record straight on her husband's education policies. The ad encourages college graduates and their parents to send President Bush their student loan bills because they may be forced to pay an average of $5,500 more in interest on student loans if House Republicans and the Bush administration get their way. Mrs. Bush, who begins her first multi-stop campaign swing for Bush-Cheney 2004 Thursday, raised her public profile in the presidential campaign last month with the release of an Internet ad supporting President Bush's education policy.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Campaign for America's Future Co-director Robert Borosage noted that college students graduate with more average debt than ever before and it is simply unconscionable that the administration and House Republicans would support a plan that sticks students with higher interest rates and greater risk.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;No more lip service. The Bush administration leaves working families behind,&quot; said Borosage. &quot;President Bush generated record deficits with massive tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy, now House Republicans are trying to figure out who will pick up the tab. It is obscene to single out young men and women at the start of their careers and hit them with higher costs for school loans.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Laura Bush webmercial parody released today lets the White House know that students across the country can not afford more debt. Student debt levels have doubled in the last 10 years, and are likely to rise even higher with public college tuition rates soaring &#151; up 14 percent this past year alone. Hiking the price of college student loans by an average of $5,500 would only add to the burden and price college out of range for students.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The government helps students pay for college by allowing them to consolidate their student loans with a fixed interest rate. The College Access and Opportunity Act would force an average of $5,500 more in variable interest payments on borrowers, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. Republicans today held a congressional hearing on the bill.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">**NOTE: Media representatives interested in a script or copy of the webmerical should visit <A HREF="http://www.sendbushyourstudentloanbill.com" TARGET="_new">www.sendbushyourstudentloanbill.com</A>**</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;NO MORE LIP SERVICE&quot; WEBMERCIAL PARODY SCRIPT</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">[Ad opens with First Lady Laura Bush sitting in front of a bookcase and facing the camera.]</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">FIRST LADY:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">I'm Laura Bush.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Education is very important to my husband.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">That's why he wants you to pay thousands more for your college loan.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">You see, if your education costs you more, you'll value it more.
