<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - March 19 - With El Salvador preparing to vote this Sunday, March 21st, Dennis Kucinich today urged that the Bush Administration not interfere in the elections or attempt to influence the outcome.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Two top officials from the Bush Administration have made strong statements against the country's left-wing FMLN party that, according to Kucinich, &quot;threaten the integrity of Salvadoran elections.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Last Sunday, in a phone-in press conference at right-wing ARENA party headquarters, White House Special Assistant Otto Reich said he was worried about the impact an FMLN win could have on the country's &quot;economic, commercial, and migratory relations with the United States.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In February, Assistant Secretary of State Roger Noriega told voters to &quot;consider what kind of a relationship they want a new administration to have with us.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In a country where family remittances constitute 16% of the national economy, this message has a powerful influence over voters.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Congressman Kucinich said: &quot;Unfortunately, what is going on in El Salvador is representative of a Latin American policy that is not about promoting healthy democracies, but instead focused on making Latin American nations bend to U.S. commercial interests.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The people of El Salvador have a right to free and fair elections without interference from the United States. The U.S. cannot claim to be a leader in promoting democracy worldwide and at the same time hinder democracy by attempting to influence the outcome of elections abroad,&quot; Kucinich said.</FONT></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
