<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - March 3 - In a letter delivered to the members of the U.S. Senate's Budget Committee, the Sustainable Energy Coalition is calling for a Fiscal Year 2005 budget resolution &quot;that will make possible robust funding levels for the renewable energy and energy efficiency programs in the budgets of the U.S. Department of Energy, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, U.S Department of Agriculture, and other federal agencies.&quot;  The Senate Budget Committee is scheduled to meet today to develop allocations and guidelines that will influence the priorities and size of the FY05 budget.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The fourteen business, environmental, and energy policy groups that signed the letter acknowledged the &quot;tight budgetary constraints that face ... members of Congress&quot; but nonetheless suggested &quot;that funding levels for energy efficiency and renewable energy programs should be substantially increased - at least doubled or more over the next five to ten years.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The letter noted that &quot;support for federal sustainable energy programs represents a sound investment that could, over time, actually contribute to the nation's economic recovery by creating new domestic businesses and jobs, reducing energy imports and prices, enhancing national, energy, and homeland security, improving the reliability of the nation's electric transmission grid, and curbing the costs of energy-related environmental impacts.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The full text of the letter and the list of signing organizations is provided below.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">A similar letter will be sent shortly to the House Budget Committee.</FONT></P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">March 3, 2004</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Members</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Senate Budget Committee</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Washington DC 20510</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">ATTN: Budget Committee Staff Member</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Dear Senator:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">As you develop the parameters that will govern the size and shape of the Fiscal Year 2005 federal budget, we urge that you provide allocations that will make possible robust funding levels for the renewable energy and energy efficiency programs in the budgets of the U.S. Department of Energy, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, U.S Department of Agriculture, and other federal agencies.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In making this request, we are well aware of the tight budgetary constraints that face you and the other members of Congress.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Yet, we believe that support for federal sustainable energy programs represents a sound investment that could, over time, actually contribute to the nation's economic recovery by creating new domestic businesses and jobs, reducing energy imports and prices, enhancing national, energy, and homeland security, improving the reliability of the nation's electric transmission grid, and curbing the costs of energy-related environmental impacts.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In fact, several recent analyses, such as the report of the President's Committee of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST), suggest that funding levels for energy efficiency and renewable energy programs should be substantially increased - at least doubled or more over the next five to ten years.  Similarly, the various versions of the energy bill that has been under consideration by Congress during the past year authorize a roughly 50% increase in energy efficiency and renewable energy funding over the next five years.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Accordingly, we urge that the FY'05 budget reflect an overall increase in the allocations that affect the cross-section of energy efficiency programs and for the respective solar, wind, geothermal, biomass/biofuels, hydropower, and renewable hydrogen programs within the Executive Branch agencies.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">We look forward to working with you on this important endeavor.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Sincerely,</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Alliance to Save Energy</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">American Public Power Association</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">American Wind Energy Association</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Bob Lawrence &amp; Associates</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Cascade Associates</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Environmental &amp; Energy Study Institute</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Geothermal Energy Association</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">National Environmental Trust</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">National Hydropower Association</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">New Uses Council</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Solar Energy Industries Association</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Stella Group, Ltd.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Union of Concerned Scientists</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Sustainable Energy Coalition is a coalition of nearly 80 national and state business, consumer, environmental, and energy policy organizations which collectively represent several thousand companies, community organizations, and municipal utilities.
