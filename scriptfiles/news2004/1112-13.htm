<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SAN FRANCISCO -- November 12 -- Continuing its commitment to civic dialogue and engagement on the critical international issues of our day, Link TV is proud to announce the national television premiere of &#147;LITIGATING DISASTER&#148; on November 30th at 8:00 pm ET. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">December 3, 1984: Bhopal, India. About midnight a series of explosions released huge amounts of toxic gas from the Union Carbide pesticide factory in Bhopal, killing thousands and poisoning hundreds of thousands of nearby residents.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It was the deadliest peacetime chemical disaster of all time. Nearly twenty years later the ordeal isn't over, justice has not been done. Had the disaster occurred in the developed world, heads would have rolled, prison sentences would have been served, changes would have been made. But the disaster didn't happen in the West, but in this obscure third world Indian city.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today hundreds of thousands of people in Bhopal still suffer. Drinking water for at least sixteen nearby communities remains severely polluted, while no court of law anywhere in the world has held Union Carbide or any of its officers responsible for what happened that night. How is it possible that nearly two decades after an event of such magnitude there is still no legal closure? Why has the case been left to rot in the backwaters of the legal system without delivering justice to the victims?</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The powerful new film LITIGATING DISASTER explores how Union Carbide successfully manipulated the US and Indian legal systems against each other, to avoid having to defend its record at the Bhopal plant in court. Featuring a young Indian-American lawyer, the film follows the case Rajan Sharma brought on behalf of the victims in front of the Federal District Court in New York. Case number 99CIV 11239 has survived two motions to dismiss, but has not yet proceeded to trial.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Constructed as attorney Sharma's case being presented to hypothetical American jurors, LITIGATING DISASTER takes the viewers on a riveting cinematic investigation; presenting the compelling evidence assembled against Union Carbide including never before seen documents unearthed through prolonged legal struggles, exclusive interviews with Union Carbide former officers, powerful archival material, and scenes filmed in and around the abandoned plant.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As the story unfolds, the documentary makes it clear the real culprit is the lack of any international law or tribunal to govern the activities of multinational corporations. Or, as Rajan Sharma puts it to the imaginary jurors, &quot;the consequences of leaving something like Bhopal un-addressed means that there is a certain inevitability of this kind of tragedy recurring again and again until somebody has the sense to say that just because this happened in the Third World or in a developing country does not mean we do not have to take it seriously.&quot;</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The director of LITIGATING DISASTER, Ilan Ziv, has directed dozens of documentaries dealing with issues of human rights, the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, and investigations of contemporary history. Ziv&#146;s films have been broadcast by leading television networks and presented in film festivals around the world.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;By airing LITIGATING DISASTER, we hope to bring awareness to this Third World nation&#146;s protracted fight for justice following one of the deadliest chemical disasters of all time,&#148; says Link TV President, Kim Spencer. &#147;All people deserve to have a voice,&#148; Spencer adds, &#147;let&#146;s hear it.&#148;</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LITIGATING DISASTER</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Director: Ilan Ziv</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Co-Producers: Luc Martin Gousset and Ilan Ziv</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A co-production of Point Du Jour, Tamouz Media and Arte France in association with SVT, TSR, RTBF, Tele-Quebec.</font></p><p> </p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">About Link TV:</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Link TV is a nationwide public satellite television network offering global perspectives on world events, issues and culture.
