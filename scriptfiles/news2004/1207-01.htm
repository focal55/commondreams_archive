<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- December 7 -- As 2004 winds down and the county begins to celebrate the holiday season, our thoughts turn to the young men and women serving in the US military around the world who won't be home with their families.  Sadly, an event  &#147;Fur Wraps the Hill,&#148; on Capitol Hill this Tuesday at   10am in Rayburn House Office Building, will promote, on behalf of our wounded soldiers, an industry which inflicts needless and wholly unnecessary suffering through its use of the barbaric steel jaw leghold traps. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The non-selective and highly destructive steel jaw leghold trap is the most common type of trap used on the millions of animals killed for their fur each year in the US. Victims suffer excruciating pain and fear as they tear ligaments and break teeth in their struggle to free themselves from the bone crushing trap.  <a href="http://www.saplonline.org/" target="_new">The Society for Animal Protective Legislation</a> (SAPL) and its parent organization, Animal Welfare Institute, are campaigning vigorously against the steel jaw leghold trap in this country and abroad. </font></p><p>            <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;As a veteran of the US Army and former staffer in the US Senate, I find it distasteful to promote an industry well known for its inhumane practices in a guise to honor our veterans,&quot; notes Chris Heyde, Policy Analyst with the Society for Animal Protective Legislation.   Heyde further stated that, &#147;We disrespect our soldiers by associating them with such a barbaric industry.&#148;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">             SAPL calls on all Members of Congress and the American public to take a stand against industries promoting and using practices harmful to all animals.  To honor our military, it would be more appropriate for Congress to host an event promoting compassion instead of cruelty. </font> </p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
