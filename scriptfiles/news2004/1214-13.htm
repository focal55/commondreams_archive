<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">COLUMBUS, OH -- December 14 -- Green Party presidential candidate David Cobb told members of the House Judiciary Committee yesterday about an Ohio Board of Elections employee who witnessed deliberate tampering with county voting machines.</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The revelation came as part of Cobb's testimony in a forum convened by Representative John Conyers, the ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee.  The committee members are examining reports of voter suppression and intimidation and other irregularities that occurred in the Ohio 2004 presidential election. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cobb's report of rigged voting machines drew an instantaneous response from Conyers who directed his staff to immediately investigate the situation. &quot;This allegation is just the tip of the iceberg,&quot; said Cobb. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The bigger problem is the use of electronic voting machines that don't produce auditable paper trails.  Electronic voting machines and tabulators without verifiable paper trails are one of the greatest threats to our democracy,&quot; Cobb added.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cobb's comments come as 21 more Ohio counties begin the recount process today, including Franklin, Mahoning, Pickaway and Ross counties which use only electronic voting machines. Problems reported with electronic voting machines in this election have included one Ohio county adding almost 4,000 extra votes to George W. Bush's tally, machines that wouldn't let voters record presidential votes for anyone but Bush, and &quot;backwards counting&quot; machines that subtracted votes from Kerry's vote totals.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;In the old days, crooked politicians stuffed ballot boxes.  Today, computer technicians can fix the vote behind-the-scenes. There's compelling evidence that the 2004 presidential vote was manipulated.  Until there's public scrutiny and access to all phases of the voting process, there will be lingering suspicions of fraud,&quot; said Blair Bobier, Media Director for the Cobb-LaMarche campaign.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Green Party's presidential campaign has demanded recounts in both Ohio and New Mexico.  The New Mexico state canvassing board, which oversees that state's elections, is meeting today to take up the issue of the New Mexico recount.  By New Mexico law, the recount should have started there no later than today.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Cobb-LaMarche website &lt;<a href="http://www.votecobb.org/" target="_new">http://www.votecobb.org</a>&gt; has more information about the campaign and recount efforts.  Information about the national Green Party can be found at &lt;<a href="http://www.votecobb.org/" target="_new">http://www.gp.org</a>&gt;.<br></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
