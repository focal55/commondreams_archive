<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - July 2 - With a week to go before the Democratic Party's Platform Committee convenes in Miami, supporters of Democratic Presidential candidate Dennis Kucinich and representatives of leading Progressive Democratic organizations are gearing up to give the committee a political earful.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Hundreds of Kucinich campaigners and political allies, armed with petitions bearing hundreds of thousands of names (www.kucinich.us/petitions), will begin arriving in Miami next Friday to present platform planks and amendments they want included in the final document. They are expected to push hard for planks calling for the creation of a Cabinet-level Department of Peace, withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq, national health care reform, and other issues.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The objective, organizers say, is to fashion a platform that lays out a more distinctly &quot;Democratic&quot; position on domestic issues, such as economic policy, health care, education, civil rights, and the environment;  and on foreign policy issues, such as trade agreements, military intervention abroad, and international relations.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Campaign representatives will formally present the petitions to the 186-member Platform Committee, probably Saturday morning, and spend the rest of the day lobbying members and closely monitoring the discussion and debate.  A final platform will be adopted by the end of the day Saturday and referred to the party's national convention, which meets in Boston beginning July 26.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The lobbying, in fact, has already begun.  Kucinich representatives on the Platform Committee, as well as campaign staff and supporters, have been contacting other members of the Platform Committee and officials of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) to make their positions clear.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Millions of Americans believe, as does Congressman Kucinich, that this war was based on lies and misrepresentations, and the occupation must come to an end,&quot; said Kucinich National Campaign Manager Dorothy (Dot) Maver. &quot;We intend to remind the Democratic Platform Committee of those realities in no uncertain terms.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">She said the campaign also intends to point out to committee members that the Democratic parties in eight states approved measures at their state conventions recently calling for the establishment of a Cabinet-level Department of Peace.  Several other state parties called on their national party to support the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The message from grassroots Democrats all across the country is very clear,&quot; Maver said.  &quot;We're planning to make sure that message is communicated in Miami and in Boston.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Regardless of the outcome with the Platform Committee in Miami, the Kucinich campaign is coordinating with other organizations to plan a series of events in Boston during the convention &quot;to focus attention on issues that Democrats believe in, but the Party itself has yet to embrace,&quot; said Tim Carpenter, Convention Director for the Kucinich organization.   Those events will include rallies, political and educational forums, neighborhood gatherings, and other activities. The week will culminate with a Progressive Democratic Convention that will launch a new organization, Carpenter said.  (A schedule for events in Boston will be released on July 6.)</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In Miami, the Kucinich campaign has reserved a conference room in the Westin Hotel, the same hotel where the Platform Committee will be meeting. Organizers have extended invitations to supporters and like-minded organizations throughout Florida and in dozens of other states.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Over the Fourth of July holiday weekend, Kucinich campaigners and allies across the country will be gathering additional signatures on the petitions that will be presented to  the Platform Committee next week.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">For information about the National campaign: <A HREF="http://www.kucinich.us" TARGET="_new">http://www.kucinich.us</A></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">For Congressman Kucinich's Schedule: <A HREF="http://www.kucinich.us/schedule.htm" TARGET="_new">http://www.kucinich.us/schedule.htm</A>.</FONT></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
