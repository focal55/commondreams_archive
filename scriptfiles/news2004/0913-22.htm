<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON/PARIS - September 13 - In response to September 9th's 
revelation of an accident at the French Cadarache nuclear plant (1), 
which has contaminated two workers, <a href="http://www.greenpeace.org">Greenpeace</a> has called for the 
immediate cancellation of next week's plans to send US weapons grade 
plutonium to the facility.

</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to a statement by the French nuclear regulator, CEA, two 
workers were contaminated on Monday when radioactive plutonium and 
uranium leaked from a container. The workers are now undergoing urgent 
health checks. The CEA said the accident was due to a 'violation of 
procedures'.

</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"In addition to exposing the workers to danger, this accident exposes 
risks of producing plutonium MOX fuel. It is one more reason why the 
United States should not send its plutonium to Cadarache next week," 
said Shaun Burnie of Greenpeace International.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

The French nuclear facility, which is operated by nuclear state company 
AREVA/Cogema, has a long history of leaks and accidents.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

"There is no justification for this transport as the whole policy of 
using weapons plutonium in reactors is dangerously misguided. After 
September 11th terrorist attack, any risk to international security by 
shipping plutonium across the ocean should be automatically avoided." 
said Yannick Rousselet of Greenpeace France.</font></p>

Two armed British ships are expected to arrive at the South Carolina 
port of Charleston on September 15 to pick up a cargo of weapons grade 
plutonium.
