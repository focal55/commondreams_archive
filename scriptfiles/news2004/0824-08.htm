The goals of the daily, sunrise-to-sunset event are to call upon the Bush administration to meet the needs of the people affected by Ground Zero pollution, and to educate the rest of the country about the continuing risk. Participants will gather on the corner of Liberty and Broadway (one block from Ground Zero) from August 26 until the final day of the Convention (September 2).  Each day will honor and advocate on behalf of a different &quot;constituency&quot; of the Ground Zero community. The event kicks off with a press conference on the steps of Federal Hall (across from the New York Stock Exchange) at 11:00 AM on Thursday, August 26th.  (corner of Wall St and Broad St, one block east of Broadway). This event is sponsored by Sierra Club, 9/11 Environmental Action, New York Committee for Occupational Safety and Health (NYCOSH) and New York Environmental Law &amp; Justice Project.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">   <b>March to say &quot;No to the Bush Agenda&quot; (August 29)</b> **Message: &quot;It's time to conserve our energy, water and forests!
