<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- October 28 -- Fifty percent of junior enlisted service members say that gays and lesbians should be allowed to serve openly in the military, according to the University of Pennsylvania&#146;s National Annenberg Election Survey. The number is a significant increase since 1992, when two similar surveys found 16 percent of male service members held the same view.</font></p>
<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Annenberg poll follows a report last week from the Urban Institute which estimates 65,000 lesbian and gay Americans serve in the armed forces. &#147;Despite the military&#146;s  gay ban, service members have seen first hand the contributions of lesbian and gay Americans,&#148; said Sharra E. Greer, Director of Law and Policy for Servicemembers Legal Defense Network (SLDN). &#147;Heterosexual service members serve alongside lesbian and gay colleagues every day and they are increasingly comfortable doing so.&#148; </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to the Annenberg Survey, those who support allowing gays to serve openly do so because they believe sexual orientation is unrelated to job performance. Twenty-nine percent also believe allowing gays to serve is an issue of equal rights.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Even among those who oppose allowing gays to serve openly, however, the rationales often used for excluding gays were rejected. Only 16 percent of those opposed believed lesbian and gay service members were &#147;bad for morale,&#148; while just 12 percent thought allowing gays to serve openly would be &#147;bad for teamwork,&#148; two justifications frequently used by military leaders who have rejected the idea of allowing gays to serve openly. &#147;The old rationales used to justify the military&#146;s gay ban aren&#146;t even effective among those who support the Pentagon&#146;s overall position,&#148; said Aaron Belkin, director of the Center for the Study of Sexual Minorities in the Military at UC-Santa Barbara. &#147;Clearly, those serving on the frontlines and in the trenches do not believe gays disrupt unit cohesion or troop morale.&#148;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Annenberg poll also reflects other recent polls finding widespread public support for lifting the military&#146;s &#147;Don&#146;t Ask, Don&#146;t Tell&#148; ban on lesbian and gay personnel. Annenberg reports 67 percent support among civilians for allowing gays to serve openly. In 2003, FOX News reported 64 percent support, and the Gallup organization 79 percent, on a similar question.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;There are few people who continue to defend the military&#146;s ban,&#148; said Greer. &#147;The American people and, increasingly, our men and women in uniform, realize the disservice &#145;Don&#146;t Ask, Don&#146;t Tell&#146; exacts on our nation. Congress must also now recognize the contribution of lesbian and gay Americans and repeal the ban once and for all.&#148;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>The 2004 National Annenberg Election Survey is available online at <a href="http://www.naes04.org/" target="_new">www.naes04.org</a>.</i></font></p>
