- January 6 - The Associated Press reported today that President George W. Bush's Labor Department is suggesting ways that employers can avoid paying overtime to the 1.3 million low-wage workers it claims would be eligible for additional overtime pay under a new rule. In short, they're telling employers how to get around the new rule they've just created.</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Among the options, according to AP:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Making a 'payroll adjustment' that results 'in virtually no, or only a minimal increase in labor costs,' the department said. Workers' annual pay would be converted to an hourly rate and cut, with overtime added in to equal the former salary.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Essentially, employees would be working more hours for the same pay.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The department does not view the 'payroll adjustment' option as a pay cut.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">When criticized for the tip sheet, a Labor Department spokesman, Ed Frank, told AP, &quot;We're not saying anybody should do any of this.&quot; Frank used to represent one of the largest business association lobbying groups in Washington, the National Federation of Independent Business, which has been aggressively lobbying for this very rule change.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">What is the money-in-politics angle on overtime pay? Consider one example to see who win and wholoses:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Bush &quot;Ranger&quot; mega-fundraiser Steven A. Burd has already raised at least $200,000 for the President's re-election effort. Burd is the Chair, CEO &amp; President of Safeway, Inc., the third largest supermarket corporation in the United States, and an employer of tens of thousands of low-wage workers - workers who have been locked out and on strike for two and a half months in an effort to get better health care and higher wages. The supermarket chain, along with Albertson's and Kroger's (which owns Ralph's Supermarkets in California), continue to demand cuts in wages and health care benefits for new hires.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Another mega-fundraiser for Bush is 2000 &quot;Pioneer&quot; Robert E. Zincke, Executive Vice President of Kroger's. Kroger's is the largest supermarket chain in the country and ranked as the third largest U.S. retailer in 2002 with $52 billion in annual sales.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Will Burd's Safeway and Zincke's Kroger's use Bush's new overtime rules to erode low-wage workers pay regardless whether the strike gets settled?</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">And how many low-wage workers making $22,100 (the new threshold in the rule) have donated or raised large amounts of campaign money for Bush?</FONT></P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p></FONT><!-- #EndEditable -->
