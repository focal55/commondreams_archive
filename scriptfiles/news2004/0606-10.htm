<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - June 5 - WHAT: 	A Press Conference organized by Jubilee USA Network which will include the release of a letter to the G-8 fro, hundreds of religious leaders calling for full debt cancellation for impoverished nations so as to fight HIV/AIDS in Africa.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WHO:	The panel of religious leaders and other speakers includes:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Marie Clarke, National Coordinator, Jubilee USA Network; Adam Taylor, Associate Minister, Shiloh Baptist Church; Board member, Jubilee USA, Washington, DC Barbara Kalima, Director, AFRODAD, Zimbabwe Rev. Tim McDonald, Concerned Black Clergy, Atlanta, Ga. (invited) Rev. Fred D. Taylor, Coordinator of Direct Action for the National office of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (invited) Pastor Zack Lyde, Brunswick, Ga.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WHEN:	Tuesday, June 8, 2004, 12 noon</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WHERE:	At the site of The Other Economic Summit (TOES), Coastal Georgia Community College, 3700 Altama Ave., Brunswick, GA. Look for signs pointing to the room for the event.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">BRUNSWICK, Ga. -- Jubilee USA Network, in collaboration with Africa Action and the National Center for Human Rights Education will release a letter from religious leaders to world leaders on the first day of the G-8 Summit in Georgia (the official summit is June 8-10 in Sea Island, Ga). The letter will address the moral imperative for the G-8 to enact full debt cancellation in order fight AIDS in Africa and to guarantee human rights for impoverished peoples.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The press conference will feature religious leaders speaking from their faith traditions about prophetic call for debt cancellation for impoverished nations. Speakers will also address current conditions in Africa, and the need for debt cancellation in light of the global HIV/AIDS pandemic. Jubilee USA Network will also unveil a photo display at the event containing hundreds of photos of people of faith and conscience from across the United States, Europe, and elsewhere with messages to the G-8 leaders.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">G-8 leaders at the summit are likely to address the issue of the debt crisis faced by impoverished nations. UK Prime Minister Tony Blair and Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown are proposing an extension of the World Bank and IMF's debt relief scheme, the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries' Initiative and the extension of debt relief to countries that have not yet benefited from the program.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Jubilee USA Network argues that rather than taking these limited steps with the failed HIPC program, the G-8 must commit to a lasting solution to the debt crisis and leverage 100 percent cancellation of the external debt of the most impoverished nations by the International Monetary Fund and World Bank as well as all other significant bi-lateral creditors.</FONT></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
