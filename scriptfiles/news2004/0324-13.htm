It examines public health, psychological, social and political ramifications of the US war on terrorism and our escalating defense economy, especially how they affect ordinary Americans and what we can do to affect them.  It marks the 25th anniversary of a 1979 Physicians for Social Responsibility (PSR) conference in Philadelphia which for the first time focused professionals on nuclear policy issues, helped define nuclear threats and preparedness as public health issues and helped  set the stage for in the national nuclear freeze movement.  The current conference takes place as policy experts are revising upwards their assessments of nuclear and terrorism dangers, and as a resolution in favor of the PSR  &quot;SMART (Sensible, Multilateral American Response toTerrorism) Security&quot; platform for improving public health and safety post 9-11 is introduced into Congress.  Co-sponsored by Physicians for Social Responsibility and Business Leaders for Sensible Priorities.</FONT></p>
