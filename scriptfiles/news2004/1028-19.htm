<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PHILADELPHIA, PA -- October 28 -- The Kensington Welfare Rights Union and the Poor People&#146;s Economic Human Rights Campaign refuse to let this election be decided by the Supreme Court and demand that all votes be counted before the next President is determined.  The Kensington Welfare Rights Union is based in Philadelphia, PA, a major swing state in what they view as the most important election in United States history.  </font><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The powers that be  have taken virtually everything away from poor people in </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">America, while preparing to make many more Americans poor. Now our right to </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">vote is being threatened. It's one of the last things we've got left. If they steal this election after the Florida 2000 debacle, a constitutional crisis must erupt from the streets of America.&quot; </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">- Cheri Honkala, National Coordinator of the PPEHRC</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Kensington Welfare Rights Union and the Poor Peoples Economic Human Rights Campaign call for organizing demonstrations and/or acts of massive civil disobedience, if necessary, on November 3 at federal and local court houses in Philadelphia and hometowns nationally where PPEHRC affiliates are organized.
