<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PORTLAND, OR -- December 17, 2004 -- A testimony to the rising clout of global women's voices, a new glossy, independent publication launches next week called World Pulse.  Symbolizing the &quot;pulse&quot; of new voices on world issues, World Pulse features solutions-oriented commentary on current international events from leading women journalists, analysts, luminaries, and youth worldwide.  World Pulse is geared to appeal to globally-conscious readers who crave in-depth and inspiring information about their world and are frustrated with traditional news coverage that focuses primarily on conflict and crisis.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ten thousand copies of World Pulse&#146;s Magazine's pilot issue were successfully distributed in June throughout the U.S. and Canada to subscribers, newsstands, and leadership conferences.  With hard-hitting yet hopeful articles from women leaders in Iraq and the Democratic Republic of Congo,  the pilot issue was received enthusiastically by readers, frequently selling out in independent bookstores and natural food markets, and captured two nominations for &quot;Best International Coverage&quot; and &quot;Best New Title&quot; of 2004 by the Utne Independent Press Awards. </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The official launch issue will hit newsstands next week and features brave women journalists and leaders from Afghanistan and Colombia who are risking thier lives to speak out.   Mariane Pearl, award-winning journalist and widow of Wall Street Journal correspondent Daniel Pearl,  sits on the publication's editorial Guide Council, and headlines with an intimate article on &quot;The Ultimate Weapon Against Terror.&quot;  Other articles include:  &quot;Human Trafficking Solutions&quot;, &quot;A Peace Plan for the Drug War&quot;, and a compilation of perspectives from global democracy experts on the recent U.S. elections.  </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">World Pulse is the brainchild of Founder and Executive Editor Jensine Larsen, who envisioned the publication after working as a freelance journalist covering stories of ethnic cleansing in Burma and indigenous movements in South America.  It was the courageous women leaders who most deeply moved Larsen, often waging an additional struggle for equal roles in community leadership against seemingly insurmountable obstacles.  When Larsen returned to US, she became acutely aware of the absence of solutions-focused news and women's voices on world issues in media.  </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;World Pulse is the magazine I have always wanted to read.  I want cutting-edge solutions-oriented international news and analysis, but the voices I want to hear, from powerful women leaders and writers, are too often missing in our media.&quot;  Larsen says she waited for five years for someone else to implement the idea before realizing she would be the one to do it.  Since starting the project nearly two years ago Larsen today boasts a qualified staff, Board of Directors, dozens of pro bono professional advisors, a supporting network of international women's and youth organizations, women and youth writers from around the world, and endorsements from women luminaries and visionaries.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;When people open World Pulse they will feel a surge of excitement as they sense the potency and sophistication of the rising global movement of women's and youth leadership.  It is a phenomenon that is transcending blame and victimization and looking for working solutions to the problems humanity faces today.&quot;  Larsen says that the most frequent response she hears after introducing the magazine is  - &quot;It's time.&quot;</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">World Pulse is based in Portland, Oregon and will start quarterly in 2005 and move to bi-monthly with international distribution in 2006.
