<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - July 13 - Uncovered: The Whole Truth About The Iraq War and Unprecedented: The 2000 Presidential Election, two films from Robert Greenwald, who is making headlines with his new documentary, Outfoxed: Rupert Murdoch's War On Journalism, will air on Sundance Channel, Monday, September 6th as part of the network's DOCday programming block. (Logo: <A HREF="http://www.newscom.com/cgi-bin/prnh/20010404/SUNDANCELOGO" TARGET="_new">http://www.newscom.com/cgi-bin/prnh/20010404/SUNDANCELOGO</A> )</FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">No stranger to making documentaries with a political edge, Greenwald examines the Bush Administration's conduct in convincing the American people that Saddam Hussein posed a threat to national security in 2003's Uncovered: The Whole Truth About The Iraq War. The film, praised by critics for its honesty, airs September 6th at 9:00 pm ET/PT. Greenwald also served as the executive producer of Joan Sekler and Richard Ray Perez's 2002 film, Unprecedented: The 2000 Presidential Election, which scrutinized the electoral fiasco in the state of Florida. The film airs at 8:00 pm ET/PT.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Uncovered revisits such key moments as President Bush's 2003 State of the Union speech and Colin Powell's address to the United Nations, when the argument was made that Saddam Hussein was an imminent threat who possessed weapons of mass destruction and had restarted a nuclear weapons program. Did the administration know it was going to war on flawed intelligence? Among those addressing this and other vital questions are Chas Freeman, a Defense Department veteran and former Ambassador to Saudi Arabia; weapons inspector Scott Ritter; former ambassador Joseph Wilson; Colonel Mary Ann Wright, a career diplomat who was part of the rebuilding team in Afghanistan; Patrick Lang, who served as Defense Intelligence Officer for the Middle East, South Asia and Terrorism from 1985 to 1992; and CIA veterans Graham Fuller, Mel Goodman, Ray McGovern and Robert Baer.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">As the pundits said repeatedly on election night 2000, &quot;It all comes down to Florida.&quot; Unprecedented dissects the incompetence and petty corruption that altered the final tally from the moment the Sunshine State's polls opened. Citing a suspicious pattern of irregularities, injustices and purges of African Americans from the voter records, the film presents a provocative piece of advocacy journalism that -- contrary to suggestions to &quot;just get over it&quot; -- prompts outrage.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Under the creative direction of Robert Redford, Sundance Channel brings television viewers daring and engaging feature films, shorts, documentaries, world cinema and animation, shown uncut and with no commercials.
