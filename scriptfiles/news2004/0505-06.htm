<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - May 5 - Statement of Tiernan Sittenfeld, U.S. PIRG Conservation Program Director, Heritage Forests Campaign Co-Director</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">We applaud Senator Cantwell, and Representatives Inslee, Hinchey, DeLauro, Blumenauer, and Wu for being stalwart defenders of our national forests, and we join them in calling on the Bush administration to abandon its present course and start protecting our last wild forests for future generations.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Three years ago yesterday, Agriculture Secretary Veneman pledged to uphold the Roadless Area Conservation Rule, a historic conservation initiative enacted in January 2001 to protect nearly 60 million acres of national forests from most logging and road-building. The Roadless Rule ensures that our national forests will continue to provide clean drinking water, wildlife habitat, and endless opportunities for recreation and solitude. To date, the Forest Service has received about 2.5 million comments in support of the Roadless Rule, making it the most popular rule in history.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">On the third anniversary of Secretary Veneman's promise to uphold the Roadless Rule, the Bush administration is poised to break that promise by further weakening the rule. The administration has already exempted Alaska's Tongass Rainforest&#151;our largest national forest&#151;from the Roadless Rule. Next, the administration is planning to weaken the rule in the Lower 48 by letting governors decide whether they want roadless areas in their states protected. This would give governors unprecedented power over federal lands owned by all Americans and could lead to the destruction of some of the most pristine lands in the entire country. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">It's been three years since Secretary Veneman promised to uphold the Roadless Rule. It's well past time for the Bush administration to make good on that promise. Today, we call on President Bush to keep the Roadless Rule intact in the Lower 48 and in Alaska's Chugach and to reinstate the rule in the Tongass. </FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
