<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - April 7 - Official figures being released by the Brazilian government this afternoon are expected to show that deforestation in the Amazon last year was at or near a new record high. On top of the sharp spike in deforestation that occurred the previous year, the new figures indicate that Brazil needs to do much more to halt the increasingly rapid destruction of the world's largest and most important rainforest.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Based on satellite imagery, the data released last year showed that 10,000 square miles of Amazon forests disappeared in Brazil between July 2001 and June 2002, an area more than twice the size of Connecticut, and a jump of 40 percent over previous levels. This year's figures for the rates and trends in deforestation of the Amazon Basin in 2003 are expected to be even higher.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;There continues to be an alarming increase in the rate of Amazon deforestation for the second year running,&quot; said Guillermo Castilleja, WWF's vice president for Latin America and the Caribbean. &quot;WWF calls on the Government of Brazil to move urgently to respond to this crisis by fulfilling its commitment to triple the area of rainforest under legal protection.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The announcement is expected at 4 p.m. local time in Brasilia (3 p.m. EST). WWF will issue a news release and make experts available to speak with the media as soon as the figures are available.</FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
