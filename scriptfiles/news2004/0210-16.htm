She said today: &quot;Apparently for the first time since the days of J. Edgar Hoover, the government is using the grand jury to harass and intimidate antiwar protestors. Drake University and four peace activists have been subpoenaed to produce records about the National Lawyers Guild before a federal grand jury in Iowa. The subpoenas constitute an outrageous attack on constitutionally protected speech and association.&quot;<BR><BR></FONT></LI><LI><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">KATHY KELLY, <A HREF="mailto:info@vitw.org">info@vitw.org</A>, <A HREF="http://www.vitw.org" TARGET="_new">www.vitw.org<BR></A>Co-founder of the group Voices in the Wilderness and a three-time Nobel Peace Prize nominee, Kelly was recently sentenced to three months in federal prison for crossing onto the property of the Ft.

Wilson had ended a 30-day hunger strike outside the Seadrift plant before climbing the 90-foot tower. She said today: &quot;I was protesting that for 12 years Dow's subsidiary Union Carbide has been refusing to attend a court in India where it stands charged with culpable homicide for the deaths of more than 20,000 people. Carbide killed thousands, then jumped bail; I never harmed a soul but it's me in the dock facing criminal charges. Truly, companies like Dow make a mockery of justice. They invoke the law when it suits them and ignore it when it doesn't.&quot; At her trial she was prohibited from telling the jury why she scaled the tower. There have been solidarity fasts in India.</FONT></LI></UL><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
