<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - May 13 - PEN USA, the third largest PEN center in the world, has responded to the recent ruling of the Federal Communication Commission (FCC), which called the word &quot;f---,&quot; used as an expletive by Golden Globe winner Bono (leader singer of rock group U2), &#147;indecent and profane.&#148;  PEN USA Freedom to Write Committee&#146;s First Amendment Action Committee &#147;deplores this ruling&#148;.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Bono expletive controversy began at the 2003 Golden Globes, which were broadcast live on NBC. After receiving a Golden Globe, Bono exuberantly exclaimed &#147;this is really, really f---ing brilliant.&quot; The FCC&#146;s Enforcement Bureau originally declined to sanction NBC for the comment, but on May 18th, after the Parent&#146;s Television Council filed an &#147;Application for Review,&#148; the full commission of the FCC reversed the decision.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Fox Entertainment Group, Viacom (which owns CBS, MTV, BET and other media entities), the National Coalition Against Censorship, the Screen Actors Guild, the performers Penn &amp; Teller, comedian Margaret Cho, and others have formed a coalition dedicated to pressuring the FCC to reverse its ruling regarding Bono&#146;s remark. The ACLU has recently joined the alliance. Attorneys with the law firm Davis Wright Tremaine, led by Robert Corn-Revere, a respected First Amendment lawyer, filed the petition. They warn that they will file a suit in federal court if the decision is not reversed.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The FCC is now setting itself up as a national censorship board, seeking to impose its version of morality on the American public,&quot; said Chris Hansen, an ACLU senior staff attorney and expert on free speech issues. &quot;What's worse, for the first time in television history, the FCC is declaring that tape delays of live broadcasts are necessary to protect us from so-called &#147;indecency and blasphemy.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The FCC's definitions of these terms, Hansen said, &quot;are so hopelessly vague that no broadcaster can conscientiously apply the rules. As a result, broadcasters will self-censor, and we will lose both creative, challenging content and spontaneity.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Most disturbing to proponents of free speech, Hanson explains, the FCC definition of &#147;profanity&#148; includes words that can be interpreted as &#147;blasphemous,&#148; &#147;vulgar,&#148; or &#147;coarse.&#148; The ACLU claims this has the potential to inject the government into religious disputes, a violation of the Constitution.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">PEN USA&#146;s Freedom to Write Committee warns that legislating or otherwise imposing morality onto broadcasting amounts to censorship. PEN USA sees this ruling and its apparent basis as an attack on the First Amendment and free speech expression. PEN USA further condemns the language of the FCC ruling, specifically the vague concept of &#147;indecency.&#148;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;This is a clear attempt on the part of the FCC to politicize the current controversy over decency, by taking an extemporaneous remark out of context,&quot; said David L. Ulin, Co-chair of PEN's Domestic Freedom-To-Write Committee and a writer and teacher of writing at the university and graduate level. &quot;Words are words, but what is indecent and profane are the attempts of an unelected body like the FCC trying to interject its own arbitrary standards into the public discourse.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Stephen Rohde, a constitutional lawyer and Vice President of PEN's Domestic Freedom to Read Committee, explained that &quot;once a government agency like the FCC starts to punish television and radio stations for incidental spontaneous remarks under vaguely worded regulations, everyone's free speech is in danger. Ambiguous regulations allow bureaucrats to translate there personal views, often political and sometimes religious, into prohibitions on certain language, which eventually removes certain ideas from the marketplace.&quot;</FONT></P><P></P><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
