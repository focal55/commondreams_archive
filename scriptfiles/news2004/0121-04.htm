<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - January 21 - The following is the statement of Ron Pollack, Executive Director of Families USA, about President Bush's health care proposal in the State of the Union Message:</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Only the wealthiest and healthiest people in America will receive help from President Bush's tax credits.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;When the proposed tax credits lure the wealthiest and healthiest into high-deductible health plans, they will leave only the sicker and poorer in traditional insurance. As a result, premiums for people who remain in traditional insurance - those who need health care the most - are likely to soar.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The President's tax credit proposal will fail to help millions of hardworking Americans seeking relief from skyrocketing health costs. This tax give-away for people who need help the least is the wrong prescription.&quot; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><I>Families USA is the national organization for health care consumers. It is nonprofit and nonpartisan and advocates for high-quality, affordable health care for all Americans.</I></FONT></P><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
