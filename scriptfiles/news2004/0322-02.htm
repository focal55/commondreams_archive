<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - March 22 - 9/11 CitizensWatch and 9/11 victim family members will hold a press conference at the National Press Club, 529 14th St. NW, 13th Floor, Morrow Room, Washington, D.C. at 1:00 pm on Monday, March 22nd.  C-SPAN has scheduled LIVE coverage on its flagship channel. </FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">A watchdog group, 9/11 CitizensWatch that monitors the official 9/11 investigation, will be joined by 9/11 survivors and family members of those who lost loved ones on Flight 77, Flight 11 and at the World Trade Center and Pentagon.  Speaking family members some of whom have never spoken out include William Rodriquez, April Gallup, and Henry Hughes.  The group will also be joined by former Bush I official, Catherine Austin Fitts. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">They will formally present as yet unanswered questions regarding the attacks of September 11th, 2001.  They are set to present tough questions for the 9/11 Commission witnesses giving testimony at upcoming hearings on March 23rd and 24th. [<A HREF="http://www.9-11commission.gov" TARGET="_new">www.9-11commission.gov</A>] </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The conference comes on the heals of a leading victim family group, the 9/11 Family Steering Committee, calling for the resignation of the Executive Director of the 9/11 Commission following former Counter-terrorism chief Richard Clarke's shocking revelations yesterday that Dr. Zelikow sat in on meetings at which Clarke detailed the imminent threat posed by Al-Qeada.  Clarke also have revealed in his recently released book that despite a record of carrying out multiple attacks on Americans Al-Qeada was simply not a priority for the Bush administration. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">It also comes a day before the two days of hearings of the 9/11 Commission which for the first time, in over a year, should recieve extensive media coverage. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">CitizensWatch is joining the Family Steering Committee in calling for the resignation of Dr. Zelikow and calling on all concerned Americans to lobby for his removal if he doesn't step.  The group is also calling on public sworn testimony from all officials who can inform the investigation including Bush, Cheney, Clinton, Gore, Rice and now Zelikow.  An ad campaign calling for such testimony is being launched today in the D.C. Metro system and in the Washington Post. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;We are posing questions for top officials from current and former administrations that we feel must be answered before the 9/11 Commission, under oath and in public.  Americans deserve a transparent investigation into this tragic world-changing event.  The concerns and key questions raised by families and citizens remain to be addressed,&quot; insisted, John Judge, a co-founder of 9/11 CitizensWatch.. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The 9/11 Commission currently investigating the attacks will be holding hearings next week with members of the Clinton and Bush administrations. Notably absent is National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice who has refused to offer sworn public testimony.  &quot;There is a growing chorus calling for public testimony from not only Condoleezza Rice, but also from Bush and Cheney. Ongoing stonewalling is not only an affront to the victims and their families, but conveys a sense to the American people that they have something to hide. Full disclosure and accountability is a must,&quot; said Kyle F. Hence of CitizensWatch. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Current administration resistance to a public inquiry began shortly after members of Congress called for a Commission inquiry and public hearings. 9/11 Commission chair Gov. Thomas Kean and other members have consistently spoken out about a pattern by the FAA, NORAD and the current administration of withholding or delaying access to documents and testimony. Commissioner Bob Kerry recently said that they could not do a thorough investigation under the restrictions currently imposed by the White House staff and even through out the possibility he would resign if access was not granted the entire Commission. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Organizers and 9/11 family members have consistently raised disturbing and unsettling questions for potential witnesses, based on solid independent research and analysis.  Jamie Gorelick, one of the 9/11 Commissioners, referred to the questions posed by 9/11 widow Mindy Kleinberg of the 9/11 Family Steering Committee as a 'road map' for the Commission [<A HREF="http://www.911independentcommission.org" TARGET="_new">www.911independentcommission.org</A>].  &quot;We feel these questions are best answered openly in a public forum not in closed interviews or overly classified reports. We want to send a clear message to all individuals in a position to provide the country with a full accounting to do so in the open,&quot; said Kyle Hence, one of the event organizers. </FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
