<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- October 25 -- Three former Foreign Service Officerstell their compelling personal stories this week in a national speaking tour. Beginning today in Wisconsin, they will explain how President Bush's policiesmade their day-to-day work as US diplomats impossible and forced them to resign (see tour locations and dates below).&quot;I served the United States for 35 years and under seven administrations,&quot;says Ann Wright.  &quot;I resigned from a career as a diplomat -- a job I dearly loved -- because I could not defend the policies of the Bush administration toward Iraq.  Ironically, as a 29 year veteran of the Army Reserves, I could still be sent there at any time.&quot;<br></font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;I left the Foreign Service because I thought President Bush had failed to consider the full ramifications of the war, including the number of casualties,&quot; says John Brown.&quot;I left the US Embassy in Athens at the beginning of March, 2003,&quot; says Brady Kiesling.  &quot;I emptied out my apartment and flew to New York to put forward as best I could the case that US foreign policy was on the wrong track.&quot;<br></font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">    All three reluctantly became activists and joined Diplomats and Military Commanders for Change (DMCC), an unprecedented coalition of over 50 career chiefs of mission and retired four-star military leaders which is urging that President Bush not be re-elected. On September 30 DMCC issued a statement, noting that, &quot;The claim that we<br>are safer is the biggest lie of this campaign season.&quot; Many of the former officials served under President Reagan and President George H. W. Bush.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">    Schedule:<br>     Monday, October 25, Green Bay, WI, UW Campus, Christe Theater. 12 noon<br>     Tuesday, October 26, Columbus, OH, location TBA<br>     Wednesday, October 27, Cincinnati, OH, UC Law School, 4:30 pm<br>     Thursday, October 28, Albuquerque, NM, University of NM, Mitchell Hall<br>      101, 7 pm<br>     Friday, October 29, Taos, NM, Ramada Inn (615 Pueblo Del Sur), 6:30 pm<br>     Saturday, October 30, Sante Fe, NM, Unitarian Church, Santa Fe, 1 pm</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">    Ann Wright will also be visiting Jacksonville, Florida.
