<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- November 17 -- The International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM), the representative body for many of the world's largest mining and metals companies, will have an active presence at the World Conservation Forum. The Forum is organised by IUCN - <a href="http://www.iucn.org/congress/index.cfm" target="_new">The World Conservation Union in Bangkok</a>, Thailand on 18-20 November 2004. The ICMM delegation will include Bobby Godsell, CEO of AngloGold Ashanti and ICMM's Secretary General, Paul Mitchell. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Leading mining companies believe that responsibly managed mining operations can contribute positively to biodiversity conservation through good biodiversity practices and through helping alleviate poverty. Their participation in this event is grounded on their conviction that biodiversity conservation and sustainable development require business, governments and civil society to work collaboratively. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Paul Mitchell, ICMM Secretary General says: <br>&quot;The mining industry recognises that, like many industrial sectors, it has made mistakes in the past. We know that we still have a long way to go and pledge to address the deep-rooted level of mistrust of our industry within conservation circles. Our members are committed to keeping their negative impacts to a minimum and believe that, if properly integrated into regional development and biodiversity conservation strategies, mineral-related investment can help alleviate poverty as well as foster improvements in the health, education and standard of living of local and indigenous communities.&quot; </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Leading companies are pursuing onsite and offsite opportunities to enhance their contributions to biodiversity conservation. These include assessments and conservation of flora and fauna, research and development and support for protected area site management programmes. A number of companies have also established partnerships with conservation groups, and these are beginning to deliver on-the-ground conservation outcomes. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ICMM will be involved in the following sessions: </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bobby Godsell will participate in a CEO Forum on &quot;Corporate Response to the Challenge of the World Conservation Forum&quot; (Session 580, Thursday 18 November from 12.00 to 13.30 in Rooms 3 and 4) </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Paul Mitchell will address the closing plenary of the Forum's &quot;Health, Poverty &amp; Conservation&quot; theme (Saturday 20 November from 09.00 to 11.30 in Plenary Hall 2) </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ICMM will participate in &quot;Looking for Conservation Solutions: Business &amp; Biodiversity Case Studies&quot;, a workshop under the Forum's &quot;Markets, Business &amp; Environment&quot; theme organised by Conservation International (Session 270, Friday 19 November, 12.00 to 14.00 in Room 3) </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ICMM will host &quot;Mining and Metal Industry Contributions to Biodiversity Conservation &#150; Developing Good Practice Guidance,&quot; a conservation platform to report back on the IUCN-ICMM dialogue and seek feedback on the preparation of this document, which is being carried out as part of the Dialogue to guide companies' biodiversity practices (Session 331, Saturday 20 November, 12.00 to 14.00 in Room 3) </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A publication compiling case studies of good practice in mining and biodiversity and other materials will be available at the ICMM booth (Plaza P22) and online at www.icmm.com/library_pub_detail.php?rcd=1 73. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Notes to Editors: </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The International Council on Mining and Metals is a CEO-led organisation dedicated to sustainable development. ICMM comprises many of the world's leading mining and metals companies as well as regional, national and commodity associations, all of which are committed to improving their sustainable development performance and to the responsible production of the mineral and metal resources society needs. ICMM's vision is a viable mining, minerals and metals industry that is widely recognised as essential for modern living and a key contributor to sustainable development. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ICMM' 16 corporate members are: <br>Alcoa, Anglo American, AngloGold Ashanti, BHP Billiton, Freeport-McMoRan, Lonmin, Mitsubishi Materials, Newmont, Nippon Mining &amp; Metals, Noranda, Placer Dome, Rio Tinto, Sumitomo Metal Mining, Umicore, WMC Resources, Zinifex. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ICMM's 27 association members are: <br>Chamber of Mines of South Africa, Consejo Minero, Eurometaux, Euromines, Federation of Indian Mineral Industries, Indonesian Mining Association, Industrial Minerals Association-Europe, Instituto Brasileiro de Minera&ccedil;ao, International Aluminium Institute, International Copper Association, International Lead Zinc Research Organization, International Wrought Copper Council, International Zinc Association, Japan Mining Industry Association, Minerals Council of Australia, Mining Association of Canada, Mining Industries Associations of Southern Africa, Nickel Institute, Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada, <br>Sociedad Nacional de Miner&iacute;a y Petr&oacute;leo, Sociedad Nacional de Miner&iacute;a, SveMin, The Cobalt Development Institute, World Coal Institute. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>About the IUCN-ICMM Dialogue </i></font></p><p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Set up in 2002 at the World Summit on Sustainable Development, the Dialogue aims to improve <br>the mining and metals industry's performance in biodiversity conservation and to raise mutual awareness and understanding between the industry and the conservation community. </font></i></p><p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Dialogue provides a platform for communities, corporations, non-governmental organisations, and governments to discuss and seek the best balance between the protection of ecosystems and the social <br>and economic importance of mining. </font></i></p><p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">IUCN and ICMM have committed themselves to facilitating this discussion with the ultimate objective of enhancing the contribution of the mining industry to biodiversity conservation. </font></i></p><p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">About the &quot;No-Go&quot; pledge <br>ICMM corporate members issued a landmark position statement on mining and protected areas in September 2003, which commits them &quot;not to explore or mine in World Heritage Sites&quot;. This statement establishes key precedents for the mining and extractive industries at large. ICMM is currently examining the possibility of developing a reporting requirement, which would measure members' performance against their &quot;no-go&quot; commitment.

Over 3,000 delegates are expected. The Congress is the governing body of IUCN &#150; The World Conservation Union. It is held every four years and represents the world's largest democratic environmental forum where governments and non-governmental organisations jointly establish conservation priorities, guide the Union's policy and approve its Programme.</font></i></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
