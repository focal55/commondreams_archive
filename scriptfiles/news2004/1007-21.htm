PORTLAND, Oregon - October 7 - Children’s advocates and media experts sent letters today to all members of the U.S. Senate and House appropriations and commerce committees, asking them to cut off funding for the Federal Communications Commission’s campaign to prod Americans to buy digital TV sets.  

<p>The letter was written and organized by Commercial Alert, an anti-commercialism group.  The letter follows:
<p>Dear Senator:

<p>On October 4th, Federal Communications Commission Chairman Michael Powell announced that the FCC was launching a campaign to convince the public to buy digital television sets. The campaign even has a website, at <a href="http://www.dtv.gov" target="_new">www.dtv.gov</a>, bearing the slogan “DTV: Get It!”

<p>Many of these new digital TV sets are extremely expensive – some cost $3,000 dollars or more – which says a lot about why consumer electronics companies such as Sony and Panasonic are “partnering” with the FCC to promote them.

<p>Do you really believe that with all the troubles facing our nation, the federal government should be on a crusade to encourage people to buy costly new television sets?

<p>Television is a major public health problem.  It is a factor in many diseases, syndromes and unhealthy habits, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, violence, aggression, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, poor fitness and smoking.

<p>Television is an incubator of disrespect for parents.  TV ads are crafted to set children against their parents and stir dissension in the home.  In addition, some political theorists, such as Robert Putnam, believe that television is in part responsible for civic decline in the United States.

<p>Americans don't need the federal government telling them to buy new television sets, and they certainly don't need their hard-earned tax dollars spent in this manner.

<p>We strongly urge you eliminate all funding for this campaign immediately.
<p>&nbsp;
<p>Sincerely,
<p>Nicholas Johnson, former Commissioner, Federal Communications Commission
