<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - March 23 - On Monday, March 29, at two separate briefings on Capitol Hill, community leaders from across the country will give testimony to Congress about the weapons destroying their communities and ask Congressional members to invest in communities in order to make our homeland secure.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The unveiling of the NPA People's Platform will take place at two Congressional briefings at 1:30 pm. The Senate briefing is in the Hart Building, Room 902 and the House briefing is in the Rayburn Building, Room 2362A. The briefings are part of the 33rd Annual National People's Action (NPA) conference (agenda attached). </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">At the briefings, community leaders will give testimony on the issues most important to them and their families.

An America where neighbors trust each other and feel safe in their homes -- their largest investment. An America where jobs pay well and workers reap the benefits of their hard work. The true American Dream is an America where we can count on clean air, water and food that is plentiful and safe to eat. This America is close at hand if we destroy these weapons of mass destruction,&quot; said Inez Killingworth, NPA co-chair and chair of NPA's House Briefing. NPA is a 33-year-old multi-racial/ethnic, inter-generational non-partisan coalition of hundreds of local community organizations that volunteer their time to make communities throughout the U.S. safer, healthier and more stable environments. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">NPA was founded by Gale Cincotta in 1972. With her leadership, NPA spearheaded efforts to pass the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) and the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA). CRA is credited with investing over $1 trillion dollars in low/moderate income neighborhoods and families. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>33rd Annual Neighborhoods Conference</B></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Renaissance Hotel, 999 9th Street NW, Washington Dc </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">SCHEDULE OF EVENTS</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">SUNDAY, MARCH 28, 2004</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Workshops: 8 a.m. to 9:15 a.m.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">EDUCATION: Parents and community leaders will discuss the ramifications of No Child Left Behind on their communities, especially in the areas of special education and school construction. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">PREDATORY LENDING: Predatory mortgage lenders are allowed to operate in our neighborhoods and threaten to dismantle the safest place for millions of Americans - their homes.
