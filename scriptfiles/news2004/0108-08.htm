<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - January 8 - The Environmental Protection Agency's Inspector General (IG) announced today that the Superfund toxic waste cleanup program faced a $174.9 million funding shortfall in fiscal year 2003, slowing toxic cleanup projects at at least 29 Superfund sites in 17 states.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">For the second year in a row, the IG has reported dramatic funding shortfalls for the federal toxic waste cleanup program. Cleanups at America's 1238 Superfund sites have slowed by 50% under the Bush Administration, with only 40 sites cleaned up in fiscal year 2003, compared to an average 87 sites per year in the late 1990's.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The dramatic slowdown in the pace of Superfund cleanups puts millions of Americans at risk of chemical exposure and disease,&quot; said U.S. PIRG Environmental Health Advocate Julie Wolk. &quot;This report shows that, once again, the Bush Administration is failing to protect public health and the environment.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In addition, the Superfund trust fund, which used to pay for the bulk of orphan Superfund cleanups, is virtually bankrupt. While the Bush Administration touts the 70% of Superfund cleanups paid for directly by responsible polluters, 30% of sites do not have a responsible party from whom to recoup cleanup costs. Cleanups at these &quot;orphan sites&quot; had historically been funded by the Superfund trust fund, filled with money from the polluter pays fees. Taxpayers, who paid only 18% the cost of &quot;orphan site&quot; cleanups in 1995, will pay to up to 100% in FY2004.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Without funding from the trust fund, Superfund competes with every other government program for funding,&quot; said Wolk. &quot;Bush Administration should reinstate Superfund's polluter pays fees and make polluters, not regular taxpayers, pay for toxic cleanups,&quot; she concluded.</FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
