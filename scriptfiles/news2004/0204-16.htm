<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - February 4 - The Sierra Club today joined hundreds of national, state and local public interest groups in filing an unprecedented challenge to a Federal Election Commission (FEC) General Counsel draft advisory opinion that could effectively restrict free speech and the right to engage in advocacy on behalf of the public. As a non-profit 501c4 organization, the Sierra Club has been long involved on a non-partisan basis in public advocacy.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Issued under the guise of campaign finance reform, this proposed FEC advisory opinion would effectively prohibit public interest groups from engaging in advocacy involving elected officials and issues in the 2004 federal elections, potential legislation, executive orders or rule changes. Public communication via electronic and paper advertising, mailings, phone calls and emails would all be restricted. Alarmingly, the proposal would make it unlawful to criticize the policies and actions of a sitting President or members of Congress except through federal political action committees (PACs) that are closely monitored by the FEC. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Sierra Club was a strong and visible proponent of the Bipartisan Campaign Finance Reform Act (BCRA) of 2002, but this FEC proposal is not campaign finance reform. It goes far beyond the intent of BCRA and is a blatant attack on constitutionally protected rights to freedom of speech and assembly.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">If approved by the FEC when it convenes this Thursday, this ruling would effect every public policy, public advocacy and membership organization in the United States. An unprecedented collection of 324 environmental, civil rights, civil liberties, women's rights, public health, social welfare, senior, religious and social justice organizations today filed public comments with the FEC challenging the proposal.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Ironically, we've heard nothing but deafening silence from conservative organizations that would be equally affected -- where are the National Rifle Association, National Right to Life Committee, Christian Coalition and American Center for Law and Justice, all of which ordinarily are vociferous regarding issues of freedom of speech and association? Could they be part of a partisan effort to silence progressive groups in 2004? If not, we hope they will find their voices before it's too late. If they don't, we'll have our answer -- it's election-year politics, pure and simple. </FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
