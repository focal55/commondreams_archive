<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BOSTON -- December 29 -- </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today Oxfam America, the Boston-based international relief and development organization, announced a $5 million dollar appeal in support of the Asia Earthquake Fund.</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since Sunday morning, the question Oxfam has received around the clock has been, &quot;How can I help?&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The most effective way for concerned citizens to help, and to have the most impact in the lives of those affected by the tsunami, is to make a monetary donation to Oxfam America. Additional funding will increase Oxfam's capacity to provide life-saving aid to tsunami survivors during this critical period. Funding will also help support rebuilding efforts in South East Asia over the long term.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Those interested in making a donation to support Oxfam's humanitarian response efforts in Southeast Asia, can do so by:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Calling: 1-800-77-OXFAM</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Visiting our website at: <a href="http://www.oxfamamerica.org/" target="_new">http://www.oxfamamerica.org</a></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Or by mailing a check to: Oxfam America, Asia Earthquake Fund, PO Box 1211, Albert Lea, MN 56007-1211.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Because of Oxfam's network of contacts in local communities and years of support for the local grassroots organizations we partner with, aid workers were able to provide assistance to survivors immediately after the tsunamis hit. Aid has included water, sanitation equipment to prevent the spread of disease, food and temporary housing. In addition, Oxfam has deployed flood and public health experts to the region. Our long-term commitment to the regions of South and South East Asia, including over 30 years of operations in Sri Lanka alone, uniquely positioned us to respond quickly and effectively when the tsunami hit.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Relief operations by Oxfam staff are under way in four of the countries worst hit by the massive tsunami wave that is known to have so far killed over 70,000 people. This regional disaster will require massive and sustained assistance to prevent continued suffering. Oxfam is concerned that donors provide new aid and do not divert aid from other crises. The agency calls on the international community to channel its response through the United Nations in the interests of effective co-ordination.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The first fifteen days after a natural disaster are crucial. Because of water contamination and unsanitary conditions, thousands more can die during this initial period if clean water, sanitation and food are not delivered immediately. Oxfam has been working on this first phase of aid delivery since Sunday. But once the critical phase has subsided, Oxfam will stay in the region, and continue to work with local communities and grassroots organizations to help rebuild communities through agriculture, and micro-finance and credit programs.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For additional information on Oxfam America's humanitarian response in Asia, please contact Adrienne Smith at 1-617-728-2406</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Oxfam America is a Boston-based international development and relief agency and an affiliate of Oxfam International. Working with local partners, Oxfam delivers development programs and emergency relief services, and campaigns for change in global practices and policies that keep people in poverty.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
