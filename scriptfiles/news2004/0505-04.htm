<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">GREAT FALLS, MT - May 5 - A study released today uses federal government data to demonstrate that the Blackleaf area of Montana&#146;s Rocky Mountain Front, which is now being studied for possible new drilling by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), contains less than a day&#146;s worth of natural gas and 15 minutes of oil for the nation. The analysis also found that the entire Front (federal lands) contains less than a week&#146;s worth of natural gas and 20 minutes of oil. </FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;This report shows that it makes no sense to drill the Front,&quot; said Gene Sentz from the Front community of Choteau. &quot;For almost a 100 years, Montanans have worked together to protect the Front. It&#146;s crazy to throw that legacy away for a miniscule amount of natural gas &#150; especially when so many other places in the Rockies are already open to energy exploration.&quot;</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">One of America&#146;s most stunning landscapes, Montana&#146;s Rocky Mountain Front faces a new round of natural gas drilling proposals. The 45 day &quot;scoping&quot; period for a BLM analysis of drilling in the Blackleaf area of the Front ends June 1 and BLM open houses on drilling in this area also are happening this month.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">To better understand the tradeoffs with proposed energy development on the Front, The Wilderness Society used data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) to estimate the amount of &quot;economically recoverable&quot; natural gas and oil along the Front and several sub-areas. &quot;Economically recoverable&quot; oil and gas (defined as &quot;technically recoverable&quot; gas that is estimated to be profitable to extract) is recommended by the Congressional Research Service as the appropriate basis for policy analysis.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">KEY REPORT FINDINGS</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Blackleaf area contains less than a day&#146;s worth of natural gas and 15 minutes of oil for the nation.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Badger Two Medicine area contains less than two days of natural gas and five seconds of oil.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The entire Montana Front (federal lands) contains less than a week of natural gas and 20 minutes of oil.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;It's important that the public have a full understanding of what&#146;s at stake along the Front,&quot; said The Wilderness Society&#146;s Peter Aengst. &quot;Drilling the Front could mean trading a few minutes of oil and a few days of gas for a lifetime of watershed protection, recreation, hunting and other benefits for current and future generations of Montanans.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">You may download and view the report fact sheet, &quot;<A HREF="http://www.wilderness.org/Library/Documents/loader.cfm?url=/commonspot/security/getfile.cfm&PageID=8995" TARGET="_NEW">A GIS Analysis of Economically Recoverable Gas and Oil in the Rocky Mountain Front of Montana</A>.&quot; This fact sheet includes summary tables and an explanation of methodology. </FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
