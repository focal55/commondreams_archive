<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">HOUSTON -- November 1 -- </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Two years before the September 11 attacks, presidential candidate George W. Bush was already talking privately about the political benefits of attacking Iraq, according to his former ghost writer, who held many conversations with then-Texas Governor Bush in preparation for a planned autobiography.</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;He was thinking about invading Iraq in 1999,&quot; said author and journalist Mickey Herskowitz. &quot;It was on his mind. He said to me: 'One of the keys to being seen as a great leader is to be seen as a commander-in-chief.' And he said, 'My father had all this political capital built up when he drove the Iraqis out of Kuwait and he wasted it.' He said, 'If I have a chance to invade.if I had that much capital, I'm not going to waste it. I'm going to get everything passed that I want to get passed and I'm going to have a successful presidency.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Herskowitz said that Bush expressed frustration at a lifetime as an underachiever in the shadow of an accomplished father. In aggressive military action, he saw the opportunity to emerge from his father's shadow. The moment, Herskowitz said, came in the wake of the September 11 attacks. &quot;Suddenly, he's at 91 percent in the polls, and he'd barely crawled out of the bunker.&quot; </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">That President Bush and his advisers had Iraq on their minds long before weapons inspectors had finished their work -- and long before alleged Iraqi ties with terrorists became a central rationale for war -- has been raised elsewhere, including in a book based on recollections of former Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill. However, Herskowitz was in a unique position to hear Bush's unguarded and unfiltered views on Iraq, war and other matters - well before he became president. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1999, Herskowitz struck a deal with the campaign of George W. Bush about a ghost-written autobiography, which was ultimately titled A Charge to Keep: My Journey to the White House, and he and Bush signed a contract in which the two would split the proceeds. The publisher was William Morrow. Herskowitz was given unimpeded access to Bush, and the two met approximately 20 times so Bush could share his thoughts. Herskowitz began working on the book in May 1999, and says that within two months he had completed and submitted some 10 chapters, with a remaining 4 to 6 chapters still on his computer. Herskowitz was replaced as Bush's ghostwriter after Bush's handlers concluded that the candidate's views and life experiences were not being cast in a sufficiently positive light. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to Herskowitz, who has authored more than 30 books, many of them jointly written autobiographies of famous Americans in politics, sports and media (including that of Reagan adviser Michael Deaver), Bush and his advisers were sold on the idea that it was difficult for a president to accomplish an electoral agenda without the record-high approval numbers that accompany successful if modest wars.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The revelations on Bush's attitude toward Iraq emerged recently during two taped interviews of Herskowitz, which included a discussion of a variety of matters, including his continued closeness with the Bush family, indicated by his subsequent selection to pen an authorized biography of Bush's grandfather, written and published last year with the assistance and blessing of the Bush family. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Herskowitz also revealed the following:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- In 2003, Bush's father indicated to him that he disagreed with his son's invasion of Iraq.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Bush admitted that he failed to fulfill his Vietnam-era domestic National Guard service obligation, but claimed that he had been &quot;excused.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Bush revealed that after he left his Texas National Guard unit in 1972 under murky circumstances, he never piloted a plane again. That casts doubt on the carefully-choreographed moment of Bush emerging in pilot's garb from a jet on the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln in 2003 to celebrate &quot;Mission Accomplished&quot; in Iraq. The image, instantly telegraphed around the globe, and subsequent hazy White House statements about his capacity in the cockpit, created the impression that a heroic Bush had played a role in landing the craft. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Bush described his own business ventures as &quot;floundering&quot; before campaign officials insisted on recasting them in a positive light.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Throughout the interviews for this article and in subsequent conversations, Herskowitz indicated he was conflicted over revealing information provided by a family with which he has longtime connections, and by how his candor could comport with the undefined operating principles of the as-told-to genre. Well after the interviews -- in which he expressed consternation that Bush's true views, experience and basic essence had eluded the American people -- Herskowitz communicated growing concern about the consequences for himself of the publication of his remarks, and said that he had been under the impression he would not be quoted by name. However, when conversations began, it was made clear to him that the material was intended for publication and attribution. A tape recorder was present and visible at all times. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Several people who know Herskowitz well addressed his character and the veracity of his recollections. &quot;I don't know anybody that's ever said a bad word about Mickey,&quot; said Barry Silverman, a well-known Houston executive and civic figure who worked with him on another book project. An informal survey of Texas journalists turned up uniform confidence that Herskowitz's account as contained in this article could be considered accurate. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One noted Texas journalist who spoke with Herskowitz about the book in 1999 recalls how the author mentioned to him at the time that Bush had revealed things the campaign found embarrassing and did not want in print. He requested anonymity because of the political climate in the state. &quot;I can't go near this,&quot; he said. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to Herskowitz, George W. Bush's beliefs on Iraq were based in part on a notion dating back to the Reagan White House - ascribed in part to now-Vice President Dick Cheney, Chairman of the House Republican Policy Committee under Reagan. &quot;Start a small war. Pick a country where there is justification you can jump on, go ahead and invade.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bush's circle of pre-election advisers had a fixation on the political capital that British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher collected from the Falklands War. Said Herskowitz: &quot;They were just absolutely blown away, just enthralled by the scenes of the troops coming back, of the boats, people throwing flowers at (Thatcher) and her getting these standing ovations in Parliament and making these magnificent speeches.&quot; </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Republicans, Herskowitz said, felt that Jimmy Carter's political downfall could be attributed largely to his failure to wage a war. He noted that President Reagan and President Bush's father himself had (besides the narrowly-focused Gulf War I) successfully waged limited wars against tiny opponents -- Grenada and Panama -- and gained politically. But there were successful small wars, and then there were quagmires, and apparently George H.W. Bush and his son did not see eye to eye.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;I know (Bush senior) would not admit this now, but he was opposed to it. I asked him if he had talked to W about invading Iraq. He said, 'No I haven't, and I won't, but Brent (Scowcroft) has.' Brent would not have talked to him without the old man's okaying it.&quot; Scowcroft, national security adviser in the elder Bush's administration, penned a highly publicized warning to George W. Bush about the perils of an invasion. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Herskowitz's revelations are not the sole indicator of Bush's pre-election thinking on Iraq. In Dec. 1999, some six months after his talks with Herskowitz, Bush surprised veteran political chroniclers, including the Boston Globe's David Nyhan, with his blunt pronouncements about Saddam at a six-way New Hampshire primary event that got little notice: &quot;It was a gaffe-free evening for the rookie front-runner, till he was asked about Saddam's weapons stash,&quot; wrote Nyhan. &quot;'I'd take 'em out,' (Bush) grinned cavalierly, 'take out the weapons of mass destruction...I'm surprised he's still there,' said Bush of the despot who remains in power after losing the Gulf War to Bush Jr.'s father...It remains to be seen if that offhand declaration of war was just Texas talk, a sort of locker room braggadocio, or whether it was Bush's first big clinker.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The notion that President Bush held unrealistic or naove views about the consequences of war was further advanced recently by a Bush supporter, the evangelist Pat Robertson, who revealed that Bush had told him the Iraq invasion would yield no casualties. In addition, in recent days, high-ranking US military officials have complained that the White House did not provide them with adequate resources for the task at hand. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Herskowitz considers himself a friend of the Bush family, and has been a guest at the family vacation home in Kennebunkport. In the late 1960s, Herskowitz, a longtime Houston Chronicle sports columnist designated President Bush's father, then-Congressman George H.W. Bush, to replace him as a guest columnist, and the two have remained close since then. (Herskowitz was suspended briefly in April without pay for reusing material from one of his own columns, about legendary UCLA basketball coach John Wooden.) </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1999, when Herskowitz turned in his chapters for Charge to Keep, Bush's staff expressed displeasure -- often over Herskowitz's use of language provided by Bush himself. In a chapter on the oil business, Herskowitz included Bush's own words to describe the Texan's unprofitable business ventures, writing: &quot;the companies were floundering. I got a call from one of the campaign lawyers, he was kind of angry, and he said, 'You've got some wrong information.' I didn't bother to say, 'Well you know where it came from.' (The lawyer) said, 'We do not consider that the governor struggled or floundered in the oil business. We consider him a successful oilman who started up at least two new businesses.'&quot; </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the end, campaign officials decided not to go with Herskowitz's account, and, moreover, demanded everything back. &quot;The lawyer called me and said, 'Delete it. Shred it. Just do it.'&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;They took it and (communications director) Karen (Hughes) rewrote it,&quot; he said. A campaign official arrived at his home at seven a.m. on a Monday morning and took his notes and computer files. However, Herskowitz, who is known for his memory of anecdotes from his long history in journalism and book publishing, says he is confident about his recollections.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to Herskowitz, Bush was reluctant to discuss his time in the Texas Air National Guard -- and inconsistent when he did so. Bush, he said, provided conflicting explanations of how he came to bypass a waiting list and obtain a coveted Guard slot as a domestic alternative to being sent to Vietnam. Herskowitz also said that Bush told him that after transferring from his Texas Guard unit two-thirds through his six-year military obligation to work on an Alabama political campaign, he did not attend any Alabama National Guard drills at all, because he was &quot;excused.&quot; This directly contradicts his public statements that he participated in obligatory training with the Alabama National Guard. Bush's claim to have fulfilled his military duty has been subject to intense scrutiny; he has insisted in the past that he did show up for monthly drills in Alabama - though commanding officers say they never saw him, and no Guardsmen have come forward to accept substantial &quot;rewards&quot; for anyone who can claim to have seen Bush on base. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Herskowitz said he asked Bush if he ever flew a plane again after leaving the Texas Air National Guard in 1972 -- which was two years prior to his contractual obligation to fly jets was due to expire. He said Bush told him he never flew any plane -- military or civilian -- again. That would contradict published accounts in which Bush talks about his days in 1973 working with inner-city children, when he claimed to have taken some of the children up in a plane. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 2002, three years after he had been pulled off the George W. Bush biography, Herskowitz was asked by Bush's father to write a book about the current president's grandfather, Prescott Bush, after getting a message that the senior Bush wanted to see him. &quot;Former President Bush just handed it to me. We were sitting there one day, and I was visiting him there in his office...He said, 'I wish somebody would do a book about my dad.'&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;He said to me, 'I know this has been a disappointing time for you, but it's amazing how many times something good will come out of it.' I passed it on to my agent, he jumped all over it. I asked (Bush senior), 'Would you support it and would you give me access to the rest of family?' He said yes.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">That book, &quot;Duty, Honor, Country: The Life and Legacy of Prescott Bush,&quot; was published in 2003 by Routledge. If anything, the book has been criticized for its over-reliance on the Bush family's perspective and rosy interpretation of events. Herskowitz himself is considered the ultimate &quot;as-told-to&quot; author, lending credibility to his account of what George W. Bush told him. Herskowitz's other books run the gamut of public figures, and include the memoirs of Reagan aide Deaver, former Texas Governor and Nixon Treasury Secretary John Connally, newsman Dan Rather, astronaut Walter Cunningham, and baseball greats Mickey Mantle and Nolan Ryan.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After Herskowitz was pulled from the Bush book project, the biographer learned that a scenario was being prepared to explain his departure. &quot;I got a phone call from someone in the Bush campaign, confidentially, saying 'Watch your back.' &quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Reporters covering Bush say that when they inquired as to why Herskowitz was no longer on the project, Hughes intimated that Herskowitz had personal habits that interfered with his writing - a claim Herskowitz said is unfounded. Later, the campaign put out the word that Herskowitz had been removed for missing a deadline. Hughes subsequently finished the book herself - it received largely critical reviews for its self-serving qualities and lack of spontaneity or introspection.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So, said Herskowitz, the best material was left on the cutting room floor, including Bush's true feelings. &quot;He told me that as a leader, you can never admit to a mistake,&quot; Herskowitz said. &quot;That was one of the keys to being a leader.&quot;<br></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
