<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DEARBORN, MI -- October 25 -- America's Second Harvest, The Nation's Food Bank Network, Paul Newman and Ford Motor Company have partnered for the fourth consecutive year to provide trucks and food to 12 food banks to help address the issue of hunger in America. This year's donation brings the total vehicles in operation to 50. Since it's founding in 2001, the partnership's trucks have traveled over 1,000,000 miles and have distributed over ten million pounds of food to rural areas in need.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The USDA reports that the poverty rate for non-metropolitan areas is higher than in metro areas, 14 % vs. 11%; in addition, 2.6 million children living in rural areas are poor, accounting for 35 percent of the entire rural poverty population. Of the nation's 386 rural counties, 340 counties have persistent poverty rates.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These refrigerated trucks will help get fresh and nutritious food into hard-to-reach communities that are often underserved. Often, many fresh foods, such as produce and meats, cannot be delivered due to lack of refrigeration during long delivery routes.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Paul Newman said of the alliance, &quot;This has been a compelling and rewarding partnership. We are proud to partner with America's Second Harvest and Ford.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Ford Motor Company is proud to partner with America's Second Harvest and Paul Newman to help improve food distribution in our communities,&quot; said Tim O'Brien, vice president Corporate Relations. &quot;Supporting our communities is part of Ford's heritage and it is an important component of our corporate culture.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to Robert Forney, President and CEO, America's Second Harvest, &quot;The latest Census figures confirm that poverty and unemployment rates are as high, if not higher in rural America than in metropolitan areas. It's shameful that so many people need to turn to a hunger-relief program in their community just to eat in the very same communities where the food is raised,&quot; said Forney.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">America's Second Harvest is the largest domestic hunger-relief organization in the United States, feeding people in rural, urban and suburban communities.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Paul Newman, as sole owner of Newman's Own, donates all his profits and royalties after taxes for educational and charitable purposes. Paul Newman has given over $150 million to thousands of charities since 1982.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The cities receiving this year's trucks are:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Capital Area Food Bank, Austin, Texas</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Second Harvest Food Bank of Northeast Tennessee, Gray</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Gleaners Community Food Bank Serving Southeast Michigan</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Tri State Food Bank, Evansville, Indiana</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Great Plains Food Bank, Fargo</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- God's Pantry Food Bank, Lexington, Kentucky</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Middle Georgia Food Bank, Macon</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Food Bank of Northern Indiana, South Bend</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- South Plains Food Bank, Lubbock, Texas</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- America's Second Harvest of Greater St Joseph, St. Joseph, Missouri</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- The Community Food Bank of Tucson</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Kansas Foodbank Warehouse, Wichita</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
