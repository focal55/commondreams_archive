<p><i><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"We need legal reform because the strength of our economy is undermined by frivolous lawsuits." - Dick Cheney
</font></i><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON - September 14 - Vice President Cheney, corporate front groups and their allies in Congress say the court system is filled with too many lawsuits even though nearly half of all lawsuits each year are filed by corporations suing other corporations. 

</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A HalliburtonWatch.org survey of court actions filed by Halliburton and its subsidiaries between 1995 and 2000 – the period when Cheney was CEO of the company -- found that Halliburton was involved in 151 court claims it filed in 15 states around the nation. On average, Halliburton petitioned America's legal system 30 times per year while Cheney was CEO. In filing these court actions, Halliburton was seeking everything from injunctions and evictions to payments of debt.

</a></font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Most of Halliburton's court actions were filed against other corporations, with only 24 of the 151 claims filed against individuals. Thirty-three of the claims (or 22 percent) were filed by Halliburton's subsidiary, Dresser Industries, against insurance companies. Although Halliburton earns billions in revenues each year, it sued people or corporations in small claims court for as little as $1,500. It sued 15 debtors for less than $10,000 each, 24 debtors for less than $15,000 each and 40 debtors for less than $100,000 each. 

</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Vice president Cheney says he believes the number of personal injury lawsuits has skyrocketed over the years and is supporting tort reform legislation designed to stop it. But studies have shown that the number of those lawsuits is actually declining. Between 1993 and 2002, personal injury lawsuits declined by 5 percent while lawsuits based on contract disputes increased by 21 percent. Moreover, the number of lawsuits involving contract disputes between corporations is ten times the number of lawsuits filed by injured consumers in products liability and medical malpractice actions. Studies also show that doctor mistakes kill more people each year than auto accidents, breast cancer or AIDS - an indication that doctors, not lawyers, are most responsible for lawsuits filed against them. 

</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Although we're hearing a lot of blather from Mr. Cheney and his colleagues about ‘frivolous’ lawsuits, they never bother to mention that corporations like Halliburton file more lawsuits than ordinary citizens, and no one ever questions whether those corporate lawsuits are frivolous," says Jim Donahue of HalliburtonWatch.org. "The next time Cheney complains about lawsuits clogging the courts, reporters should ask why Halliburton so frequently resorted to the judicial system when Cheney was in charge of the company. It is not just billion dollar companies who deserve their day in court." </font>
