<p align="LEFT"><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- October 26 -- While taxpayers in Florida have paid 7.8 billion dollars for the war in Iraq, their state received less than 500 million dollars in 2003 to protect itself from terrorist attacks. Ohio residents have been charged 5.7 billion dollars of the Iraq bill, but they received just one-tenth of that amount in 2003 to fund President Bush&#146;s signature education program, No Child Left Behind. And in Texas, the federal government has contributed just 3.75 billion dollars to fund Homeland Security and No Child Left Behind, while the </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">people of Texas have spent over 11 billion dollars to fund the war in Iraq. <br> </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These are some of the highlights of &#147;State-by-State: The Bill for the Iraq War&#148; &#150; an interactive map released this morning by the National Priorities Project and the Center for American Progress that details the cost of the Iraq war from the perspective of the states.
