Instead, the Northern governments forged the new Clean Development Mechanism, which even Kyoto Protocol supporters concede has failed to forge new pathways of development.  The CDM allows Northern countries to evade limits on their carbon emissions already committed, by setting up projects in Southern countries, including &quot;cheap&quot; carbon &quot;sinks&quot; such as large-scale tree plantations.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Monoculture tree plantations are devastating for local communities and for the environment,&quot; said Rachel Nunez of the World Rainforest Movement. &quot;If the Kyoto Protocol allows large plantations of genetically modified trees to count as clean development projects, the results will be catastrophic,&quot; she added.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Current carbon trading schemes involve governments, export credit agencies, corporations and international financial institutions-all of whom continue to invest in and support fossil fuel exploitation and use-but not the people whose land, air and water, and lives and most directly affected.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At today's press conference, the Institute for Policy Studies released an expose of the biggest carbon trading proponent, the World Bank.  Wrong Turn From Rio: The World Bank's Road to Climate Catastrophe demonstrates how the World Bank has systematically transformed Kyoto tools including carbon trading schemes into mechanisms for institutional profit and maintaining the status quo.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The World Bank has done more than any other institution to entrench the global fossil fuel industry,&quot; said Nadia Martinez of the Institute for Policy Studies.  &quot;It must be removed from any scheme that purports to solve the climate crisis.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Daily updates on the Climate Justice blogs: <a href="http://climatejustice.blogspot.com" target="_new">http://climatejusticeblogspot.com</a> (English) and <a href="http://justiciaclimatica.blogspot.com%20" target="_new">http://justiciaclimatica.blogspot.com</a> (Spanish).</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Also check <a href="http://globaljusticeecology.org/" target="_new">http://globaljusticeecology.org</a><br></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
