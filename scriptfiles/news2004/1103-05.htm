<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- November 3 -- Planned Parenthood Action Fund today expressed its determination to continue fighting forward for women's reproductive rights regardless of the presidential election's outcome.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;In a political race, there is always a winner and a loser,&quot; said Planned Parenthood Action Fund President Gloria Feldt. &quot;But it is also true that every victory sows the seeds of the next defeat and every defeat sows the seeds of the next victory. Today we at the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, along with America's pro-choice majority, dedicate ourselves to forging ahead in the fight for women's reproductive rights and health. These election results are not a mandate to move the country yet further to the right on women's rights. We will think and act with unity of purpose and fierceness of heart to protect our human rights. No matter what.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Feldt noted that America will now face decisive battles over the future of the U.S. Supreme Court and attempts to restrict access to abortion, contraception, and comprehensive medically accurate sex education. Feldt also vowed that the Action Fund would work with other human and civil rights organizations to protect and elevate women's reproductive self-determination. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We will fight these and many other battles,&quot; Feldt said, &quot;to continue to work to bring about the day when reproductive rights are understood as fundamental human rights that can never be jeopardized by the outcome of any election.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>The Planned Parenthood Action Fund is an independent, non- partisan, not-for-profit organization formed as the political arm of Planned Parenthood Federation of America. The Action Fund engages in educational and electoral activity including public education campaigns, grassroots organizing, and legislative advocacy</i></font><i>.</i><br></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
