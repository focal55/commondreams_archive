<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - September 8 - The National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty announced today that Diann Rust-Tierney will join the Coalition as its new executive director.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since 1991 Rust-Tierney has served as director of the Capital Punishment Project for the American Civil Liberties Union. As ACLU's lead strategist and spokeswoman on the death penalty, she helped develop and coordinate national strategy on capital punishment. Her efforts included expanding efforts to educate the public about the problems associated with the death penalty and building broad coalitions with new partners to spread the abolitionist message.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Diann brings to us the vision and experience to strengthen our movement,&quot; said Brenda Lewis, chair of the NCADP Board of Directors, in announcing Rust-Tierney's appointment. &quot;NCADP has a dedicated  staff that in recent years has been responsible for a number of successes. With Diann's leadership we believe we can continue to build a national consensus that the death penalty is wrong, both morally and as a matter of public policy.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rust-Tierney said her goals as NCADP's executive director will include making sure that NCADP affiliates continue to play an essential role in educating the public about the death penalty and in pressing for abolition and other reforms. She also pledged that NCADP will build upon its recent successes at state legislative advocacy and expand its efforts to organize against the death penalty within a national and international human rights framework.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The abolition movement is turning a corner,&quot; Rust-Tierney said. &quot;Both the number of executions and the number of death sentences are on the decline. Organizations that traditionally have not taken a stand on capital punishment are speaking up. With the help of new, diverse voices and a more powerful movement of activists, we can and will begin to move abolition bills through the state legislatures.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rust-Tierney received her undergraduate degree in political science from the College of Wooster in Ohio and her law degree from the University of Maryland School of Law. She replaces Steven W. Hawkins as NCADP's permanent executive director. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Last year, NCADP launched its Campaign to End Juvenile Executions and has worked to build diverse coalitions against the juvenile death penalty. NCADP also publishes the monthly Execution Alert, which documents the case of every person facing execution in the United States.</font></p><p></p><p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">###</font></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
