<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - May 10 - ADVISORY FOR THURSDAY, MAY 13 -- Speakers from Peru and Kenya Share Family Planning Successes and Bush Administration Threats</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Pathfinder International, Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Planned Parenthood of Western Washington , Planned Parenthood VOX, Population Action International, Population Connection, and Sierra Club, will sponsor a forum to draw attention to the Bush administration's misguided international family planning policies. Milka Dinev from Peru and Charles Thube from Kenya will tell their personal stories about how access to voluntary family planning can save lives, advance development and protect the environment. Dinev and Thube will explain how the Bush administration's cuts to vital international family planning programs like the United Nations Population Fund and the reinstatement of the global gag rule endanger their accomplishments.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Bush administration's first action in office was to reinstate the global gag rule, which effectively shut down the lines of communication between a doctor and his or her patient. Despite two decades of progress toward saving the lives of women and children and slowing population growth, the Bush administration also cut US funding for the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) - an organization that works in over 150 countries to provide voluntary family planning and basic health care services. In the past year, US funding could have prevented 2 million unwanted pregnancies and saved the lives of an estimated 4,700 mothers and 77,000 children under the age of five.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WHO: Milka Dinev, Peru Country Representative for Pathfinder International</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Charles Thube, Kenya Country Representative for Pathfinder International </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">David Greenberg, Ph.D., Planned Parenthood, Columbia/Willamette</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WHAT: Public forum to highlight Bush administration's misguided international family planning policy and its specific effects on Peru and Kenya</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WHEN: Thursday, May 13th, 6:30 PM to 8:30 PM</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WHERE: Bell Harbor International Conference Center, Seattle, Washington</FONT></P><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
