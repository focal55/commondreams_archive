<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - January 8 -  In an effort to spread the word on the fatal flaws in the guest worker policy announced yesterday by the President, a coalition of progressive and civil rights organizations, labor and immigrant advocacy organizations are launching a Spanish-language TV ad campaign scheduled to hit the airwaves this weekend. The ad urges viewers to contact the White House and ask for a policy that provides a path toward earned legalization and real labor protections.</FONT></p><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The primary beneficiary of President Bush's policy is corporate America, not hardworking immigrants who are supporting our economy, &quot; said Ralph G. Neas, President of People For the American Way.  &quot;With no new help for immigrants seeking to become legal residents and no workplace protections, this plan gives some workers temporary job security, but guarantees that millions of hardworking people will lose everything in the long run.&quot;</FONT></P><P> </P><P> <FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;When their legal status expires in a few years, or if they lose their job, many workers will face deportation,&quot; said Neas.  &quot;What immigrant would raise questions about abusive working conditions if it means they could be fired and deported? It's a policy ripe for exploitation.&quot;</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The coalition creating and funding the ad includes PFAW, the Center For Community Change, the Service Employees International Union, and the National Council of La Raza.  The groups began working together immediately following the announcement of the new policy, and more groups are expected to join as word spreads in the coming days.  The ad was produced by the Squier, Knapp, Dunn media firm and will be aired on Univision and Telemundo.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;It's critical to reach the immigrant population in this country and explain this policy: This is a bad deal.  Don't trade a few years of legal status for the real American dream,&quot; said Neas.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><A HREF="http://www.pfaw.org/pfaw/general/default.aspx?oid=13328" TARGET="_new">Click here</A> to view the ad or read the script.</FONT></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
