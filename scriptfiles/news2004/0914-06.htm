<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - September 14 - President Bush&#146;s bounce from the Republican National Convention was greatly exaggerated and the majority of Americans want the country to move in a new direction, according to experts that gathered at an event sponsored by the Campaign for America&#146;s Future. More Americans support progressive reforms over the current course, according to Lake and Greenberg.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Campaign for America&#146;s Future Co-director Robert Borosage convened the presentation, noting that voters want the country to move in a new direction since the failure of right-wing policies is apparent.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Progressives must stand up and not duck on our values,&#148; said Borosage. &#147;People are looking for straight talk solutions for the problems they worry about when they sit down around their kitchen tables late at night.&#148;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greenberg, Quinlan, and Rosner Research Chairman and CEO Stan Greenberg, who is playing an increasingly prominent role in the fall election, shared new public opinion numbers that illustrate the case.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;America still wants to vote for change and will respond to a Democratic agenda that impacts peoples lives,&#148; said Greenberg.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lake, Snell, Perry and Associates president Celinda Lake, another top progressive public opinion expert summarized results from her battleground polling with a special focus on women voters.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;While any bounce is sobering, we should remember that voters nationwide still see Kerry as better able to handle a range of issues,&#148; said Lake. &#147;When we define the terms of the election on our issues &#151; on our values, we win.&#148;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Borosage outlined progressive messages that move voters and unveiled Straight Talk, a political guide designed to help activists and candidates argue their case. Straight Talk outlines progressive arguments, illustrates the broad support progressive reforms garner and includes personal testimonials and anecdotes on key issues.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An online version of the Straight Talk guide is available at <a href="http://straighttalk.ourfuture.org/" target="_new">straighttalk.ourfuture.org</a>.</font></p><p></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
