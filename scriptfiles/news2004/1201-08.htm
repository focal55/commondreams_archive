<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- December 1 -- Breast Cancer Action submitted testimony to the Advisory Committee for Reproductive Health Drugs at the Food and Drug Administration in opposition to the proposed testosterone transdermal system (NDA 21-769), also known as the testosterone patch or by its trade name, Intrinsa. Both Breast Cancer Action and Our Bodies Ourselves call on the FDA to reject the NDA 21-769 application. The full text of the testimony is available upon request.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;It is now widely accepted that breast cancer is largely a hormonally driven disease,&#148; said Barbara Brenner, executive director of Breast Cancer Action. &#147;There is great concern that any treatment that interferes with the endocrine system will ultimately stimulate some aspect of cancer development.&#148;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;We urge all women&#151;and the agencies charged with protecting their health&#151;to proceed with extreme caution before pursuing hormonal treatments of other medical conditions,&#148; Brenner said. For women who have already been diagnosed with breast cancer, this caution cannot be stated too strongly, as high serum testosterone levels have been linked to a greater likelihood of breast cancer recurrence.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The relatively narrow scope of the application before the committee&#151;for the treatment of &#147;hypoactive sexual desire disorder in surgically menopausal women&#148;&#151;belies the greatest danger that approval would create: off label use. Of particular concern to Breast Cancer Action, for all of the above reasons, are the growing number of women who have menopause induced by chemotherapy. There have been no studies of NDA 21-769 in this population, which may well be at increased risk from testosterone exposure. Yet Procter and Gamble has already indicated that it intends a significant advertising campaign for this product, which will inevitably result in off-label use in this group of at-risk women. The recent experience with advertising of Vioxx is a cautionary tale relevant to the instant applications.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Breast Cancer Action is a national education and advocacy organization whose mission is to carry the voices of people affected by breast cancer to<br>inspire and compel the changes necessary to end the epidemic.</i> <br></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
