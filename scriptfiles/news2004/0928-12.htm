<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - September 28 - Some callers to NBC Nightly News, responding to FAIR's September 28 Action Alert, were told that FAIR's transcript of Tom Brokaw's item (9/24/04) on &quot;liberals [who] want to ban the Bible&quot; was incomplete.  A spokesperson for NBC told callers that FAIR had left out a line in which a representative of a progressive religious group condemned the claim that liberals sought to outlaw the Bible.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Reviewing a videotape of the broadcast, FAIR affirmed that the Nexis transcript quoted in the Action Alert was accurate. The spokesperson now acknowledges that the line she cited did not appear on the air, though it may at some point have been in the script for the newscast.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The email address that appeared with the alert is no longer in use; the correct email address for NBC Nightly News is <a href="mailto:nightly@nbc.com">nightly@nbc.com</a></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">See FAIR's original alert at <a href="http://www.fair.org/activism/brokaw-bible-ban.html" target="_new">http://www.fair.org/activism/brokaw-bible-ban.html.</a></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
