<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - September 29 - Tomorrow's House of Representatives vote on a &quot;Federal Marriage Amendment&quot; (FMA) is an election-year ploy designed to help the Religious Right launch political attacks as the Nov. 2 election approaches, says Americans United for Separation of Church and State.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Senate has already sidetracked this divisive and unwise amendment,&quot; said the Rev. Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United. &quot;The only reason for this vote is to give the Christian Coalition and similar groups another line item on their biased 'voter guides.'&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The constitutional amendment, which is being heavily promoted by Religious Right organizations, would limit marriage to one man and one woman. It is designed to outlaw same-sex marriages.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Americans United says the proposal (H.J. Res. 106), introduced by Rep. Marilyn Musgrave (R-Colo.), is unnecessary. The group notes that some religious traditions recognize same-sex unions and some do not. The government, AU says, should not elevate the views and practices of certain faith groups over others.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lynn noted that during a national meeting of the Christian Coalition in Washington, D.C., Sept. 23-25, staffers with the group bragged that they would distribute millions of &quot;voter guides&quot; this year. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The guides, Coalition Field Director Bill Thomson said, &quot;are our greatest weapon. It is the best weapon in our arsenal. It is our B-2 bomber.&quot; </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition, the Family Research Council (FRC) has pledged to include three FMA-related votes on its congressional scorecards this year. (The FRC will even rate lawmakers on whether they cosponsored the amendment.)</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Coalition, the FRC and other Religious Right groups, Americans United asserts, are eager to get a vote on the FMA, put the results on guides and scorecards and use them to tip the balance in close House races around the country.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It's sad to see the House act at the behest of extreme groups like the Christian Coalition and the Family Research Council,&quot; said Lynn. &quot;If members of Congress have nothing better to do than engineer phony votes like this, they should do the taxpayers a favor and declare an early recess.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A wide array of religious organizations opposes the amendment. More than two dozen faith groups sent a letter to House members today, urging them to reject the FMA. Among the signers were: the Alliance of Baptists; the American Friends Service Committee (Quaker); the American Jewish Committee; the Episcopal Church, USA; the Loretto Women's Network (Catholic Order); the Lutheran Office for Governmental Affairs of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America; the National Sikh Center; the Metropolitan Community Churches; the Office of the General Minister and President, Christian Church (Disciples of Christ); the Union for Reform Judaism; the Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations and the United Church of Christ Justice &amp; Witness Ministries.</font></p><p></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
