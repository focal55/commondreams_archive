<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NEW YORK -- The activist group that staged the first protest of the Republican National Convention by &quot;telling the naked truth,&quot; has moved the issue of the Bush global AIDS policy to the forefront once again today.  Members of the group ACT UP have just now dramatically disrupted the speech of White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card to the Youth Convention at the Republican National Convention (RNC).  The activists stripped off their outer shirts to reveal t-shirts emblazoned with &quot;Bush lies.  Stop Aids.  Drop the debt now.&quot;  Chanting the same message and blowing whistles, the activists succeeded in disrupting Card a minute into his speech. Many of today's participants were part of the group who &quot;bared all&quot; in front of Madison Square Garden last Thursday pressing for changes in the Bush Administration's AIDS policies.  The activists were taken away by security.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We continue to call on the Bush Administration to support cancellation of the global debt owed by poor countries to international banks and donor countries,&quot; said Sharonann Lynch of ACT UP.  &quot;Right now, sub-Saharan African nations are pouring $15 billion a year into repaying debt to wealthy nations.  That money could and should be used to provide treatment to the millions of people on the continent living with HIV/AIDS.  The Bush Administration must move to save the lives of people in the world's poorest countries by supporting 100% debt cancellation now.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The group is challenging the Bush Administration to join with other members of the Group of 7 industrialized countries in supporting debt forgiveness for at least 50 of the world's poorest nations.  At their most recent summit in June, the leaders of the G8 discussed a proposal for 100% cancellation of debts owed by some poor countries to the IMF and World Bank.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;On October 1, the finance ministers of these economic powers will be meeting in Washington to consider the issue of debt cancellation,&quot; continued ACT UP's Mark Milano.  &quot;We call on President Bush to make his commitment to the world's poor clear during the Republican Convention and announce U.S. support for lifting the burden of debt from the backs of these countries.  The nations of Africa are spending approximately $15 billion a year on repayment of debt.  The sooner debt cancellation becomes a reality the sooner these countries will be able to redirect some of that spending to alleviating the most deadly health threat facing the globe...the scourge of AIDS.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition to debt cancellation, the group is also demanding that the U.S. live up to its commitments to the Global Fund.  Global AIDS Coordinator Randall Tobias announced earlier that other nations are being given until the end of this month to match the U.S. contribution to the Fund so that the final U.S. $120 million can be released.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This administration has demonstrated its disdain for multilateral cooperation on most foreign policy issues.  The Global Fund is one of the most blatant examples.  While the Fund requested a contribution of $1.2 billion, the Bush White House only asked Congress for $200 million.  Congress upped the amount to more than $500 million, but restricted giving to 33% of the total fund receipts by July 30th.  Mr. Tobias extended that deadline to September 30th.  We are demanding that the U.S. give other nations until the end of 2004 to meet their commitments to the Fund which is the best hope of getting treatment to people living with AIDS around the world,&quot; concluded ACT UP's Lynch.</font></p>
