Winners receive a total of $3,000 in prizes. The theme for this year&#146;s contest was: &#147;If you were invited to give a nationally televised speech to the American people, including the President and the Congress, what would you say to convince them that the United States should take a leadership role in the global elimination of nuclear weapons?&#148;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">            This year, first place was awarded to Emma Thompsell for her essay entitled, America Must Lead the World in Nuclear Disarmament. &#147;The world is a much riskier place with nuclear weapons.  It is up to America, as the most powerful nation that this world has ever seen, to show that its political and military pre-eminence is matched by moral leadership.  America must lead the world in nuclear disarmament,&#148; writes Emma in her essay. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Emma is a student at the Westminster School in London, UK.
