<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - January 23 - While many have called on President Bush to offer an explanation for his false claims about Iraq possessing weapons of mass destruction, several Democratic presidential candidates have made similar claims. Here are candidate statements made before the occupation of Iraq:</FONT></p><UL><LI><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">JOHN KERRY: &quot;Why is Saddam Hussein attempting to develop nuclear weapons when most nations don't even try? &amp; According to intelligence, Iraq has chemical and biological weapons ...

She didn't say what action she would take. Perhaps that's because she had claimed: 'Saddam Hussein certainly has chemical and biological weapons. There's no question about that.' (on NBC, Nov. 17, 2002) [See: <A HREF="http://www.sfbg.com/38/16/x_oped.html" TARGET="_new">www.sfbg.com/38/16/x_oped.html</A>] When I asked her about this last week, she declined to even acknowledge that her statement had been false. [See: <A HREF="http://www.accuracy.org/pelosi.htm" TARGET="_new">www.accuracy.org/pelosi.htm</A>] Many Democrats are refusing to be held accountable; this is further restricting them from holding Bush accountable. They should admit and explain their own false statements.&quot;<BR></FONT></LI></UL><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
