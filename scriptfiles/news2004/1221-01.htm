<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- December 21 -- </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Congressman Dennis J. Kucinich (D-OH) issued the following statement today on the escalating violence in Iraq: </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The brazen executions, captured on film for the world to see, shows Iraq out of control, despite Administration rhetoric.  The US occupation has failed to provide security. It's time for the Administration to be honest with the American public:  Free and fair elections cannot, and will not, happen under such conditions.   The January election can only be a sham.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;American troops and American taxpayers are footing the bill for a war that was never needed, and a war that is counterproductive to the security interests of our nation. No weapons of mass destruction have been found in Iraq and the 9/11 Commission has determined that Saddam Hussein had nothing to do with the September 11th attacks. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This Administration is conducting a war with no end.  Iraqi elections, while an important step, will not bring an end to the US occupation of Iraq, and will not bring our soldiers home. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The continued occupation of Iraq is draining our financial resources here at home, and is harming our military readiness worldwide.  We cannot continue down this path.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Now is the time for a new direction in Iraq. We must end the occupation of Iraq. It is time for a new plan. It is time, to begin the process of getting the UN in and the US out.&quot;<br></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
