<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - June 29 - Today, Christian Solidarity International (CSI), together with Sudan Campaign partners, marched on the Sudanese Embassy in Washington D.C., protesting against state-sponsored genocide and slavery. Two Sudan Campaign members, former Congressman Rev. Walter Fauntroy and radio talk show host Joe Madison, were arrested by Secret Service agents protesting through non-violent civil disobedience.  Wrapping yellow &#147;Crime Scene&#148; police tape around the entrance Madison declared the embassy a crime scene, noting that the racist Government of Sudan is guilty of genocide and slavery against black Sudanese.</FONT></p><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Sudan Campaign demonstration was timed to coincide with Secretary of State Colin Powell&#146;s visit to western Sudan where government-sponsored ethnic cleansing raids have resulted within the past twelve months in the displacement of over one million Black Africans, the death of tens of thousands and the enslavement of others. The genocide process in Sudan has progressed in tandem with a U.S. supported peace initiative directed by the newly appointed U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, former Sen. John Danforth. In October 2002, President George W. Bush and both Houses of Congress, including Sen. John Kerry, identified the Government of Sudan as a perpetrator of acts of &#147;genocide&#148;.  But since then, the U.S. government has taken no further punitive measures against Khartoum. U.S. government officials have warned that hundred of thousands may die in the coming months.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">CSI and Sudan Campaign partners urged the United States to work closely with Sudan&#146;s oppressed democratic opposition to restore respect for human rights; mobilize international forces to guarantee the safe return of survivors of ethnic cleansing; and to stand in the vanguard of efforts to suspend the Government of Sudan&#146;s membership of the United Nations. </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">CSI&#146;s Executive Director, Dr. John Eibner, issued call to action, stating:   &#147;I commend the many people of good will throughout this county, people of every race and religion who are not prepared to stand idly by when the lives of fellow human beings are destroyed en mass by the evil forces of genocide and slavery. Let us all join together to STOP the GENOCIDE and FREE the SLAVES!&#148;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Rev. Walter Fauntroy, declared, &#147;Enough is enough!&#148;  He said, &#147;It is our hope and expectation that the action we take today will spur people of conscience to come to this place everyday, week and month, for however long it takes until the killing stops.&#148;  </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Other speakers included Nina Shea, Freedom House Director for the Center for Religious Freedom, Faith McDonnell, Institute on Religion and Democracy, Rabbi David Saperstein, Director of the Religious Action Center for Reformed Judaism, and Dr. Charles Jacobs, President of the American Anti-Slavery Group.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">CSI Washington Representative, the Rev. Dr. Keith Roderick concluded the demonstration, calling for the international community to stop sweeping the crimes of the Sudanese government under the rug.   &#147;Lies and denial cannot protect the Sudanese government any longer from its complicity with evil.&#148; </FONT> </P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
