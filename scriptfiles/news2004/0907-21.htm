<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - September 7 - President Bush and Congress have just five legislative days to act on the federal assault weapons ban.  If President Bush does not work to save the landmark law this week, the assault weapons ban will surely expire on Monday, September 13, 2004. 

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
In an August 4 interview on National Public Radio, U.S. House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) said the assault weapons ban &quot;might have a chance&quot; of passage.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But an aide to the speaker has said previously that it would only pass the House if Bush pushes for it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The U.S. Senate voted to renew the ban on a bipartisan 52-47 vote on March 2, 2004. 

&quot;It is well past time for the President, who leads the majority party in Congress, to back up his words with action,&quot; said Josh Horwitz, Executive Director of the <a href="http://www.csgv.org/">Coalition to Stop Gun Violence</a>.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;George W. Bush needs to stop playing politics with public safety and the lives of law enforcement.&quot;</font></p>
<p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Promises of Support; No Action</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> President Bush has repeatedly pledged support for banning assault weapons.  During the 2000 campaign, George W. Bush said "It makes no sense for assault weapons to be around our society."</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 

During his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention, President Bush said that protecting the American people is his &quot;most solemn duty,&quot; and that he is running on a &quot;compassionate conservative philosophy.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Mr. President, the overwhelming majority of Americans, a bipartisan majority of the United States Senate, and police officers from across the nation are calling on you to protect us by banning assault weapons,&quot; said Horwitz.   &quot;There is nothing compassionate about an AK-47.&quot;</font></p>
