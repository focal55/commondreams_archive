<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - July 12 - The Senate Intelligence Committee report released last week does its best to whitewash the Bush Administration&#146;s role in hyping intelligence prior to the invasion of Iraq by piling the blame on the CIA.[1] </FONT></p><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The report distorts the truth by failing to meaningfully investigate the ways intelligence was misused by Administration policymakers.  Those issues, conveniently, will be addressed in a separate report sometime after the November elections. </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The report does illustrate how, when the intelligence community did get it right, the White House and its collaborators ignored them.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The report shows, for example,  that when the CIA told the White House that there was no link between Al-Qaeda and Iraq, and that intelligence on African uranium was too weak, the Bush Administration went public with the information anyway.  The Administration, more interested in creating  fear than circulating fact, consistently used  intelligence as a political tool rather than making sound policy decisions.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">At one point the CIA reported to the Administration that Iraq and Al-Qaeda did not have &#147;an established formal relationship.&#148;[2]  In fact, the Iraqi government actively sought &#147;to prevent Iraq youth from joining Al-Qaeda.&quot; Yet, Vice President Dick Cheney continued to tell the American people that Saddam Hussein had &#147;an established relationship with Al-Qaeda.&#148;[3]</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Also, according to the Intelligence Committee report, George Tenet directly contacted National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice and her deputy Stephen Hadley in October 2002 to tell them the president should not say that Iraq had sought uranium from Africa because &#147;the evidence was weak.&#148;  In a fax sent to the White House the CIA explained &#147;this is one of the two issues where we differed with the British.&#148;  Nevertheless, just two months later, the president publicly declared &#147;[t]he British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa.&#148;[4]</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">For more information and citations, visit: <A HREF="http://www.misleader.org" TARGET="_new">www.misleader.org</A>. </FONT></P><P></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">[1] Report on the U.S. Intelligence Community&#146;s Prewar Intelligence Assessments on Iraq, Senate Intelligence Committee, 7/7/04</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">[2] C.I.A.
