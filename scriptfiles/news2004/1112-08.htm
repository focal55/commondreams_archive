<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- November 12 -- The League of Women Voters announced today an unprecedented amount of traffic on its online one-stop election information site, DemocracyNet (DNet, <a href="http://www.dnet.org/" target="_new">www.dnet.org</a>) during the 2004 Election. The Capwiz Election&auml; tool featuring DNet registered 10 million page views on Election Day alone and 18 million in the week preceding the election. </font></p><p> </p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Voters clearly did not want to go to the polls unprepared,&#148; said Kay J. Maxwell, Chair, League of Women Voters Education Fund. &#147;With all of the focus on the presidential election, voters turned to DNet to find unbiased information about the other races and questions on their ballot. The combination of Capitol Advantage&#146;s technological capabilities and the League&#146;s reputation as the top source for nonpartisan election information makes Capwiz Election with DNet the premier election information site on the Internet,&#148; Maxwell concluded.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The site, run by the League in partnership with Capitol Advantage, offers comprehensive coverage of federal and state races. &#147;DNet was invaluable to millions of voters, allowing easy and unfiltered information on candidates of all political affiliation,&#148; stated Maxwell.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During the 2004 Election cycle, DNet provided coverage for almost 6,000 races across the country. Including both the primaries and the general election, Capwiz Election with DNet covered over 25,000 candidates and allowed voters access to over 11,000 issue statements. Over 80 percent of all candidates for the U.S. Senate, the U.S. House of Representatives and governor provided at least one statement to DNet. But the coverage did not stop there &#150; DNet covered issues statements for almost 2,000 candidates for state legislatures and offered analysis of 125 statewide ballot initiatives.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Several major daily newspapers, such as The Philadelphia Inquirer, The Miami Herald, and The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, urged readers to check DNet for candidate information in the days prior to the election. Thanks to Capitol Advantage, Capwiz Election with DNet was also available through some of the nation&#146;s largest media web portals, including msn.com, aol.com, yahoo.com, usatoday.com, nytimes.com, foxnews.com, c-span.org and more. As a result, this valuable election information was readily accessible to millions of voters. </font></p><p></p>
