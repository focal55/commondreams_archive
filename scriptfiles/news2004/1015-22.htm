<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - October 14 - &quot;Sen. John Kerry answered our call last night,&quot; said <a href="http://www.nowpacs.org/" target="_new">NOW/PAC</a> Chair Kim Gandy. &quot;He made women's issues part of the debate and established his commitment to the fight for equality and justice.&quot; </font>
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sen. Kerry addressed many issues important to women&#151;he pledged to defend the landmark Roe v. Wade decision in the courts, promote pay equity, expand affordable health care, increase the minimum wage and protect affirmative action. Kerry successfully aligned himself with women by recognizing the detrimental policies imposed by the Bush administration. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We disagree with his position against same sex marriage, although Sen. Kerry does recognize that denying partner benefits is discrimination,&quot; said Gandy. &quot;And last night he reaffirmed his belief that that we should not amend the Constitution to enshrine discrimination.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The weak economy has left millions of women, especially single mothers, in dire straits. Kerry lambasted Bush for providing enormous tax cuts to the wealthy while neglecting to raise the minimum wage. Even a modest increase would put thousands of dollars into women's pockets, allowing them to adequately provide for their families. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Kerry vowed to work toward closing the gender wage gap,&quot; said Gandy, &quot;something the current administration has never made one of their priorities. In fact the pay gap between women and men has expanded during this administration&#151;the first time in over 25 years.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The stark contrast between the two candidates was more pronounced than ever when domestic policy became a topic of debate. Ultimately, Bush was unable to defend his shameful record on women's issues. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;NOW/PAC urges its members and supporters to turn out in record numbers on Nov. 2 for John Kerry and all candidates who support women's rights,&quot; said Gandy. &quot;We have proven time and again that women can and will make a difference on Election Day. John Kerry will stand with us in our struggle to achieve full equality.&quot; </font></p>
