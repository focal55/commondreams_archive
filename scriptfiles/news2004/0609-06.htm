The report, &quot;Beyond Torture: U.S. Violations of Occupation Law in Iraq,&quot; documents ten categories of war crimes and rights violations regularly committed by U.S. forces. It can be accessed at <A HREF="http://www.cesr.org/beyondtorture.pdf" TARGET="_new">http://www.cesr.org/beyondtorture.pdf</A>. </FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Torture is only the tip of the iceberg,&quot; said Roger Normand, an international lawyer who directs the Center. &quot;From unlawful killings, mass arrests, and collective punishment to outright theft and pillage, the U.S. is violating almost every law intended to protect civilians living under foreign military occupation.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The report blames the Bush Administration for misusing the war against terrorism to exempt itself from the Geneva Conventions and other legal norms, creating a climate of impunity in which ordinary soldiers feel free to torture and abuse Iraqis. Rather than scapegoat those caught on camera, the report recommends that George W. Bush, Donald Rumsfeld, and other responsible U.S. officials be held accountable for war crimes resulting from their policies.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">According to the report, these crimes are so entrenched in U.S. policies towards Iraq that they will end only when the occupation itself is ended. This would require withdrawal of U.S. troops and an end to U.S. control over Iraq's political, economic and military affairs. Absent these fundamental changes, the purported June 30th &quot;transfer of sovereignty&quot; to Iraqi authorities is &quot;a form of political theatre with no legal effect&quot; on U.S obligations as an occupying power, notwithstanding the diplomatic fig leaf provided by yesterday's UN Security Council resolution. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Under international law, continued military occupation is incompatible with self-determination,&quot; said Mr. Normand. &quot;For the Security Council to legitimize as sovereign an Iraqi government hand-picked by the U.S.-as Washington sends more troops to occupy Iraq-merely proves that the UN cannot defend its own Charter against American pressure.&quot; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><I>CESR is an international human rights organization that has organized numerous human rights fact -finding missions to Iraq since 1991.
