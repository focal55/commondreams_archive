<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- November 15 -- Today is the final day for citizens to comment on changes to the Roadless Area Conservation Rule, and I urge President Bush to listen carefully to what the American people are saying. For six years, Americans have been saying that we should protect the roadless areas still left in our national forests. A total of 4 million comments have poured in as the Roadless Rule has evolved. The overwhelming majority opposed commercial logging and road building in these pristine places.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So far, the administration has tried to ignore the public. In fact, the latest proposal is nothing less than an outright repeal of the rule. It replaces what Americans have supported for years with a meaningless and confusing petition process that tries to hide the fact that they are eliminating the rule all together. Under the proposed plan, governors will be forced to petition the federal government to protect roadless forests in their states. That is bad enough. Even worse, the Forest Service would have the power to reject the petitions.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nine governors in states that would be directly affected by this decision believe the plan is misguided and will cause more - not less - confusion, and will increase financial burdens on their already over-extended state agencies. Additionally, this unwise proposal would upend our long tradition of consistently applying the same laws and standards across the country. The result could be different rules for managing national forests in every single state.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Roadless Area Conservation Rule garnered ten times more public comments than any federal rule in history when it was enacted in 2001. It has been favored by Americans from all walks of life, from both political parties, from Maine to California. They all see protecting a portion of our most unspoiled places as a commonsense way to create a legacy for our children; the government should too.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With so much to lose and so little to gain, the choice is clear.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We urge the Bush administration to listen to the hundreds of scientists and economists who have written so eloquently about the importance of protecting these special places, listen to the businesses who are certain to be hurt if this new plan is enacted, listen to the hunters and anglers who want this remarkable wildlife habitat preserved, listen to the governors who have said they don&#146;t want the additional financial burden that is certain to come with the task of managing federal lands, and most of all, listen to the millions of Americans who desperately want to see these natural treasures protected.<br></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
