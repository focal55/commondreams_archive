<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PHOENIX, AZ -- December 29 -- Following is a release of Food for the Hungry:</font></p><div align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> To donate: <a href="http://www.fh.org/" target="_new">http://www.fh.org</a> or call 1-800-2-HUNGERS (ask for Donor Services)<br></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Acting quickly to prevent more deaths</font></div><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Immediately following the devastating tsunami that hit more than 10 countries in southeast Asia Dec. 26, Food for the Hungry began deploying rapid-response procedures.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The next few hours and days are critical, and it is imperative we act quickly to prevent the spread of disease. With the decay of bodies and the contamination of water, diseases like malaria and cholera could be as deadly as the tsunami itself,&quot; said Ben Homan, president of the Phoenix-based Food for the Hungry.</font><br></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Partnering with others to help:</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Food for the Hungry has already been distributing clean water and critically needed items including food, shelter and clothing through its many partners including EFICOR (Evangelical Fellowship of India's Commission on Relief).</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">They are also teaming up with churches in Thailand, Sri Lanka and working with other local organizations to help victims in the countries hit worst.</font><br></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Positioned well on-the-ground:</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Because we work in 46 countries including nations throughout Asia, we are well-positioned to help,&quot; said Homan. With over 2,000 Food for the Hungry staff worldwide, we are able to assess the situation and respond quickly.&quot; Our Thailand team distributed items less than 24 hours after the tsunami and our Korean partners have been distributing items in Sri Lanka through local churches. Because we maximize our impact through networks of local volunteers in grassroots community organizations like churches, we are able to move into disaster situations swiftly and with cultural sensitivity.</font><br></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Ways we have helped already:</font></p><ul><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Thailand -- distributed clean water, food and clothing to a hospital and evacuation center</font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">India -- logistical support with one of our partners; (EFICOR)</font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Indonesia -- medical help via clinics set up by our Korea staff</font></li></ul><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Estimating 100,000</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The death toll seems to be growing by the hour and nearly doubling daily. Just two days ago the count was 24,000; then 40,000 and health experts, along with the Red Cross have estimated deaths to climb higher than 100,000. Beyond the death count are the millions who are homeless.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Financial help of $3 million</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We're shooting to raise $3 million with our partners for the initial relief campaign and it looks like we'll easily get it,&quot; said Matt Panos, Senior Vice President of Ministry Partners.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;People have been so generous and I think it helps that they know Food for the Hungry manages their money well93 percent of all gifts go directly to supporting programs including relief efforts.&quot; To-date, we are over $100,000 in cash donations and nearly $1 million committed from in-kind gifts and online donations we are so grateful to everyone who has donated already.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> More donations needed</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The United Nations is calling this 'the largest humanitarian effort ever,' because of the challenge of coordinating assistance to 10 nations at the same time. The sheer scale and size of the disaster is more vast than any other relief operation in history,&quot; said Homan.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">David Evans, Vice President of Government and Gift-in-Kind Resources said &quot;The disaster response effort is significantly more complex than most emergencies due to the huge geographical area that has been hit. It will take millions more to help these countries rebuild, let alone provide initial relief,&quot; said Evans. &quot;We are currently looking at potential U.S. Government resources for longer-term help, including rehabilitation efforts, to get these people back to square one.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Meeting more than physical needs</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since the group's onset, Food for the Hungry's mission has been to provide physical and spiritual needs. &quot;We are called to be there,&quot; said Homan. &quot;Many of their family members have died and offering emotional comfort is a vital response in tandem with providing items to meet their physical needs. We are there to respond to the needs of the whole person and to give them hope in a seemingly hopeless situation,&quot; said Homan.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> To help or donate:</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Food for the Hungry is urging individuals to please help the earthquake victims by calling 1-800-2-HUNGERS or by donating online, <a href="http://www.fh.org/main_donate" target="_new">http://www.fh.org/main_donate</a></font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> About Food for the Hungry</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Food for the Hungry currently impacts individuals in 46 countries providing emergency relief and implementing development programs throughout the world.
