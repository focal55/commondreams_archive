<p><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - March 7 - In honor of International Women&#146;s Day and the beginning of the Presidential election season, women throughout the United States converged today on the White House in a colorful march that culminated with the hoisting of a huge pink banner into the air in front of the White House. The banner, reading &#147;Women Say: Fire Bush, &#148; marked the kick-off of a campaign calling on women to Give George Bush a Pink Slip in November 2004.</FONT></p><P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!--/beginimage/-->

&#147;George Bush is a global bully,&#148; said Medea Benjamin, a co-founder of CODEPINK, the women&#146;s peace group that organized the protest. &#147;He lied to Congress and the American people about the weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and is robbing our children of a viable future as he lines the pockets of his already wealthy corporate friends. It&#146;s time for Bush to join the 2.4 million people who have gotten pink slips since he took office. Let&#146;s fire him!&#148;</FONT></P><P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The march began at noon at the National Mall with about 100 women carrying a clothesline of dozens of pink women&#146;s slips meant for George Bush. The women also carried banners with their reasons for wanting to Give George Bush a Pink Slip, including &#147;Bush Lies, Innocents Die,&#148; &#147;Biggest Budget Deficit Ever,&#148; and  &#147;2.4 Million Jobs Lost; Pink Slip Bush.&#148; As they made their way to Lafayette Park in front of the White House, for one of the first permitted protests in the park since September 11, 2001, they chanted &#147;1-2-3-4, We don&#146;t Want George Bush No More; 5-6-7-8, Speak out Women, State-to-State&#148; and &#147;We won&#146;t be lied to anymore, Bush out of office in 2004.&#148;</FONT></P><P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CODEPINK: Women for Peace is the group that brought 10,000 women to Washington, DC last year to protest the war against Iraq and encircle the White House in pink. Since then it has grown into a movement with some 90 chapters throughout the United States and around the world. CODEPINK is known for its creative and sometimes outrageous actions that have ranged from singing anti-war Christmas carols in front of Donald Rumsfeld&#146;s house to holding a four-month long peace vigil in front of the White House before the war against Iraq. All of their actions are full of their signature color, pink.</FONT></P><P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CODEPINK has now turned its attention to preventing George Bush from being re-elected in 2004, and has initiated a campaign to Give Bush a Pink Slip.
