<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - February 11 - The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force will honor V. Gene Robinson, the first openly gay man to be named a bishop in the Anglican communion, at the organization's 15th Annual Leadership Awards event on March 15, 2004 in New York City. The event will be held at New York University School of Law and will be the first time Bishop Robinson has been honored since his consecration in November. (Bishop Robinson's bio appears below).</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Bishop Robinson's courage, compassion and quiet perseverance in the face of vilification by his opponents worldwide and threats of violence against him has been an inspiration to us all,&quot; said Task Force Executive Director Matt Foreman. &quot;We are incredibly proud that he is honoring us with his presence.&quot; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Bishop Robinson said, &quot;I am deeply honored to be recognized by one of the preeminent social justice groups working for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights. I look forward to celebrating with those at the Task Force Leadership Awards event the many advances achieved on so many fronts.&quot; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Bishop Robinson's consecration has attracted worldwide attention, with some leaders of the Anglican communion moving to sever relations with the Episcopal Church of the United States. Right wing &quot;family&quot; organizations have joined in the chorus of denunciation. In the weeks leading up to his consecration, then-Rev. Robinson was deluged with hate mail and, following threats on his life by Christian fundamentalists, was placed under round-the-clock FBI protection. In the face of all of this, Bishop Robinson has repeatedly called for understanding, love and dialogue with his detractors. At his consecration, for example, he said, &quot;There are faithful, wonderful Christian people for whom this is a moment of great pain and confusion and anger.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Task Force Leadership Awards pay tribute to community leaders and allies who help pave the way for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender equality, freedom and justice. Past award recipients include Coretta Scott King; then-South African President Nelson Mandela; Senator Ted Kennedy; and Kelli &amp; Rosie O'Donnell. Comedian Kate Clinton will serve as Emcee for the evening. (Ms. Clinton's bio appears below.)</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">EVENT INFORMATION</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">What: National Gay and Lesbian Task Force Leadership Awards Honoring Bishop V.
