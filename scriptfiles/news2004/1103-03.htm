<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- November 3 -- A precedent-setting ballot initiative that requires Colorado utilities provide 10 percent of their electricity from renewable energy by 2015 swept to victory late Tuesday night. Known as the Renewable Energy Initiative #37, the initiative won by a margin of 52 percent to 48 percent and marked the first time a clean energy standard was on the ballot anywhere in the country.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This landmark victory proves that voters are demanding more wind, solar and other clean, renewable resources,&quot; said Alan Nogee, Energy Program Director of the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) which was on the initiative steering committee. &quot;Even in the face of an intimidating and well-funded campaign by the coal and utility industry, the people's voices were heard in this coal-dominated state. Now our leaders in Washington need to start paying attention to voter support for renewable energy.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Research by UCS released in October showed that Amendment 37 would likely save Colorado consumers $236 million by 2025, while creating 2,000 new jobs and boosting the economies of rural towns. Amendment 37 is in line with the goal adopted last month by the Western Governors' Association of developing 30,000 megawatts of renewable energy by 2015.  </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The passage of this initiative serves notice on large rural electric cooperatives that their efforts to block the clean energy measures will ultimately fail.  &quot;In the face of clean energy initiatives in other states, the coops should recognize that they need to be part of the solution - not part of the problem,&quot; said Nogee.   Nogee predicted that future state ballot initiatives could force coops to participate in clean energy programs.  <br>	<br>The Colorado initiative effectively opens the door to similar moves in other states. Of the 23 states with the initiative process, 17 still do not have a Renewable Energy Standard.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Voters in Colorado have sent a clear message to the rest of the country that the environmental and economic benefits of renewable energy are starting to break through the utility smoke screen,&quot; Nogee said. &quot;Utilities are on notice that their customers are prepared to go to the ballot box to demand a shift to cleaner, healthier energy.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Visit UCS on the Web at <a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/" target="_new">www.ucsusa.org</a>.
