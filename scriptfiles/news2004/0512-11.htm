<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - May 12 - Workplace shootings in America virtually doubled in 2003 from 2002 as did the number of workplace shooting victims according to a new report, &#147;<A HREF="http://www.workplaceshootings.org/workshootings.pdf" TARGET="_new">Terror Nine to Five: Guns in the American Workplace, 1994- 2003</A>&#148; released by Handgun-Free America (see <A HREF="http://www.workplaceshootings.org" TARGET="_new">www.workplaceshootings.org</A>).</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In 2002, there were 25 workplace shooting incidents and 33 victims killed.  But in 2003, American workplace shootings rose dramatically to 45 incidents, with 69 victims killed and another 46 wounded.  The report highlighted a dangerous five-year trend showing consistent increases in the number of American workplace shootings since 1998 when there were only 9 workplace shootings compared to 45 incidents in 2003.  The study documented that over 10 years, from 1994 to 2003, there have been at least 164 workplace shootings in America, that killed a total of 290 people and wounded 161.  </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">California had the highest number of workplace shooting incidents over the 10-year period of the study with 21 incidents that killed 50 people and wounded another 25.  Florida suffered the next highest total of workplace shootings from 1994-2003 with 20 incidents, and 38 killed and 16 wounded.  Other states to lead the tragic list from 1994 to 2003 include Pennsylvania with 11 workplace shootings (22 people killed, 7 wounded), Texas with 10 workplace shootings (32 killed, 5 wounded), and Ohio with 10 workplace shootings (13 killed, 10 wounded).  </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">As of the end of April 2004, there have already been 12 workplace shootings, with 12 people killed and 8 others wounded, whereas by the end of April of 2003, there were only 2 workplace shootings.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The report also found that handguns were used in 78.5% of all workplace shootings listed in the study, and of that number, 81.2% were semi-automatic handguns.  </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;The unifying factor amongst all these tragedies is the availability of firearms, especially semi-automatic handguns, which are the weapons of choice for rampage and workplace shooters,&#148; said Chris McGrath, executive director of Handgun Free America.  &#147;It is time we discuss the specific role of handguns in fueling gun violence in America.&#148; </FONT>   </P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
