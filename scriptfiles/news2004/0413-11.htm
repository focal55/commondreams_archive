<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - April 13 - </FONT></p>
<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Wednesday, April 14 at 12:45pm - Meet at National Press Club to march to the White House</FONT></p>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">United for Peace and Justice and CODEPINK, the nation&#146;s largest antiwar coalitions, calls on President Bush and the United States Congress to immediately halt the escalating violence in Iraq. On Wednesday, April 14th Military Families Speak Out (MFSO) and Veterans for Peace, and members of United for Peace and Justice and CODEPINK, will bring this message directly to the White House: it is time to end the Occupation in Iraq, it is time to Bring the Troops Home!</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In the first 12 days of April there were 76 U.S. troops and more than 700 hundred Iraqis killed, and there is no end in sight.  Meanwhile the Administration is talking about increasing the U.S. presence, sending more troops -- including National Guard and Reserves -- to fight in a war that is based on lies. The military occupation of Iraq is the problem, not the solution, and increasing the U.S. presence will only lead to the deaths of more U.S. service people and more Iraqis.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">On Wednesday, April 14 Military Families , Veterans, including a veteran of the Iraq War, and Iraqi-Americans will come together to say &#147;End the Violence, End the Occupation, End the War, Bring The Troops Home Now!&#148; At a press conference at the National Press Club they will call on military families, veterans, and others across the country to demand that their elected officials move immediately to bring an end to the war in Iraq. Following the press conference, the delegation will proceed to the White House to deliver letters to President Bush from military families in every part of the nation, and to leave flowers and petals in remembrance of all who have lost their lives in a war that should never have happened. The delegation will also be joining in a day-long fast in memory of all who have lost their lives and who have been wounded as a result of this reckless military misadventure.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Join us to fast and/or to help lay down flowers at the White House gates in remembrance of over 600 U.S. soldiers and thousands of Iraqis killed in the war.  Space is limited at the Press Club so the DC community is encouraged to meet military families and supporters outside the press club at 12:45pm to carry flowers over the White House.  Please bring friends and co-workers.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Date: Wednesday, April 14, 2004</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Time: 12noon Press Conference (limited seating) </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">12:45 General public encouraged to meet at the National Press Club, 529 14th St., NW (Metro Center) to join procession to White House.</FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
