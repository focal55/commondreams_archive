<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - October 15 - Congressman Bernie Sanders was joined by 31 members of Congress in writing to Federal Communication Commission Chairman Powell to demand that he prevent Sinclair Broadcasting from using its control of 62 television stations to improperly influence the November 2 Presidential election.  Sanders and the other signers warned that Sinclair's actions represent a move toward a corporate-directed media similar to the state-run television that existed in the former Soviet Union.  They also pointed to the FCC Chairman Powell's support of great media consolidation as facilitating the acts of Sinclair and the loss of media diversity.

<p>Rep. Sanders wrote, "If Sinclair is allowed to go forward, it will set a precedent that endangers our very democracy.  There can be little doubt that other broadcasters will follow suit and American television could become little more than the political mouthpiece for its corporate owners.  If that happens, the sad truth is that American television could end up looking more like that of authoritarian countries like the former Soviet Union and China, which are widely despised for broadcasting the "party line," rather than a forum for the free exchange of diverse political views that is so necessary to a vibrant democratic society." 

<p>This is not Sinclair's first attempt to use its control of television stations to advance its owners pro-Republican agenda.  Earlier this year, Sinclair refused to air an episode of ABC's Nightline that featured a tribute to American troops lost in Iraq and included each fallen hero's name.

<p>Sinclair owns 62 television stations that reach some 25% of American households.  It is a major advocate for loosening federal regulations to permit media conglomerates to grow even larger.  In June 2003, the FCC promulgated regulations permitting greater consolidation in the media - regulations held illegal by the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. In the letter members of Congress asked Chairman Powell that as he redraft his earlier media regulations -- as the Third Circuit directed, he carefully consider the actions of Sinclair. The actions show that increased consolidation and corporatization of the media pose a real threat to the very existence of American democracy.

 

<p>Attached are the full text of the letter and a list of signatories. 

 

<p>October 14, 2004

<p>The Honorable Michael Powell
Chairman
Federal Communications Commission
445 12th Street, S.W.
Room 8-A204A
Washington, DC 20554

 

<p>Dear Chairman Powell:

<p>            We are writing about an issue of great importance to the Commission, to Congress, and to the long-term viability of American democracy.

<p>In June 2003, the FCC promulgated regulations permitting greater consolidation in the media - regulations held illegal by the Third Circuit Court of Appeals.  Many of us opposed those regulations because we feared that the further consolidation of broadcast media would increasingly put control of what Americans see, hear, and read in the hands of a few media conglomerates who would use that control to advance their own agenda.  Unfortunately, the current reality is worse than we could have feared.

<p>            As you are no doubt aware Sinclair Broadcasting, in an unprecedented move, has announced that all 62 of its television stations will preempt their regular programming to broadcast a blatant 90-minute political attack on Senator John Kerry a few days before the election.  To the best of our knowledge, never before in American history has a broadcasting company been such an active partisan participant in a Presidential campaign.      

<p>If Sinclair is allowed to go forward, it will set a precedent that endangers our very democracy.  There can be little doubt that other broadcasters will follow suit and American television could become little more than the political mouthpiece for its corporate owners.  If that happens, the sad truth is that American television could end up looking more like that of authoritarian countries like the former Soviet Union and China, which are widely despised for broadcasting the "party line," rather than a forum for the free exchange of diverse political views that is so necessary to a vibrant democratic society.  

<p>            We, therefore, urge you to prevent Sinclair from using its control of 62 television stations and its ability to reach some 25% of U.S. households to improperly influence the election.  In addition, we ask that as you redraft your earlier media regulations -- as the Third Circuit directed, you carefully consider the actions of Sinclair.  They show that increased consolidation and corporatization of the media poses a real threat to the very existence of American democracy. 

<p>                                                                                    Sincerely,
