<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - August 19 - In an interview taped yesterday for PBS' NOW with Bill Moyers, Lou Dobbs, one of the most respected names in financial news reporting, emerges as a surprisingly strident critic of big business, whose power in Washington, he claims, is unparalleled. The pro-business Dobbs excoriates corporations for shipping jobs overseas. &quot;Corporate America will not tell us how many jobs they're shipping overseas to cheap foreign labor markets,&quot; Dobbs tells Bill Moyers. &quot;We're talking about not an economic judgment but a political judgment, a social judgment....What kind of country do we want?  Do we want to destroy the middle class? Because if we do let's continue outsourcing jobs.&quot; </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dobbs is the anchor and managing editor of CNN's Lou Dobbs Tonight and a founding member of the network in 1980, as well as CNN's financial news division.  His latest book is Exporting America: Why Corporate Greed Is Shipping American Jobs Overseas.  In addition, Dobbs anchors a nationally-syndicated financial news radio report. He writes a monthly column for Money magazine, a weekly syndicated column published in newspapers across the country, is a contributing editor for U.S. News and World Report.  </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">	The full interview with Dobbs airs on NOW with Bill Moyers on Friday, August 20, at 9 p.m. on PBS (check local listings).</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
