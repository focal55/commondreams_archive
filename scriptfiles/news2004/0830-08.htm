<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - August 30 - Campaign for America's Future Co-director Robert Borosage today said that President Bush's policies weakened America's place in the world. President Bush and Republicans will discuss national security today at their convention in New York City.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Campaign for America's Future Co-directors Robert Borosage and Roger Hickey are available to provide media representatives with the liberal perspective to the Republican National Convention. Borosage is a political strategist and institution builder and Hickey co-founded the Economic Policy Institute. Together they co-direct the Campaign for America's Future, which has brought together progressives from across the country to create momentum in the movement to take back America from the failed policies of the conservative right.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>STATEMENT OF ROBERT BOROSAGE</b></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It will take more than an extreme makeover to hide this president's disastrous record. Foreign policy professionals condemn the war in Iraq a failure &#150; one Republican congressman even gently termed it the &#147;mess in Iraq.&#148;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">President Bush's policies have put America's standing in the world at an all-time low. America is more isolated, less secure and less admired under President Bush.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Voters across the country want to move in a new direction. People want an America that is a strong force for peace and freedom in the world.</font></p><p></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
