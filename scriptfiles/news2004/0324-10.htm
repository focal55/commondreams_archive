<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - March 24 - Green Party leaders are expressing concern over evidence that the invasion and occupation of Iraq is leaving many Iraqi women with fewer rights and protections than under the Saddam Hussein regime.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Iraqi women have fought for inclusion in Iraqi politics and as a result will have 25% of the seats in the interim National Assembly, according to the Law of Administration for the Iraqi transitional government, which was approved by the Interim Governing Council on March 8.  But Greens note that Iraqi women have been terrorized in some areas by thugs espousing theocratic government.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;We commend the women of Iraqi for their efforts to achieve representation in the new government,&quot; said Starlene Rankin, Lavender Green Caucus delegate to the Green Party of the United States.  &quot;Iraqi women asked for 40% of the seats and received 25%.  But it wouldn't matter if they get 100% if they can't safely get to National Assembly meetings.  In Afghanistan, violence and intimidation have prevented women from seeking office and participating in government.  Will the same thing happen in Iraq?&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Members of the U.S.-backed Interim Governing Council had previously attempted to place family law under the jurisdiction of Islamic Sharia Law through Resolution 137, which removed legal protections for women in areas including divorce, inheritance, child custody and alimony.  The resolution has since been repealed, but forces in Iraq continue to advocate for a restrictive and regressive role for women.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Women's organizations in Iraq have reported increases in rapes, abductions, 'honour' killings, and domestic violence in the lawlessness which has prevailed since the U.S. invasion,&quot; said Anne Anderson, member of the party's International Committee and of the D.C. Statehood Green Party.  &quot;How tragic that one of the legacies of our military occupations is a loss of security for women and children.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The equal protection clause in the Law of Administration states that all rights and responsibilities within apply equally to men and women.  Greens have noted, however, that women's rights in marriage, inheritance, custody, and other matters are not explicitly guaranteed.  This opens the opportunity for these freedoms to be circumvented by restrictive legislation. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Countries with high numbers of women in government tend to enact more policies favorable to women and children,&quot; said Charles Shaw, media coordinator of the Illinois Green Party.  &quot;It's essential that women in Iraq have guarantees of safety and support to run for office and participate fully in the transitional government in order to legislate for the welfare of the country.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Green Party of the United States strongly opposed the U.S. invasion of Iraq and has called for an end to the U.S. occupation and transference of authority over humanitarian relief, reconstruction, and establishment of democracy in Iraq to the U.N.  Greens participated in the worldwide 'Global Day of Action' against the Bush Administration's Iraq policies on Saturday, March 20.</FONT></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
