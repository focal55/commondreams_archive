<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - February 2 - Testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee last week, former chief U.S. weapons inspector David Kay admitted that pre-war U.S. intelligence warnings about Iraqi weapons of mass destruction were wrong. After many months of searching, Kay and his team found none of the chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons President Bush cited as his chief reason for waging war against Saddam Hussein.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> According to recent polls, more than half of the American public believed the President's assertions that Iraq had an advanced weapons program that proved a direct threat to the U.S. and roughly the same number continue to believe that there was a direct connection between Saddam Hussein and the Al-Qaeda terrorist network, despite the recent admission by Secretary of State Colin Powell that no such connection existed.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> Did the Bush Administration manipulate intelligence in order to justify their desire to go to war?  Did the White House deliberately mislead the American people? </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> 'Yes,'say John Stauber and Sheldon Rampton, investigative reporters and authors of the national bestseller <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1585422762/commondreams-20/ref=nosim/" TARGET="_new">WEAPONS OF MASS DECEPTION</A>: The Uses of Propaganda in Bush&sup1;s War on Iraq (Tarcher/Penguin).
