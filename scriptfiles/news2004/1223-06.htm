<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- December 23 -- United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) International President Cecil Roberts is praising a newly created website (<a href="http://www.reformbankruptcylaws.com/" target="_new">www.reformbankruptcylaws.com</a>), which educates people about America's unjust federal bankruptcy laws and includes a link where people can sign a petition to Congress, urging reform of the laws. The site was created by a group calling itself &quot;Citizens United to Reform Bankruptcy Laws,&quot; which was founded by Matt Alley. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The UMWA applauds the creation of this very useful tool, and we will encourage everyone to log on to read the material and sign the petition,&quot; said Roberts. &quot;It is good to know that there are people out there who feel as strongly as we do about how unjust the bankruptcy judge's ruling was to our Horizon members. But, like us, they also know it is not only coal miners who are being adversely impacted by our nation's unjust bankruptcy laws, but also airline workers and steelworkers America's bankruptcy laws need to be reformed, and this website provides an excellent way for people to educate themselves about the issue and let Congress know how they feel.&quot; <br></font> </p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
