this nation survive four more years of Dick Cheney running the show? Probably, 
but it is a risk that few thoughtful Americans, conservatives included, should 
want to take. <p> Whatever one thinks of George W. Bush--do you see a smile or 
a smirk?--it is now patently obvious that the most powerful vice president in 
U.S. history is in charge of the White House. Cheney's ultra-secretive, anti-democratic 
and crony-capitalist instincts have defined this administration.<p> Perhaps we 
should have expected all this from a man who, as head of the Bush vice presidential 
search team, selected himself. It was a forewarning of the Machiavellian arrogance 
that has made him the leading individual in an administration that has consistently 
believed that self-serving ends &#8212; such as helping Enron at the expense of 
California's energy needs or boosting Halliburton's profits at the expense of 
American troops &#8212; justify lying, secrecy and preemptive war. <p> In the 
hours after the 9/11 massacres, some Americans may have been reassured to have 
the older Cheney around at a time when the "real" president was confusedly sitting 
in a classroom listening to a story about a pet goat. However, in hindsight, this 
was clearly misguided faith in a man who presents himself as a stern father figure 
but is just an irresponsible ideologue whose disrespect and disregard for the 
U.S. Constitution are manifest in all his actions.<p> It was the vice president 
who served as the power behind a tiny group of fringe right-wing lawyers that 
secretly created a system of unaccountable White House-controlled military tribunals. 
Despite indelibly staining America's reputation as a leader in democratic principles 
and endangering the lives of American prisoners of war in current and future conflicts, 
these proceedings have proved totally useless in the war on terror, with zero 
terror convictions to date.<p> Never mind: After the tribunals decree was signed 
by Bush, Cheney was off leading a new misguided crusade, deploying a slew of manipulated 
and misrepresented intelligence factoids, clever innuendoes and outright lies 
to fool Congress and the public into supporting the invasion and occupation of 
Iraq. <p> As the Washington Post's Bob Woodward reports in "Plan of Action," his 
insider account of the Bush White House, Secretary of State Colin Powell "detected 
a kind of fever in Cheney&#133;. Cheney was beyond hellbent for action against 
Saddam. It was as if nothing else existed." <p> And through the reports of the 
bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee and 9/11 commission, and an exhaustive 
compilation released last week by Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.) of the Senate Armed 
Services Committee, it is now possible to read in excruciating detail about Cheney's 
role in convincing a majority of Americans that &#8212; strong evidence to the 
contrary &#8212; Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, was moving toward 
the production of nuclear bombs and was an ally of Al Qaeda.<p> As recently as 
June and contrary to the 9/11 commission's final report, to give but one of many 
examples, Cheney was still insisting that lead hijacker Mohamed Atta had a meeting 
in Prague with a high-ranking Iraqi intelligence agent before the 9/11 attacks. 
This is an unconscionable and obviously knowing use of the Big Lie technique, 
given that the CIA and FBI repudiated that baseless yet titillating claim in 2002. 
<p> Lately, as the war has become an unmitigated disaster for the United States 
and Iraq, Cheney and the president have been on the defensive against charges 
by numerous terrorism experts &#8212; and presidential candidate John F. Kerry 
&#8212; that the invasion of Iraq was a dangerous distraction from the fight against 
Al Qaeda and its affiliates. <p> Undaunted, Cheney tells us the Jordanian-born 
terrorist Abu Musab Zarqawi, who has been blamed for many anti-American attacks 
in Iraq, originally entered Iraq with Hussein's permission; thus Cheney tries 
to post facto justify the invasion as a legitimate pillar of the war on terror. 
But it's just another lie, with the CIA stating the opposite: The fundamentalist 
Zarqawi first sneaked into Hussein's secular and nationalist dictatorship using 
a false identity.<p> That Cheney clearly has a huge personal interest in the war 
makes all of this that much more sickening.<p> The latest report in a never-ending 
stream of conflict-of- interest revelations about this administration appears 
in the current issue of Time magazine. It detailed how the Pentagon favored Halliburton 
&#8212; which Cheney headed from 1995 until 2000 &#8212; with long-term, no-bid 
contracts. No problem. In Cheney's world, messianic ambition and personal greed 
can happily co-exist.<p> Next Tuesday, voters should retire this malevolent force.
