<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - June 16 - The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has changed its mind about participating in a discussion in front of reporters with Public Citizen about a radical, anti-consumer overhaul of the class action system that the Chamber is trying to push through Congress.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The measure, which is likely to come to a vote soon in the U.S. Senate, would dramatically curtail the rights of consumers to pursue state-law class action claims by shifting most of them to federal courts, which in many instances are far less advantageous for consumers.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Because the legislation is so significant, Public Citizen President Joan Claybrook in March invited Chamber President Tom Donohue to a debate in front of the national press. The idea was to bring together the heads of two organizations with a great interest and activity in the issue, and to exchange views to help journalists better understand the reasons for supporting or opposing bill.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">A tentative date had been set in mid-June that was apparently good for both Donohue and Claybrook. Later, though, the Chamber&#146;s staff canceled with no explanation.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;It is very telling that the Chamber, which is vigorously working behind the scenes to push this radical measure, refuses to discuss the pros and cons in front of the national press,&#148; Claybrook said. &#147;What does the Chamber fear? If Tom Donohue backs this bill, he owes the public an explanation as to why.&#148;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Class actions help enforce consumer protection, civil rights, health, safety and environmental laws and protect consumers from fraudulent or abusive corporate behavior, but under the bill, the improperly named &#147;Class Action Fairness Act&#148; (S. 2062), consumers will be at a significant disadvantage.
