<tr align="left" valign="top"> <td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p>Rapper, 
songwriter and hip hop producer Wyclef Jean has this song out called "If I Were 
President..."<p> With a Bob Marley feel to the music, the chorus goes like this: 
"If I were president/I'd get elected on Friday/Assassinated on Saturday/Buried 
on Sunday/ Go back to work on Monday/If I were president...."<p> Why does Wyclef, 
a Haitian New Yorker, imagine being assassinated if he were president? Because 
of his progressive populist social vision, i.e. ridding the world of hunger, poverty 
and war.<p> Well, here's the column remix. And it goes a little somethin' like 
this. Hit it!<p> If I were president, I'd take a page from Teddy Roosevelt's playbook 
and halt the Bush push to eliminate the estate tax. I would re-tool the estate 
tax rate so that small business owners would not lose the family farm. I would 
tailor the rate to specifically target the top 2 percent of America's wealthy 
class.<p> Because the hereditary transfer of concentrated wealth is incompatible 
with the ideal of equality of opportunity and democracy and because society plays 
a significant role in the creation of individual wealth, I would declare, as did 
President Theodore Roosevelt in 1906, that "the man of great wealth owes a particular 
obligation to the State because he derives special advantages from the mere existence 
of government.<p> "The primary objective of an (estate tax)," Roosevelt said, 
"should be to put a constantly increasing burden on the inheritance of those swollen 
fortunes, which it is certainly of no benefit to this country to perpetuate."<p> 
If I were president, I'd get elected on Friday and assassinated on Saturday....<p> 
If I were president, I'd assemble a blue ribbon commission to overhaul our penal 
system. I would remind the American people that most felons will eventually be 
released from prison so, despite popular subjective misperceptions about what 
criminals "deserve," the fact is we have to do everything in our power to rehabilitate 
and reconcile offenders with law-abiding communities.<p> If we don't, that means 
penal business as usual, which is taking people with problems, putting them into 
an institution that makes them worse by stripping them of their tarnished but 
inherent God-given human dignity, and then turning them loose again on an unsuspecting 
public without any jobs skills, disenfranchised and morally stigmatized.<p> That's 
a recipe for creating more victims of crime. If I were president it would be incumbent 
on me to educate the public on how a rehabilitative penal approach reduces the 
likelihood of future criminal acts, thus decreasing the number of future crime 
victims.<p> If I were president, I'd get elected on Friday and assassinated on 
Saturday....<p> If I were president I'd convene a mutual security conference at 
the United Nations, inviting the world's greatest military strategists and the 
most brilliant nonviolent theoreticians and practitioners with an aim to exploit 
the full powers and potential of Gandhi-ism in resolving global conflicts.<p> 
"Things undreamt of are daily being seen, the impossible is ever becoming possible 
(like the Red Sox beating the Yankees). We are constantly being astonished these 
days at the amazing discoveries in the field of violence. But I maintain that 
far more undreamt of and seemingly impossible discoveries will be made in the 
field of nonviolence."<p> I'd explain to the country that because the structure 
of reality itself is interdependent and because of our collective ability to destroy 
the entire human race with weapons of mass destruction, bringing the endless cycle 
of retaliatory violence to its logical and inevitable nuclear conclusion, war 
is no longer a viable option. The evil in men's hearts cannot be defeated with 
bullets and bombs.<p> I'd use the bully pulpit to explain the moral and practical 
difference between being willing to die for freedom and being willing to kill 
for it. I'd go on national television and talk about Jesus referring to peacemakers 
as children of God and how the meek will indeed inherit the earth.<p> If I were 
president, I'd get elected on Friday, assassinated on Saturday. Buried on Sunday 
and back to work on Monday.<p> Back to work? Yup. To be about the business of 
establishing a universal health care system and an education curriculum that teaches 
students how to think and not just regurgitate the "right" answers.<p> Now, you 
sing:<p> If you were president, what would you do?<p> <p ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&copy;
