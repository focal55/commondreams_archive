<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - August 9 - Today marks the launch of the campaign (<a href="http://www.RenewableEnergyYES.com" target="_new">www.RenewableEnergyYES.com</a>) to pass a groundbreaking ballot initiative on renewable energy use in Colorado this November.  The Colorado Renewable Energy Initiative will be the nation&#146;s first statewide vote on renewable energy and would require the state&#146;s major utility companies to obtain 10% of their energy from renewable sources such as wind, solar, biomass, geothermal, and hydroelectric power by 2015.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although Colorado has enough wind and sun to meet its power needs more than 10 times over, the state currently gets only 2% of its energy from renewable sources.  Increasing this margin to 10% would have the same environmental impact as removing pollution from 600,000 cars each year (according to the EPA).</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The initiative has bipartisan support from Republican and Democratic leaders including campaign co-chairs, Speaker Lola Spradley (Rep) and Congressman Mark Udall (Dem).  </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;It is a crucial time to think about our energy security. We need to prepare for the future by reducing our dependence on unstable foreign energy sources. Renewable Energy is a step toward a secure, stable energy future&#148; said co-chair Congressman Udall. </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Citing the initiative&#146;s economic benefits, co-chair Spradley noted, &#147;Ranchers and farmers are ready to harvest a bumper crop of renewable energy that can bring important economic development to rural Colorado.&#148;  </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Unfortunately, the initiative is already facing powerful opposition from Xcel Energy, Colorado&#146;s largest utility company.  On August 2nd, Xcel announced that natural gas prices are on the rise.  But rather than embracing the initiative, Xcel&#146;s solution to growing energy demands and rising fuel prices is to build a large coal plant in Pueblo, CO.  </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;This initiative will provide Coloradans with cleaner, safer, cheaper energy,&#148; said Matt Baker, <a href="http://www.RenewableEnergyYES.com" target="_new">RenewableEnergyYES.com</a> committee member.  &#147;Not only will renewable energy increase our security by reducing America&#146;s reliance on unstable foreign fuels, it will also become less expensive over time, unlike gas and coal which will become increasingly expensive and hard to obtain.&#148; </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Visitors to the campaign&#146;s web site can sign an online petition asking Xcel Energy&#146;s CEO not to block progress for Colorado and urging him to withdraw Xcel&#146;s opposition to the initiative. The web site also offers more information about the initiative, as well as how to support the campaign by volunteering or making a donation. </font> </p><p> </p><p></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
