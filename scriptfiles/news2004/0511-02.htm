Kindy has spent two five-month stints over the last year and a half in Iraq with the Christian Peacemaker Team, which released a document entitled &quot;Report and Recommendations on Iraqi Detainees&quot; in January, available at the above CPT web page. Kindy has had substantial contact with Iraqi detainees and their families and with U.S. soldiers and higher-ups. He said today: &quot;The problems are clearly not isolated. From our work with detainees and their families, the temporary facilities are in many ways worse than Abu Ghraib.&quot;</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">SHEILA PROVENCHER, <A HREF="mailto:cptiraq@cpt.org">cptiraq@cpt.org</A></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Provencher is currently in Baghdad with other members of the Christian Peacemaker Team. She said today: &quot;CPT has been documenting abuses within the detention system for nearly a year, and these photos, tragically, were not a surprise to me. For months now, we have communicated grave concerns about the detention system in several meetings with U.S. military and Coalition Provisional Authority officials in Iraq, and with representatives in Congress.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">GENE STOLTZFUS, MAXINE NASH, <A HREF="mailto:peacemakers@cpt.org">peacemakers@cpt.org</A></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Stoltzfus is director of the Christian Peacemaker Team and is in daily contact with the team members currently in Baghdad.
