<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - September 20 - Roughly four in 10 Americans say they are worried about potential problems with electronic voting machines to be used in the November election, according to a new poll by the legal Web site FindLaw (http://www.findlaw.com). Forty-two percent of those surveyed are concerned about potential vote tampering in electronic voting machines. Thirty-eight percent say they are worried about the accuracy of the machines.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Roughly one-third of voters nationwide will use touch-screen computer voting machines in the upcoming November election. The machines are controversial because of concerns over testing procedures, security measures to prevent tampering, the accuracy of vote counts, lack of paper trails, the potential for software bugs and vulnerability to computer hackers. Lawsuits have been filed in several states demanding removal or modification of the machines. New electronic voting machines are being installed in several states, including California, Ohio, Maryland, Connecticut and Florida, the site of several major vote-tallying controversies in the 2000 Presidential election.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The survey interviewed 1,000 adults nationwide, with results accurate to plus or minus three percent.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The FindLaw survey found that concerns about accuracy and vote tampering with electronic voting machines were higher among adults who were younger, those with lower incomes, and minorities. A majority of those with annual incomes of $25,000 or less said they were concerned about possible vote tampering. Fifty percent of non-whites said they were concerned about possible vote tampering.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Overall, 42 percent of those surveyed said they were concerned about potential problems with vote tampering in electronic voting machines, while 57 percent said they were not concerned. Thirty- eight percent said they were concerned about the accuracy of electronic voting machines, compared with 61 percent who said they were not.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">FindLaw is the most-visited online source of legal information and resources.
