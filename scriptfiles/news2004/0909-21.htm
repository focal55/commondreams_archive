<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CHALFONT, PA -  September 9 - In three waves of interruptions, seven AIDS activists 
disrupted President Bush's campaign appearance at the small venue of 
Byers Choice factory in the suburbs of Southeastern Pennsylvania. The 
AIDS activists held signs reading: "BUSH: GLOBAL AIDS LIAR" and "$30 
BILLION FOR AIDS NOW!" while chanting "Bush lies, people die, $30 
billion for AIDS now."</font></p>

An activist shouted a  question to President 
Bush: "The U.S. fair share of global AIDS contributions is $30 
billion by 2008. Why do you refuse to pay America's fair share?"</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
The 
activists were escorted from the event, and charged with disorderly 
conduct.

The protest comes one week after several high-profile protests and 
arrests during the Republican National Convention criticizing 
President Bush's record on AIDS, including a disruption of White 
House Chief of Staff Andrew Card's speech on the Main Stage of 
Madison Square Garden.

</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"American voters have to hold Bush accountable for his compassion 
deficit on AIDS," said Jose DeMarco of <a href="http://www.critpath.org/actup/">ACT UP</a> Philadelphia. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
Bush's 
controversial bilateral AIDS plan, called "PEPFAR" (the President's 
Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief), has come under criticism by 
activists and public health experts. According to critics, PEPFAR 
underfunds key programs like the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, 
Tuberculosis and Malaria, and it funds HIV prevention programs that 
are based in ideology, not scientific evidence.

</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
In addition, the White House has refused to support 100% debt 
cancellation for at least 50 of the world's poorest countries, 
although billions of dollars in resources made available through debt 
cancellation could be invested in life saving HIV treatment and 
prevention. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The finance ministers of the Group of 7 industrialized 
countries (G7), including John Snow, US Treasury Secretary, meet 
October 1 to consider a proposal for 100% debt cancellation.

"8,500 people are dying with HIV every day. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The stakes couldn't be 
higher," said Rowda Moallin of ACT UP Philadelphia. "President Bush 
won't cancel poor countries' debts, he won't spend the money needed 
to fight AIDS, and he won't support science based HIV prevention 
programs. If that's President Bush's version of compassion, I would 
hate to see indifference."</font></p>
