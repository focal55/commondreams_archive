<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - July 9 - From Sheri A. Lunn, Director of Communications.</FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Task Force friends:</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Over the coming days, the United States Senate is scheduled to debate the &quot;Federal Marriage Amendment&quot; that would, for the first time in history, amend the constitution of the United States to explicitly discriminate against a minority by forever prohibiting the recognition of same sex marriage (and, as it's now written, other forms of partner recognition as well).</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">With the Democratic minority holding firm to its pledge to kill the measure and a handful of the Senate's 51 Republicans expressing doubts about its need, even Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN) has been forced to admit the votes aren't there to pass the amendment as written - and probably not enough to end debate and force a vote on the amendment itself. (Just over two weeks ago, Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said he thought a majority of Senators would end up voting against the amendment.)</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The media have accurately diagnosed the real purpose behind this particularly ugly and wasteful charade: to try to put John Kerry and the Democratic Party on the spot right before the Democratic National Convention. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In desperation, the right wing has gone into hyperdrive, hoping to generate thousands of telephone calls to Senators today and over the weekend. As described in the article below, the head of Focus on the Family, James Dobson, is asking supporters to &quot;call until the switchboard smokes.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">We need to do the same to be sure there's no wavering on our side. So, please, take a couple of minutes and contact your U.S. Senator. (In the article below, you'll find the names of those Senators who are either undecided or opposed to this discriminatory amendment.)</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Sign onto our online action center here to contact your Senators. And remember, Equality Begins at Home so ask your friends and family to call as well. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">More info on the struggle for marriage equality can be found in the Task Force Marriage Information Resource Center at http://www.TheTaskForce.org/marriagecenter.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Baptist Press Article:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Dobson on FMA: Call Senators 'until the switchboard smokes' </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">By: Michael Foust </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Note: In accordance with Title 17 U.S.C. Section 107, the material originated by other sources is distributed without profit to those who have expressed a prior interest in receiving the included information for research and educational purposes.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">NASHVILLE, Tenn. (BP)--Focus on the Family's James Dobson broke new ground on his radio broadcast July 7, telling where all 100 U.S. Senators stand on the Federal Marriage Amendment and encouraging his listeners to flood the nation's capital with phone calls. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Call them every day,&quot; he said. &quot;Get all your friends to call. Call until the switchboard smokes.&quot; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Dobson's plea came on the eve of debate in the Senate on the Federal Marriage Amendment, which would protect the traditional definition of marriage, thus banning same-sex &quot;marriage.&quot; Debate is scheduled to begin July 12. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;These are Democrats and Republicans -- some of them conservative -- who will not commit to voting to protect marriage,&quot; he said. &quot;... They've been conservative on so many issues, but when it comes to this issue, they are terrified of the homosexual lobby.&quot; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">According to Dobson only 33 Senators -- 32 Republicans and one Democrat -- have stated they will back the Federal Marriage Amendment. The other 67 Senators either have stated their opposition or remain undecided, he said. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">For the amendment to pass it must garner the votes of 67 Senators. But for it to get that far, it must get 60 votes simply to prevent a filibuster. Congressional experts say it is uncertain whether the amendment can reach even the 60-vote threshold. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Phone calls, Dobson said, can make the difference. Senators who support the amendment, he said, have requested that people call Washington. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Our friends in the Senate are begging us to do what we have done today,&quot; he said. [They have said,] 'Please ask the people to call. It's the only way we're going to win this.'&quot; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Dobson and guests on the program answered objections to the amendment. Alan Sears, president of the Alliance Defense Fund, said that contrary to what some believe, the Defense of Marriage Act -- signed into law in 1996 -- is not sufficient protection against the legalization of same-sex &quot;marriage.&quot; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;One of these out-of-control sets of courts can strike that down, and we have chaos at the federal level,&quot; he said. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">A federal amendment, Sears said, &quot;takes it out of the jurisdiction of [the] court.&quot; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The irony, Dobson said, is that in June the Senate passed a bill adding sexual orientation to the list of hate crimes. It still must pass the House. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;It tells you a whole lot about the Senate,&quot; he said. &quot;The Senate that passed hate crimes legislation with hardly a whimper ... they are not willing to defend marriage. That bothers me a lot.&quot; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">While Dobson often deals with hot-button issues on his radio program, he rarely if ever goes as far as he did July 7 by naming each individual Senator and requesting action on the part of the audience. In fact, before he read the list he said he was doing something he's &quot;never done before and never been able to do before.&quot; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Because of tax laws the broadcast was not paid for with Focus on the Family funds but instead by a separate organization, Focus on the Family Action, which was started to fund pro-family political efforts. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Senate amendment is SJR 30. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">According to Dobson 67 Senators either are opposed to the amendment or are undecided. They are: </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Daniel Akaka (D.-Hawaii), Max Baucus (D.-Mont.), Evan Bayh (D.-Ind.), Robert Bennett (R.-Utah), Joseph Biden (D.-Del.), Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.), Barbara Boxer (D.-Calif.), John Breaux (D.-La.), Robert Byrd (D.-W.Va.), Ben Campbell (R.-Colo.), Maria Cantwell (D.-Wash.), Thomas Carper (D.-Del.), Lincoln Chafee (R.-R.I.), Hillary Clinton (D.-N.Y.), Susan Collins (R.-Maine), Kent Conrad (D.-N.D.), Jon Corzine (D.-N.J.), Thomas Daschle (D.-S.D.), Mark Dayton (D.-Minn.), Mike DeWine (R.-Ohio), Christopher Dodd (D.-Conn.), Byron Dorgan (D.-N.D.), Richard Durbin (D.-Ill.), John Edwards (D.-N.C.), Russell Feingold (D.-Wis.), Dianne Feinstein (D.-Calif.), Bob Graham (D.-Fla.), Judd Gregg (R.-N.H.), Chuck Hagel (R.-Neb.), Tom Harkin (D.-Iowa), Ernest Hollings (D.-S.C.), Daniel Inouye (D.-Hawaii), James Jeffords (I-Vt.), Tim Johnson (D.-S.D.), Edward Kennedy (D.-Mass.), John Kerry (D.-Mass.), Herb Kohl (D.-Wis.), Mary Landrieu (D.-La.), Frank Lautenberg (D.-N.J.), Patrick Leahy (D.-Vt.), Carl Levin (D.-Mich.), Joseph Lieberman (D.-Conn.), Blanche Lincoln (D.-Ark.), Richard Lugar (R.-Ind.), John McCain (R.-Ariz.), Barbara Mikulski (D.-Md.), Lisa Murkowski (R.-Alaska), Patty Murray (D.-Wash.), Bill Nelson (D.-Fla.), Ben Nelson (D.-Neb.), Don Nickles (R.-Okla.), Mark Pryor (D.-Ark.), Jack Reed (D.-R.I.), Harry Reid (D.-Nev.), Pat Roberts (R.-Kan.), John Rockefeller (D.-W.Va.), Paul Sarbanes (D.-Md.), Charles Schumer (D.-N.Y.), Gordon Smith (R.-Ore.), Olympia Snowe (R.-Maine), Arlen Specter (R.-Pa.), Debbie Stabenow (D.-Mich.), John Sununu, R.-N.H., Craig Thomas (R.-Wyo.), George Voinovich (R.-Ohio), John Warner (R.-Va.), Ron Wyden (D.-Ore.). </FONT></P><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
