<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">VASHON, WA - February 19 - The Backbone Campaign is a progressive grassroots effort to embolden the Democratic Party. We are both recognizing the Democrats who have stood up to intimidation, and demanding greater strength, and visionary leadership from the rest. We are uniting artists and activists to utilize beauty and humor to inspire citizens and leaders alike. Our nation and the world face a collection of unprecedented challenges. These challenges will not be met by a fearful people. We intend to tap into the American peoples' great reserve of courage and creative power to sculpt a future worthy of our children. </FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Projects </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Backbone Awards, similar in size to the Oscar, are given to courageous elected officials in recognition of their willingness to take principled progressive stands at politically lonely moments. Artists and activist groups around the country are invited to create their own satellite awards ceremonies. We will provide these groups with the awards and support for creating successful media events. On January 11, 2004, the Honorable Congressman Jim McDermott was given the first Backbone Award, for his courageous pre-war trip to Iraq. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">A Platform with a Backbone is being sculpted through an online process of gathering the country's most progressive initiatives, and organizing them into a living visionary document. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">A Giant Backbone Puppet will appear in the streets of Boston during the 2004 Democratic National Convention, traveling horizontally above the heads of the accompanying parade of Americana. Each vertebrae will symbolize a piece of the Platform with a Backbone. We will work to support efforts of the Progressive Caucus leading up to the convention and recruit progressive delegates to spread our message within the convention. Our goal is to wrench the Democratic party out of the hands of corporate interests and rescue it from irrelevance. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">You Can Participate! </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">We are seeking support and participation from progressives, grassroots artists and activist groups.
