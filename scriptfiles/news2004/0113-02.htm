In a letter, the diverse group of national and community leaders urged the president to fulfill a campaign pledge to &#147;restore and renew&#148; America&#146;s national parks by providing an additional $240 million in the National Park Service&#146;s 2005 operating budget. </FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;Our national parks are in triage,&#148; said Americans for National Parks Campaign Director Blake Selzer. &#147;Protection of our national heritage should be a national priority.&#148;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Research has shown that national parks are operating, on average, with less than two-thirds of needed funding&#151;an annual shortfall in excess of $600 million.
