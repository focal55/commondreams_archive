<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> NEW YORK - October 8 - "This is classic bait and switch," says G. Simon Harak, Anti-Militarism Coordinator of the <a href="http://www.warresisters.org" target="_new">War Resisters League</a> and one of the 
200-plus August 31 arrestees against whom all charges were dropped 
yesterday. "On August 31, we obeyed the police directives, and they still 
arrested us. Now they're saying that they can't convict us in court, but 
they're still trying to convict us in public opinion."

<p>Assistant DA William Beesch declared Wednesday that he was declining to 
pursue the charges of disorderly conduct and marching without a permit 
because he was "unable to prove" that the defendants were guilty. "The DA 
couldn't 'prove' we were guilty because we weren't," Harak says. "A fair 
number of the people who were arrested weren't even participating in the 
protest."

<p>Some 200 people were arrested near the "Ground Zero" site of the World 
Trade Center on the afternoon of the 31st. The protest had begun with a 
one-hour vigil at Ground Zero and was to be followed by a solemn march 
toward the Republican National Convention and then a "die-in," an act of 
nonviolent civil disobedience calling attention to the terrible toll the 
Bush administration wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have taken. Just before 
the march was scheduled to begin, police and march organizers negotiated 
about how the march might be held without disrupting traffic; a march that 
doesn't disrupt traffic is legal under the First Amendment whether or not 
it has a permit.

<p>Yet once the march began, police fenced off an entire block and arrested 
everyone within the area, including bystanders, some legal observers and 
some members of the press. "After Mayor Michael Bloomberg's declaration 
that free speech was a not a right, but a privilege [on August 16, at the 
John Jay College of Criminal Justice], we thought his administration might 
try to annul our First Amendment rights," said WRL Board member, Frida 
Berrigan. "So we planned for the march to start from several different 
places. Some of us completed the march and the die-in. Generals aren't the 
only ones who know how to plan campaigns."

<p>The arrestees were flex-cuffed; some had to sit in the sun for several 
hours. They were taken to a former bus depot on the Hudson River's Pier 57 
and held in wire-link cages topped with razor wire, with few seats other 
than a cement floor covered with oil and other chemical contaminants. After 
many hours, they were again cuffed and transferred to the Criminal Court 
Building at 100 Centre Street, where they were finger-printed. So in the 
space of two weeks, the exercise of free speech went from being a 
constitutionally guaranteed right, to being a revocable privilege, to being 
a criminal act.

<p>Dropping the charges is not enough, "we require some form of redress for 
the violation of our civil rights," Harak said.

<p>To demonstrate that we will not be cowed or intimidated by the government's 
tactics, the War Resisters League would lead another nonviolent march, 
again beginning from the World Trade Center site. "We need to reclaim that 
public space for the people," Ruth Benn said, "and away from those who 
would deprive us of our First Amendment rights."<i> </i></font>
