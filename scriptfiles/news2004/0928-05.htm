Today's New York Times features an op-ed by Ellsberg titled &quot;Truths Worth Telling&quot; in which he writes: &quot;Surely there are officials in the present administration who recognize that the United States has been misled into a war in Iraq, but who have so far kept their silence -- as I long did about the war in Vietnam. To them I have a personal message: don't repeat my mistakes. Don't wait until more troops are sent, and thousands more have died, before telling truths that could end a war and save lives. Do what I wish I had done in 1964: go to the press, to Congress, and document your claims.&quot; Author of the book Secrets: A Memoir of Vietnam and the Pentagon Papers, Ellsberg faced 115 years on 12 felony counts in 1971 for leaking the Pentagon Papers.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RAY McGOVERN, <a href="mailto:rmcgovern@slschool.org" target="_new">rmcgovern@slschool.org</a>, <a href="http://www.antiwar.com/news/?articleid=3565" target="_new">www.antiwar.com/news/?articleid=3565</a></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Also available for a limited number of interviews, McGovern is one of the signatories with Ellsberg to a recent statement, &quot;A Call to Patriotic Whistleblowing,&quot; available at the above web address.
