<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - March 5 - Wes Boyd, President of MoveOn.org Voter Fund, announced this afternoon that his organization will spend another $1 million to amplify its TV ad campaign focused on the economic failures of the Bush Administration.</FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">On Thursday, March 4th, MoveOn.org Voter Fund launched a $1.9 million TV ad campaign in seventeen states and 67 media markets which was scheduled to run through Monday, March 8th. Most of the TV buy paid for an ad that highlighted President Bush&#146;s plan to eliminate overtime pay for eight million workers, the continued loss of manufacturing jobs to &#147;outsourcing,&#148; and the general economic insecurity felt by working families.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;In light of the disappointing jobs numbers today, which demonstrate again that the President has no plan for getting many Americans back to work, we&#146;ve decided that it&#146;s important for our message to stay on the air,&#148; said Boyd. </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Earlier today, RNC Chairman, Ed Gillespie released a letter he claims to have sent to TV stations asking them to pull the MoveOn.org Voter Fund ad on grounds that it violates federal campaign finance law. </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;It&#146;s not surprising that Mr. Gillespie continues to make false claims about the legality of our campaign in order to try to silence us. That&#146;s his job as Chairman of the Republican National Committee. Our lawyers continue to assure us that our advertising, and the small contributions from tens of thousands of our members that pay for it, conform in every way to existing campaign finance laws,&#148; Boyd said.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">MoveOn.org Voter Fund&#146;s lawyer, Joseph Sandler of Sandler, Reiff and Young observed, &#147;The federal campaign laws have permitted precisely this use of money for advertising for the past twenty five years. The most recent court rulings continue to uphold the legality of what MoveOn.org Voter Fund is doing. The RNC statement is a complete misrepresentation of the law.&#148;</FONT></P><P> </P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
