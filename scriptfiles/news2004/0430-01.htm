<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - April 30 - In <I>The Day After Tomorrow</I>, an ice age blankets North America in 96 hours. While this could never happen so quickly in real life, Earth&#146;s average temperature is warming, and at a faster rate than at any time in recorded history. This warming is due mostly to pollution generated by human activity, primarily the burning of fossil fuels. The predicted impacts of this warming are already visible around the globe. The good news is we don&#146;t have to sit back and wait for catastrophic changes&#151;such as more lethal and frequent storms, droughts, and heat waves&#151;to arrive. There are ways to reduce our pollution and slow climate change. Solutions already exist. And each of us can play a role in reducing the threat. Worldwatch <A HREF="http://www.worldwatch.org/press/experts/" TARGET="_new">energy and climate experts</A> are available to explain how.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>Cool Science: There&#146;s a Conveyor Belt in the Ocean!?</B></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In <I>The Day After Tomorrow</I>, disaster erupts because global warming disrupts a natural &#147;conveyor belt&#148; of ocean currents. This belt, which slowly winds around the globe, helps to regulate the Earth&#146;s climate. Hollywood didn&#146;t dream up this belt. It&#146;s real and there is evidence that it is being affected by global warming. What is the science behind the belt? Might human activity be putting it at risk? What might we face if currents don&#146;t circulate properly? </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>What Can I Do?</B></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Climate change, global warming, pollution&#133; Today&#146;s global environmental problems often seem monstrous and unsolvable. What can individuals do in the face of such a Goliath? The answer is: more than you&#146;d think. From making simple changes in the way we use energy, to buying more environmentally sensitive products, to supporting businesses and political candidates who care about climate change, there are many things we can do to curb our polluting emissions and slow climate change. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>Building a Better Day After Tomorrow with Renewable Energy </B></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Renewable energy is taking off around the globe in response to a variety of concerns&#151;with the threat of global climate change nearing the top of the list. The security of the world&#146;s energy supply and the health and environmental impacts of conventional energy are also driving this trend. But some areas of the world are moving to renewables far faster than others. Despite its size and wealth of resources, the United States, for example, no longer leads the world in the development and use of renewable technologies. In fact, Japan, which has far less sunshine than California, uses and manufactures more solar photovoltaic (PV) cells and modules than any other country in the world. And Germany, which has a fraction the land and resources of the United States, has twice as much installed wind capacity and leads in other renewables as well. If it&#146;s not natural resources, then what&#146;s driving some countries to forge ahead on the path toward a renewable energy future while others are slower to keep pace? </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Visit the Worldwatch Climate Change: <A HREF="http://www.worldwatch.org/features/climate/" TARGET="_new">A Better Day After Tomorrow web portal</A>.</FONT></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
