We call on American military authorities to do whatever is necessary to ensure that those supplies reach Iraqi civilians who are suffering and dying today in that city.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It is also essential that reports of attacks on civilians be investigated thoroughly by an independent international body and the results of that investigation be made known. There must be an accounting of civilian casualties in Fallujah and those forced to flee their homes must be allowed to return. American journalists embedded with our military should also examine the impact of the war on Iraqi civilians.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We call on President Bush, elected officials and all Americans of conscience to re-think our disastrous policies in Iraq and to recognize that those policies are making us less safe and less respected as a nation.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>CAIR, America's largest Muslim civil liberties group, is headquartered in Washington, D.C., and has 29 offices and chapters nationwide and in Canada.
