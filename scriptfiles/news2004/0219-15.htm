<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">NEW YORK - February 19 - Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA) today praised the recently released report &quot;Scientific Integrity in Policymaking,&quot; issued by the Union of Concerned Scientists. The report documents the Bush administration's repeated imposition of ideological beliefs on the scientific process. More than 60 leading scientists, including 20 Nobel laureates, contributed to the report. </FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;This carefully documented report makes plain the Bush administration's extensive subversion of science to fit its ideological agenda,&quot; said Gloria Feldt, president of PPFA. &quot;Just last week the FDA delayed its decision on whether to make emergency contraception (EC) available over the counter, despite comprehensive evidence of EC's safety and efficacy - and despite the FDA's own advisory boards' recommendation! The imposition of narrow beliefs on scientific objectivity affects all of us, threatening public health and scientific research. If allowed to continue, it will have disastrous consequences for the United States and the world.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The report, which covers a range of scientific issues, features sections on reproductive rights, abstinence-only education, and HIV/AIDS, and includes the false link between breast cancer and abortion made by anti-choice hardliners. The report also details the corruption of scientific integrity in the appointment process, describing how the Bush administration has consistently appointed to its advisory committees people with bias, financial conflicts, or beliefs far outside the scientific and medical mainstream. For example, President Bush has appointed several outspoken enemies of reproductive rights to the FDA Reproductive Health Advisory Committee, including Dr. David Hager, who prescribes biblical scriptures to treat pre-menstrual syndrome, and Dr. Joseph Stanford, who refuses to prescribe contraceptives of any sort to his patients. Planned Parenthood commends the Union of Concerned Scientists for their support of objective science and vows to continue fighting the imposition of narrow personal ideology on the realm of public health.</FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
