<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- November 8 -- Following is a statement released today by NOA, LLC, a public relations firm, on behalf of the People of the Ivory Coast:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We call on the American opinion to have France and French troops stop their hegemonic attitude in the Ivory Coast. Please call or fax a copy of this letter to your representative and/or senator in Congress to make the Ivorian cause heard.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In fact, on Saturday, Nov. 6 French troops in an alleged retaliation move, openly and unilaterally waged war against Cote d'Ivoire (former Ivory Coast). To that end they bombed the Ivorian Presidential Palace, destroyed the national army war planes, targeted and killed more than 300 defenseless civilians who took to the street in Abidjan to demonstrate against French military occupation of their country.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition, the French troops seized the two airports in Abidjan and Yamoussoukro, and sent more troops to reinforce their positions. In so doing, France under Jacques Chirac demonstrated her implication in the terrorist attacks launched on Sept. 19, 2002, by Ivorian rebels backed by Burkina Faso and Liberia in an attempt to overthrow the elected president, President Laurent Gbagbo.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A peace agreement signed in Marcoussis (France) on Jan. 24, 2003 and reinforced in Accra, on July 31, 2004 set the timetable for the disarmament to start on Oct. 15. The rebels refused to do so although President Gbagbo had implemented the political reforms designed to be part of the entire package. Therefore, the Ivorian national army took upon itself the responsibility to enforce the overdue disarmament by destroying the weapons of the rebels on Nov. 3, so as to enable Ivorian citizens to freely move everywhere in the country, particularly on the northern part, which was under the control of the rebels.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
