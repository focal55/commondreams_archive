<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - February 10 - As revelations each day make clear that President Bush and his advisers deliberately misled Americans on the reasons for invading Iraq, a coalition of organizations and individuals &#151; including a former CIA analyst, an anti-terrorism diplomat and military families &#151; called on Congress today to censure the President. </FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;This is not about a failure of intelligence. It&#146;s a failure of integrity,&#148; said Tom Andrews, national director of Win Without War, a coalition of 42 national membership organizations.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;Each day new evidenced dribbles out that the President knew. He knew the evidence wasn&#146;t sufficient to support his claims that Iraq posed an &#145;imminent threat&#146; to the American people,&#148; said Andrews, a former member of Congress from Maine. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;He knew that the intelligence community&#146;s assessment of Iraq&#146;s arms programs did not support the administration&#146;s pre-conceived notion that Iraq had chemical and nuclear weapons. He knew better &#151; but he chose to mislead us,&#148; Andrews added. It is up to Congress to address this significant abuse of power by the Bush Administration, he said.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Adam Ruben, field director for the grassroots organization MoveOn.org, said it has collected more than 450,000 signatures in a week urging Congress to begin a process leading to censure. He said the organization would use print and TV advertising and its two million members to extend the campaign.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;There should be consequences when the President of the United States misleads the people and the Congress,&#148; said Ruben. &#147;Congress devoted considerable attention and, eventually, voted to impeach President Clinton for misleading the public about a sexual relationship. It isn&#146;t unreasonable to think that misleading the nation about the necessity of going to war constitutes an abuse of power of much greater significance,&#148; he said.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;The President has created the worst intelligence scandal in history, falsely creating a case to go to war when no national interests were at stake&#148; said Mel Goodman, who served at both the CIA and the State Department under Republican and Democratic administrations.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;The reasons we were given for going to war were false. The Bush Administration engaged in a deliberate campaign of information warfare, which employed erroneous and misleading information as part of a broader strategy to build public opinion for an invasion,&#148; added Larry Johnson, who served as Deputy Director of the State Department&#146;s Office of Counter Terrorism and, earlier, for the CIA.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The parents of two soldiers who were casualties of the war in Iraq demanded accountability. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;I want to know there was a good reason for what happened to my daughter and to all of the others injured and killed in Iraq,&#148; said Adele Kubein of Corvalis, OR, whose daughter was injured by a mortar round while serving with her National Guard unit. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Also appearing was Fernando Suarez del Solar of San Diego, whose son, a Marine, was killed in combat. &#147;It&#146;s very difficult to accept the reality that my son died in a war that was not at all necessary,&#148; he said.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">MoveOn.org will encourage its members to communicate with Members of Congress in the coming weeks, Ruben said, and will assist in publicizing new evidence of the Administration&#146;s deceptive behavior. &#147;This is only the beginning,&#148; he said.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><A HREF="http://www.moveon.org/front/" TARGET="_new">MoveOn.org</A> is an internet issues organizing project created in 1998 during the campaign to impeach President Bill Clinton despite public opinion surveys showing that Americans wanted Congress merely to censure the President for his behavior and then &#147;move on&#148; to other national business.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><A HREF="http://www.winwithoutwarus.org" TARGET="_new">Win Without War</A> is a coalition of religious, human rights, civil rights and national membership groups that promote international cooperation and the enforcement of international law to provide security for the United States and the world. It offers a mainstream, patriotic voice for engaging opinion makers, activating citizens and communicating through the media.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><A HREF="http://www.winwithoutwarus.org/html/new_censure.html" TARGET="_new">Read the censure materials and background</A></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><A HREF="http://www.winwithoutwarus.org/html/whatsnew.censure.ad.pdf" TARGET="_new">See the Washington Post ad (PDF)</A></FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
