<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - February 4 - Today the Council of the City of New York approved a resolution denouncing parts of the Patriot Act and affirming that &#147;security measures [must] enhance the public safety without impairing constitutional rights or infringing on civil liberties.&#148;  The resolution makes New York the 251st &#145;civil liberties safe zone,&#146; and raises the zones&#146; population to 43 million nationwide, according to the Bill of Rights Defense Committee, which tracks the movement and encourages communities to join in a national debate on these issues.  Four of the country&#146;s five most populous cities&#151;New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Philadelphia&#151;are now &#145;safe zones,&#146; along with the states of Alaska, Hawaii, and Vermont.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Nancy Talanian, BORDC&#146;s director, says, &#147;Our country is indebted to New York&#146;s City Council for demonstrating true patriotism by courageously upholding the Bill of Rights.  Their vote sends a strong message to Washington and our whole nation that the tragic attacks of September 11th were not a signal for the United States to abandon the Bill of Rights and the Constitution.&#148; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The groundswell of support for amending the Patriot Act received two major boosts last week.  On Monday, federal judge Audrey Collins handed down a ruling that part of the Act is unconstitutional.  On Tuesday, one of the Act&#146;s leading authors, Georgetown Law Professor Viet Dinh, said that he supports modifications. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Nevertheless, the Bush Administration remains staunchly opposed to any amendments.  Last Wednesday, Attorney General John Ashcroft sent a letter to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch regarding S.1709, the Security and Freedom Ensured Act of 2003 (SAFE Act), which is among several congressional initiatives to amend the Patriot Act that has bipartisan support.  The letter urges the Senate to vote against the SAFE Act and warns that &#147;if S.1709 is presented in its current form to the President, the President&#146;s senior advisors will recommend that it be vetoed.&#148;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">New York&#146;s resolution recognizes the city&#146;s diversity and denounces policies that target city residents &#147;who appear to be Arab, Muslim or of South Asian descent.&#148;  The council opposes federal requests requiring city agencies to violate federal or state laws, including the United States Constitution. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The New York City Bill of Rights Defense Campaign began as a small group in Brooklyn and grew to a citywide nonpartisan coalition of 92 member groups and hundreds of members, according to Glenn C. Devitt, the Campaign&#146;s Chair.  A majority of the city&#146;s representatives in Congress signed a letter urging Council Speaker Gifford Miller to support the resolution. </FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
