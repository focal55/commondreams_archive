<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - March 15 - Moving Ideas, the leading source for progressive public policy on the net, has released a new research companion on the controversial Unborn Victims of Violence Act. Moving Ideas has centralized research, editorials and fact sheets from progressive organizations such as NARAL/Pro-Choice America, Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice and the American Civil Liberties Union. This companion includes links to government and pro-choice organizations that examine the problematic issues with the legislation such as: the separation of the fetus and pregnant woman, the lack of concern for violence against women, and the hidden agenda against Roe vs. Wade.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">On March 4th, the House of Representatives passed the Unborn Victims of Violence Act (HR 1997) by a margin of 254-163. The bill now heads to the Senate. If passed, the Act will make it a crime to kill or harm an embryo or fetus while attacking a pregnant woman, therefore charging the criminal with two separate and punishable crimes. This is widely viewed as a win for anti-abortion advocates because it gives rights to an embryo or fetus at any stage of development. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Read articles such as: Deceptive &quot;Unborn Victims of Violence Act&quot;, from the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice; Do Fetal Rights Limit Mothers' Rights, from the National Conference of State Legislatures; and &quot;The Unborn Victims of Violence Act&quot; Is Not the Solution to Domestic Violence, from NARAL/Pro-Choice America.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">View the entire article at: <A HREF="http://www.movingideas.org/blitz/uvva.html" TARGET="_new">http://www.movingideas.org/blitz/uvva.html</A></FONT></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
