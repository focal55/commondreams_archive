<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MINNEAPOLIS-  September 28 -  The U.S. is adopting fewer international treaties, opting out of previous treaty commitments, and often finds itself isolated among the international community on treaties that limit nuclear arms and protect workers, the environment, women and children, concludes a new report on the United Nations treaty system by the <a href="http://www.iatp.org">Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy</a> (IATP).

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report, The Treaty Database: A Monitor of U.S. Participation In Global Affairs, found that the Senate has ratified only 10 treaties during the Bush Administration. Of those 10, four of the treaties were actually signed during the Clinton Administration. Five of the six treaties signed by the Bush Administration represented the interests of specific industries, with only one related to social development. 

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Perhaps most alarming, since 2000 the Bush Administration has reversed the U.S. government's position on at least five major UN treaties including the Kyoto Protocol on Climate Change, the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention, the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons Treaty and the International Criminal Court. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Bush Administration's withdrawal from the ABM treaty in 2002 was the first time a major power has withdrawn from a nuclear treaty after it had become legally binding. North Korea opted out of the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons Treaty in 2003, citing the Bush Administration's decision on the ABM treaty.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

"This retreat from the UN system makes it much harder for the Bush Administration to lead at the international level," said Kristin Dawkins, IATP's president of Global Programs. "By pulling out of long-held treaties, the Bush Administration has actually weakened the international rule of law. It has set a dangerous precedent that other countries could follow in areas such as arms trade and nuclear weapons." 

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Of the 549 treaties reviewed for the report, the United States has ratified only 157, or 29 percent. The report also found that the U.S. has ratified just 14 of the International Labor Organization's 162 active treaties, 12 of 38 environmental treaties, six of 21 Human Rights treaties, two of 12 treaties that address traffic in persons, the first Geneva Convention but not the two related protocols, about half of 23 treaties protecting intellectual property, and all 13 treaties addressing international terrorism.
