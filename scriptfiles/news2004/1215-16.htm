<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- December 15 -- &quot;Today, the Geneva-based World Meteorological Organization (WMO) reported that 2004 is on track to be the fourth-hottest year since record-keeping began in 1861. The WMO added that global warming trends will lead to increased extreme weather events.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;While the Bush administration continues to deny the seriousness of global warming, temperatures continue to rise and 2004 joins the 10 warmest years on record - all occuring since 1990. Today's WMO announcement is further evidence reinforcing the scientific conclusion that global warming will lead to increased habitat loss, sea level rise, and shifting weather patterns. Sir David King, the British government's top scientist, called global warming 'more serious even than the threat of terrorism.' In contrast to the actions of our leading trading partners and the warnings of the world's leading scientists, the Bush administration's approach to global warming ranges from ostrich-like to flat earth.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Meanwhile, states are taking the initiative in attacking global warming. California's recently passed Pavley Law will require automobile makers to reduce global warming emissions from new cars and light trucks beginning in 2009. The Pavley Law is a big step in the right direction because it delivers clean car choices for consumers, and encourages cost-effective, currently available technology to reduce global warming emissions. Seven Northeastern states plan to implement California law when it is finalized, and Canada is considering adopting the measures.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;There is more good news. We have the solutions today to curb global warming emissions. By using cost-effective technology, we can slash greenhouse gas emissions from cars, pickup trucks, and SUVs. Using this technology can also wean ourselves from our dangerous oil dependence. We can use energy efficient technology to cut the energy use of lighting, heating, cooling and industrial processes. Finally, we can replace dirty, coal fired power plants with clean, renewable energy sources like wind, solar power and cleaner burning natural gas.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Its time for the Bush administration to take its head out of the sand and put currently available, cost-effective solutions to work against the problem of global warming.&quot;</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
