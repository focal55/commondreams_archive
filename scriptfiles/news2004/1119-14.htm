<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BOZEMAN, MT -- November 19 -- Independent Business Alliances, community groups and individual locally-owned businesses nationwide are urging citizens of their communities to &#147;unchain&#148; themselves on November 20&#151;to do all their business on that day only at locally-owned independent establishments. The efforts are part of America Unchained ! , a national campaign of the <a href="http://www.amiba.net/" target="_new">American Business Alliance</a> (AMIBA). </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These community-level efforts aim to get citizens excited about, yes, micro-economics. Each local organizing group or business, using last year&#146;s retail sales figure, is calculating how much money will enter the local economy if every community member shops or dines with only locally-owned independent businesses that day. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Austin, Texas that figure is $14 million dollars above what the community would gain if everyone shopped at chains. In the Tampa, Florida area, it&#146;s $17.5 million, and in Colorado Springs, it&#146;s $9 million. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;We think people will want to participate in their community&#146;s America Unchained! event once they discover the positive community impact of spending their hard-earned money with their home town businesses,&#148; said Jennifer Rockne, director of AMIBA. AMIBA is a national non-profit organization that helps communities start and sustain their own IBAs--local coalitions uniting independent businesses, non-profits, and local citizens to help entrepreneurism flourish and prevent chain businesses from driving out home town businesses. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Studies from small towns in Maine to sizeable cities like Austin and the Andersonville neighborhood in Chicago found that locally-owned independent businesses create 3 - 3 &frac12; times the local economic activity as chains do. Home town businesses use the goods and services of other local independent businesses and give back to community institutions far more than chains,&#148; said Rockne. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At least 12 local Independent Business Alliances and thousands of businesses are participating around the country in communities like Phoenix, Colorado Springs, Tampa, Albuquerque, Raleigh, Mystic (CT) and many more. AMIBA and collaborating organizations plan &#147;America Unchained&#148; to be an annual event.<br></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
