<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - March 31 - Statement of Gretchen DuBeau, Staff Attorney</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">We applaud Representatives Gilchrest (R-MD) and Olver (D-MA) for introducing the Climate Stewardship Act. This new legislation will limit global warming emissions to 2000 levels by the year 2010 by establishing a market-based cap and trade system. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">U.S. global warming pollution accounts for one-quarter of global emissions. Burning dirty fossil fuels (oil, coal and gas) to power cars and homes releases heat-trapping global warming gases into the atmosphere, which alters the climate of the planet and throws weather systems out of balance. Scientists warn that doing nothing to reduce global warming pollution will increase the frequency and severity of costly extreme weather events such as drought, floods, and hurricanes. Extreme weather events cost Americans nearly $20 billion in 2002, a cost that could increase if the U.S. does nothing to curb global warming.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">While the Gilchrest/Olver bill is a good first step in reducing U.S. Global warming emissions, we are concerned that the bill allows too much industry flexibility in meeting the modest goals. This will allow individual companies to comply with the law without actually reducing their own emissions. For example, by investing in conservation practices such as reforestation, companies gain more carbon emitting credits without reducing overall emissions. U.S. PIRG supports conservation practices, but we need real reductions in global warming emissions to solve global warming and protect forests and other ecosystems.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">It's time to establish national emissions goals for reducing global warming pollution and holding industry accountable. The Climate Stewardship Act is a good step in the right direction. It's time for the Bush administration and the rest of Congress to join the rest of the world and take real action on global warming. We urge other members of Congress to co-sponsor this bill and work with U.S. PIRG to promote other steps to reduce global warming. </FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
