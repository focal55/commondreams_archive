<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">HUNTINGTON, W.VA. -- A national report released today documents the health and environmental hazards posed by PVC during manufacturing, product use and disposal. In West Virginia, the Ohio Valley Environmental Coalition released the report:  PVC, Bad News Come in Threes: The Poison Plastic, Health Hazards, and the Looming Waste Crisis. </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report concludes that Americans throw away billions of pounds of PVC. However, there really is no 'away' since PVC waste poses perpetual hazards.  Polyvinyl chloride, or PVC, is widely used in plastic pipes, building materials (such as vinyl siding), consumer products (such as toys or tablecloths) and disposable packaging.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;If PVC is incinerated or illegally burned in backyard trash barrels, that creates cancer-causing dioxin,&#148; said Vivian Stockman, Ohio Valley Environmental Coalition (OVEC) project coordinator. &#147;If it is buried in landfills, it contaminates groundwater. If you try to recycle it, it contaminates the entire recycling process. Even when you are done with it, it&#146;s not done with you.&#148; </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report estimates that about 10,000 tons of PVC waste is land-filled in West Virginia.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Thanks to state laws the environmental community helped pass in the 1990s, we aren&#146;t on the list of states that land-fill the most PVC,&#148; Stockman said. &#147;But we are still at risk. PVC is everywhere. It&#146;s a poison plastic. Luckily, there are safer alternatives.&#148;</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report estimates that 70 billion pounds of PVC plastic are slated for disposal in the next decade. And, the problem is going to get worse. Disposal rates will sharply increase as an estimated 125 billion pounds of PVC, installed in construction over the last two decades, reaches the end of its useful life.  </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A growing number of corporations are phasing out PVC, such as Nike and Firestone. To prevent harm from PVC, OVEC joined with the Center for Health, Environment &amp; Justice to kick off a campaign to convince Johnson &amp; Johnson and Microsoft to phase out PVC use.  These corporate targets are large users of PVC packaging such as Microsoft&#146;s blister packs on computer software products and Johnson and Johnson&#146;s Kids Detangling Shampoo bottles. </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Some major medical device manufacturers are switching from using PVC to avoid direct patient exposure to phthalates, as well as the public and environmental health impacts of PVC throughout its life cycle,&#148; said Ted Schettler MD, MPH of the Science and Environmental Health Network.  &#147;Companies realize that protecting the public health and the environment is the right thing to do and makes good business sense.&#148;</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PVC is estimated to contribute from 38 to 67% of the total chlorine found in solid waste, from 90 to 98% of phthalates, from 1 to 28% of the lead, and 10% of the cadmium (Pg. 14 Report).  Cadmium, lead, organotins and phthalates are commonly released from PVC waste in landfills (Pg. 37 Report).</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Burning PVC plastic, which contains 57% chlorine when pure, forms dioxins, a highly toxic group of chemicals.  PVC is the major contributor of chlorine to four combustion sources&#151;municipal solid waste incinerators, backyard burn barrels, medical waste incinerators and secondary copper smelters&#151;that account for a significant portion of dioxin air emissions; these four sources accounted for more than 80% of dioxin emissions to air based on a USEPA survey (Pg. 2 Report).</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Government tests found residents of Mossville, Louisiana&#151;the location of four vinyl production facilities&#151;had dioxin levels in their blood at three times the average rate and were breathing air contaminated with vinyl chloride, a potent carcinogen, more than 120 times higher than the ambient air standard (Pg. 19 Report). </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">OVEC joined in releasing the report with dozens of groups nationwide. The report was authored by the Center for Environment, Health and Justice&#146;s BE SAFE precautionary campaign and the Environmental Health Strategy Center. </font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
