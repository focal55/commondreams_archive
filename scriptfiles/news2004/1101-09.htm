<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- November 1 -- As November 2 approaches, many Americans are concerned about getting to the polls and making sure their votes are counted.  This is vital to ensuring that all Americans exercise their right to participate in the democratic process.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But there is much more at stake that just a particular political party winning the election.  Voters will eventually make peace with whomever is chosen president.  The real issue lies in that individual's ability to unite America against an ever-growing threat-poverty. Poverty will loom long after the lawyers haggle over vote tallies in the battleground states.  It will loom after the losing campaign staff packs up the satellite offices, tosses out the bumper stickers and pins, and deletes all the spin-related emails from their Blackberries.  Whomever is chosen president must move quickly to present his plan for creating jobs, and making health care and housing more affordable, as these were among the top concerns of voters. The most effective way for the next president to show his commitment to ending poverty is to agree to convene a White House Conference on American Poverty.  The Community Action Partnership, the nation's largest anti-poverty organization, called for such a conference at its recent &quot;No Room for Poverty&quot; National Rally in Washington, DC.  The Partnership and its 1,000-member network of Community Action Agencies are also collecting signatures in support of this effort-the goal is one million signatures-to underscore that a significant number of Americans are concerned about poverty and want the White House to address it. Convening a White House Conference on American Poverty will demonstrate that our next leader is courageous enough to take a bold step to unite the nation after a polarized election process and make the American Dream a reality once again.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Based in Washington, DC, the Community Action Partnership is the national association representing the interests of the 1,000 Community Action Agencies (CAAs) organized to change people's lives, embody the spirit of hope, improve communities, and make America a better place to live.  CAAs care about the entire community and are dedicated to helping people help themselves and each other.
