<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - September 20 - Exploiting loose regulations and lax oversight, "New Stealth PACs" have poured millions of dollars into elections without revealing the identities of their donors or how they spend their income to influence elections, according to a new report by Public Citizen. 

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Public Citizen estimates that at least $91 million - and almost certainly many millions more - was spent by 26 non-profit groups registered under Section 501(c) of the tax code to influence at least 117 contests in 2000 and 2002. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, these groups reported only $12.2 million in electoral expenditures to the IRS. In 2004, at least 13
501(c) groups have been active.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

The report was compiled from information in a new Public Citizen Web site and database, The New Stealth PACs: Tracking 501(c) Non-Profit Groups Active in Elections, available at <a href="http://www.steathpacs.org">www.stealthpacs.org</a>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The project is designed to monitor the activities of tax-exempt 501(c)(4) social welfare, 501(c)(5) labor and 501(c)(6) business groups seeking to influence the outcomes of elections while avoiding public scrutiny. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report analyzes the activities of 30 groups that have tried to influence elections since 2000. 

Public Citizen believes that four seniors' groups may have been heavily financed by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America
(PhRMA) and may have engaged in enough activities intended to influence elections in 2002 to raise the question of whether they violated the prohibition against allowing political work to be their primary activity.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In letters to IRS Commissioner Mark Everson, Public Citizen today asked the agency to examine "its procedures for monitoring and enforcing the tax code when it comes to regulating electioneering activities of
501(c)(4)-(6) non-profit groups" because there "appears to be a considerable amount of confusion.as to what constitutes a political expenditure versus a lobbying expenditure."</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Public Citizen also asked the IRS to "consider initiating a formal investigation into the financial transactions and electioneering activities" of the four seniors' groups that appear to have been funded by PhRMA.

501(c) non-profit groups are permitted to make substantial political expenditures, which the IRS defines as expenditures intended to influence the outcomes of elections, but they are prohibited from making electoral activities their primary purpose.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> However, unlike traditional political action committees and Section 527 groups - which must abide by strict disclosure requirements - the 501(c) groups are able to operate with much secrecy while accepting unlimited contributions from corporations, unions and wealthy individuals.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Whether it's the Swift Boat Veterans or <a href="http://www.moveon.org">MoveOn.org</a>, 527 groups have been generating a lot of controversy and media attention of late," said Frank Clemente, director of Public Citizen's Congress Watch division. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Meanwhile, 501(c) groups are operating unregulated and under the radar, and are spending millions of dollars to influence elections. These new stealth PACs should not be allowed to operate with such impunity."

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Using an assortment of government documents and media reports, Public Citizen built a first-of-its-kind public database to track politically active 501(c) groups. The database contains more than 400 political advertisements and other election-related communications put out by the new stealth PACs, records of the groups' expenditures and previously unpublished data disclosing the amounts of large contributions to the groups and the percentage of revenue they received from major donors.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The report and database identify key personnel and funders of the stealth PACs, as well as their political affiliations and connections to other partisan organizations. The New Stealth PACs project found that:</font></p>
<ul>
<li>
<div align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

	The Republican-leaning 501(c) groups studied outspent Democratic
groups by 61 percent to 39 percent during 2000 and 2002 and by more than a 3-to-1 ratio in 2002. Moreover, the stealth PACs are highly partisan. Of 27 groups that were active in elections from 2000 to 2003, 22 favored candidates from only one party. Outside of the primaries, no group favored a single party less than 80 percent of the time. </font></div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">	Purportedly "grassroots" groups are often funded by just a few
big donors. Obtaining previously unpublished data showing the amounts of contributions to the 501(c) groups (but generally not donors' names), Public Citizen learned of four groups that received more than 98 percent of their contributions in a given year from donors who gave more than $5,000 each.
</font></div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some stealth PACs appear to be violating their tax status.
Although the lack of full disclosure prevents a definitive analysis, Public Citizen's research raises substantial questions as to whether one third of the 30 groups studied exist primarily to influence elections. Such politically active groups should be ineligible for 501(c) protections from having to disclose the names of their contributors and how they spend their money.</font></div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

	PhRMA and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce may have violated IRS
reporting requirements by failing to report grants given to stealth PACs in 2002.</font></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Most stealth PACs fail to report any electioneering expenditures
whatsoever to the IRS, despite documentation of sizable election spending. Of the 26 groups that apparently conducted election activities in 2000 and 2002, only seven reported any such expenditures to the IRS.

</font></div>
</li>
</ul>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This study only begins to tell the story of these groups' activities," said Taylor Lincoln, a senior researcher at Public Citizen's Congress Watch division and primary author of the new report. "Congress and the IRS need to institute much-needed reforms that shine light into this haven for campaign finance abuses."

 

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A Case Study of How Stealth PACs Operate:

PhRMA Appears to Have Funneled Up to $41 Million
 To "Stealth PACs" to Help Elect a Drug Industry-Friendly Congress

With its eyes on passage of an industry-friendly Medicare prescription drug bill, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America
(PhRMA) appears to have quietly channeled as much as $41 million to four stealth PACs in 2002 to help elect a Congress sympathetic to the pharmaceutical industry's interests, according to Public Citizen.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Reports to the IRS and other available information strongly suggest that PhRMA gave "unrestricted educational grants" of $21 million to the United Seniors Association and $10 million to 60 Plus Association to fund advertisements and direct mail supporting drug industry-favored candidates that year. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Two other groups, the Seniors Coalition and America 21, appear to have received $6 million and $3.7 million, respectively, to promote PhRMA-favored candidates. The groups collectively broadcast ads and sent direct mail in 39 U.S. Senate and House contests that year, supporting candidates friendly to PhRMA's agenda and criticizing those who weren't, Public Citizen has concluded.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At least one of the groups, United Seniors Association, is again active in the 2004 elections, recently sponsoring TV ads in 17 or more House races that praise incumbents who supported the PhRMA-backed Medicare drug law passed by Congress in 2003.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The story of the four groups and their connections to PhRMA are chronicled in a second report also released today by Public Citizen: Big PhRMA's Stealth PACs: How the Drug Industry Uses 501(c) Non-profit Groups to Influence Elections. The report is available at <a href="http://www.tealthpacs.org">www.stealthpacs.org.</a></font></p>
<p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The Medicare drug bill is a gold mine for the pharmaceutical companies because it expands their base of paying customers for brand-name drugs and protects them from lower-cost foreign imports and government attempts to negotiate price discounts," Clemente said. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"PhRMA's apparent bankrolling of these stealth PACs left voters with no way of knowing whether the campaign messages aimed at them were bought with the drug industry's money or whether PhRMA helped elect a Congress that will do its bidding and enact industry-friendly bills like the Medicare drug law."

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Each of the four PhRMA stealth PACs has declared zero political expenditures to the IRS, claims that do not seem plausible given the content of the groups' television commercials and direct mailings, the timing of their messages, and the groups' decisions to direct the messages disproportionately to voters who lived in particularly competitive state and congressional districts.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Additionally, PhRMA failed to disclose grants to USA and 60 Plus, although it has acknowledged giving a grant to USA and published reports indicate it gave one to 60 Plus in 2002. And if PhRMA was the source of the other large contributions to the Seniors Coalition and America 21 identified in the Public Citizen report, it again failed to disclose these grants, as required by law.</font></p>
