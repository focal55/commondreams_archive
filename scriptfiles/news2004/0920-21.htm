<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">SNOWMASS, Colorado - September 20 - Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI)
today released <i>Winning the Oil Endgame: Innovation for Profits, Jobs, and
Security</i>, a Pentagon-cofunded blueprint for making the United States oil-free.
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The plan outlines how American industry can restore competitiveness and boost
profits by mobilizing modern technologies and smart business strategies to
displace oil more cheaply than buying it.
    Winning the Oil Endgame proves that at an average cost of $12 per barrel
(in 2000 dollars), the United States can save half its oil usage through
efficiency, then substitute competitive biofuels and saved natural gas for the
rest -- all this without taxation or new federal regulation.
    </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Unlike previous proposals to force oil savings through government policy,
our proposed transition beyond oil is led by business for profit," said RMI
CEO Amory Lovins.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Our recommendations are market-based, innovation-driven
without mandates, and designed to support, not distort, business logic.
They're self-financing and would cause the federal deficit to go down, not
up."</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
    Winning the Oil Endgame shows that by 2015, the United States can save
more oil than it gets from the Persian Gulf; by 2025, use less oil than in
1970; by 2040, import no oil; and by 2050, use no oil at all.</font></p>
<p>
    <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Because saving and substituting oil costs less than buying it, our study
finds a net savings of $70 billion a year," Lovins said. "That acts like a
giant tax cut for the nation. It simply makes sense and makes money for all."</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
    The RMI study focuses on cars and light trucks (SUVs, pickups, and vans).
These vehicles account for nearly half of projected 2025 oil use. The report
demonstrates that ultralight, ultrasound materials like carbon-fiber can halve
vehicles' weight, increase safety, and boost efficiency to about 85 mpg for a
midsize car or 66 mpg for a midsize SUV.
    </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"BMW has confirmed that carbon-fiber autobodies weigh only half as much as
steel and have exceptional crash performance," said Lovins. "The resulting
fuel savings can be like buying gasoline for 56 cents a gallon."
    </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Winning the Oil Endgame also predicts that to fight better and save money,
the Pentagon -- the world's largest oil buyer-will accelerate the market
emergence of superefficient land, sea, and air platforms. A more efficient and
effective military can protect American citizens instead of foreign oil, while
moving to eliminate oil as a source of conflict.</font></p>
<p>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"A fuel-efficient military could save tens of billions of dollars a year," said Lovins, who served on a Pentagon task force studying this issue.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"As our
nation stops needing oil, think of the possibilities of being able to treat
oil-rich countries the same as nations that don't own a drop. Imagine too our
moral clarity if other countries no longer assume everything the United States
does is about oil."
    </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The RMI report says that by 2015, more efficient vehicles, buildings, and
factories will turn oil companies into broad-based energy companies that
embrace biofuels as a new product line.  Winning the Oil Game demonstrates how
cellulosic biofuels (wood-based rather than from starchy or sugary plants like
corn) can replace one-fifth of current oil use, more than triple farm income,
and create 750,000 agriculture jobs.
    </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Europe produces 17 times more biodiesel than we do," Lovins said. "The EU
has shifted farmers from subsidies to durable revenues, and now oil companies
compete to sell their petroleum-free fuel."
    </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Winning the Oil Endgame demonstrates half of U.S. natural gas can be saved
at less than a fifth of its current price. Two-thirds of that figure comes
from saving electricity, especially at peak times when it's inefficiently
produced from natural gas. This step alone could return natural gas to
abundance within a few years, cutting gas and power bills by $55 billion per
year.
    Recommended policy innovations include:</font></p>
<ul>
<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

     Revenue-neutral feebates -- rebates for buyers of efficient cars, paid
       for by fees on inefficient ones</font></li>
<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Low-income access to affordable mobility -- a new nationwide initiative
       to buy efficient cars in bulk and lease or sell them to low-income
       drivers at terms they can afford</font></li>
<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> R&D investment incentives and temporary loan guarantees to help
       financially weakened U.S. automakers retrain and retool faster</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Temporary federal loans guarantees to U.S. airlines for buying very
       efficient new airplanes, provided that for every plane thus financed,
       an inefficient one is scrapped.


    </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"For the first time, our report adds up the new ways to provide all the
services now obtained from oil, but without using oil -- which will save us
$70 billion a year," concluded Lovins. "Forging the tools to get our nation
off oil forever is the key to revitalizing industry and farming."

    This peer-reviewed RMI study is based on its five coauthors' 70 years of
combined energy experience, mainly in the private sector, and on extensive
industry input. The Pentagon and diverse foundations and private donors funded
the research. RMI's thoroughly documented 329-page report is introduced in
forewords by former Secretary of State, Treasury, and Labor George P. Shultz
(an ex-Marine who also chaired the Bechtel Corporation) and by oil geologist
and former Shell Chairman Sir Mark Moody-Stuart. The report, its executive
