<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - October 7 - The following was released today by <a href="http://www.punkvoter.com" target="_new">Punkvoter.com</a>:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Punkvoter.com to Congress: Tell the truth about reinstating the draft and who is really fighting the war in Iraq.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">No matter how unpopular, tell the American people who is really going to fight the war. Young people will not let the issue of the draft or the facts that young people are dying everyday for a war they did not choose to fight. Don't let Congress fool you into thinking millions of kids are signing up to support this war.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Congress brought up reinstating the draft legislation this week with only a few short days of session left to play politics and try and silence our voice about who is really fighting their war and why,&quot; stated Pat Thetic of the band Anti-Flag who met with Representatives Jim McDermott, Jan Schakowsky, Shelley Berkley, Nita Lowey, Hilda Solis and Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi yesterday. He continued, &quot;We brought our friend Michael Hoffman, co-founder of Iraq Veterans Against the War to Congress to speak out about the draft that is already taking place in America and to highlight the fact that America needs a real discussion about the draft not a political vote.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It was obvious why the right-wing leadership is trying to kill rumors of the draft. But we know the reality, there already is a draft going on in America and kids are already being forced into the military.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Write Congress and ask them to end The Poverty Draft, The Backdoor Draft, and The Education Draft! And than ask them where they are going to get the bodies to fight their war.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- The Poverty Draft: 45 million Americans are without healthcare...and being drafted to fight their wars is not the answer.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- The Backdoor Draft: Thousands of our nation's reserves our being forced to serve longer than they ever signed up for and put their family in major hardships...and being drafted to fight their wars is not the answer.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- The Education Draft: Education costs have risen 29 percent in the last three years, No Child Left Behind has not been fully funded and Pell Grant funding has forced kids to not be able to go to college.... being drafted to fight their wars is not the answer.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Punkvoter will not let this issue go away because a few members in Congress are trying to ignore the facts. It does not take a mathematician to realize which kids are dying for their war and will need to be replaced -- since we have no exit strategy and no other countries are getting involved. Punkvoter.com knows that draft legislation fear is as real as the hand-to-hand combat that exists today with no exit strategy or peace plan.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>CALL TO ACTION:</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Tell Congress to stop playing politics with your future. Call your member of Congress today and tell them if they are going to talk about the draft -- they need to tell young Americans the truth about who is already being drafted into fight their war and why. (Congressional Switchboard is 202-224-3121.)</font></p>
