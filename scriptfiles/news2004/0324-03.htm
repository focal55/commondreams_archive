<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - March 24 - Several member organizations of the SafeWind environmental coalition yesterday filed a &quot;friend of the court&quot; brief in the lawsuit against the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, challenging its issuance of a permit to the Cape Wind Associates to build a private data tower in Nantucket Sound. </FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Corps issued this permit in August 2002 under the authority of section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act. The tower, which is designed to collect meteorological information, is associated with the Cape Wind proposal to build a massive wind energy project covering 23 square miles of Nantucket Sound. The brief supports an appeal filed by the Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound of a decision issued by federal district court Judge Tauro last September, which upheld the Corps' permit. Massachusetts Attorney General Tom Riley filed a similar friend of the court brief on March 11, 2004.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Sharon Young, representing The Humane Society of the United States, stated: &quot;Our coalition of environmental groups has filed this brief in an effort to ensure that private developers cannot make use of the public resources of Nantucket Sound or any federal waters without first obtaining the necessary land use authorization. The Corps cannot ignore the fact that Cape Wind is now using the public lands and waters in Nantucket Sound for a private purpose without any permission to do so. And they are doing so with the expectation of expanding this use to an extent that may adversely affect birds and the local marine ecosystem.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Cindy Lowry, director of the Oceans Public Trust Initiative, a project of the Earth Island Institute, said, &quot;The United States government holds Nantucket Sound in the public trust for all citizens. We cannot allow a federal agency to issue permits that developers will use to take over such property for their own gain. If this action by the Corps of Engineers is allowed to stand, it will establish a very dangerous precedent that threatens our oceans and coast lines with other private development. This should be viewed as an action by the Corps that is allowing illegal privatization of public property.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In its brief, the SafeWind groups argue that the Corps lacks the power to grant permits to private developers to use land and water which is held in the public trust for private development on the Outer Continental Shelf, which covers the area of the ocean more than 3 miles from shore. They also argue that the Corps acted unlawfully by issuing this permit when it knew that Cape Wind had no property right to use and occupy this location. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">As a result, the brief argues, the Corps violated federal law and acted contrary to the public trust by issuing such a permit. The groups contend that construction of a massive wind farm at this site may adversely affect important wintering areas for migratory birds and feeding areas for </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Members of the SafeWind coalition that filed the brief are: The Humane Society of the United States, the International Fund for Animal Welfare, the International Wildlife Coalition, the Oceans Public Trust Initiative, Three Bays Preservation, and the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society. They are joined by Cetacean Society International. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">As a result of their concerns over the lack of an adequate regulatory structure, and the need to assure thorough environmental review of proposed offshore wind energy facilities, the SafeWind coalition (<A HREF="http://www.safewind.info/" TARGET="_new">SafeWind.Info</A>) was established as a vehicle for providing information to inform the process and to advocate for environmental protection. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Patrick Parenteau, a professor of environmental law of the Vermont Law School, filed the brief for SafeWind. Professor Parento previously served as Regional Counsel for EPA in Boston from 1984 to 1987. He also served as Commissioner of the Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation from 1987 to 1989.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Organizations Filing the &#147;Friend of the Court&#148; Brief</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Humane Society of the United States (HSUS): The HSUS is the nation&#146;s largest animal protection organization with over seven million members and constituents.

To this end, we seek in every peaceful way to minimize cetacean killings and captures, and to maximize activities that neither harm nor harass, such as regulated whale watching, nonlethal research, and widespread educational, aesthetic, and environmental programs relating to free-living whales, dolphins, and porpoises. Our ultimate aim is peaceful coexistence and mutual enrichment for humans and cetaceans.
