<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BUENOS AIRES, ARGENTINA -- December 18 -- Greenpeace today expressed disappointment at the outcome of the climate talks in Buenos Aires, and anger at the US and Saudi Arabia for their deliberate tactics of obstruction and delay. The agreement means that discussions on future greenhouse gas cuts will not progress substantially during the coming year and will not ensure that countries most at risk from climate impacts get the assistance they need from the industrialised world.</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We hope that everyone has taken note of the bullying and blocking tactics of the USA at these negotiations. As a result we have a deal that is that barely keeps the process moving&quot; said Greenpeace spokesperson, Steve Sawyer.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This agreement ensure that there will not be the kind of progress we need on negotiations of future emissions cuts during the next twelve months, and the adaptation package is far from adequate.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The complex agreement originally contained plans for a series of informal meetings to discuss the future of the climate regime. At the insistence of the US, this was reduced to one 'seminar'. US demands that the agenda should not contain any discussions of future cuts or be reported back at the next negotiations were finally amended to allow one informal seminar to go ahead.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Saudi Arabia worked alongside the US throughout the meeting and further blocked progress by imposing conditions on making financial assistance available for adaptation in developing countries. In return it demanded compensation for loss of oil revenues if the world moves away from fossil fuels.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;For Saudi Arabia to hold out a begging bowl whilst the least and poorest developed countries in the world struggle to cope with floods, droughts and extreme events, is obscene&quot; said Sawyer.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;And the danger of trying to negotiate with the US is clear. They are intent on wrecking the talks and are not capable of negotiating in good faith. Their position on the science is illegitimate, their refusal to accept responsibility for impacts on the developing world is immoral and their negotiating positions are absurd.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Only by moving ahead strongly without the US can we make real progress on climate change,&quot; he concluded.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Next year's negotiations will see the Kyoto countries meeting as a group for the first time. The USA will have observer status only at this and future Kyoto Protocol meetings unless and until it ratifies.<br>		</font></p><p></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Notes to Editor:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Complete reports visit :<br><a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/climatesummit/" target="_new">http://weblog.greenpeace.org/climatesummit/</a></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
