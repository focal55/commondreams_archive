<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - March 23 - Washington, D.C. - Ralph Nader may have been abandoned by some of his celebrity backers, railed against in Democratic Party circles and skewered on late night TV, but the consumer advocate still packs a powerful punch with young voters. According to the latest NEWSWEEK and Newsweek.com Genext poll, the feisty Nader, widely blamed for Al Gore&#146;s defeat in the 2000 election, drew twice the support among voters aged 18-29 as he did in a comparable poll of all registered voters. The groundswell of youth support could mean good news for Nader, and perhaps more significantly, for President George W. Bush. </FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">For the Newsweek/Ipsos Genext Poll, Ipsos-Public Affairs interviewed 354 registered voters aged 18 to 29, from March 1 to March 17, 2004. The margin of error is plus or minus 5.1 percentage points. References to poll data on registered voters of all ages are from an AP/Ipsos poll conducted March 1-3 on 771 registered voters. That margin of error is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Read the <A HREF="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4569835/" TARGET="_new">Newsweek.com</A> Web Exclusive Report by Jonathan Darman. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Download the Topline Results <A HREF="http://www.ipsos-na.com/news/pdf/media/mr040323-1tb.pdf" TARGET="_new">here</A>. </FONT></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
