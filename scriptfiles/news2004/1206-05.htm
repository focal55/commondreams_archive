<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NEW YORK -- December 6 --  The Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual &amp; Transgender Community Center, Harlem United Community AIDS Center and the New York Panthers Leather Club have teamed up to address crystal meth use in the African-American community by launching a community-awareness campaign comprising compelling posters featuring photos of African-American men, titled &quot;PNP? Party N' Play or Party N' Pay.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The large posters will be placed on telephone kiosks in Harlem, Chelsea and the West Village beginning Monday, December 6. The posters, which direct people to Harlem United and the Center for relevant services, will be on view through January.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Crystal meth has permeated many communities in New York City,&quot; says Dr. Perry Halkitis, director of New York University's Center for HIV/AIDS Education and Training. &quot;Our most recent research data indicates a dramatic and alarming increase in crystal meth use among gay men of color, which means we must not wait another minute to implement wide-reaching prevention education campaigns.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dr. Barbara Warren, who is responsible for research at the Center, says, &quot;A decade ago, we watched as cocaine use grew into a crack epidemic in communities of color. With this collaboration and campaign, we are trying to prevent crystal meth use from exploding into an epidemic among men of color.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Adds Patrick McGovern, executive director of Harlem United: &quot;This crystal campaign is an essential part of Harlem United's mission to promote the health and safety of all persons at risk for HIV/AIDS. There is a grave risk in assuming that crystal is a phenomenon that is limited to the gay white community. The campaign is designed to raise awareness and lay the foundation for effective interventions to address the risks associated with crystal use.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The groups are also co-sponsoring a free forum titled The Realities of Crystal Meth for Men of Color, on Wednesday, January 12, 6-8PM, at the National Black Theatre, 2031 5th Avenue (between 125th and 126th streets). The campaign is funded via a grant from the New York City Department of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Several interview opportunities are available.
