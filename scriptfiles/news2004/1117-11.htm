<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- November 17 -- In the frantic special session of Congress under way, House Republicans are rewriting House ethics rules to protect Rep. Tom DeLay (R-Texas) from himself. Specifically, a handful of lawmakers are attempting to rescind the rule that would force DeLay to temporarily resign his leadership post if he is indicted for criminal activity in Texas until the case is resolved. Public Citizen strongly condemns any effort by House Republicans to insulate DeLay from the consequences of his ethical lapses.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The House ethics rule dates back to 1993, when House Republicans wanted then-House Ways and Means Chairperson Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) to be held accountable for his own ethics violations. In the early 1990s, DeLay helped lead the floor fight for tougher ethics requirements, resulting in the rule that members of the House cannot serve as leaders while under indictment for violating state or federal laws. DeLay complained that the House had become poorly managed because of disregard for the rules.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today&#146;s rule change, proposed by Rep. Henry Bonilla (R-Texas), would end the penalty only for House leaders indicted by a state grand jury, as in DeLay&#146;s potential situation.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is bad enough that the Republican caucus reaffirmed DeLay as House majority leader, given the three admonishments he has received recently from the House ethics committee. But it is an affront to all Americans that House Republicans would rewrite the ethics rules to allow DeLay to continue serving even while under indictment.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Public Citizen&#146;s new Web page called &#147;DeThrone DeLay &#150; Clean Up the House,&#148; at www.dethronedelay.org, serves as a clearinghouse for information related to the ethical challenges and undemocratic actions of DeLay. Posted on the page are histories of DeLay&#146;s ethical lapses and his autocratic leadership; House ethics committee admonishments of DeLay; Public Citizen complaints against DeLay sent to the ethics committee, the IRS and the Department of Justice; Texas grand jury indictments against his associates; media investigative reports on DeLay; and editorials and other related information.</font></p>
