<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NEW YORK - August 26 - Mothers Opposing Bush - MOB - premieres its provocative new television advertisement at a Meet the MOB Party, co-hosted by Fahrenheit 9/11 executive producer, Harvey Weinstein, and author/activist, Arianna Huffington, at the Tribeca Film Center, 5 p.m., Wednesday, September 1st.  The MOB is an all-volunteer, bi-partisan, political action committee with a membership of 10,000 mothers (and others) representing nearly all 50 states.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Our TV ad epitomizes truth in advertising, underlining how this president's policies are not good for children, and not good for anybody,&quot; says Iris Krasnow, founder of the MOB.  She adds that the mission of the MOB is to amplify the voices of mothers who feel the urgency of getting this &quot;dangerous administration&quot; out of office.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">    Mothers Opposing Bush began in December 2003 in Krasnow's Maryland living room, and has since built a base of 10,000 members.  MOB has leveraged its web site, <a href="http://www.MOB.org" target="_new">http://www.MOB.org</a>, and grassroots efforts to build 155 Sister City chapters across America.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Not since 'Housewives for Humphrey' have mothers been as galvanized and well-organized as Mothers Opposing Bush,&quot; said Harvey Weinstein.  &quot;Trust me, my brother and I know that Mom knows best.&quot;  The Weinstein brothers, Harvey and Bob, named their successful film and publishing corporation &quot;Miramax&quot; after their mother Mira and father Max.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">    Because of its non-partisan outreach and centrist spirit, the MOB has attracted Democrats, Republicans and independents, of all ages and backgrounds.  Among the MOB's current activities are voter mobilization drives, with emphasis on Swing States.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Mothers Opposing Bush is grassroots activism at its best - and it's most inspiring,&quot; said Arianna Huffington.  &quot;It's regular women, many of them getting involved in the political process for the first time, taking a long, hard look at the failings of the current administration, and the effect these failings are having on America's children.  These women are saying, 'Enough!'&quot;     The Meet the MOB event will be held at the Tribeca Film Center, 375 Greenwich Street, in New York City.  To RSVP, contact Kristin Fleckenstein at (410) 279-7893, or call Iris Krasnow at 410-533-0859.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
