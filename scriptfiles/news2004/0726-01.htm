<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - July 24 - With the strength of women in 60 countries on every continent, a Global Women&#146;s Strike (GWS)* grassroots multiracial anti-war, anti-occupation delegation of mothers, grandmothers, welfare recipients, women with disabilities, lesbian/gay people, and other activists, women and men, is converging first in Boston July 22-29 for the Democratic National Convention protests, then in NYC for the August RNC protests, culminating in Washington DC for the October 17 Million Worker March protest.  </FONT></p><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Our network of sisters and brothers in the Global South were not able to come to Boston, but have sent their message loud and clear that we bring to the movement for change converging in Boston:  &#147;Invest in Caring Not Killing&#148;.  We are letting the politicians know that at this critical time when the anti-war movement is the largest in history, business cannot continue as usual.  We the grassroots, North and South, want a total change of priorities, where the caring of people and the environment is the priority, not war, occupation, profit and military budgets. </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The GWS delegation, in addition to speaking at the Boston Social Forum and at protests during the DNC, will also be gathering support for valuing the work of caregiving in the home, on the land and in the community, and opposition to welfare &#147;reform&#148;, as well as to the US coup and occupation of Haiti, and US-backed attempts to destabilize the government of President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela and continuing efforts to punish the island nation of Cuba for standing up to the US.  </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">It is women and children who pay the highest price for US foreign and economic policy which results in death and destruction.  We therefore have the biggest stake in the US elections.  At this crucial moment when many sections of the movement for social change are together challenging US priorities which put war and profit ahead of the needs of the people, grassroots women, often silenced, are insisting on being heard.  Women from the Global South in particular have no vote against these killing &#147;Made in the USA&#148; priorities from which they suffer most.  </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">GWS demands include that the $1 trillion worldwide military budget instead go to payment for caring work, pay equity globally, abolition of Third World debt and an end to poverty and all other violence. </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Leading the delegation is Margaret Prescod, co-coordinator of the Global Women&#146;s Strike in the US and part of Women of Color in the GWS.  She is a Convocation speaker at the Boston Social Forum, the &#147;people&#146;s convention&#148; and is featured at rallies and other events before and during the official convention.  </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">An immigrant from Barbados and a community activist on women&#146;s rights for nearly three decades, Ms Prescod is well known for her activism on a wide range of issues including opposition to the war on Iraq, organizing Caribbean women&#146;s opposition to the coup in Haiti and in support of grassroots women in the Venezuelan revolution, and as one of the lead organizers and a spokesperson for the mass &#147;D2K&#148; protests at the Democratic Convention in 2000.  She is a recent host and producer of &#147;Sojourner Truth&#148;, a ground-breaking public affairs a.m. drivetime show on KPFK Radio in Los Angeles (Pacifica Network, Tues 7am).  </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Phoebe Jones, co-coordinator of the GWS in the US, will also be heading the delegation.  Based in Philadelphia, she has been involved in the women&#146;s, anti-war and justice movements for over 30 years.  Ms. Jones has twice been invited to Venezuela as a representative of the GWS, and is an author of &#147;The Milk of Human Kindness: Defending Breastfeeding from the Global Market and AIDS Industry&#148;.  She has worked with former US Air Force Captain and Commander and rape survivor Rev. Dorothy Mackey, founder of STAAAMP (Survivors Take Action Against Abuse by Military Personnel) who is also part of the delegation, to launch the joint initiative, &#147;STAAAMP Out Rape by the Military&#148; opposing the rapes by the military of Iraqi women detainees, US servicewomen and men, and people in US prisons.   </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Payday, a multiracial international network of men who work with the GWS, is an integral part of this delegation.  Payday&#146;s website www.refusingtokill.net supports refuseniks around the world, and is helping to build a growing global network of women and men &#150; from Israel to the US to Greece to other countries &#150; who refuse killing work.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><B><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> Schedule for the Global Women&#146;s Strike delegation at the DNC</FONT></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">* Veterans Address the Nation: Fri July 23, 7pm, Rev Dorothy Mackey, speaker, Faneuil Hall</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">* Boston Social Forum (U MASS, Boston) </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">- Sat July 24, Margaret Prescod, Convocation speaker at 10am and panelist 3:30-7pm, Globalizing the Struggle in an Age of Empire</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">- Sun July 25, 11am GWS workshop: For Women, Against Military Budgets &#150; Invest in Caring  Not Killing, Women&#146;s Peace and Justice Tent, NE Side of Wheatley Bldg.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">- GWS Table throughout for literature, t-shirts, videos on Venezuela &amp; other, and to get in touch</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">* Other events where Margaret Prescod will be speaking:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Sun July 25, 11am, ANSWER march on the DNC Boston Common</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Mon July 26, 12noon, Rep.
