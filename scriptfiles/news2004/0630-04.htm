<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - June 30 - NARAL Pro-Choice America, the leading national advocate for personal privacy and a woman&#146;s right to choose, submitted a request under the Freedom of Information Act for a full accounting of the activities of Bush advisor Timothy Goeglein, who was described in Monday&#146;s New York Times as &quot;the official White House liaison to conservatives and to Christian groups,&quot; and Karl Rove&#146;s &quot;legman on the right.&quot; </FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">NARAL Pro-Choice America further announced that its earlier requests for information on a number of officials at the White House have not been answered, in clear violation of federal law.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Elizabeth Cavendish, Interim President of NARAL Pro-Choice America, said: &quot;We&#146;ve always known that responding to the far right&#146;s concerns was priority one in George Bush&#146;s White House, so it only makes sense that it would require at least one full time staffer. But if the President is going to use a public employee to foment activism against women&#146;s rights, we should at least have the right to know what he is up to. It&#146;s time for the White House to stop stonewalling, respect the law, and let us see just how deeply involved anti-choice groups are in making national policy.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">NARAL Pro-Choice America originally submitted requests for information to the White House in January 2004 wishing to review the schedules of senior officials to determine how closely involved anti-choice groups have been in major administration decisions. Despite the legal requirement to respond to such requests within twenty business days, the organization has yet to receive even a cursory reply. Today, the organization sent follow-up letters to the respective agencies, noting that they are in violation of federal law.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">According to a variety of public accounts, Goeglein has used his White House post to further a career of aggressive and vocal advocacy for eliminating the right to choose. Last year, speaking to a &quot;Celebration of Life&quot; event hosted by Lutherans for Life, he described abortion rights as &quot;a cancer within our country.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Earlier in his career, as communications director for the 2000 presidential campaign of Gary Bauer, Goeglein talked of the importance of having, &quot;a specific plan, a specific pro-life plan, to end abortion on demand. It's very important to say; it goes to a central tenet of the Republican Party.&quot;</FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
