However, in winning these battles through use of uranium  munitions we have contaminated air, water, and soil. Consequently, children,  women, and men have inhaled, ingested, or got wounds contaminated with uranium.   Uranium is a heavy metal and radioactive poison. The toxicity is not  debatable as the Director of the U.S. Army Environmental Policy Institute stated in a  congressionally mandated report that &quot;No available technology can  significantly change the inherent chemical and radiological toxicity of DU. These are intrinsic properties of uranium &quot; (Health and Environmental Consequences of  Depleted Uranium Use in the U.S. Army: Technical Report, AEPI, June 1995). The  primary U.S. Army training manual: STP 21-1-SMCT: Soldiers Manual of Common Tasks  states &quot;NOTE: (Depleted uranium) Contamination will make food and water unsafe  for consumption.&quot; [Task number: 031-503-1017 &quot;RESPOND TO DEPLETED URANIUM/LOW LEVEL RADIOACTIVE MATERIALS (DULLRAM) HAZARDS&quot;]. Although, existing U.S.  Department of Defense (DOD) directives require that prompt and effective medical  care be provided to all exposed individuals (Medical Management of Unusual  Depleted Uranium Casualties, DOD, 10/14/93) and the thorough clean up of dispersed  radioactive contamination (AR 700-48: &quot;Management of Equipment Contaminated  With Depleted Uranium or Radioactive Commodities&quot;); United States, British, and  Australian officials refuse to comply with these directives.      </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">RECENT EVENTS. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The United States, England, and Australia have recently used extensive  amounts of weapons made from uranium, commonly called depleted uranium in Iraq,  Afghanistan, and the Balkans. Medical evidence and especially the birth defects in  children born to parents in areas with DU contamination is an issue of  significant concern.  Depleted uranium (uranium 238) along with other contaminates  of war have been implicated and medical evidence supports the fact that uranium  contamination exposure results in adverse health effects.  </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Today; after the willful use of uranium munitions during Gulf War 1, during  Balkans combat, in Afghanistan, and now during Gulf War 2; warriors and  non-combatants are exhibiting serious adverse health effects from exposure to  depleted uranium munitions contamination, conventional weapons residue, and released  toxic industrial chemicals. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">However, even though medical evidence exists to prove adverse health effects  United States, British, Australian, Canadian, and NATO officials continue to  state specifically that there are no known adverse health effects in  individuals who were exposed to uranium and other contamination. That is a willful lie  as verified by actual medical records of thousands of individuals affected by  war created contamination. However, despite their formal stance the British  Ministry of Defence recently have acknowledged that British serviceman who serve  in Iraq may be exposed to depleted uranium contamination and can obtain medical testing upon re-deployment (http://www.traprockpeace.org/du_mod_warning_cards.html).     </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WHAT IS DU? </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Depleted uranium (DU) which is 99.8% by mass U-238 is made from uranium  hexaflouride, the byproduct of the uranium enrichment process. Recent documents  released by the U.S. Department of Energy and the 1995 U..S. Army Environmental Policy Institute reports state that a small proportion of other toxic heavy  metals and radioactive isotopes such as plutonium, neptunium, americium, and  U-236 also are present.  Although the 60 % of the ionizing radiation given off by  gamma emissions from U-235 and U-234 was eliminated during the enrichment  process, alpha particles at 4.2 Mev and 4.15 Mev that cause significant internal  ionization with consequent cellular damage were proportionally increased and  gamma and beta emissions from contaminants and daughter products still are  present.  The continuing incomplete statement that DU is 60% less radioactive than  natural uranium simply ignores the serious internal damage caused by alpha  particles that impact any cell!  Alpha particle emission measurements show that  the dose or exposure rate is in excess of 10000 counts per minute.  DU is a   serious internal hazard.  Consequent inhalation, ingestion, and wound  contamination pose significant and unacceptable health risks due to direct cell damage  from alpha and beta particle and gamma ray emissions.  Spent penetrators, DU  fragments, and contaminated shrapnel emit beta particles and gamma rays at 300  mrem / hour and thus can not be touched or picked up without protection.  </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">HOW IS DU USED BY THE MILITARY? </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">DU is used to manufacture kinetic energy penetrators- giant pencils or rods.   Each kinetic penetrator consists of almost entirely uranium 238.   The United  States munitions industry produces the following DU munitions with the  corresponding mass of uranium 238: 7.62 mm with unspecified mass 50 cal.  With unspecified mass  20 mm with a mass of approximately 180 grams. 25 mm with a mass of approximately 200 grams. 30 mm with a mass of approximately 280 grams.  105 mm with a mass of approximately 3500 grams. 120 mm with a mass of approximately 4500 grams. Sub-munitions / land mines such as the PDM and ADAM whose structural body  contain a small proportion of DU. Cruise missiles with unknown quantity of DU Bunker buster bombs with unknown quantity of DU </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">  Many other countries now produce or have acquired DU munitions.  DU is also  used as armor, counter weights, radiation shielding, and as proposed by the  U.S. Department of Energy as a component of road and structural materials.  All of these uses are designed to reduce the huge U.S. Department of Energy stockpiles left over from the uranium enrichment process. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">It is important to realize that DU penetrators aresolid uranium 238. THEY  ARE NOT TIPPED OR COATED!  During an impact at least 40 % of the penetrator  forms uranium oxides or fragments which are left on the terrain, within or on  impacted equipment, or within impacted structures. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The remainder of the penetrator retains its initial shape. Thus we are left  with a solid piece of uranium lying someplace which can be picked up by  children.  DU also ignites in the air during flight and upon impact.  The resulting  shower of burning DU and DU fragments causes secondary explosions, fires,  injury, and death.   </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">All individuals must ask if they would want tons solid uranium penetrators   lying in their backyard? Does anyone want any radioactive contamination of any  type lying in their backyard?  The answer is simple- NO ONE!  </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">OPERATION DESERT STORM DEPLETED URANIUM FRIENDLY FIRE AND COMBAT INCIDENTS INVESTIGATION FINDINGS </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">I was assigned to the 3rd U.S. Army  Depleted Uranium assessment team as the  health physicist and medic by order of  Headquarters Department of the Army in  Washington, D.C.  What we found can be explained in three words:  &quot;OH MY  GOD&quot;.  </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">According to official documents each uranium penetrator rod could loose up to  70% of it's mass on impact creating fixed and loose contamination with the  remaining rod passing through the equipment or structure to lie on the terrain.  On-site impact investigations showed that the mass loss is about 40% which  forms fixed and loose contamination leaving about 60% of the initial mass of the  penetrator in the solid pencil form. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">We found that standard radiacs will not detect his contamination.  Equipment  contamination included uranium fragments, uranium oxides, other hazardous  materials, unstable unexploded ordnance, and byproducts of exploded ordnance.   U.S. Army Materiel Command documents sent to us stated the uranium oxide was 57%  insoluble and 43 % soluble and at least 50% could be inhaled. In most cases  except for penetrator fragments, contamination was inside destroyed equipment or  structures, on the destroyed equipment, or within 25 meters of the equipment.  During the 1994 and 1995 Nevada tests we found DU contamination out to 400  meters from a single incident. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">After we returned to the United States we wrote the Theater Clean up plan  which reportedly was passed through U.S. Department of Defense to the U.S.  Department of State and consequently to the Emirate of Kuwaiti. Today, it is obvious  that none of this information regarding clean up of extensive DU  contamination ever was given to the Iraqi's. Consequently, although there still are  substantial radiation contamination hazards existing within Iraq these hazards have  been ignored by the United States and Great Britain for political and economic  reasons at the same time additional use of uranium weapons has occurred  resulting in additional confirmed contamination. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Iraqi, Kosovar, Serbian, and other representatives have asked numerous times  for DU contamination management and medical care procedures but this  information has not been provided.  Although residents of Vieques, who are U.S.  citizens, also have asked for medical care and completion of environmental remediation DOD officials still refuse to complete these essential actions.  </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">THE U.S. ARMY DEPLETED URANIUM PROJECT AND ITS OBJECTIVES?   </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The probable health and environmental hazards of uranium contamination were  known before the Gulf War.  A United States Defense Nuclear Agency memorandum  written by LTC Lyle that was sent to our team in Saudi Arabia stated that quote: </FONT></P><P> <FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;As Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD), ground combat units, and civil  populations of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Iraq come increasingly into contact with DU  ordnance, we must prepare to deal with potential problems.  Toxic war  souvenirs, political furor, and post conflict clean up (host nation agreement) are only some of the issues that must be addressed.  Alpha particles (uranium oxide  dust) from expended rounds is a health concern but, Beta particles from  fragments and intact rounds is a serious health threat, with possible exposure rates of 200 millirads per hour on contact.&quot; end quote. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">This memorandum, the reports that we prepared immediately after the Gulf War  as a part of the depleted uranium assessment project to recover DU destroyed  and contaminated U.S. equipment, the previous research, and other expressed  concerns led to the publication of a United States Department of Defense  directive signed by General Eric Shinseki on August 19, 1993 to quote: </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;1.  Provide adequate training for personnel who may come in contact with  depleted uranium equipment. 2.  Complete medical testing of personnel exposed to DU contamination during  the Persian Gulf War. 3. Develop a plan for DU contaminated equipment recovery during future  operations.&quot; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">It is thus indisputable that United States Department of Defense officials  were and are still aware of the unique and unacceptable health and environmental hazards associated with using depleted uranium munitions.      Consequently, I was recalled to active duty in 1994 as U.S. Army Depleted  Uranium Project Director and tasked with developing training and environmental management procedures.  The project included a literature review; extensive  curriculum development project involving representatives from all branches of the  U.S. Department of Defense and representatives from England, Canada, Germany,  and Australia. We also completed basic research at the Nevada Test Site  located 120 miles northwest of Las Vegas, Nevada, to validate management procedures. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">    The products of the DU project included: Three training curricula: </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">(1) Tier I: General Audience, </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">(2) Tier II: Battle Damage and Recovery Operations, </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">(3) Tier III: Chemical Officer / NCO; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">(4) Three video tapes: (1) &quot;Depleted Uranium Hazard Awareness&quot;, (2)  &quot;Contaminated and Damaged Equipment Management&quot;, and (3)  &quot;Operation of the AN/PDR 77  Radiac Set&quot;; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">(5) The draft Army Regulation: &quot;Management of Equipment Contaminated with  Depleted Uranium or Radioactive Commodities&quot; (currently AR 700-48, Department of the Army, Washington, D.C., 9/16/2002); </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">(6) an United States Army Pamphlet specifying &quot;Handling Procedures for  Equipment Contaminated with Depleted Uranium or Radioactive Commodities&quot; and </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">(7) a redesigned radiac capable of finding and quantifying DU contamination.  </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Although, these products were completed, approved, and ready for distribution  by January 1996, U.S. Army, U.S. Department of Defense, British, German,  Canadian, and Australian officials have disregarded repeated directives and have  not implemented or only have implemented portions of the training or management  procedures. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The training curriculum and management procedures have not been given to all  individuals and representatives of governments whose populations and  environment have been exposed to DU contamination as verified by U.S. General  Accounting Office investigators in a report published during March 2000 and through  personal conversations. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WHAT ADVERSE HEALTH EFFECTS HAVE BEEN OBSERVED, RECOGNIZED, TREATED, AND  DOCUMENTED? </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Deliberate denial and delay of medical screening and consequent medical care  of U.S. friendly fire casualties who inhaled, ingested, and had wound  contamination and all others with verified or suspected internalized uranium exposure  limits recognition and verification of health effects still continues as of  December 10, 2003. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Although we recommended immediate medical care during March 1991 and many  times since then United States Department of Defense, the British Ministry of  Defense, Canadian, Australian, United State Department, and U.S. Department of Veterans  Affairs officials are still refusing to provide thorough medical  screening and necessary medical care for all DU casualties as required by their own  written and published directives. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Dr. Bernard Rostker wrote to me in a letter dated March 1, 1999 that  physicians and health physicists at the completion of the ground war decided that  medical screening and care for uranium exposures was not required. Actual  documents refute this!Today, individuals are sick (including me) and others are dead  who were denied medical care even though I requested it in a letter dated May  21, 1997 which was sent to the Office of Surgeon U.S. Army Materiel Command  and forwarded to Dr. Rostker.   </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Verified adverse health effects from personal experience, physicians, and  from personal reports from individuals with known DU exposures include: (a)  Reactive airway disease, (b) neurological abnormalities, (c) kidney stones and  chronic kidney pain, (d) rashes, (e) vision degradation and night vision losses,  (f) gum tissue problems, (g) lymphoma,  (h) various forms of skin and organ  cancer, (I) neuro-psychological disorders, (j) uranium in semen, (k) sexual  dysfunction, and (l) birth defects in offspring. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Today, health effects have been documented in uranium processing facility  employees of and residents living near Puducah, Kentucky, Portsmouth, Ohio; Los  Alamos, New Mexico; Oak Ridge, Tennessee; and Hanford, Washington.  Employees  of and residents living near uranium manufacturing or processing facilities in  New York, Tennessee, Iowa, Massachusetts, and the four corners area of  southwest Colorado also have repeatedly reported health effects similar to those  reported by Gulf War DU casualties. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Iraqi and other humanitarian agency physicians are reporting the same health  effects in exposed populations.  Scottish scientists have verified that  residents of the Balkans were excreting uranium in their urine.  Dr. Assaf Durakovic  (a retired U.S. Army Colonel)  of the Uranium Medical Research Center has  also verified extremely high uranium excretion rates in Afghanistan refugees.  This demonstrates that depleted uranium (U-238) is mobile and contaminating, air,  water, and soil just as specified in the October 1943 letter to General  Leslie Groves. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Today, verifying correlation between uranium exposures and adverse health effects, except in only in a few cases, is difficult because of deliberate delays  in required screening, a radio-bioassay and medical care. Screening involves  the collection and analysis of urine, fecal, and throat samples within 24  hours of exposure as required in a October 1993 Department of Defense published  directive. Today, months or years after exposure, only a small fraction of the  sequestered uranium will be detected. This detectable fraction represents only  the mobile or soluble portion and a very smal fraction of what is or was in  the body. Terry Riordan's (a DU casualty) autopsy in Canada has revealed that  sequestering is occurring and that the mobile fraction may not be representative  of what is actually present. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Even when verified medical evidence attributing adverse health effects to DU  exposures is available official recognition and documentation is limited.  For example during 1994 and 1995 United States Department of Defense medical  personnel at an U.S. Army installation hospital removed, separated, and hid  documented diagnoses (including my own) from affected individuals and other  physicians. Some medical records were retrieved during the fall of 1997, but, probably  too late for many individuals. Today, this practice continues and  consequently exposed individuals are not receiving adequate and effective medical care.   This includes individuals whose required medical care has been requested and  ordered many times. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The denial of medical care will continue as long as the United States,  British, Canadian, NATO, and United Nations officials are permitted to ignore the  emerging evidence and deny medical care to all individuals who have been or may  have been exposed to depleted uranium (uranium 238), other isotopes, and other  contaminants created as result of depleted uranium munitions use.  The  criteria describing exposures requiring medical screening within 24 hours of  exposure and consequent medical care were specified in a message from Headquarters  Department of the Army dated October 14, 1993.  These exposures included: </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;a.  Being in the midst of smoke from DU fires resulting from the burning of vehicles uploaded with DU munitions or depots in which DU munitions are being  stored. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">b. Working within environments containing DU dust or residues from DU fires. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">c. Being within a structure or vehicle while it is struck by DU munitions.&quot;  </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">These guidelines must be applicable to all exposed individuals with care  independent of military or civilian status. They must be implemented now! </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Medical care must be planned and completed to identify and then alleviate  actual physiological problems rather than placing an emphasis on psychological  manifestations and continued testing. Children and others are sick and deserve  care for the complex exposures that have resulted in health problems.  Medical  care for known uranium exposures should emphasize (concern in parentheses): </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> a. neurology (heavy metal effects) </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> b. ophthalmology (radiation and heavy metal effects) </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> c. urology (heavy metal effects and crystal formation) </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> d. dermatology (heavy metal effects) </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> e. cardiology (radiation and heavy metal effects) </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> f. pulmonary (radiation, particulate, and heavy metal effects) </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> g. immunology (radiation and heavy metal effects) </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> h. oncology (radiation and heavy metal effects) </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> i. gynecology (radiation, neurological, and heavy metal effects) </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> j. gastro-intestinal (systemic effects) </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> k. dental (heavy metal effects) </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> l. psychology (heavy metal effects) </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">m. chromosomal damage (systemic effects) </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Many individuals with known exposures still have not received requested care.  As stated during March 10, 2003 by Dr. Michael KilPatrick, U.S. Department of Defense, only 90 individuals (including myself) are receiving minimal medical  care from physicians assigned to the Baltimore Maryland Department of Veterans Affairs Depleted Uranium program. That includes only a fraction of over 400  individuals with verified extremely high exposures as the Dr. Rostker's staff told members of the Presidential Special Oversight Board on September 28, 1998. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">It is impossible to get proper care and treatment. IF YOU DO NOT PROVIDE  MEDICAL ASSESSMENT FOR THOSE WITH VERIFIED EXPOSURES AND HEALTH PROBLEMS THEN YOU  CAN SAY DU DID NOT CAUSE ANY ADVERSE HEALTH PROBLEMS BECAUSE YOU NEVER SAW ANY  HEALTH EFFECTS.  SO MUCH FOR MEDICAL SCIENCE WHEN A COVER-UP IS DIRECTED BY  POLITICIANS TO LIMIT LIABILITY. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The cover-up actions to avoid liability started with the infamous Los Alamos  memorandum sent to our team in Saudi Arabia during March 1991.  This memo told  us to be sure that we should only report our findings so DU munitions could  always be used.  IN OTHER WORDS LIE! </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">A letter sent to General Leslie Groves during 1943 is even more disturbing.   In that memorandum dated October 30, 1943, senior scientists assigned to the  Manhattan Project suggested that radioactive materials; including uranium as  confirmed during personal discussions with former Manhatten Project scientists;  could be used to contaminate air, water, and terrain contaminant.  According  to the letter sent by the Subcommittee of the S-1 Executive Committee on the  &quot;Use of Radioactive Materials as a Military Weapon&quot; to General Groves (October  30, 1943) inhalation of radioactive materials- dirty bomb, would result in  &quot;bronchial irritation coming on in a few hours to a few days&quot;.  This is exactly what happened to those of us who inhaled DU dust during Operation Desert Storm  and in U.S. soldiers in the Balkans.  </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The subcommittee went on further to state that &quot;Beta emitting products could  get into the gastrointestinal tract from polluted water, or food, or air.   From the air, they would get on the mucus of the nose, throat, bronchi, etc. and  be swallowed.  The effects would be local irritation just as in the bronchi  and exposures of the same amount would be required. The stomach, caecum and  rectum, where contents remain for longer periods than elsewhere would be most  likely affected.  It is conceivable that ulcers and perforations of the gut  followed by death could be produced, even without an general effects from  radiation&quot;.   </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Today, although medical problems continue to develop; medical care is denied  or delayed for all uranium exposed casualties while United States Department  of Defense and British Ministry of Defense officials continue to deny any  correlation between uranium exposure and adverse health and environmental effects.   They contend that they can spread tons of solid radioactive waste (uranium  238) in anyone's backyard without cleaning it up and providing medical care.   Their arrogance is astonishing! </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Since 1991 numerous DOD and VA directives have required compliance with these  recommendations. However even though DOD, VA, and UN officials know what  should be done, visual evidence, photographic and video tape evidence, on site  radiological measurements, personal experience, and published reports verify that: </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">1.

All DU contamination must be physically removed and properly disposed of  to prevent future exposures. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">2. Specialized radiation detection devices that detect and measure alpha particles, beta articles, x-rays, and gamma rays emissions at appropriate levels  from 20 dpm up to 100,000 dpm and from .1 mrem/ hour to 75 mrem/ hour must be  acquired and distributed to all individuals or organizations responsible for  medical care and environmental remediation activities involving depleted uranium  / uranium 238 and other low level radioactive isotopes that may be present.   Standard equipment will not detect contamination. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">3. Medical care must be provided to all individuals who did or may have  inhaled, ingested, or had wound contamination to detect mobile and sequestered  internalized uranium contamination. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">4.

The efforts of senior U.S. Department of Defense, U.S. Army, U.S. Department of Energy, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, British,  Canadian, Australian, and United Nations officials to prevent acknowledgment of  these problems and accept responsibility must be stopped!   The overt  retaliation against any of us who are attempting to get these same officials to  comply with their own directives must stop.  We can not continue to ignore the  consequences of wartime contamination that include adverse health and  environmental effects. I IMPLORE YOU TO ACT! </FONT></P><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
