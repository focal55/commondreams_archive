<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BOSTON -- November 17 -- </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Building on 27 years of successful campaigns challenging irresponsible and dangerous actions of corporations like Nestl&eacute;, General Electric and Philip Morris/Altria, Infact is expanding its organizing and changing its name to Corporate Accountability International. As it launches new initiatives challenging the water, food and agribusiness, and oil industries, the organization will continue to build its campaign for the <a href="http://www.who.int/tobacco/framework/en/" target="_new">Framework Convention on Tobacco Control</a> (FCTC)&#151;the first global health and corporate accountability treaty. Corporate Accountability International&#146;s new website, launched this week, is <a href="http://www.stopcorporateabuse.org/" target="_new">www.stopcorporateabuse.org</a>.</font><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;For nearly three decades we&#146;ve been pressuring some of the most powerful and dangerous corporations in the world and winning changes that save lives and protect people. By changing our name, we will reach and mobilize millions more people to take action and pressure corporations to stop abusive practices,&#148; says Corporate Accountability International Executive Director Kathryn Mulvey.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In collaboration with allies around the world, this month Corporate Accountability International is launching new pressure on corporations that threaten our water resources, with a particular focus on Coca-Cola. The soft drink giant is draining water from some of the world&#146;s poorest communities. As a result of Coke&#146;s water extraction, at least five communities across India face severe water shortages and health problems. In Plachimada, in southern India, Coke&#146;s water extraction has dried up hundreds of hand-pumped wells, leaving people without enough water for basic needs. In Mehdiganj, in northeastern India, Coke has decreased the level of groundwater by 40 feet, leaving small farmers without enough water to irrigate their crops. </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;We cannot allow corporations to steal our water, and turn it into an unaffordable luxury in India&#151;or anywhere else. This month thousands of people are supporting a 150-mile march in India, from one Coke bottling facility to another, to demand an end to the corporation&#146;s abuses. The courage of our Indian allies is inspiring action around the world,&#148; says Corporate Accountability International Campaigns Director Patti Lynn.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The United Nations estimates that two-thirds of the world&#146;s population will not have enough water by 2025 if current trends are not reversed. According to a former Vice President of the World Bank, &#147;The wars of the 21st century will be fought over water.&#148; Coke&#146;s water depletion contributes to this problem, and is making water shortage a reality right now for some communities. </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With global brand recognition, Coke wields tremendous economic and political clout. In the US alone, Coke reportedly spent $1.7 million on federal lobbying in 2003, and Coke&#146;s PACs poured hundreds of thousands of dollars into the 2004 election. Coke is a prime example of a corporation that does not abide by Corporate Accountability International&#146;s Standards of Political Conduct for Corporations.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Through its expanded organizing, Corporate Accountability International will be exposing abuses by a range of corporations and trade associations in the water, food and agribusiness, and oil industries. Activists will challenge target corporations and trade associations engaging in practices that threaten people and the environment, and using their economic and political clout to get away with irresponsible and dangerous actions. </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Meanwhile, with growing global support, the FCTC has now been ratified by 36 countries. On November 8, Thailand became the latest to do so. The treaty, which will save millions of lives, will become international law once 40 countries have ratified.</font></p><p></p><p> </p><p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Corporate Accountability International, formerly Infact, is a membership organization that protects people by waging and winning campaigns challenging irresponsible and dangerous corporate actions around the world. Through bold campaigns and a commitment to win, Corporate Accountability International and its members have scored major victories that protect people and save lives. For over 25 years, we&#146;ve forced corporations&#151;like Nestl&eacute;, General Electric and Philip Morris/Altria&#151;to stop abusive actions.
