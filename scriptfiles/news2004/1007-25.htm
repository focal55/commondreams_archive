<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">QUEENS, New York - October 7 - Today, AARP continued its nation-wide voter outreach efforts by holding a forum for Hispanic voters in Queens. At the forum, a panel of AARP speakers explained the facts and answered questions on issues important to older voters, such as Social Security, affordable healthcare, and the rising cost of prescription drugs.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials found that many Hispanics don't vote because they feel they don't know the issues well enough - AARP is here today to make sure people not only have their questions answered but they are also educated voters," said Carlos Rodriguez, a member of AARP New York's Executive Council.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> "Social Security, the high cost of prescription drugs, and affordable health and long-term care, these issues affect all of us, regardless of age or ethnicity."

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The forum provided an in-depth look by AARP experts at election issues that greatly impact older voters such as: Social Security; high prescription drug costs; affordable health care; and long-term care options. Translators were on-site to ensure the message was understood and assist in answering questions. Additionally, AARP election and education materials were provided in both Spanish and English at the event.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

"Some things are simply too important to get lost in the rhetoric of Presidential campaigns," said Lois Aronstein, AARP New York State Director. "Getting the facts out on issues important to older voters really helps all voters make the decision that's right for them."

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today's forum, held at the Pan American Hotel in Elmhurst from 10 a.m. to noon, drew over 100 attendees. The AARP Hispanic Voter Forums are not designed to influence or steer voters towards candidates, rather, the goal is to educate and inform voters as to where the candidates stand on issues critical to older voters. AARP's 2004 Presidential Voter Guides are available online at<a href="http://www.aarp.org" target="_new"> http://www.aarp.org</a>.
