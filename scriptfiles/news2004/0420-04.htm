<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - April 20 - Representing more than 140,000 future physicians, Medical Students for Choice (MSFC), the American Medical Student Association (AMSA) and the American Medical Women's Association (AMWA) will be sending a coalition to join in support of reproductive freedom and justice for all women at the March for Women's Lives on April 25th. </FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The availability of high quality, comprehensive reproductive health care for women has been shown to have a dramatically positive impact on the health of all people, particularly in reducing rates of maternal and infant mortality, unintended pregnancies and abortions. It is important, as future physicians who are knowledgeable and supportive of comprehensive reproductive health services, to stand together and demand that all women have access to family planning services, including contraception and abortion services, without government intervention. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Although abortion is one of the most common medical procedures, medical students receive little education about this fundamental aspect of women's health care. Hundreds of MSFC members will be marching with the belief that every physician has an obligation to meet the full reproductive needs of their patients. Only 60 percent of U.S. medical schools provide students with education on abortion, and even at those schools, less than 30 minutes is devoted to the topic.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;We will be marching to help ensure all future doctors are adequately trained to meet the full reproductive needs of their women patients, including abortions, because it's just good medical care,&quot; states MSFC President, Rob Roose, a third year medical student at George Washington University School of Medicine.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;As future physicians it is critical that our medical decisions are based upon our training and judgment,&quot; says Lauren Oshman, M.D., M.P.H., AMSA National President. &quot;These decisions are being jeopardized and our patients' health is being put at risk by politicians who support vague legislation, delay access to over the counter emergency contraception and delete information about the effectiveness of condom use from government websites.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Medical education that incorporates comprehensive reproductive health services, including contraception and abortion, produces physicians who are better able to care for and meet the needs of their women patients,&quot; states Lisa Haddad, a third year medical student currently serving as the AMWA-Reproductive Health Initiative National Student Liaison.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Marchers will assemble at 10:00 a.m. on the National Mall between 3rd and 14th Streets NW. The March will begin at noon with a rally to follow from 1-4 p.m. on the National Mall.

Founded in 1950, AMSA is a student-governed, non-profit organization committed to representing the concerns of physicians-in-training. With approximately 40,000 members, including medical and premedical students, residents and practicing physicians, AMSA is committed to improving medical training as well as advancing the profession of medicine. AMSA focuses on five strategic priorities, including universal healthcare, disparities in medicine, diversity in medicine, leadership development and transforming the culture of medicine.

Founded in 1915, AMWA represents 10,000 women physicians, resident and medical students and has student chapters in over 80% of U.S. medical schools. AMWA developed the Reproductive Health Initiative (RHI) in 1993 out of a commitment to education and training programs that improve reproductive health services and access to care. Through its projects and educational materials, RHI helps medical education institutions worldwide provide comprehensive reproductive health information to current and future health care providers.

Through campus organizing and abortion training opportunities for medical students, MSFC supports physicians-in-training who will become the next generation of abortion providers.For more information on our programs, please visit us online at <A HREF="http://www.ms4c.org" TARGET="_new">www.ms4c.org</A></FONT></I></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
