<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - May 24 - The War Resisters League, the 80-year-old peace organization, is proud to announce that its 2004 Peace Award will be given to Fernando Suarez del Solar.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Fernando Suarez del Solar paid the highest price for &quot;regime change&quot; in Iraq. His son, Jesus Alberto Suarez del Solar Navarro, was a Marine killed at the beginning of the war last year. He was killed not by the Republican guard or Saddam loyalists, but by a U.S. cluster bomb.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Mr. Suarez del Solar mourns the death of his son in a war he knows is wrong and is working with Military Families Speak Out, a network of families opposed to the war in Iraq. In December 2003 Mr. Suarez de Solar took his grief to Iraq. With other military families, he went to see where his son died and to try and understand why.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WRL bestows the Peace Award annually on activists who have generously contributed their time, hard work and creative energies to the movement for peace and justice. WRL honors people who may not be well known in the media as movement leaders, but who have carried out important work behind the scenes or at the grassroots community level.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Please join us to honor Fernando and Military Families Speak Out.
