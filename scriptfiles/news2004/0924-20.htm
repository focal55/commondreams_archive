<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NEW YORK - September 24 - According to the just- released Forbes 400 list of richest Americans, 39 percent  inherited at least some of their wealth and &quot;the rest have self- made fortunes.&quot; In fact, says Responsible Wealth, everyone on the  Forbes 400 owes their wealth partly to a taxpayer-financed  inheritance of public research and contracts; public schools and  universities; communications, transportation and other critical  infrastructure, and myriad government institutions from the  Federal Reserve and the courts to the Treasury, Defense and  Commerce Departments.</font></p>
<p>   <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It takes a village to raise a billionaire. Every taxpayer  deserves some credit for Forbes 400 wealth,&quot; says Mike Lapham, co- director of Responsible Wealth. &quot;Yet while the Forbes 400 richest  Americans are doing better this year -- their collective wealth rose  $45 billion since 2003 -- the average taxpayer is not. Median  household income fell for the fourth year in a row last year.&quot;</font></p>
<p>   <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Self-serving stories of 'self-made' success may nourish the  ego, but they mask the real ingredients of wealth creation and a  strong economy. Where would the Forbes 400 be without public  investment and infrastructure-from Google founders building on the  Internet to Ross Perot and government contracts?&quot; said Chuck  Collins, co-founder of Responsible Wealth.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">   Billionaires Warren Buffett, Ross Perot and Google's Larry Page  illustrate the myth of the &quot;self-made&quot; label. They are all  featured in Responsible Wealth's report, &quot;I Didn't Do It Alone:  Society's Contribution to Individual Wealth and Success.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">   Warren Buffett, No. 2 on the Forbes 400, attended a publicly  supported state school, the University of Nebraska in Lincoln, and  is quite clear that his investment wealth depends on America's  social and economic infrastructure. &quot;I personally think that  society is responsible for a very significant percentage of what  I've earned,&quot; said Buffett. &quot;I happen to work in a market system  that happens to reward what I do very well -- disproportionately  well.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">   Larry Page, No. 43 on the Forbes 400, co-founded Google, which  went public this year. Page graduated from a state school, the  University of Michigan, and then attended Stanford University for  graduate work, where Google was born. Government grants underpin  the lucrative research in Silicon Valley and at Stanford  University. The Internet platform, without which Google would not  exist, is built on a foundation of taxpayer-funded research and  development.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">   H. Ross Perot, Jr, No. 40 on the Forbes 400, grew his company  Electronic Data Systems (later sold to General Motors) by focusing  on computer systems and services for Medicare, a government  program. The company's growth -- and windfall profits -- really  took off when it began reselling the Medicare claims processing  system it had developed for Texas Blue Cross under a research and  development contract paid for by federal funds.</font></p>
<p>   <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Some Forbes 400 billionaires want to pull up the ladder behind  them,&quot; says Scott Klinger, co-director of Responsible Wealth.  &quot;They received government help, but don't want anyone else to. The  myth of self-made wealth is used to justify tax cuts for the rich  and reduce public investment in the very institutions and  infrastructure that not only enable more Americans to become  wealthy, but are crucial to a strong and growing economy.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">   Responsible Wealth's report, &quot;I Didn't Do It Alone: Society's  Contribution to Individual Wealth and Success,&quot; co-authored by  Chuck Collins, Mike Lapham and Scott Klinger, spotlights  successful entrepreneurs who credit society's investment in their  success. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">   Jim Sherblom, a venture capitalist and former chief financial  officer of the biotech firm, Genzyme, observed in the report, &quot;The  opportunities to create wealth are all taking advantage of public  goods -- like roads, transportation, markets -- and public  investments. None of us can claim it was all personal initiative.  A piece of it was built upon this infrastructure that we all have  this inherent moral obligation to keep intact.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">   The report concludes that if society's role in wealth creation  withers from inadequate revenues and political will, then  opportunities for wealth and innovation will shrink.  Entrepreneurism, the economy and society will all be undermined.</font></p>
