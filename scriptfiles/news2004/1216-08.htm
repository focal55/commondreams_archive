<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NEW YORK, NY -- December 16 -- </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today Tamara Draut, Director of the Economic Opportunity Program at Demos, a non-partisan public policy think-tank, issued the following statement regarding the recent fifth interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve in 2004:</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;While the increase in the Federal Reserve rate might benefit individuals with long term investments or saving, millions of households in our deficit-spending culture will only experience its many pitfalls. After several years of declining wages and rising costs, families across the country have often turned to readily available cash &#150; either through revolving credit or home refinancing, and many of them will feel the squeeze of this latest interest rate increase after the holiday season .&quot; </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot; Over the last several years there was an explosion of home refinancing with Adjustable Rate Mortgages that are tied to fluctuations in the Prime Rate, and many of those homeowners who took advantage of the ready cash offered by refinancing will find themselves saddled with higher monthly payments, just as they prepare to deal with the debt accumulated at the end of the year.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot; The credit card companies that reaped the benefits of steep declines in the Fed's rate in the 90's, but didn't pass the savings on to their customers -- and instead raised penalty rates and fees dramatically -- will undoubtedly pass the costs of th e rate increase on to already strapped cardholders.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;For the millions of indebted Americans , the Fed's measured interest rate increases may very likely spell financial trouble . &quot; <br> </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For more information about the Economic Opportunity Program, our research on credit card industry practices, personal debt, and challenges to asset building and affordable higher education, visit <a href="http://www.demos-usa.org/" target="_new">www.demos-usa.org</a>. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Demos: A Network for Ideas &amp; Action is a nonprofit, nonpartisan public policy organization based in New York</i>. <br></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
