<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - March 25 - The Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, United States Section, rejects a US constitutional amendment defining marriage as a union between a man and a woman.  Such an amendment would set a profoundly anti-democratic precedent in that it would explicitly remove legal rights from a group of its citizens.  The administration has crossed the line between church and state and presumes that our secular nation is a religious nation.  We believe in the separation of church and state.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The legal rights and benefits of partnerships are a civil issue and should be conferred equally on opposite and same gender unions, as a matter of justice.  A religious ceremony should not have the right to grant legal partnership recognition to anyone, that role belongs to the state.  A civil process that grants lesser legal status (or none) to gay and lesbian couples is patently discriminatory.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The administration is proposing this amendment to fan the flames of bigotry, divide the nation and shift the focus away from its failed policies.  What does require scrutiny, as the country assesses its leadership, are fundamental issues of governance and leadership.  We are facing a sagging economy including the staggering loss of jobs, and mounting crises in healthcare and education. Additionally, we call for investigation of the lies used to justify attacking Iraq.   US citizens realize this dividing tactic for what it is and reject it.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><I>Since 1915, WILPF has worked to achieve through peaceful means:  world disarmament, full rights for women, racial and economic justice, an end to all forms of violence, and to establish those political, social, and psychological conditions which can assure peace, freedom, and justice for all.
