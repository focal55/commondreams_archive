<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PHILADELPHIA, PA -- December 30 -- </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) is accepting financial contributions to assist victims of the tsunami (tidal wave) resulting from the earthquake along the costal line in south Asia on Sunday. Reports confirm more than 110,000 people have been killed. Millions are homeless and in need of emergency housing, food, water and other basic necessities in a dozen countries in the region.</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">    The devastation occurred from Indonesia in southern Asia across the India Ocean to Somalia on the east coast of Africa. The United Nations reports that Indonesia and Sri Lanka experienced the greatest number of deaths and that the humanitarian effort will be the largest undertaken in its history. AFSC is providing an initial grant for immediate relief in Indonesia from its Crisis Fund. The funds will be shared between Mennonite Central Committee (MCC), which is another international faith-based organization with staff on the ground, and the Society for Health, Education and Environment for Peace, (SHEEP) a local Indonesian organization. The grant to SHEEP will support sending a team of 40 medical doctors to the Aceh region to join or relieve 75 current doctors.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The most damaged area in Indonesia is the northern section of Sumatra Island where more than 6,000 people were killed. There is no electricity, transportation to and from the airport is limited or not available at all. There are about 250,000 people located in camps for displaced people who need blankets and clothes,&quot; reports Rina Wijiya, AFSC staff in Jakarta, Indonesia.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Contributions marked AFSC/Crisis Fund can be sent to AFSC, 1501 Cherry Street, Philadelphia, Pa 19102. Also, contribute via www.afsc.org/emap or by calling toll free 1-888-588-2372, ext. 1. AFSC is not accepting material donations nor sending volunteers at present.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;AFSC has had a presence and contacts in Indonesia for more than 35 years through its peace building efforts and international conferences and seminars. We will send additional staff as soon as possible to make an assessment of how AFSC can best assist in the short term relief effort and will begin planning for longer-term development in Indonesia,&quot; said Geri Sicola, AFSC's associate general secretary for International Programs.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>The American Friends Service Committee is a Quaker organization that includes people of various faiths who are committed to social justice, peace and humanitarian service. Its work is based on the belief in the worth of every person and faith in the power of love to overcome violence and injustice. </i></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
