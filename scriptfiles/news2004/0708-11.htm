<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - July 8 - Iceland has met this year's self-imposed quota for &quot;scientific whaling,&quot; after killing 25 minke whales around its coast. Since the resumption of whaling in 2003, Iceland has killed 61 whales.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;We are happy that Iceland did not follow its original research plans to kill 500 whales in 2003 and 2004. We sincerely hope this signals that whaling will soon come to an end, once and for all,&quot; said Della Green, IFAW Marine Campaigner.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The whale meat from scientific whaling has been sold in supermarkets, but there is little demand. Of the 35 tons of meat landed last year, 23 tons remain unsold.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The hunt ended shortly after IFAW's research and education vessel Song of the Whale arrived in Iceland. IFAW's whale research team is conducting benign research on the largest animal in the world, the blue whale, and other cetacean species in Icelandic waters. The main focus of IFAW's scientific study is to further develop acoustic techniques for listening to whales and to correlate the sounds they make with behavioral observations.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Recent polling on public support for whaling in Iceland, conducted by Gallup for IFAW and <A HREF="http://www.greenpeace.org/international_en/" TARGET="_new">Greenpeace</A>, shows a decline in public support for the third consecutive poll. Although still high, support has dropped to 67 percent; the first time it has fallen below 70 percent in Iceland. The poll indicates an important shift in opinion, particularly within the younger generation.</FONT></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
