CADARACHE, France - October 7 - Five Greenpeace climbers have hung a 
10x10m "Stop Plutonium" banner just above the entrance of the Mirabeau 
Tunnel - five kilometres from Cadarache - where a shipment of U.S. 
plutonium is due to arrive later today. Hundreds of military police and 
security vehicles have been deployed along the route of this high risk 
transport.
<P>

"Despite claims that French nuclear state company Areva, the French and 
U.S. governments are committed to this program declaring it will reduce 
the threat of nuclear proliferation, in reality it will have the 
opposite effect. It will massively increase proliferation threat by 
dispersing the plutonium around," said Jan Vande Putte of Greenpeace 
International.
<P>

Every year in France, more than 10,000 kilograms of plutonium are 
transported from the La Hague reprocessing plant in Normandy to nuclear 
fuel fabrication plants elsewhere in France. The security surrounding 
this US nuclear shipment is far higher than the weekly French transports 
of weapons-usable plutonium, carried out in non-armoured vehicles under 
low-level police protection.

<P>Greenpeace wants and immediate end to plutonium production and 
separation and believes current stocks both civil and military should be 
treated as nuclear waste not shipped around the world as reactor fuel. 
Plutonium should be mixed with radioactive waste, solidified or 
vitrified, and stored. This approach would be cheaper, faster, safer, 
and more secure.
