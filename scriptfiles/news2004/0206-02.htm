Organizers hope the golfing term &#147;Mulligan&#148; will be both entertaining and thought provoking for the golfers in attendance.  </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In casual golf games, Mulligan refers to a &#147;freebie&#148; or &#147;do-over&#148; second shot sometimes offered to a player who botches a swing.  In official play and the rules of golf, however, Mulligans are never offered or allowed.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;We are asking Republicans, Democrats, and all Americans to hold our President accountable for his administration&#146;s possible distortion and misuse of national intelligence to promote the invasion of Iraq,&#148; said Creighton Peet, a sponsor of the advertising flight. &#147;In early 2003, with his party in tight control of Congress and the nation still in shock from 9/11, George W. Bush got a free pass to invade Iraq without sufficient public debate,&#148; said Peet.  &#147;Our message is that now it is time to play by the rules and determine the whole truth.&#148;</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">A small group of private citizens was inspired to sponsor the aerial advertising by President Bush&#146;s call for an investigation into &#147;poor pre-war intelligence&#148; in Washington earlier this week.  &#147;Poor intelligence&#148; is only half the story and a potential red herring, the group claims.  Americans also need to know whether the Bush administration misused and distorted whatever intelligence they had to mislead the country into an unjust, unnecessary, and costly invasion of Iraq.  </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The AT&amp;T Pebble Beach Pro-Am Golf Tournament has a long tradition of light heartedness, good sportsmanship, and fair play.  It is in this spirit that organizers say they are making their appeal to the golfing public to set appropriate limits on a President which many of them voted for.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">(A definition of the term &#147;Mulligan&#148; can be found at <A HREF="http://www.golfglossary.com" TARGET="_new">www.golfglossary.com</A> or <A HREF="http://www.leaderboard.com/GLOSSARY_MULLIGAN" TARGET="_new">http://www.leaderboard.com/GLOSSARY_MULLIGAN</A></FONT></P><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
