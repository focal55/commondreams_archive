<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - March 26 - The Children's Defense Fund today responded to the budget resolution just passed by the House of Representatives by pointing out how it hurts children now and in the future. </FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">By granting tax cuts for the wealthy - piling more red ink on top of the current deficit which is the largest in the history of the nation - while cutting programs for children and low-income Americans, this budget is a reckless attack on the most vulnerable Americans. The budget cuts funding for nearly all domestic programs by $120 billion, including nutrition, housing assistance, and juvenile justice. It also threatens to increase the number of uninsured children with a potential cut of $2.2 billion to Medicaid. It includes no additional child care funding when the need is growing, and it under funds education.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">CDF called the House passed version of the budget a clear set back for children. &quot;Discretionary spending programs, especially those that help low-income families and children will be slashed over the next five years.&quot; said Jim Jones, Vice President of Programs and Policy. &quot;Tax cuts tilted to the wealthy are extended. Under this budget, by 2009 spending on almost all discretionary domestic programs would fall to their lowest level as a share of the economy since 1963, and our children will still inherit a huge national debt. This budget hurts children now and it hurts children in the future.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Senate version of the budget, though severely flawed because of cuts to critical children's programs, does not cut Medicaid and puts a road-block in the way of any additional tax cuts for the wealthy. The House-Senate Conference Committee has a unique opportunity to do the right thing now by agreeing on a budget that is not only fiscally responsible, but is compassionate in the way it treats children. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;We should be investing in children, not investing in millionaires,&quot; Jones said.</FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
