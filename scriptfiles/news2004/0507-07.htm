<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - May 7 - Last night&#146;s FDA decision to deny over-the-counter availability of the &#147;morning after pill&#148; &#150; medication that can prevent a pregnancy from occurring if taken within 72 hours following unprotected sex &#150; is an egregious example of the Bush Administration&#146;s choice of politics over women&#146;s health.  The administration overruled a sound, scientific recommendation from an FDA panel, which voted 23-4 to make the medication available.</FONT></p><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;This is about politics, not medicine.  President Bush wants to have it both ways,&#148; said Ralph G. Neas, president of People For the American Way.  &#147;He wants to portray himself as compassionate, but an agency operated by his appointees is rejecting expert medical opinion that women&#146;s lives can be helped if this medication is made available over the counter.   The decision is clearly aimed at energizing the radical anti-choice wing of the GOP base, and is a cynical ploy to gain votes at the expense of women&#146;s health.&#148;</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;If the president trusts scientists and doctors and honestly wants to reduce the number of abortions in this country, he should ask the FDA to reconsider its decision,&#148; added Neas.  &#147;But if he wants to use a public agency and the reproductive health of American women as political pawns in this fall&#146;s election, he can keep playing to the anti-choice extremists who only want to see one thing &#150; an end to every woman&#146;s constitutional right to make decisions about her life and her body.&#148; </FONT> </P><P> </P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
