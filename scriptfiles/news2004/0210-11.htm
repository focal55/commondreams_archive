<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - February 10 - Despite Bush&#146;s unqualified promise on &#147;Meet the Press&#148; Sunday to release all documents, Bush has not yet signed a release for tax records and military medical and disciplinary records. </FONT></p><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Responses to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests in the year 2000 stated that some records were held back -- and those classes of documents have not yet been released. Before medical, disciplinary and perhaps additional personnel records can be released, President Bush must authorize the military to release those records covered by the Privacy Act. </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Asked by Tim Russert on Sunday, &#147;Would you authorize the release of everything to settle this?&#148; and &#147;&#133;anything to show that you were serving during that period?&#148; Bush answered without qualification, &#147;Yes, absolutely.&#148;  (For information on the FOIA request, see <A HREF="http://users.cis.net/coldfeet/Den_cov_letter.gif" TARGET="_new">http://users.cis.net/coldfeet/Den_cov_letter.gif</A> . ) </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Instead, the Administration only released annual pension point summaries and pay records which apparently showed Bush had intermittently attended meetings and been paid &#150; which was never in dispute -- but with gaps of several months still unanswered.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Many of the documents distributed to reporters today were unreadable.  And although other presidential candidates have surrounded themselves with companions from their military service days &#150; &#147;Bands of Brothers&#148; &#150; no one has yet to come forward saying he served in the Air National Guard with Bush in Alabama during 1972, when Bush was there working in a Senate campaign and &#150; so he says &#150; fulfilling his military service obligation.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Scott McLellan, the spokesman for Bush, said that the existence of pay records proved that Bush showed up for duty.  &#147;You are paid for the dates you serve,&#148; he claimed.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">But columnist Richard Cohen, writing in today&#146;s Washington Post, said that like Bush, he joined the National Guard to avoid service overseas during the Vietnam War.  Also like Bush, he wrote, he failed to participate fully.    </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;For two years or so, I played a perfectly legal form of hooky. To show you what a mess the Guard was at the time, I even got paid for all the meetings I missed,&#148; wrote Cohen. </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">For more information on the President&#146;s contradictory statements on his military record see <A HREF="http://www.Misleader.org" TARGET="_new">www.Misleader.org</A>.</FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
