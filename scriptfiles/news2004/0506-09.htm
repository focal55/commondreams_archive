<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">SAN FRANCISCO - May 6 - A new study conducted in Israel on the dynamics of swimming dolphins confirms recent research developed by U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service scientists: The chasing and netting of dolphins, as promoted by the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC) and the government of Mexico, separates dolphin calves from their mothers. Unable to keep up with the dolphin herd, these young either starve or are quickly snapped up by sharks that accompany the dolphin herds and tuna vessels in the Eastern Tropical Pacific.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Along with recent revelations of $10,000 bribes of IATTC observers on tunaboats to falsify dolphin mortality data and net sets, this new study points out the scientific fallacy of continuing to chase and net dolphins in order to catch tuna. Encircling dolphins with deadly nets can NEVER be considered &quot;Dolphin Safe&quot;. The IATTC program, endorsed by the Bush Administration, does not protect dolphins.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Earth Island Institute's International Marine Mammal Project developed international standards for &quot;Dolphin Safe&quot; tuna that are adhered to by more than 90% of the world's canned tuna markets. Earth Island standards require that no dolphins be chased or netted during an entire fishing trip, in order to qualify as &quot;Dolphin Safe&quot;. These standards have been the required standards for use of a &quot;Dolphin Safe&quot; tuna label in the U.S. since 1990's passage of the Dolphin Protection Consumer Information Act authored by then-Representative Barbara Boxer. The Bush Administration tried to weaken these standards in December 2002 to conform to the weak IATTC standards allowing chasing and netting dolphins. However, federal Judge Thelton Henderson, in a lawsuit filed by Earth Island Institute, has issued a Preliminary Injunction against the weak standards. A hearing on summary judgement in that case, &quot;Earth Island Institute v. Secretary of Commerce Donald Evans&quot;, is scheduled for Monday, May 24th, in San Francisco federal court.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Only by adhering to the Earth Island Institute international standards for &quot;Dolphin Safe&quot; tuna will dolphins and other marine life be protected for future generations.</FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
