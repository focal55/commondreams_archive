<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">NAJAF, IRAQ - April 23 -    As numerous people from nonprofit organizations working in Iraq evacuated the country during the past week, an independent emergency delegation of U.S. civilians was preparing to enter the conflict-torn nation,traveling to the tense stand-off around Najaf, where the U.S. military recently deployed almost 3,000 troops for a looming assault to crush Shiite rebels there.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Najaf Emergency Peace Team, &quot;Peace Between Peoples&quot;, a handful of determined volunteers from several well-established peace/global justice/human rights and religious organizations, has now arrived in the area, to place themselves &quot;nonviolently, symbolically and physically&quot; between the U.S. armed forces massed nearby and the civilian population of the ancient holy city - in the way of any  American military assault.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The delegation has received messages of encouragement from religious and community leaders in south-central Iraq, including an advisor to Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani.  &quot;We understand the dangers of our journey, but we are determined to try and contribute in our own small way to peace and justice for the people of Najaf and Iraq.  Only when peacemakers are willing to shoulder some of the same risks that soldiers take in war, can we begin to move away from the cycle of violence that grips human society at the dawn of the 21st century,&quot; says the group's statement.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Meg Lumsdaine, Peter Lumsdaine, Mario Galvan, Trish Schuh, and Brian Buckley  - of California, New York and Virginia, respectively  -  are now in south-central Iraq to carry out their peace mission.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Rev.
