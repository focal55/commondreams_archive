<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- November 19 -- Thanksgiving is fast approaching, and most Americans are buying turkeys, preparing stuffing, and perfecting Mom's pumpkin pie recipe. For them this holiday is a happy occasion and a chance to enjoy a great meal with family and friends.  But for the 110 million Americans living in or near poverty, the holiday is ripe with anxiety.  These families wonder if they will be able to afford a turkey, if they will ever be able to have Thanksgiving dinner in their own home instead of a homeless shelter, and if things will get better by the time Christmas rolls around.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Community Action Partnership, the nation's largest anti-poverty organization, wants to ensure that all Americans can enjoy Thanksgiving and everyday of the year without worrying about a lack of jobs, affordable housing and health care.  The organization is calling on President Bush to convene a White House Conference on American Poverty where the nation's top economist, practitioners, and policymakers would gather to craft a national anti-poverty agenda.  The Partnership and its network of 1,000 Community Action Agencies are currently collecting signatures in support of the effort, and their goal is one million signatures demonstrating that a significant number of Americans feel that poverty is a serious issue and want the White House to address it.

CAAs care about the entire community and are dedicated to helping people help themselves and each other.
