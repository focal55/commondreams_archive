<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">GENEVA - June 21 - For the first time since it was adopted in May 2003, countries are coming together to discuss the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) in a meeting that will help determine the strength of the treaty&#146;s implementation. Set to take place from 21-25 June at the World Health Organization, the FCTC Intergovernmental Working Group will debate critical issues such as: the participation of civil society, the exclusion of the tobacco industry, the designation of a permanent Secretariat and the adequate funding of FCTC implementation. The US-based corporate accountability organization Infact and other members of the Network for Accountability of Tobacco Transnationals (NATT) are urging delegates to be vigilant to attempts by the tobacco industry and the US to derail the treaty.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The FCTC bans tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship and protects public health policy from tobacco industry interference. The FCTC, which sets precedents for international regulation of other industries that threaten health, the environment and human rights, enters into force and becomes international law after 40 countries ratify it. To date 131 countries have signed the FCTC and 21 have ratified.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;There is great momentum behind the FCTC&#146;s swift implementation. Decisions made here this week will help determine how effective the treaty&#146;s enforcement will be. With millions of lives at stake, the countries that led the way through the negotiating process must resist attempts by the tobacco industry and its allies in governments to derail the FCTC at this critical time,&#148; says Kathryn Mulvey, Executive Director of the US-based corporate accountability organization Infact, a NATT member.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Infact and NATT are urging country negotiators to: </FONT></P><UL><LI><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Keep the tobacco industry out of FCTC ratification and implementation. </FONT></LI><LI><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Designate an effective FCTC Secretariat that is independent, fully funded and committed to health. </FONT></LI><LI><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Ensure participation of public interest NGOs in the Conference of the Parties. </FONT></LI><LI><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Establish strong financial mechanisms and full funding of FCTC implementation. </FONT></LI></UL><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Global tobacco corporations have attempted to water down and delay the FCTC from the beginning of the process. Philip Morris/Altria considered a variety of strategies including setting up its own &#147;NGO&#148; to gain access to negotiations. According to the corporation&#146;s internal documents, it received advice from the notorious public relations firm Mongoven, Biscoe and Duchin that &#147;A comprehensive strategy to influence the&#133;UN/WHO policies would be enhanced significantly by establishing an NGO&#133;.&#148; Documents also show Philip Morris/Altria profiled regions to determine which countries would support the Convention, and would be susceptible to industry influence.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;Big Tobacco continues to try to derail the FCTC. Philip Morris/Altria is even trying to win a seat at the table by proclaiming its &#145;support&#146; for the FCTC. However, Philip Morris/Altria opposes central provisions of the treaty including the ban on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship,&#148; says Yul Francisco Dorado, of Consumers International Regional Office for Latin America and the Caribbean, a NATT member. &#147;Governments around the world must not allow the tobacco corporations, their subsidiaries or affiliates to slow down FCTC ratification or implementation.&#148;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The 21 countries that have ratified the FCTC are: Norway, Malta, Fiji, Sri Lanka, Seychelles, New Zealand, Mongolia, India, Palau, Hungary, Myanmar, Slovakia, Singapore, the Cook Islands, Mauritius, Maldives, Mexico, Brunei Darussalam, Japan, Iceland, and Bangladesh. Across the globe, public interest organizations are urging their governments to be among the first 40 to ratify. A number of ratifications are expected over the next few weeks.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Last month the US government&#146;s signing of the FCTC was met with skepticism. According to Infact, the move appeared to be the latest in a series of public relations maneuvers to cover up its efforts to undermine the treaty. Throughout the FCTC negotiating process, the US government consistently took positions to weaken the treaty at the expense of people&#146;s lives in the US and around the world. Treaties that the US has signed but not ratified include: the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Convention on Biological Diversity, the Kyoto Protocol, the International Criminal Court, and the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">* The US Campaign for Burma * Infact * World Bank Bonds Boycott * Press for Change * Social Choice for Social Change * Citizens Coalition (Frente Civico) * Educating for Justice * National Community Reinvestment Coalition * National Congress for Community Economic Development</FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
