Participants in the event will urge Treasury to continue to push its proposal forward, while calling on Treasury to extend cancellation to all impoverished countries, and without harmful conditions.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The event is part of Jubilee USA Network&#146;s &#147;Countdown to Freedom from Debt campaign&#148; to pressure the US government to support 100% debt cancellation for impoverished nations. In the past six months, Jubilee and its more than 70 Network member organizations have sent more than 600 faxes to US Treasury, delivered 11, 000 cards to the World Bank and IMF, delivered a letter from more 250 prominent religious leaders to the G7,  worked to introduce bi-partisan legislation into the US Congress (the JUBILEE Act), and organized call-in days that have tied up the lines at the White House - all calling on the Bush administration to support 100% debt cancellation. In the coming weeks, Jubilee USA will continue to raise the pressure on the Bush administration and the G7 to support full debt cancellation. Jubilee USA will also organize an action on October 1 at the G7 Finance Ministers meeting in Washington.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
