<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- November 15 -- Washington, DC: Ralph Nader today called for the immediate resignation of Terry McAuliffe as Chairman of the Democratic National Committee. Nader described the Democratic Party as losing its direction under his leadership, not knowing what it stands for and taking its base for granted. He also criticized McAuliffe for condoning and participating in &quot;constitutional crimes&quot; in his efforts to keep Nader-Camejo off the ballot.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The letter highlighted how the traditional Democratic base is abandoning the party including Latinos, workers, low wage earners, women, youth and liberals. Nader noted: &quot;You have taken the Democratic base for granted and as a result are losing support among Americans who should be supporting an alternative to the Republican Party.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Regarding the attack on the Nader-Camejo campaign Nader pointed to &quot;harassment and intimidation of people who circulated and signed our petitions, dirty tricks at ballot access conventions and phony lawsuits.&quot; He quoted democratic party operatives who said one pupose was to bleed the campaign dry of resources to emphasize that this effort was not about trying to ensure the law was being followed. He described the Democratic Party efforts as &quot;political bigotry&quot; based in a belief that &quot;the United States as a two-party dictatorship rather than a robust democracy with diverse voices.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nader urged the Democratic Party to do some soul searching to examine why they have been losing to the most extreme Republican candidates for two decades. Nader said McAuliffe's &quot;immediate resignation would be a first step toward a reappraisal of the direction of the Democratic Party so that it stops evading and scapegoating but instead looks at itself directly in the mirror.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">November 15, 2004</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Terry McAuliffe, Chairman<br>Democratic National Committee<br>430 S. Capitol St. SE<br>Washington DC 20003</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dear Mr. McAuliffe:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I am writing to request your immediate resignation as Chairman of the Democratic National Committee.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Under your leadership the Democratic Party has lost its direction, no longer knows what it stands for and as a result is losing to many of the most extreme Republican candidates in history. You have taken the Democratic base for granted and as a result are losing support among Americans who should be supporting an alternative to the Republican Party, e.g., according to CNN exit polls 38% of union members voted for Bush as did 40% of those with union members in their households, 42% of those earning $15,000-$30,000, 44% of those who earn under $50,000 and 44% of Latinos, 45% of youth (aged 18-29), 13% of liberals &#150; even 11% of Democrats voted for Bush! Even significantly lower percentages would still have been an astonishing abandonment.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The anti-democratic activities you condoned, funded and participated in against the Nader-Camejo independent campaign were constitutional crimes that make you unworthy of serving in any capacity in U.S. politics. Harassment and intimidation of people who circulated and signed our petitions, dirty tricks at ballot access conventions and phony lawsuits in order to prevent voters from being allowed to vote for the candidates of their choice needs to be rejected by the political parties. As Democratic operatives told The Washington Post on August 24, one of the goals of this litigation was &#147;to neutralize his campaign by forcing him to spend money and resources defending these things.&#148; You and many members of your party showed a political bigotry that sees the United States as a two-party dictatorship rather than a robust democracy with diverse voices.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Democratic Party needs to examine its failures honestly. Over the last two decades there has been a steady decline in electoral success at the local, state and national level. Your immediate resignation would be a first step toward a reappraisal of the direction of the Democratic Party so that it stops evading and scapegoating but instead looks at itself directly in the mirror.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sincerely,</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ralph Nader</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
