<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TEMPE, Arizona - October 5 - </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">EVENTS:  The October 13th Alliance is planning a week of activities and actions around the Presidential debate scheduled for October 13th in Tempe, Arizona.  Activities include music festivals, panel discussions, art installations, a free market, film screenings, and marches.  Events start on October 9th and continue through October 13th.  The list attached provides the time and location for each event planned. </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The October 13th Alliance is a diverse, non-partisan, grassroots coalition formed in response to concerns that the presidential candidates will not discuss critical global and local issues during the presidential debates.  To correct this fault, the Alliance organized multiple events to address various important issues, including the withdrawal of troops from Iraq, military recruitment of minorities, and loss of civil liberties.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;This is going to be a festival of ideas,&#148; says Beth Swadener. &#147;We are going to have a real diversity of views where people can discuss what is on their minds.&#148;     </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Our message is that there are many critical issues not being debated and more than two sides to every story&#148; said Sue Hilderbrand. &#147;Instead of complaining, we are going to create a truly democratic environment.&#148;</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Highlighted events:</font></p><ul><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Saturday, October 9th, 5 - 10 pm, Democracy for a Change Music Festival: Rally for Awareness.

Join us for a joyful display of what a truly &quot;free&quot; market would look like while expanding our vision of the possibilities for creating a fair economy.  Read some poetry, feed a neighbor.
