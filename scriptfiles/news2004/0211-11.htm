<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - February 11 - The nation&#146;s civil rights leaders today called on Congress and the White House to fulfill Martin Luther King&#146;s dream of justice and equality for all Americans by supporting  &#147;FAIRNESS: The Civil Rights Act of 2004.&#148;  </FONT></p><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;2004 is the 40th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the 50th anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court&#146;s landmark Brown v. Board of Education decision,&#148; said Wade Henderson, executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights (LCCR), the nation's oldest, largest, and most diverse civil and human rights coalition. &#147;While we have come a long way,&#148; continued Henderson, &#147;recent court decisions have undercut and weakened America&#146;s civil rights laws in ways that Congress and the American people never expected.&#148;</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;Treating some of us as second-class when it comes to rights guaranteed by the Constitution is neither moral nor just and hardly a beacon for the rest of the world,&#148; said Henderson.  &#147;If we are to be that shining &#145;city on the hill,&#146; then the Civil Rights Act of 2004 must become the law of the land.&#148;</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;How is it fair,&#148; asked Henderson, &#147;for an older worker employed by a local or state government not to have the same legal protections as workers in private industry?  But that&#146;s what the federal courts have decided.&#148;</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;And how is it fair,&#148; continued Henderson, &#147;for students to be held to a higher standard of proof when they are victims of sexual harassment than workers or even their teachers?  But that&#146;s what the federal courts have decided.&#148;</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;And how is it fair,&#148; asked Henderson, &#147;for soldiers in our armed forces to be unable to get damages relief when they are victims of discrimination by state employers based on their military service?  </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">LCCR and its member organizations strongly endorse the FAIRNESS Act because it ensures that Congress keeps the promises it made to the American people when it passed previous civil rights laws prohibiting unfair and discriminatory treatment.    </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;In America, our individual rights are supposed to be guaranteed by the Constitution,&#148; said                                                                         Henderson, &#147;but in case after case, the courts are taking those rights away and that&#146;s just not right.  The FAIRNESS Act sends a strong and clear message to the courts &#150; trampling on the civil rights of older Americans, the elderly, workers, women, individuals with disabilities, and the poor is not what America is about.  The FAIRNESS Act restores civil rights protections and realizes the dream of Martin Luther King.&#148;</FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
