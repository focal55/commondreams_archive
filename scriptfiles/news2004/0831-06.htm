<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BANGLADESH - August 30 - The government of Bangladesh should immediately release Rafique Al Islam, a campaigner against landmines in Bangladesh, said the International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL), 1997 Nobel Peace Prize co-Laureate. Mr. Al Islam was arrested at his home in Cox's Bazaar on 21 August by soldiers of the Rapid Action Battalion.  He is the Coordinator of the ICBL's Treaty Implementation and Victim Assistance Working Group in Bangladesh, and is also the representative of the ICBL in his country.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We fear for the well-being and even the life of our esteemed colleague,&quot; said Liz Bernstein, ICBL coordinator. &quot;Rafique has worked openly and cooperatively with Bangladesh officials on the landmine issue for many years, making his arrest as inexplicable as it is appalling,&quot; said Ms. Bernstein.  Bangladesh is a State Party to the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rafique Al Islam has been detained for nine days without charges. A hearing of his case -- originally scheduled for Sunday 29 August -- was held on Saturday 28 August.  His family and lawyer were not informed of this change, and thus were unable to prepare his defense. On 29 August he was remanded into the custody of the Rapid Action Battalion for the purpose of interrogation for five days. Another hearing is scheduled for later this week.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The continued detention of Rafique without charges and without informing his family of where he is being held is outrageous,&quot; said Yeshua Moser-Puangsuwan, Bangkok representative of Non Violence International, the international NGO represented by Mr. Al Islam in Bangladesh. &quot;Rafique Al Islam is committed to his work to implement the treaty banning landmines in his country.  He has devoted himself to ridding the country of dangerous, inhumane weapons.&quot;  Non Violence International is registered with the government of Bangladesh and helps coordinate the work on landmines.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jody Williams, who received the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize along with the ICBL, said, &quot;Bangladesh was the first country in South Asia to join the Mine Ban Treaty.  It is squandering its good image and destroying its leadership on this issue by its unjust treatment of the most active and respected landmine campaigner and researcher in the country.  He must be released immediately.&quot; The ICBL has not received a response from the Government of Bangladesh to repeated enquiries regarding Rafique Al-Islam's arrest and detention.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Links to more information:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nonviolence International Press Statement: Statement: <a href="http://www.icbl.org/content/download/11596/257456/file/NI%20press%20statement.pdf" target="_new">http://www.icbl.org/content/download/11596/257456/file/NI%20press%20statement.pdf</a></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Human Rights Watch Statement: <a href="http://www.humanrightswatch.org/english/docs/2004/08/27/bangla9276.htm" target="_new">http://www.humanrightswatch.org/english/docs/2004/08/27/bangla9276.htm</a></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ICBL Letter to Prime Minister Khaleda Zia: <a href="http://www.icbl.org/content/download/11494/255786/file/ICBL%20Bangladesh%20Rafique.23%20Aug%2004lhd.pdf" target="_new">http://www.icbl.org/content/download/11494/255786/file/ICBL%20Bangladesh%20Rafique.23%20Aug%2004lhd.pdf</a></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jody Williams Letter to Prime Minister Khaleda Zia: <a href="http://www.icbl.org/content/download/11493/255783/file/Jody%20Rafique%20Letter.pdf" target="_new">http://www.icbl.org/content/download/11493/255783/file/Jody%20Rafique%20Letter.pdf</a></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Landmine Monitor Report on Bangladesh: <a href="http://www.icbl.org/lm/2003/bangladesh.html" target="_new">http://www.icbl.org/lm/2003/bangladesh.html</a></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
