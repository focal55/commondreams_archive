<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON &#150; October 19 -  All but five House Republicans vying for re-election this November have received more than $2 million from House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, according to new data released today by the Campaign for America&#146;s Future. Rep. DeLay recently received a series of reprimands by the House Ethics Committee, raising serious questions about his use of bribery and unethical tactics in the U.S. House and prompting calls for his ouster.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The analysis, based on Oct. 4 data from the Federal Election Commission and analyzed by the Center for Responsive Politics, shows that 241 current members of the House and Senate received $2,135,802 from Rep. DeLay&#146;s political action committee, Americans for a Republican Majority, since it was formed in 1994. More than $1 million of the $2.1 million was donated in this election cycle.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The top recipients of Rep. DeLay&#146;s contributions are Rep. Mike Ferguson, R-N.J., Rep. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., Rep. Robin Hayes, R-N.C., Rep. Heather Wilson, R-N.M., Rep. Mike Rodgers, R-Mich., Rep. Anne Northrup, R-Ky. and  Rep. Jim Ryun, R-Kan., who all accepted more than $30,000 from the PAC.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Campaign for America&#146;s Future Co-director Robert Borosage called on House Republicans to return the campaign contributions in question and urged all elected officials to take a stand before the election on the series of ethics charges leveled against Rep. DeLay.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Tom DeLay is the kingpin of the most corrupt Congress in recent history,&#148; said Borosage. &#147;DeLay has a long record of working in the shadows. Taking money from DeLay compromises the integrity of every elected official who supports his dark tactics. Everyone who has taken Tom DeLay&#146;s dirty money must publicly decide if they stand with DeLay or with decency.&#148;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Campaign for America's Future has already called on House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., to oust Rep. DeLay from his leadership post following rulings from the House Ethics Committee on charges filed in June by Rep. Chris Bell, D-Texas.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The House Ethics Committee reprimanded Rep. DeLay earlier this month for, among other violations, attempting to bribe a Republican colleague to change his vote on President Bush&#146;s Medicare prescription drug bill.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rep. DeLay tried to force Rep. Nick Smith, R-Mich., to vote his way on the bill and threatened to work against the House candidacy of Rep. Smith&#146;s son if he refused. Rep. Smith voted against the bill and Rep. Smith&#146;s son lost his primary.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Last month, a Texas grand jury indicted three of Rep. DeLay's political associates in a case involving a political committee affiliated with the majority leader. A separate three-part complaint to the committee says Rep. DeLay also misused his office and taxpayer resources for political purposes related to elections and redistricting in Texas.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
