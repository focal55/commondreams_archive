<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - February 3 - The Children's Defense Fund today said the Bush Administration's proposed budget cuts in Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Section 8 housing program could mean as many as 150,000 families with children will be denied vouchers. The Administration's budget also effectively block grants the Section 8 program, which could lead to some of the poorest families losing assistance and other families having to spend a greater portion of their income for rent. </FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The proposed cuts and changes will disproportionately affect children. Fifty-nine percent of the 2 million households that receive Section 8 rental vouchers are families with children, making Section 8 the main source of housing assistance for low-income children. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">While the HUD budget emphasizes that &quot;ours is a compassionate mission,&quot; Assistant Secretary Michael Liu acknowledged yesterday that the Section 8 voucher program is being cut by nearly $1 billion from FY 2004 to FY 2005. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;It is unconscionable that the Bush Administration would cut Section 8 housing when already only one-fourth of low-income families eligible for rental assistance receive it,&quot; said Marian Wright Edelman, President of the Children's Defense Fund. &quot;The Administration is making it more difficult for families and children to find safe, decent, and affordable housing.&quot; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Bush Administration's budget also calls for making tax cuts permanent, which would give each individual millionaire an average of approximately $181,700 each year when fully implemented, according to estimates last year by the Brookings Institution. That amount of money could provide affordable housing for 21 low-income families each year.</FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
