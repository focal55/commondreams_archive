</b></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON, October 14 - The following is being issued by Diplomats and Military Commanders for Change:

</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHAT: 10/15 Speech by Mary Ann Wright, former US diplomat, at Arkansas State University, Jonesboro; 10/17 Speech in Little Rock

</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHO: Ann Wright was a US Foreign Service Officer from 1987 until 2003, when she resigned in protest over the Iraq war. In 1997, Wright managed the evacuation of the U.S. embassy in Sierra Leone and of Americans living there when a coup d'etat took place, and later she was given the State Department Award for Heroism for her work. In December 2001, Wright helped reopen the U.S. embassy in Kabul, Afghanistan. Prior to joining the Foreign Service, Ms. Wright began her service in the U.S. Army/Army Reserves, attaining the rank of colonel during 26 years of military service. Ms. Wright is originally from Bentonville, Arkansas and graduated from the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville. She now lives in Honolulu.

</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHEN: Friday, Oct 15, 3:30pm in Room 157, ASU Museum, Jonesboro; Sunday, Oct 17, 1pm, First Presbyterian Church, 800 Scott St, Little Rock.

</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BACKGROUND:

</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In March 2003, Ann Wright sent a letter of resignation to Secretary of State Colin Powell, telling him that "this is the only time in my many years serving America that I have felt I cannot represent the policies of an administration of the United States."

</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"There is no doubt Saddam Hussein is a despicable dictator," Wright told Powell. But, "In our press for military action now, we have created deep chasms in the international community and in important international organizations."

</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Wright belongs to Diplomats and Military Commanders for Change, which is sponsoring her visit to Arkansas. DMCC is a coalition of 27 career chiefs of mission and retired four-star military leaders, including Republicans as well as Democrats, who believe the Bush Administration has made America less safe. Many of them served under President Reagan and President George H.W. Bush.</font>
