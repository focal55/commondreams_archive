<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - July 16 - TV preacher Jerry Falwell has used his Jerry Falwell Ministries to endorse President George W. Bush's re-election in apparent violation of federal tax law, Americans United for Separation of Church and State has told the Internal Revenue Service.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In a complaint to the federal tax agency, Americans United told the IRS that Falwell endorsed Bush in a July 1 e-mail to supporters and also urged followers to send money to a political action committee that supports Republican candidates. Falwell also posted the partisan election-year appeal on his ministry website.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Rev. Barry W. Lynn, Americans United executive director, said Falwell's action clearly merits an IRS investigation.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Falwell is thumbing his nose at the IRS,&quot; Lynn said. &quot;He must not be permitted to use a tax-exempt ministry to engage in partisan politics. The vast majority of America's religious institutions play by the rules. He should too.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Falwell, in his &quot;Falwell Confidential&quot; bulletin, wrote, &quot;For conservative people of faith, voting for principle this year means voting for the re-election of George W. Bush.  The alternative, in my mind, is simply unthinkable. To the pro-life, pro-family, pro-traditional marriage, pro-America voters in this nation, we must determine that President Bush is the man with our interests at heart.  It is that simple.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Falwell continued, &quot;However, simply voting may not be enough.  I believe it is the responsibility of every political conservative, every evangelical Christian, every pro-life Catholic, every traditional Jew, every Reagan Democrat, and everyone in between to get serious about re-electing President Bush. That is why I am utilizing this column to urge you to support the Campaign for Working Families, which is headed by Gary Bauer.  It is the organization that I believe can have the greatest impact in re-electing Mr. Bush to the Oval Office.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The message was sent out under the auspices of Jerry Falwell Ministries and included a direct weblink to the donation page of the Campaign for Working Families, a Republican-oriented PAC founded by former Republican presidential candidate Gary Bauer.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Lynn, in his July 15 complaint to the IRS, charged that Falwell seems to have clearly violated federal law barring tax-exempt groups from partisan politicking.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Falwell is using his ministry to urge the election of George W. Bush and other candidates and to implore supporters to make contributions to a PAC whose purpose is to secure the election of Bush and other candidates,&quot; Lynn wrote in the IRS letter. &quot;I believe this is intervention in a political campaign on behalf of a candidate in clear violation of federal tax law. I urge you to take appropriate action to correct this abuse of the law.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Lynn noted that the IRS in 1993 retroactively revoked the tax-exempt status of Falwell's television ministry, the Old Time Gospel Hour, for the years 1986 and 1987 after determining that the group had improperly channeled funds into a PAC supporting congressional candidates. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Falwell is apparently still smarting from that action. On CNBC's &quot;Capital Report&quot; July 2, AU's Lynn reminded Falwell of his run-in with the IRS. Falwell denied it had ever happened.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Never,&quot; Falwell shouted. &quot;Never. Never. Not one minute. Not one second. You are wrong.... Never one second did we lose our tax exemption.&quot; He later added, &quot;You are telling a lie right now, Barry.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In fact, the revocation of the Old Time Gospel Hour's tax-exempt status is a matter of public record. On April 7, 1993, The New York Times reported that the IRS in February of that year revoked the Old Time Gospel Hour's tax-free status retroactively for two years for diverting assets and personnel to a political action committee. Falwell also had to pay $50,000 in back taxes. The federal agency required the ministry to issue a public statement signed by Falwell reporting the settlement.</FONT></P><P></P><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
