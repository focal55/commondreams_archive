<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - July 23 - Statement of Carl Pope, Executive Director of Sierra Club</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The Sierra Club strongly supports Congressmen Dingell, Markey, and Waxman's Resolution of Inquiry requesting Vice President Cheney to release the names of participants in the Bush Administration's Energy Task Force.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The Bush Administration's obsession with secrecy has already led to a polluting energy policy that would harm Americans' health, safety and the places they treasure. They have continued to fight efforts in the courts to disclose the names of meeting participants in developing their policy. The Sierra Club urges Congress to send a strong message to the Vice President that this information should be made public.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The Bush Administration has consistently demonstrated a pattern of shutting the public out, ignoring public comments, and instead favoring corporate campaign contributors.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;It's no secret that President Bush and Vice President Cheney have close ties to the energy industry. And it's no secret that the energy industries would benefit greatly from the Administration's policies.. What is unknown is the level of influence these executives had over America's energy future. The public has a right to know.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;We thank these three Congressmen for their leadership on this resolution and urge the rest of Congress to support it.&quot;</FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
