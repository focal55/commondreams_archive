<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - August 10 - The Sierra Club joined conservationists across the country today in releasing a report that documents the on-the-ground impacts of the Bush administration&#146;s destructive forest policies. The report, &quot;This Land is Your Land,&quot; was written by the American Lands Alliance and released by a coalition of conservation groups. Highlighted in the report are the administration&#146;s efforts to increase commercial logging in wild, roadless forests such as the Tongass National Forest in Alaska, ancient old growth forests in the Pacific Northwest and forests across the country. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report is available at: <a href="http://www.americanlands.org/this_land_is_your_land.htm" target="_new">http://www.americanlands.org/this_land_is_your_land.htm</a></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report focuses on 18 timber sales and one gas development project that are moving forward in 13 states. Among the list of projects are several that would cause irreparable harm to old-growth forests. The report highlights places like the Zane Grey roadless area in southern Oregon and the Kaibab National Forest near the Grand Canyon in Arizona where destructive timber sales are planned under the guise of &quot;fuel reduction&quot; and &quot;fire prevention.&quot; </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Bush administration&#146;s forest policies have been skewed in favor of the timber industry at the expense of all Americans. There is a better way,&quot; said Sean Cosgrove, forest policy specialist with the Sierra Club. &quot;The Bush administration should focus on community protection and honest fuel reduction efforts, redirect logging subsidies to create restoration and fire protection jobs and halt new energy development in environmentally sensitive areas.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report comes on the heels of the Bush administration&#146;s proposal that revokes the popular Roadless Area Conservation Rule. The administration&#146;s new, convoluted process will leave America&#146;s last wild forests open to destructive commercial logging and road building. This controversial decision forces Governors to petition the Department of Agriculture to protect their wild, roadless National Forests. The comment period on the administration&#146;s proposal ends September 14, 2004. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;By revoking the landmark Roadless Rule, the Bush administration is leaving wild forests across the country vulnerable to commercial timber sales and road building,&quot; said Cosgrove.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The administration is already moving ahead with its plans for 50 timber sales in roadless areas on Alaska&#146;s Tongass National Forest, America&#146;s largest forest and the largest intact temperate rainforest in the world. This is happening despite the fact that their efforts fly in the face of public sentiment and a recent vote in Congress to eliminate wasteful subsidies for new road building on the Tongass.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cosgrove joined the American Lands Alliance, county commissioners from Oregon and New Mexico, a leader of the Nez Perce Tribe, and a recreation group at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., today to release the report. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This administration doesn&#146;t seem to consider what Tribes or local citizens want for management of the forests in their community,&quot; said Anthony D. Johnson, Chairman of the Nez Perce Tribe. &quot;For years, the Tribe has been working to repair watersheds impacted by years of logging and road building. The Tribe believes, as do many others, that healthy forests require healthy streams and good water quality. The administration&#146;s plans for logging and road building in the South Fork of the Clearwater River is contrary to the Tribe&#146;s efforts to restore a healthy forests and restore salmon habitat.&quot;</font></p><p></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
