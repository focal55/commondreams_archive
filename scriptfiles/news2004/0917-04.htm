<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - September 17 - WHAT:  	Telephone news conference at which Public Citizen, a national public interest organization, will discuss the findings of two new reports. The first, The New Stealth PACs: Tracking 501(c) Non-profit Groups Active in Elections, chronicles how 30 501(c) non-profit groups - including the AFL-CIO, United Seniors Association and U.S. Chamber of Commerce - have spent tens of millions of dollars since 2000 to influence elections without revealing the identities of their donors or how they spent their income. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The second report, Big PhRMA's Stealth PACs: How the Drug Industry Uses 501(c) Non-profit Groups to Influence Elections, details how the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), the trade association of the brand-name prescription drug industry, quietly channeled millions of dollars in 2002 into a handful of 501(c) non-profits, including several senior citizen groups, to advocate its corporate interests and message directly in election campaigns and help ensure a Congress friendly to a Medicare drug bill acceptable to PhRMA. Public Citizen also will discuss its request for the IRS to investigate 501(c) non-profits whose primary purpose appears to have been to influence elections and who have failed to fully comply with IRS disclosure requirements. Finally, Public Citizen will unveil a new Web site and database designed to monitor the activities of tax-exempt 501(c) groups seeking to influence the outcomes of elections while avoiding public scrutiny. The reports will be e-mailed to reporters at their request and will be available at <a href="http://www.stealthpacs.org">www.stealthpacs.org</a> by 9:30 a.m. (EDT) Monday.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHEN: 	11:30 a.m. (EDT), Monday, Sept. 20</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHERE: 	To participate in the news conference, reporters should dial toll-free 1-800-377-8846 at 11:30 a.m. and enter the passcode 36707396#.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHO:  	Frank Clemente, director, Public Citizen's Congress Watch, Taylor Lincoln, Congress Watch's senior researcher and primary author of the &quot;New Stealth                PACs&quot; report, Craig Holman, Congress Watch's campaign finance legislative representative</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
