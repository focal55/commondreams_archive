<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - June 23 - On the eve of the Green Party Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, a grassroots organization called &quot;Greens for Kerry&quot; (GFK) announced the launch of its national campaign to urge Greens and former Nader voters in swing states to unite with people of all political stripes to defeat Bush by voting for John Kerry. The campaign, founded by a Green Party member and former Nader campaign volunteer, has set a goal of gathering a minimum 10,000 signatures on their website (www.greensforkerry.com) pledging support for John Kerry in battleground states. GFK will focus its more intensive outreach efforts on a handful of the most competitive swing states with the highest proportion of Green Party members and former Nader voters. The 2000 Presidential election demonstrated that a few hundred votes could decide the victor. The GFK campaign seeks to provide the votes necessary to tip the election in Kerry's favor. GFK believes the best interests of the party aren't served by competing in battleground states, which might actually help swing the state in Bush's favor.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;I voted for Nader twice, and volunteered for his campaign in 2000,&quot; said Greens for Kerry founder Sarah Newman. &quot;This election is different. The Bush administration is dismantling the progress that grassroots and populist movements have achieved in the past 100 years, including women's rights, environmental protection, civil rights, and worker rights. Our message is simple: a Bush second term would have catastrophic consequences for our country, the world, and the progressive causes for which our party stands. We have an historic opportunity to participate in one of the most important political challenges of modern times: ending the Bush presidency. To do that, we must vote for Kerry in the swing states.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">An excerpt from the GFK website: &quot;The emergence of 'GREENS FOR KERRY' reflects a growing recognition of what's at stake,&quot; said syndicated columnist and author Norman Solomon. &quot;There are many things wrong with John Kerry's political positions -- yet piling up sufficient votes for Kerry on November 2 is the only practical way to rid this country and the world of the horrific Bush presidency. Let's get to work on this historic imperative! Voting Bush out means voting Kerry in.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The most likely states the campaign will target are Oregon, New Mexico, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Florida. Key outreach strategies include: collaborating with state organizations that share its goals (527s, PAC's, and student groups), coordinate/network with local Green Party and progressive activists, and participate in a tour of swing states featuring prominent progressive speakers and entertainers designed to build a progressive coalition to defeat Bush.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Greens for Kerry website is the campaign's key component, featuring comprehensive Bush and Kerry fact sheets on a broad range of issues, an interactive map of swing states with party affiliation break downs, a downloadable signs and posters page, a quotes and endorsements section of prominent progressive leaders and Green Party members, and a news article archives section, among others.</FONT></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
