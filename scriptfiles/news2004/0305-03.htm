<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - March 5 - Today&#146;s unemployment report underscores the disastrous state of our nation&#146;s jobs situation. It should be clear by now that a &#147;jobless recovery&#148; is a contradiction in terms. More than eight million Americans are officially out-of-work, nearly 400,000 more people gave up looking for work last month and millions more are underemployed. The number of long-term unemployed remains at close to two million and hopes for an imminent jobs recovery are fading fast. The 21,000 new jobs added last month are mainly temporary jobs and barely fill a gaping hole in our jobs market. The statistics clearly show that the crisis is not being addressed and our country&#146;s leaders are oblivious to the suffering of the unemployed.</FONT></p><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Job growth remains sluggish despite predictions from the Bush Administration of a rebound in the jobs market. Administration officials have stated that the market is in a transitional period as thousands of jobs move offshore. Such pronouncements do not reassure white-collar workers who are now competing for low-wage jobs at the local fast-food and discount stores. Other economic indicators, like January&#146;s rise in mass layoffs, point to a slow and painful recovery and explain why consumer confidence has fallen sharply.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">With more than 760,000 jobless workers who have exhausted their unemployment benefits, there&#146;s no excuse for President Bush and the Republicans to reject calls to extend the emergency unemployment program. And there&#146;s no excuse for the Bush Administration to take away overtime pay for America&#146;s workers and to support companies that move American jobs offshore.</FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
