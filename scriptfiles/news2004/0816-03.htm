<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - August 16 - In a letter to Denver Mayor Hickenlooper, the National Coalition Against Censorship (NCAC) and the ACLU of Colorado are protesting the removal of several works from an exhibition at Denver International Airport. City officials removed the artworks because of complaints from people who thought the pieces were disturbing and inappropriate.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to the letter, the suppression of controversial ideas by government officials violates the principle of free expression enshrined in the First Amendment. Svetlana Mintcheva, Director of NCAC's Arts Program, said, &quot;Democracy can only flourish where a free and open debate exists. It will be a sad day when fear of ideas wins and creativity is stifled&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The groups are calling on Mayor Hickenlooper and the Mayor's Office of Art, Culture, and Film, which manages the DIA art program, to return the censored work to the exhibition.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Letter:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mayor John W. Hickenlooper</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1437 Bannock Street, Ste. 350</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Denver, Colorado 80202</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Fax 720-865-8791</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">August 16, 2004</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dear Mayor Hickenlooper, </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The National Coalition Against Censorship, an alliance of 50 national non-profit organizations that collaborate to defend First Amendment rights, and the American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado, have been alerted to the recent removal of several works of art from an installation at Denver International Airport. This action has serious First Amendment implications, and we strongly urge you to reconsider.   </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">'The Luggage Project' received approval from the DIA arts program and was installed at DIA on July 7, 2004. Two days later, on July 9, three of the works in the installation were removed, apparently in response to complaints from persons who believed that the pieces were 'offensive', 'disturbing', and 'inappropriate'. According to DIA officials, the removed artworks also violated an airport policy banning art containing 'violence' or 'political statements'. The allegedly objectionable material included box cutters, red paint splatter, political bumper stickers, and toy missiles. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Official suppression of disfavored, unpopular, and controversial ideas and viewpoints is the chief evil targeted by the First Amendment.  The works in question offer artists' reflections on the theme of travel, and include personal perspectives on recent national events. That they provoked discussion and thought is their virtue, not their defect. To silence dialogue on issues which lie at the center of American society is the most destructive kind of censorship; it violates not only the principle of free speech, but also disrupts the fundamental national ideal of democratic debate. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Plainly, complaints that the works are 'offensive' triggered their removal.  In responding as it did to these complaints, the city conferred its official stamp of approval on this viewpoint, while suppressing other views about the meaning and suitability of the art.  Courts have consistently condemned government efforts to suppress particular viewpoints while permitting others to be expressed.   Even the mere appearance of viewpoint discrimination has been enough for federal courts to strike down government display restrictions.  (See AIDS Action Committee v. Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, 42 F.3d 1 (1st Cir., 1994).)</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The removal of the pieces cannot be justified as an effort to rid the airport of reminders about the events of September 11th.  This would be patently absurd.  Airports across the country are replete with reminders of terrorism and national security issues, from the presence of armed uniformed officers to increased security provisions and signs about terrorism.  Nor is the alleged policy against 'violent' and'political' content an adequate explanation.  First of all, it lacks credibility, given the murals by Leo Tanguma permanently installed in the airport.  These murals contain dead bodies, machine guns, and demonic figures, images that, by comparison, highlight the innocuousness of the splattered paint at issue in the removed works. Second, it disregards the crucial value of political speech in a democratic society.  And finally, such a general ban invites abuse, since the determination of what is 'political' or 'violent' is highly subjective.  Such unbounded discretion is inconsistent with the First Amendment.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One of the three works initially removed from the installation was subsequently restored because, according to the official responsible, it was only 'borderline offensive', a fact that demonstrates the ultimate arbitrariness of the decision. The lack of consistency and the arbitrary exercise of discretion create a chilling effect on expression.  Comparably vague standards of decision and the inevitably inconsistent enforcement they engender have persuaded federal courts to invalidate similar policies on First Amendment grounds.  (See Planned Parenthood Association v. Chicago Transit Authority, 767 F. 2d 1225 (7th Cir., 1985); Hopper v. City of Pasco, 241 F.3d 1067 (9th Cir., 2001).) </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For the above reasons, we urge you to reconsider the removal of artwork from 'The Luggage Project.' Such censorious action not only violates the principles of free expression that are enshrined in the First Amendment; it also contradicts the Denver International Airport's efforts to support the arts.  Early this year, the Los Angeles International Airport rejected similar complaints about an arts installation, and instead embraced the idea that public art should promote open dialogue, not official orthodoxy. To remain a world-class airport renowned for its architectural and aesthetic achievements, DIA should do the same.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Svetlana Mintcheva, Director, Arts Program</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">National Coalition Against Censprship</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mark Silverstein, Legal Director</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ACLU of Colorado</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CC: Denise Montgomery, Director, Mayor's Office of Art, Culture and Film</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1380 Lawrence Street, Ste. 790</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Denver, CO 80204</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Fax: 303-640-6960</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Elbra Wedgeworth, President</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">City Council </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1437 Bannock Street, Ste. 451</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Denver, Colorado 80202</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Fax: 303-298-9716</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
