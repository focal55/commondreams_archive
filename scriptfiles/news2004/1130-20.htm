<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- November 30 -- Attorneys for Green Party presidential candidate David Cobb asked a federal court today to take jurisdiction of, and ultimately dissolve, a temporary restraining order issued by a Delaware County, Ohio judge attempting to prevent Cobb from seeking a recount of the presidential ballots cast in that county.<br>            Cobb and Libertarian Michael Badnarik, who are jointly filing the recount demand, are named as defendants, along with their attorneys, in the restraining order sought by the Delaware County prosecuting attorney. The Delaware County judge issued the temporary restraining order without contacting or seeking any input from the candidates or their attorneys.<br></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">            &quot;This is an illegal and outrageous attempt to suppress our rights to participate in the democratic process.  As a candidate, I have a right under Ohio law to demand a recount.  If the Delaware County Board of Elections has a problem with that, they need to take it up with the Ohio legislature,&quot; said David Cobb.&quot;It makes you wonder if Delaware County has something to hide. Why else would they try to prevent a recount and issue an injunction without giving the candidates any notice to participate?&quot; asked Cobb-LaMarche Media Director Blair Bobier.<br></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">            Cobb and Badnarik initiated the recount demand on November 19 by sending letters and the appropriate bond to each of the election directors of Ohio's 88 counties, requesting a hand count of the votes in every precinct in every county in the state.  The total cost of the bond, based on the number of precincts in which a recount is demanded, is $113,600.             Support for a recount in Ohio is growing on a daily basis.  On Sunday, the Reverend Jesse Jackson held a press conference and rally at a Columbus church and announced his support.            The Cobb-LaMarche campaign is now in the process of recruiting volunteers and raising funds for monitoring the actual recount process. <br>Volunteers and donors should visit the campaign website, <a href="http://www.votecobb.org/" target="_new">http://www.votecobb.org</a>, for more information.
