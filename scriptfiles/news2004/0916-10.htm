<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - September 16 - On Saturday, Sept. 18, over a half a million people around the world will volunteer their time for the International Coastal Cleanup (ICC). These dedicated volunteers will clear beaches and waterways of trash that pollutes our waters, harms marine life, hampers tourism, and poses health risks for beach-goers. Last year, almost half a million volunteers combed over 16,000 miles of beaches, rivers, and lakes, above and below the water line, hauling in over 7.5 million pounds of trash. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The number of volunteers grows each year as people realize the scope of the marine debris problem and decide to become a part of the solution by taking action in their communities,&quot; said Roger Rufe, president of The Ocean Conservancy. &quot;All of the debris that our volunteers find comes from one common source- people. It is critical that we take personal responsibility year-round and make sure that the debris never enters the waterway to begin with.&quot; </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To date, people in 127 countries and all 55 U.S. states and territories have participated in the Cleanup, helping to rid their shorelines, oceans, rivers, lakes, and other waterways of tons of marine debris. But volunteers do more than just pick up trash; they also record information about the debris they collect on detailed data cards. &quot;The data cards are compiled, analyzed, and tracked year by year, revealing patterns in marine debris in a region or country,&quot; said Seba Sheavly, director of The Ocean Conservancy's Office of Pollution Prevention and Monitoring. &quot;Over the years, this information has helped influence public policy and prompted legislation.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Debris is more than just an eyesore. Each piece of debris that enters the ocean or waterway has the potential to harm wildlife, damage habitats and threaten human health and safety. Data from the 2003 Cleanup gives an idea of the hazards: </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">More than 1.9 million cigarettes and cigarette filters </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">986,455 bags and food wrappers </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">131,197 pieces of rope </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">53,243 pieces of fishing line </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">29,967 pieces of fishing nets </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">66,532 balloons </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">36,236 six-pack rings</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">8,282 syringes </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sea turtles often mistake plastic bags for jellyfish, one of their favorite foods. Fishing line or other debris that wraps around fins or flippers can cause circulation loss and eventual amputation as an animal grows, or worse -- strangulation. &quot;Some may think that a bit of trash thrown into the water isn't a big deal, but even a small amount of trash can mean life or death to sea turtles, birds, and fish,&quot; said Rufe. Such debris can cause problems for beach visitors, as well. &quot;Debris such as discarded hooks or broken glass can also seriously injure barefooted beachgoers,&quot; he added.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The ICC's success is dependent upon the Cleanup Coordinators and volunteers who participate each year. &quot;The ICC relies on our volunteers to make the cleanup a success every year,&quot; said Rufe. &quot;Our coordinators around the world have a love for the oceans, a sense of stewardship, and a desire to protect our marine ecosystems.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>EDITORS NOTE:</b></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Call for a press kit or download one from our website at: <a href="http://www.coastalcleanup.org" target="_new">http://www.coastalcleanup.org</a> </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For more information, or to find the nearest cleanup, call: 800-262-BEACH (U.S. only)</font></p><p></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
