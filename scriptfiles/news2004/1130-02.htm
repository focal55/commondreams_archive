''We are giving the 'adoptive parent' the opportunity to rescue a recording by sponsoring the special preservation processing, including, digital media transfer, and sound restoration.''</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For a $250.00 donation the Pacifica Radio Archives will inscribe donators name on all copies of the program, including the one housed in the Archives, and will send them a CD or tape once restoration is complete.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">List of Adoptable Tapes can be found at: <a href="http://pacificaradioarchives.org/donate/adopt.php" target="_new">http://pacificaradioarchives.org/donate/adopt.php</a></font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SPECIAL BROADCAST AND ARCHIVES BACKGROUND: The broadcast will highlight the rich and historic collection of 50,000 tapes that is in danger of deterioration. Considered by many historians and scholars to be one of the most important audio collections in the world, thousands of tapes in the Los Angeles-based Pacifica Radio Archives are in danger of permanent damage caused by aging. Internationally recognized sound preservation experts have advised Pacifica to conduct an immediate review of the endangered tapes and to transfer them to new mediums, such as digital audio.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">''The Pacifica Archives are a national treasure.'' said Amy Goodman, host of Pacifica Network's Democracy Now! and author of the national bestseller, The Exception to the Rulers, ''a vast narrative of the grassroots, social justice struggles that have made this country what it is.''</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">''We are excited to share the incredible audio we have with the Pacifica audience,'' said De Shazor. ''The archives is the recorded history of the major social movements of the last half of the 20th century and must be preserved and accessible for researchers, scholars and the general public.''</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Pacifica Radio Archives (PRA), established in 1971, began as a repository for programs of exceptional historic value. The Archive also preserved programs for rebroadcast by other stations, or for use as source material for radio producers, scholars, and others. The archives houses close to 50,000 programs, dating from the 1950s through the present day. Many of these tapes are extremely rare and have seldom been heard by the general public. PRA began digitizing recordings and re-mastering or restoring the material in 1999. Since then, Pacifica has restored hundreds of historical recordings initiated by partner projects or guided by listener requests.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pacifica Radio&#146;s founder Lewis Hill's mission was to create a new kind of radio, supported by listeners, owing nothing to sponsors, providing an outlet for creative expression, and a safe haven for artistic experiments with the medium. Launched in 1949 with KPFA-FM in Berkeley, Calif., the network added stations in Los Angeles, New York, Houston and Washington, D.C over the next 28 years. Perhaps best known as a chronicler of social justice movements and cultural change, Pacifica stations have consistently embraced the performing and literary arts, and provided a stage to experiment with radio drama, spoken word, and the radio documentary.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To Listen to Clips from Upcoming Special Broadcast or View Broadcast Schedule for December 2, 2004 go to: <a href="http://pacificaradioarchives.org/funddrive/%20" target="_New">http://pacificaradioarchives.org/funddrive/    </a><br></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
