<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">RESTON, VA - Febraury 18 - The American Medical Student Association (AMSA), the nation's largest, independent medical student organization, praises Massachusetts's doctors for favoring a single-payer healthcare system. A survey of 904 physicians, published in this week's Archives of Internal Medicine, reported that 63.5 percent of Mass. physicians believe that a single-payer healthcare system would provide the best care for the most people. Also among the findings, a majority said they would be willing to accept a 10 percent cut in fees in return for less paperwork. &quot;It is commendable that the majority of doctors in Massachusetts favor a single-payer system and that most if not all of doctors are frustrated with the managed care system and would like to see it changed,&quot; says Lauren Oshman, M.D., M.P.H., AMSA National President. &quot;This survey shows the tremendous movement that has been made towards acceptance of a universal healthcare system. AMSA has built momentum for universal health care through opportunities for medical students to get involved on both national and grassroots levels.&quot; </FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">This week is Health Care Justice Week, an opportunity to mobilize thousands of medical students to lobby Congress on the Health Care Access Resolution (HCAR) (H.Con.Res 99/S.Con.Res. 41), which calls for Congress to enact health care reform that will provide &quot;access to comprehensive health services for all Americans by 2005.&quot; In the 107th Congress, there were 96 co-sponsors of the House version of HCAR. AMSA hopes to secure 100 cosponsors by the end of the month and 150 by May, the end of the school year. To become involved in Health Care Justice Week, AMSA has provided materials to meet students' needs; fact sheet, talking points and an action guide that details how to set up meetings with local representatives. For over fifty years, AMSA has advocated on behalf of universal health care, both on a federal and state level.
