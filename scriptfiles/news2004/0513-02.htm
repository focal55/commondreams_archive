<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - May 13 - Democratic Presidential candidate John Kerry released the following statement today in response to a new report focusing on the uninsured and emergency room care by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation: </FONT></p><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;The study released by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation today confirms what millions of Americans across this country already know &#150; skyrocketing health care costs are straining families&#146; budgets, overwhelming our emergency rooms and jeopardizing Americans&#146; health.  </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;Our health care system is broken. I&#146;ve spent the last four days on the campaign trail talking to families, small businesses owners and veterans about our health care crisis. Everywhere I&#146;ve been, I&#146;ve heard the same stories of families struggling to keep up with rising costs. Americans shouldn&#146;t have to rely on emergency rooms for basic health care services because they can&#146;t afford a regular doctor.  This country needs a President who will address the impending health care crisis &#150; instead of turning his back as premiums go through the roof.  George Bush has offered no real solution to the rising health care costs &#150; all while he takes millions of dollars from insurance and drug companies.  As president, I will build a stronger America by addressing rising health care costs and ensuring access to affordable, quality and reliable coverage for all Americans.&#148;</FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
