<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - October 10 - <a href="http://www.mediamatters.org" target="_new">Media Matters for America</a> CEO and President David Brock has written a letter to Sinclair Broadcasting asking the company to cancel its reported plans to force its stations to air the anti-Kerry attack film, "Stolen Honor: Wound That Never Heal," between now and the Nov. 2 presidential election.

<p>"Sinclair's plan to air anti-Kerry propaganda before the election is an abuse of the public airwaves for what appears to be partisan political purposes," Brock says. In his letter, Brock warned Sinclair that the plan could constitute a violation of broadcast regulations requiring equal time for political candidates as well as the McCain-Feingold campaign finance law. He branded a "charade" the notion that the film could be classified as "news" as a way of getting around those restrictions.

<p>According to the Los Angeles Times, "Stolen Honor" features former POWs accusing Kerry of "worsening their ordeal by prolonging the war." The Times reported that the maker of the film, former Washington Times reporter Carlton Sherwood, tells viewers on the film's website, "Intended or not, Lt. Kerry painted a depraved portrait of Vietnam veterans, literally creating the images of those who served in combat as deranged, drug-addicted psychopaths, baby killers" that has endured for 30 years.

<p>In his letter, Brock wrote, "I don't have to remind you... (that) fourteen of the 62 stations the company either owns or programs are in the key political swing stations of Ohio, Florida, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, where the presidential election is being closely fought."

</p>
<p>In the 2004 political cycle, according to the Times, Sinclair executives have given nearly $68,000 in political contributions, 97 percent of it going to Republicans. The Center for Responsive Politics ranks Sinclair 12th among top radio and TV station group contributors.</p>
