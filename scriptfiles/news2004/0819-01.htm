<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - August 18 - BUSH&#146;S BRAIN, the acclaimed feature film documentary that introduces the country to Karl Rove, the man known as &#147;Bush&#146;s Brain&#148;, the most powerful political figure America has never heard of, will open in 12 major cities beginning on August 20th in Dallas, Houston and San Antonio, Texas.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The film, detailing the Wizard of Oz behind the curtain of today&#146;s Presidential politics, will subsequently open in Austin, New York City, Washington, Los Angeles, Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, Chicago and Milwaukee. Release dates in more cities are expected as well. The full release schedule is below. The film, directed and produced by Joseph Mealey and Michael Paradies Shoob, is based on the best-selling book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0471423270/commondreams-20/ref=nosim/" target="_new">BUSH&#146;S BRAIN</a> (Wiley, 2003) by journalists James Moore and Wayne Slater.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Karl Rove is President George W. Bush&#146;s closest adviser. He is a brilliant tactician and a ruthless political opponent who has almost single-handedly shaped the policies of our nation. The relationship between Karl Rove and President George W. Bush is one of the most unique political marriages in history. Feared and admired by Republicans and Democrats alike, Rove has raised a new and disturbing question for Americans: &#145;Who really runs the country?&#146;</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dubbed &#147;the man with the plan&#148; by &#147;Dubya&#148; himself, Karl Rove boldly conceived and ruthlessly shaped the political career of our current President to a degree never before seen in America. And he continues to be a guiding force within the current Bush White House. His influence marks a transcendent moment in American politics: the rise of a political consultant to a position of unprecedented power.  </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BUSH&#146;S BRAIN explores Rove&#146;s remarkable political journey and the extraordinary role he has played in George Bush&#146;s rise to the top. From his masterful political skills, to the secret machinations he has carefully orchestrated, to his dramatic influence on foreign policy, the fingerprints of Karl Rove can be found throughout the political process.  How will Karl Rove manage to retain George W. Bush&#146;s wartime stature through to the next election? Is he perhaps &#147;Co-President&#148; of the United States?  </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The film BUSH&#146;S BRAIN explores the theme of winning and losing and the twenty-first century obsession with not simply defeating our opponents, but destroying them, so that no one is left standing on the field of battle.  But, most significantly, investigates the idea of &#147;Who really has won and lost?&#148; in Karl Rove&#146;s rise to political power. To do that, the filmmakers thoroughly look at the many lives he has touched. And changed forever.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BUSH&#146;S BRAIN features interviews with those who covered, worked alongside and have opposed Rove, and whose lives have been altered by him including Slater and Moore, Molly Ivins, Glen Smith, Richard Leiby, Joe C. Wilson, Max Cleland, and more. </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With original music by Michelle Shocked and a haunting score by composer David Friedman, BUSH&#146;S BRAIN is a thought-provoking film designed to inspire debate and scrutiny about the true cost of winning and provide a glimpse of the inner workings of the current administration&#146;s most savvy player</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Currently preview copies of BUSH&#146;S BRAIN are available at <a href="http://www.bushsbrain.com/" target="_new">www.BushsBrain.com</a>. </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Come meet the man behind the curtain.
