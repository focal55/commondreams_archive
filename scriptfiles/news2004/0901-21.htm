<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- New Analysis Finds U.S. Could Tap Into Massive Economic and Environmental Potential of Renewable Energy.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A national renewable energy standard (RES) of 20 percent by 2020 would save families and businesses $49 billion in lower electricity and gas bills, according to a new study released today by the Union of Concerned Scientists. More than 355,000 jobs would be created if the United States obtained 20 percent of its electricity from wind, solar and other renewable energy sources. This total is nearly double the number of jobs from generating the same amount of electricity from fossil fuels. A national RES would also provide new income from capital investment and direct payments to rural communities. An RES can reduce America's increasing dependence on importing natural gas from the Middle East and former Soviet states. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Renewable energy can create good jobs and save consumers money while reducing our growing dependence on energy imports from politically unstable regions around the world,&quot; said Alan Nogee, Clean Energy program director at the Union of Concerned Scientists. &quot;It is time our elected officials free us from being hostage to energy resources of the 19th century, and switch to advanced clean energy technologies. The technologies are ready. All it takes is the political will.&quot;  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A 20 percent renewable standard would also save consumers more than $35 billion on their electricity bills through 2020, and another $14 billion in lower natural gas bills. Renewables achieve these savings primarily by reducing the demand for, and the price of, natural gas.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The analysis found 20 percent renewable electricity by 2020 would boost the U.S. economy with benefits such as: . A net gain of more than 157,000 new jobs in manufacturing, construction, operation, maintenance, and other industries . $73 billion in capital investment . $16 billion in income to farmers, ranchers, and rural landowners for biomass energy supplies and wind power land leases . $5 billion in property tax revenues for rural communities</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Renewable energy provides economic benefits without producing the harmful pollution generated by coal-fired power plants,&quot; said Steve Clemmer, Energy Research Director with the Union of Concerned Scientists. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Instead of losing almost 80,000 jobs from chemical companies moving plants overseas to escape high natural gas prices, the U.S. could be creating highly skilled renewable energy jobs,&quot; said Clemmer. &quot;Installing and operating wind turbines and solar panels and growing energy crops are jobs that cannot be outsourced.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">U.S. power plant carbon dioxide emissions-a major contributor to global warming-would be also 15% lower in 2025 under a national renewable electricity standard of 20%. The same policy would reduce other pollutants from burning fossil fuels such as nitrogen oxides that produce smog and mercury that harm human health. </font></p>
