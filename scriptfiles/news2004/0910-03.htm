<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - September 10 - &quot;Michigan Republicans turned in 45,000 of the 50,500 petition signatures on behalf of Nader for a ballot spot.&quot;-- Detroit Free Press, Sept. 4, 2004</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We have not been accepting signatures obtained through organized Republican Party efforts in the three or four states where we have learned of such activity.&quot;-- Op-ed article by Ralph Nader in the Washington Post, Sept. 5, 2004</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Michigan Court of Appeals ruled Friday [Sept. 3] that Nader qualified to be on the ballot as an independent, despite Democratic objections that 45,000 of the 50,000 signatures turned in on Nader's behalf were collected by the Michigan Republican Party. Nader had wanted to be on the Michigan ballot as the Reform Party candidate, but a federal judge ruled last week that Secretary of State Terri Lynn Land was allowed to keep him from getting that designation. Two feuding groups claim to be the legitimate Reform Party representative in Michigan.&quot;-- Associated Press, Sept. 8, 2004</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Nader is aware of the tremendous amount of support he has received from conservatives, but despite public announcements that these conservatives have no intention of voting for him, Nader refused to invalidate the signatures or return the money. He has previously denounced Democrats for being beholden to special interests, but has accepted support from people who openly disagree with his platform on issues concerning tax cuts, Social Security and civil rights. He certainly has a right to be on the ballot, but his road onto it is mired in hypocrisy.&quot;-- Staff editorial, Michigan Daily (University of Michigan), Sept. 8, 2004</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Michigan Daily's editorial page editor, Jason Pesick, can be contacted at:<a href="mailto:jzpesick@umich.edu"> jzpesick@umich.edu</a></font></p><p></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
