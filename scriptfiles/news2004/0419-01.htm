<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - April 17 - As President Bush today called upon Congress to renew the controversial Patriot Act, Democratic presidential candidate Dennis Kucinich said, &quot;It's time for the Democratic Party to take a strong stand and call for the repeal of the Patriot Act.&quot;</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Kucinich, campaigning in Oregon in advance of that state's May 18 primary election, said that he is making the repeal of the Patriot Act one of the principal issues he intends to press with the leadership of the Democratic Party for inclusion in the Party's platform.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;It's time for our Party to show some backbone.  It's time to stand for the repeal of the Patriot Act. As a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, I spoke against it, I voted against it, and I introduced legislation for its repeal,&quot; said the Ohio Congressman. &quot;In campaigning across America, it's unmistakably clear that there is an almost universal rejection of the Patriot Act.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Democrats can strengthen the Party's commitment to basic civil liberties by standing for the repeal of the Patriot Act and by blocking the government's attempt to continue pursuing a policy of unreasonable search and seizure, of snooping into the private lives of our citizens, and of violating our Constitutional rights and freedoms.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Kucinich concluded:  &quot;The Patriot Act was passed in a climate of fear. Fear and democracy are inconsistent. It is wrong for the United States government to ask our citizens to defend our country and then to ignore and violate the very rights we are called upon to defend.&quot;</FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
