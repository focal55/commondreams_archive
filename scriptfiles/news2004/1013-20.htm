<p><b>What</b>: Energy Independence Day. On October 19th, tens of thousands of young voters will sign a Declaration of Independence calling on candidates and institutional leaders to lay out their plan for a complete transition beyond dirty energy sources such as oil, coal, nuclear, gas and incineration. The Declaration signings will occur as part of a North American Day of Action with hundreds of campus actions and major demonstrations in seven cities to declare freedom from oil, support clean energy, fight environmental racism and stop global warming. 

<p><b>Where</b>: Actions planned for October 19th include:
Philadelphia, PA – Declaration of Independence from Dirty Energy: Youth Present Declaration at the Liberty Bell (Independence Hall/ Constitution Center)
Dearborn, MI – Freedom From Oil: Citizens and Students Demand Separation of Oil and Auto (Ford Headquarters) 
Seattle, WA – Good Jobs and Clean Energy Go Hand in Hand: Students and Labor Rally at University of Washington to Demand Clean Energy Jobs (Denny Park) 
Long Beach, CA – California Go Solar: Students Call on Largest U.S. University System to Embrace Clean Energy (Office of Cal State Chancellor, Charles Reed) 
Middlebury, VT – 63 Years of Pollution-Free Energy: Vermont Students Celebrate the Birth of U.S. Wind Power (Middlebury College) 
New Haven, CT – Call For Leadership: Yale Students Urge Candidates to Adopt Platform (Sterling Library, Yale University) 
Near Flagstaff, AZ – Freedom from Coal: Hopi and Navajo Rally for Environmental Justice from Peabody Coal

<p><b>When</b>: Tuesday, October 19, 2004 

<p><b>Who</b>: Energy Action - a coalition of the following organizations: California Student Sustainability Coalition, Climate Campaign, Energy Justice Network, EnviroCitizen, Free The Planet!, Global Exchange, Greenpeace, National Association of Environmental Law Societies, National Wildlife Federation's Campus Ecology Program, Rainforest Action Network, Student Environmental Action Coalition, Sierra Student Coalition, Sierra Youth Coalition, Southeast Climate Network, Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, Students United for a Responsible Global Environment.

<p><b>Why</b>: In this election season, candidates from all parties are targeting young people as a pivotal voting bloc. A recent MTV/CIRCLE poll showed that an unprecedented 80 percent of youth under 30 said they definitely planned to vote Nov. 2. On October 19th, thousands of young voters will make it clear that the most important issue to them is ending U.S. reliance on dirty energy, which is connected to war, economic instability, health problems, corporate power, environmental degradation, and global warming.
