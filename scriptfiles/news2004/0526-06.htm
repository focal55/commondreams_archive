<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - May 25 - WeCount.org and Media-Screen Market Research announced today the launch of the &quot;Tell Kerry What You Think!&quot; survey giving voters an opportunity to voice whether Sen. John Kerry represents their views on key issues, and if not, what he could do differently to gain their support. An inspiring example of digital democracy, &quot;Tell Kerry What You Think!&quot; is an independent, non-partisan effort giving ordinary Americans a chance to influence the political agenda. </FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Kerry's positions on issues including the War in Iraq, the USA PATRIOT Act, healthcare, environment, education, globalization and the U.S. economy are compared with those of survey participants. Also addressed in the survey is Kerry's need to build formal partnerships with other political leaders and constituents to attract a broad spectrum of voters in order to defeat President George W. Bush in November. Would voters be more enthused by John Kerry if his administration included leaders like Sen. John Edwards, Howard Dean, Ralph Nader, Wesley Clark, Rep. Dennis Kucinich or Republican Sen. John McCain? This question and many others will be answered when the survey is completed in coming weeks. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Tell Kerry What You Think!&quot; marks WeCount.org's second phase in it's &quot;Coalition for America 2004&quot; project which began with an online petition urging Democrats, Greens, moderate Republicans and independents to form a coalition to defeat Bush in November. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The final survey results will be immediately presented to John Kerry's campaign and other political leaders and organizations. WeCount.org is actively seeking partners to expand the survey's footprint to include a large sample of swing state respondents.
