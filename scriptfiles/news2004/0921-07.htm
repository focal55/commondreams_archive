<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - September 21 - Statement of Equality California Executive Director Geoffrey Kors on Evangelist Jimmy Swaggart Threatening to Kill Gays:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Equality California is outraged by Evangelist Jimmy Swaggart's televised statement made while he was stating his opposition to same-sex marriage that he will kill gay men if they look at him &quot;like that&quot;.  This statement was met by applause by Swaggart's fans. These are no doubt some of the very people who are mounting a campaign against SB 1234, the California's Omnibus Hate Crimes Bill by Senator Kuehl that is awaiting action by Governor Schwarzenegger.  It is time for the politics of hate to stop.  Equality California urges Governor Schwarzenegger to continue to stand up to extremists who oppose equality and advocate violence by signing the hate crimes bill and sending a message that hate violence will not be tolerated in California.&quot;</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
