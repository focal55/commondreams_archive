<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - September 15 - It has been almost ten years since President Clinton sent U.S. troops to quell fighting in Bosnia, and we're still there &#151; working to preserve the peace. But in small ways peace is taking root.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Davorin Brdanovic is director of the American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) Community Gardens Program in Bosnia and Herzegovina. There he plants the seeds that help Bosnian, Serb, Croat, Roma community residents heal the wounds of war.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Davor, as he prefers to be called, was born in Sarajevo. During the war (1991-1995) he was wounded near the heart three times &#151; and survived.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During that time the city of Sarajevo ran out of virtually everything. That&#146;s when people like Davor discovered they had an instinct for survival and the ability to find the herbs and grasses and roots from which they could be nourished. He learned how to scrounge food from the earth, what grasses and roots were edible, how to grow tomatoes instead of geraniums. That&#146;s when he started to appreciate gardens.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After the war, the American Friends Service Committee came to Sarajevo with relief supplies, and helped local people start a community garden, where they could grow food, regain their self-respect, and begin the reconciliation process.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Davor eventually became director of the AFSC program. When people in the local community started gardening, Davor said, &#147;they introduced themselves with their name and nationality &#150; Bosnian, Serb, Croat, Roma &#150; but after a couple of weeks they introduced themselves by name and identified themselves as &#145;gardeners&#146;.&#148; </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The first year there was one garden. Davor started more gardens, in different locations. Now there are 13 gardens throughout Bosnia including one for disabled people, one for women from Srebenica, all survivors of violence and rape; and one inside a prison.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Davor is in the United States in preparation for the American Community Gardening Association (ACGA) Conference in Toronto, Ontario from October 1 - 3. Accompanying Davor to the ACGA Conference will be Vanja Mijovic, an agronomist in the program. Davor and Vanja will be in the U.S. Thursday, September 16 - 29, before leaving for Toronto.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Additional information on the AFSC Community Gardens Project can be found at <a href="http://www.afsc.org/europe/bosnia.htm" target="_new">http://www.afsc.org/europe/bosnia.htm</a>.</font></p><p></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
