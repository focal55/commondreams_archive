<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - July 15 - While politicians convene in Boston and New York this summer, family members of 9/11 victims will make a dramatic statement of solidarity with victims of terrorism, violence and war from around the world.  From July 25 through September 2, they will walk from Boston to New York, pulling a 1400-pound granite memorial honoring the &#147;Unknown Civilians Killed in War.&#148; </FONT></p><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">               The walk is sponsored by September 11th Families for Peaceful Tomorrows, a group of more than 130 family members of 9/11 victims, in conjunction with The Peace Abbey, a multi-faith retreat center. Through this walk, and through speaking events in dozens of communities along the way, they will bear witness to the tragic reality that civilian casualties constituted 80% of the deaths in war in the 20th century, and ask that this human toll be a prime consideration in future policymaking decisions. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> The Boston-to-New York walk also will acknowledge the tragedy that linked those two cities on September 11th, 2001, symbolically remaking that connection with a message of peace and a memorial to all of those who died that day. The memorial&#146;s journey will be made solely by human effort, using no animals or machinery, demonstrating the power of individuals to &#147;move mountains&#148; for the cause of peace. </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Peaceful Tomorrows will invite families and friends of those touched by violence, veterans and their families, and members of communities along the way to participate in pulling the memorial stone (mounted on a specially-designed caisson) or simply joining the walk for an hour, a day, or more. In keeping with its nonpartisan mission, the group will ask all who participate to leave political signs and slogans at home, keeping their focus on the human costs of war, which transcend politics, nationality or religious affiliation. </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In speaking events and public forums along the way, members of Peaceful Tomorrows and guests will:</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&middot;         Remember and honor those who have died as a result of terrorism and war</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&middot;         Bring civilian casualties to the forefront of public perception and discussion</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&middot;         Connect the issue of US civilian casualties with those of others around the world.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&middot;         Call on all political candidates to consider the human costs of war in policymaking decisions</FONT></P><P> </P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The memorial stone originated with The Peace Abbey in Sherborn, Massachusetts.  It was the centerpiece of an earlier Stonewalk in 1999, when it journeyed from Massachusetts to Arlington National Cemetery in a call for recognizing civilian casualties alongside their military counterparts. </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">      Nominated for the 2003 Nobel Peace Prize, September 11th Families for Peaceful Tomorrows represents more than 130 family members of 9/11 victims and thousands of supporters around the world.  Since the group&#146;s founding in February, 2002, its members have made contact with a host of other civilian victims of terrorism and war, including victims of the cycles of violence in Israel and Palestine; family members of victims of the nightclub bombing in Bali and the train bombings in Madrid; family members of those killed in Oklahoma City; survivors of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki; those who survived the bombing of Guernica, Spain and Dresden, Germany; those affected by terrorism in Kenya, Cambodia, Chechnya, South Africa, Northern Ireland, Bosnia, Sri Lanka and elsewhere, and those wrongly impacted by bias crimes, deportation or imprisonment as a result of the &#147;war on terror.&#148; </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;Terrorism and war are already defining the 21st century,&#148; said Peaceful Tomorrows&#146; Co-Director David Potorti. &#147;With public attention focused on both the Democratic and Republican National Conventions this summer, there is no better time for Americans to consider and to call for sensible, effective political policies which place a priority on principles of democracy and human rights.  We are honored to join with the Peace Abbey in recognizing and honoring the human cost of war, and in exploring new directions for our nation, and our world, toward peaceful tomorrows for all.&#148; Potorti lost his brother, Jim, at the World Trade Center. </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">               For details on speaking events, as well as specifics of when and where the Stonewalkers will begin and end their daily walks, visit the Peaceful Tomorrows website at www.peacefultomorrows.org.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The following is the most up-to-date schedule for the Stonewalk.</FONT></P><P> </P><P></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Massachusetts</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">July 23-25-- Boston Social Forum</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">July 26-27-- Copley Square, Boston</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">July 28-- Copley Square to BROOKLINE, MA </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">July 29-- Brookline to NEWTON, MA </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">July 30-- Newton to WELLESLEY, MA </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">July 31-- Wellesley to Natick, SHERBORNE, MA (Peace Abbey) </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Aug 1-- Sherborne to HOLLISTON, MA </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Aug 2-- Holliston to MILFORD, MA </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Aug 3-- Milford to Hopedale, Mendon, UXBRIDGE, MA </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Rhode Island</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Aug 4-- Uxbridge to Millville, N.
