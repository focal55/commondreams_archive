<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NEW YORK, October 14 - More than 250 global leaders called
today for a reordering of international priorities to bring full funding to
the historic action plan of the 1994 International Conference on Population
and Development. The unprecedented World Leaders Statement reaffirmed the
value of the ICPD Programme of Action on the eve of a United Nations General
Assembly session here that will review progress in the 10 years since the
groundbreaking event.
    
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Programme of Action, a consensus reached by 179 nations in Cairo,
Egypt, in 1994, paved the way for the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by
setting clear, achievable targets related to sexual and reproductive health
and rights for all. The targets included universal access to family planning,
safe motherhood, treatment and prevention of sexually-transmitted diseases
such as HIV/AIDS; environmental protection; basic education; human rights and
women's empowerment.

</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Current global spending of $15 billion toward these goals is short of the
agreed ICPD 2005 goal of $18.5 billion, with services suffering most in the
world's poorest countries.

</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The World Leaders Statement was signed by current and former government
leaders, Nobel Laureates, scientists, religious officials, youth leaders, and
business people. They include British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Prime
Minister Paul Martin of Canada, President Vincente Fox of Mexico, and
Botswanan President Festus Mogae, and 80 current government leaders; former
U.S. Presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter, Oscar Arias of Costa Rica, Gro
Harlem Brundtland of Norway and Pasqual Mocumbi of Mozambique.  The religious
leaders include the Rev. Bishop Desmond Tutu and Barry Morgan, Archbishop of
Wales.  More than two dozen Nobel Laureates join an equal number of scientific
leaders.  The business category includes Ted Turner, Roger Sant and Ratan
Tata.  In addition, leading health and rights leaders, youth leaders and
leaders in development (including Muhammad Yunus and Bernard Kouchner) joined
top UN officials in the Statement.
</font>
<p>    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We call on leaders in every walk of life to join us in reaffirming the
ICPD's vision for human development, social justice, economic progress and
environmental preservation," the statement said. "We call on the international
community, along with national governments and private philanthropy, to
prioritize and fully fund the ICPD Programme of Action." (Full text available

   </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Presenting the statement to UN Deputy Secretary-General Louise Frechette,
businessman and philanthropist Ted Turner said, "This statement is the good
news the world is looking for in these troubled times. It underscores the need
for cooperation across every sector and country, to realize our shared dream
for a world that is equitable, equal, peaceful, and healthy."
    </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"I want to express my sincere gratitude to everyone involved in mobilizing
this incredible roster of supporters from across sectors and regions of the
world," said Thoraya Ahmed Obaid, executive director of UNFPA, the UN
Population Fund. "The support provided through the World Leaders Statement
complements renewed commitments expressed by the world's governments in
regional meetings convened with UNFPA assistance over the past two years in
preparation for the 10-year anniversary."

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Background:

   </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The ICPD Programme of Action's 20-year vision was agreed to by 179 nations
in 1994 to guide national and international family planning, reproductive
health, HIV/AIDS prevention, women's empowerment, and related development
efforts. The Programme is a dramatic new approach to population and
development, turning away from problematic "population control" programs
(centered around demographic targets and sometimes associated with coercive
practices) and toward a more human-centered approach that responds to basic
needs and universal human rights, with special reference to women.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The ICPD set time-bound targets, including:
   </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> * Reproductive health care to all individuals of appropriate age by 2015;
    </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Sharp reductions in infant and maternal mortality rates and
      corresponding increases in the proportion of births assisted by skilled
      attendants;
    </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Dramatic gains in prevention of HIV/AIDS infection, with special
      attention to young men and women; and
    </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Steady progress in global literacy and rapid closure of the gender gap
      in education.

    </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Achieving these goals is essential to achieving the Millennium Development
Goals that were established in 2000 at a UN summit meeting involving most
heads of state from around the world. As UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan has
said, the MDGs cannot succeed without full implementation of the ICPD action
plan.</font></p>
