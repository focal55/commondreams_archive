<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON. &#150;  The USDA&#146;s weak enforcement of the nation&#146;s organic food production standards was sharply criticized today by Mark Kastel, the Director of The <a href="http://www.cornucopia.org/" target="_NEW">Cornucopia Institute&#146;s Organic Integrity Project</a>.  &#147;Why do we need to file lawsuits against our own government to enforce the law of the land,&#148; Kastel asked the members of the National Organic Standards Board (NOSB) during its semi-annual meeting in Washington, D.C.</font>
</font>
<p> </p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At issue is the expansion of factory sized farming operations into the organic dairy business.  Federal organic regulations demand strict animal husbandry practices, requiring that dairy cows have access to pasture and the outdoors plus receive a significant component of their food from pasturing.  According to Kastel, 2000- to 5000-head organic dairy operations are starting-up or have begun operations in several locations across the country.  </font></p>
<p> </p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;You cannot milk 3000 cows, 4000 cows, 5000 cows &#150; milking them in many cases three times a day &#150; and provide them access to real pasture,&#148; testified Kastel.  &#147;You can provide them with &#147;dry lots&#148; and call that pasture, but that does not make it pasture nor does it comply with the law.  A factory farm is a factory farm.  Just because you cram organic feed down the throats of your high-producing cattle does not make it organic agriculture,&#148; Kastel added.</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The USDA&#146;s failure to enforce the law, Kastel charged, &#147;is a disrespectful slap in the face to hundreds of farmers like Vermont&#146;s Ann Lazor.&#148;  Lazor and her husband Jack milk 45 Jersey cows and market an award winning organic yogurt.  She also sits on The Cornucopia Institute&#146;s board of directors.  &#147;Hard-working dairy families like the Lazors follow the letter and intent of the organic regulations and jump through the USDA&#146;s many hoops necessary to produce real organic milk,&#148; said Kastel. </font></p>
<p> </p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Kastel mentioned that The Cornucopia Institute, along with farmers and consumer groups, had called for the equivalent of &quot;r&eacute;gime change&quot; in management of the USDA&#146;s National Organic Program at last April&#146;s NOSB meeting in Chicago.  Instead, Kastel wryly observed, &#147;the program manager was given a promotion and a salary increase.  And his replacement is a young career bureaucrat once again lacking a professional background in organic agriculture.&#148;</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Kastel called upon the career employees at the National Organic Program to speak up and to speak out if they disagree with current policy.  &#147;Do the right thing,&#148; urged Kastel.  &#147;Enforce the law and protect organic integrity.  If you receive pressure from above for operating in an ethical manner&#151;let us know.  The farmers in the organic community will be on your side, consumers will be on your side, and the media will be anxious to stick their teeth into this juicy organic story.&#148;</font></p>
