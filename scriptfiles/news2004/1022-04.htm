<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- October 21 -- &quot;We're at war and (President Bush) is scaring people,&quot; says Democratic Presidential hopeful John F. Kerry, in an exclusive interview taped in Florida earlier this week for America's Black Forum, the Emmy Award- winning nationally-syndicated television news and information broadcast with an African American perspective. &quot;He is spending a lot of time trying to appeal to people's fear instinct. If our base comes out and people vote for health care, if they vote for jobs, if they vote for justice and fairness, if they come out and vote for the things that matter in their lives, we're going to win.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Current polls show that Kerry and Bush are in a close race, notes America's Black Forum host Juan Williams, who conducted the interview of which excerpts will be seen this weekend on stations throughout the nation. On the broadcast, Kerry speaks out on healthcare, unemployment, child care, minimum wage, the military and other issues of concern to the African American community and the entire nation during the interview. He also comments on the importance of high voter turnout; the rash of negative ads and personal attacks; and the significance of the battleground states; the controversy around his remarks about Mary Cheney's sexuality and responds to an inquiry by host Juan Williams on the seeming uphill challenge to beat President Bush despite the President's low approval ratings in the poll.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In response to whether charges of voter fraud are a scare tactic, Kerry says: &quot;It is not a scare tactic. I want your viewers to know if they go out to vote, we will have people at every precinct to make sure that their vote is counted. We have 10,000 lawyers. We are not going to let 2000 happen again.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Interwoven throughout the presentation will be comments on Kerry statements by Armstrong Williams and Julian Bond, the broadcast's co-hosts and commentators. Armstrong Williams, a conservative syndicated columnist, is skeptical of Kerry's commitment to African Americans, and Bond believes the Bush Administration's record has been devastating for Black Americans.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Washington, D.C., America's Black Forum is presented Sundays on WUSA/Ch. 9 at 1:30 a.m., ET in Los Angeles; it airs Sunday on KCAL/Ch. 9 at 1:30 p.m., PT.
