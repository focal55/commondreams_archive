<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - May 5 - &#147;The Computer Ate My Vote,&#148; a national campaign to protect the integrity of American ballots came to Washington, DC today to tell federal election authorities that each ballot cast this November 2 must be backed by a voter-verified paper trail.  </FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> In testimony before the Election Assistance Commission, election officials and computer experts called for transparent, verifiable voting systems.</FONT></P><P>    <FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;There will be a paper trail for every single vote cast in California, and it will happen on my watch,&quot; California Secretary of State Kevin Shelley said.  &quot;I call on the federal government to move immediately on this issue as well.&quot;  On April 30th Mr. Shelley decertified Diebold TSx voting machines and asked California's attorney general to open a criminal investigation into Diebold's practices.</FONT></P><P>  <FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Today's fully electronic voting machines do not provide any way to audit the election,&#148; said Aviel Rubin, professor of computer science at Johns Hopkins University. &#147;In particular, if there is any controversy about the outcome, a recount is impossible. We would just have to live with the result.&quot; Rubin co-authored a seminal report on the security flaws in current electronic voting machines.</FONT></P><P>  <FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;We made every effort to work with election officials in Maryland,&quot; said Linda Schade of TureVoteMD.org, a grassroots group working to get a paper trail for their state&#146;s elections. &quot;The executive and legislative branches of state government failed to protect our right to a verifiable vote, so we are turning to the federal government, through the EAC and to the judicial system, with a lawsuit in Maryland's courts.&quot; </FONT></P><P>  <FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;TrueMajority has 465,000 members across America who want elections decided by citizens, not computer errors,&quot; said its president Ben Cohen, co-founder of Ben&amp;Jerry&#146;s Ice Cream.  &#147;Since launching The Computer Ate My Vote campaign in Washington in February, TrueMajority members have sent 130,000 messages to their state election officials and legislators asking for voter-verified paper ballots.&#148; Nine states, including California, have taken steps to protect the integrity of their elections.  &#147;The federal government needs to protect voters of every state by requiring paper trails for our elections, so audits and recounts can prove the results are fair,&#148; Cohen concluded.</FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
