With efforts like the Center's targeting naturalized citizens, they are likely to play a critical role in the upcoming national, state, and local elections.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Furthermore, according to a report released this summer in conjunction with the Center and the Fair Immigration Reform Movement (FIRM), turnout of Latino, Asian, and naturalized- citizen voters is estimated to reach 15 million in November- roughly a 40 percent increase over 2000. Both parties are targeting minority voters and new citizens and immigration policies will play a critical role in getting these constituencies out to vote.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Immigrant groups are realizing that they can gain power through the ballot, and bring crucial immigration issues to the consciousness of both immigrants and policymakers,&quot; said Cristina Lopez, Deputy Executive Director, Center for Community Change. &quot;We are forcing political observers to broaden their view of voting constituencies beyond soccer moms and NASCAR dads to include immigrants.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TELEPHONIC PRESS CONFERENCE DISCUSSING NEW REPORT</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHEN: Wednesday, October 20, 3 p.m. Eastern Time</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">HOW: Dial 1- 800-441-0022 and ask for the Immigrant Vote 2004 Teleconference</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHO:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rob Paral and Benjamin Johnson, Immigration Policy Center</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Christina Lopez, Deputy Executive Director, Center for Community Change, an organization registering and mobilizing voters in immigrant and low-income communities nationwide.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">EunSook Lee, Executive Director, NAKASEC National Korean American Service &amp; Education Consortium in Los Angeles, an organization conducting voter registration and voter mobilization in the Korean and Asian community.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jorge Mursuli, National Director, Mi Familia Vota, an organization that has registered 73,000 Hispanic voters in South Florida.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Clarissa Martinez de Castro, Director of State and Local Policy, National Council of La Raza, moderator.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
