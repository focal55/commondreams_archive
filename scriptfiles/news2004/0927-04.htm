<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - September 27 - On Wednesday, September 29, youth and students across America will converge on campuses, schools, and their neighborhoods to register voters as part of National Youth and Student Voter Registration Day. These young people will be bucking the trend of youthful voter apathy* by taking responsibility for their communities and our nation's future by spending the day registering new voters. The Children's Defense Fund, which is heading up its own non-partisan voter registration campaign called &quot;Children Can't Vote. You Can.&quot; is a co-sponsor of the event. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Concerned about the state of children in America &#151; everyday in America more than 2,000 babies are born into poverty, nearly 2,500 children are confirmed as abused or neglected, and more than 1,700 children are born without health insurance &#151; students from more than 50 college campuses in 19 states along with young people from churches, homeless shelters, after-school programs, and civil rights organizations are stepping forward and taking responsibility for representing the interests of children. These young people just may change the course of history! </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The national non-partisan voter registration day, which does not represent an endorsement of any candidate or political party, is co-sponsored by more than 17 national organizations, including the American Federation of Teachers, Americans for Democratic Action, Center for Community Change, Center for Immigrant Democracy, Children's Defense Fund, Coalition on Human Needs, Hispanic Federation, League of United Latin American Citizens, National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, National Coalition for the Homeless, National Congress of American Indians, National Low Income Housing Coalition, National Network for Youth, National Student Partnership, &iquest;O&iacute;ste?, Unitarian Universalists Association, Youth Build USA, and The White House Project.
