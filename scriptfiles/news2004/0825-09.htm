Residents and workers of the Ground Zero area will participate in a daily vigil marking President Bush&#146;s upcoming visit to New York.  The goals of the daily, sunrise-to-sunset event are to call upon the Bush administration to meet the needs of the people exposed to Ground Zero pollution, and to educate the nation about the need for better public health protection in national emergencies. </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The event kicks off with a press conference on the steps of Federal Hall (across from the New York Stock Exchange) at 11:00 AM on Thursday, August 26th.
