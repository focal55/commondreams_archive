<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - April 19 - Today, the World Health Organization released the latest draft of its global strategy on diet, physical activity and health.  Following are comments from Gary Ruskin, executive director of Commercial Alert, on the WHO draft global strategy.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;The WHO global strategy is far weaker than it should be.  The advertising and junk food industries should be happy because it doesn&#146;t encourage countries to ban junk food advertising to children.  The sugar industry should be thrilled because doesn&#146;t specifically recommend that free sugars should be less than 10% of daily calorie intake.  Television companies will cheer because it doesn&#146;t mention the major role of television in the promotion of marketing-related diseases such as obesity and diabetes.  The WHO caved into the US and the junk food industry by deleting support for policies that promote the production and marketing of fruit, vegetables and legumes.&#148;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;That said, the WHO global strategy still contains some positive aspects.  It should be strengthened and approved by the World Health Assembly next month.&#148;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Text of the WHO draft global strategy is available at: <A HREF="http://www.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/WHA57/A57_9-en.pdf" TARGET="_new">http://www.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/WHA57/A57_9-en.pdf</A></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Commercial Alert is a national nonprofit organization whose mission is to keep the commercial culture within its proper sphere, and to prevent it from exploiting children and subverting the higher values of family, community, environmental integrity and democracy.
