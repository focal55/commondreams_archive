<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - February 2 - President Bush today released a budget proposal that continues a disturbing shift away from the priorities of working Americans and promises to widen rather than narrow the growing gulf between the rich and middle class in America. The $2.4 trillion blueprint ignores pleas from the unemployed and underemployed to address the jobs and health care crises with tangible solutions. </FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The president&#146;s budget validates the Administration&#146;s overall scheme to help corporate interests. It drains resources away from domestic programs and services that would strengthen and improve jobs, health care and education and devotes them instead to huge new spending for the wealthy. The hallmark of the Bush budget is the president&#146;s determination to permanently lock in multi-trillion dollar tax breaks that benefit the nation&#146;s wealthiest while increasing an already bloated deficit. </FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In order to pay for these tax giveaways to millionaires, the Bush budget cuts funding for worker protection and safety training programs, severely underfunds highway and mass transit projects that could stimulate job growth and fails to provide meaningful solutions to the continuing loss of good jobs. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Job training programs alone will not address the rising tide of outsourcing and the severe lack of quality jobs to sustain our nation&#146;s middle class. And the president&#146;s proposed funding for job training programs at community colleges does not begin to meet the tremendous financial need of institutions hammered by the states&#146; fiscal crisis. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The president owes working families more than superficial remedies if we want to rebuild the economy and secure a future for our children. He owes us a budget that clearly puts our priorities before special interests.</FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
