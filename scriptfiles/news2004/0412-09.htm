<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - April 12 - Bread for the World Institute will release its 14th annual report on the state of world hunger, Wednesday, April 14. This year's report examines the question, &quot;Are We on Track?&quot; to meeting the goals of cutting hunger in half globally by 2015 and in the United States by 2010. </FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">At the World Food Summit of 1996, the United States took the lead and agreed with other nations to cut world hunger in half by 2015. That meant reducing the number of hungry people in developing countries from about 800 million in 1995 to about 400 million by 2015. Soon thereafter, U.S. leaders pledged a goal of cutting domestic hunger in half by 2010. That meant reducing the number of people living in homes at risk of hunger from 30.4 million in 1995 to about 15.2 million in 2010.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The report also examines how American voters feel about addressing these goals in a context of a war on terrorism and in a presidential election year.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Bread for the World Institute President David Beckmann is available for interviews. He is an economist and ordained Lutheran Pastor.</FONT> </P>
