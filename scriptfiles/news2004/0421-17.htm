<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - April 21 - The Oregon branch of the National Organization for Women celebrates the ruling released today by the Multnomah County Court. According to Tina Empol, Action VP for Oregon NOW, &quot;This is a historic moment for Oregon and for the advancement of Civil Rights in America. Oregon is the first state where marriages between gay couples are legally recognized.&quot;   </FONT></p><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Judge Bearden , Multnomah County Court Judge, has ruled that there is no justifiable basis for discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender and requests that the Oregon State Legislature remedy the unconstitutional marriage statute it previously passed. The legislature needs to do so within 90 days. During the 90 days Multnomah County has been ordered to stop issuing licenses to same-sex couples.  After 90 days, if a remedy has not been agreed upon, Multnomah County will be required to resume the issuing of marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Benton County is currently refusing to issue any marriage licenses so as to prevent discrimination. Linda L. Klinge, President of Oregon NOW says, &quot; It took great courage from the Multnomah County Commissioners and the Benton County Commissioners to uphold the Constitution of the State of Oregon and they have been vindicated by this ruling.&quot; &quot;We hope that Multnomah County will follow Benton County's lead and refuse to issue marriage licenses until the State Legislature corrects the unconstitutionality of current marriage statutes.&quot;</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Oregon NOW is pleased that discrimination in marriage laws will not be allowed to stand in Oregon. Opposing all forms of discrimination is a focus agenda item for Oregon NOW members.  &quot;Now that Oregon will recognize the thousands of gay marriages that have taken place here in Oregon, we will lead the way for the rest of the Country to follow. It's about the blossoming of love and that is a good thing, says Tina Empol.</FONT></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
