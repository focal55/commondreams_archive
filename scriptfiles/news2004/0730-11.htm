<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - July 30 - As the Democratic Convention came to an end Thursday night, &#145;Greens for Kerry' (GFK) urged fellow Greens, former Nader voters, and progressives of all stripes to unite for the common good and help evict Bush/Cheney by voting for John Kerry. The Democratic Convention, noticeably temperate in its advocacy of core progressive principles, no doubt to court the swing vote, did offer a clear alternative to the Republican Party and the Bush Cheney administration. </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Bush administration's assault on the core principles that define a democratic and just society like equal rights for minorities, women, and gays, environmental protection, economic justice, peace, civil liberties, and more, has led to the emergence of an energized and increasingly united progressive movement. The key question coming out of the Democratic Convention is whether Greens and progressives will work to ensure Bush's defeat, and will they use that momentum and unity to effectively push the Kerry administration to adopt a more progressive agenda?</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">'Beating Bush by voting for Kerry is only the first step of a long term progressive movement that's united in its effort to change the political landscape of this country,&quot; said Sarah Newman, founder of Greens for Kerry. 'Greens and progressives, if mobilized, unified, and able to compromise where necessary, could play a more pro-active role in convincing a Kerry administration to act boldly on issues that we have agreement on, and help modify his positions on issues we don't.&quot; </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Illustrating this emerging progressive movement, GFK cited the recently held Boston Social Forum, the nomination of David Cobb, who ran on a &#145;safe state' strategy, as the Green Party nominee, as well as newly formed groups like Greens for Impact, Driving Votes, Repentant Nader Voter, United Progressives for Victory, and numerous others.  </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">'There are plenty of Democrats that want the same kinds of changes we do on issues like energy independence, a living wage, universal healthcare, environmental protection, and fair trade,&quot; said Abe Gutmann, Former State Chairman and US Senate Candidate, New Mexico Green Party. 'President Bush is not only the enemy of all these, he's dismantling the progressive gains we've made in the past half century. Our goals are beating Bush, growing the Green Party, and creating a progressive agenda and unified effort to implement it once this election is over.&quot;</font></p><p></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">GFK is continuing to formulate a list of specific, progressive policy positions they would like to see a Kerry administration address, particularly focusing on areas where the senator has a good record and needs to act boldly. Due to the enormous feedback GFK has received from members and participants at the Boston Social Forum, these 'issue ideas&quot; will be sent to Kerry and DNC chairman Terry McAuliffe in a few weeks. </font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
