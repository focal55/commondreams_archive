<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - February 9 - An innovative Web-based tool unveiled today by the Center for Responsive Politics allows voters to research advocacy groups spending millions of dollars to influence the 2004 elections and to report the activities of these groups in their communities.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">With the 2004 presidential and congressional races in full swing, special interest groups across the political spectrum will be airing ads, mailing flyers and operating phone banks designed to support or oppose the election of a candidate. Inconsistent reporting requirements will make identifying and tracking these groups difficult.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">To assist voters in finding out more about the election efforts, agendas and financial backers of these organizations, the Center has created the <A HREF="http://www.opensecrets.org/527s/hotline.asp" TARGET="_NEW">OpenSecrets Hotline</A>, an interface on the Center&#146;s OpenSecrets.org Web site that invites members of the public to report advocacy group activities aimed at them. The OpenSecrets Hotline invites users to enter information including the type of communication (TV ad, flyer, etc.), the name of the group that sponsored the communication and the candidate or candidates targeted.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;The OpenSecrets Hotline utilizes voters&#151;the targets of election-related communications&#151;as a resource for information on the activities and identities of advocacy groups trying to influence federal elections,&#148; said Larry Noble, the Center&#146;s executive director. &#147;The more voters know about these groups, the more informed they will be when deciding how to vote.&#148;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Center will review submissions to the OpenSecrets Hotline for accuracy and add them to an online list of the Major Players among advocacy groups. The <A HREF="http://www.opensecrets.org/527s/527grps.asp" TARGET="_NEW">Major Players section</A> will give voters information they need to research the groups that are conducting advocacy efforts.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Center has profiled more than 20 Major Players that are among the most active groups in the 2004 election cycle. These groups, organized under sections 527 and 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, have said they will raise and spend six- and seven-figure soft money contributions that the McCain-Feingold law bans the national political parties from collecting.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Several of these groups, including America Coming Together, the Leadership Forum and the Media Fund, have been dubbed &#147;shadow&#148; groups because of their close ties to the Democratic and Republican parties. Relying on the OpenSecrets Hotline and independent research, the Center will regularly update the Major Players profiles with information on their election-related activities, major donors, key personnel and budget.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Center also has posted contribution and expenditure figures for <A HREF="http://www.opensecrets.org/527s/527cmtes.asp" TARGET="_NEW">527 groups</A>, which must file such information with the Internal Revenue Service. 527 groups, defined by the Internal Revenue Code as &#147;political groups,&#148; include many of the most active advocacy groups in the 2004 election cycle. Figures reflect reports filed with the Internal Revenue Service last week. Financial information including totals raised, totals spent and top contributors will be updated regularly as data is made available by the IRS. A major IRS update of 527 data is expected today.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">America Coming Together, one of the most prominent Democratic groups dedicated to defeating President Bush this year, raised $12.5 million in 2003, making it the largest recipient of funds among 527 groups active in federal elections. The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees ranks second with $7.5 million raised. Third is The Media Fund, another of the major groups that will work to elect the Democratic presidential nominee, with $3 million raised. EMILY&#146;s List ($2.6 million) and Sierra Club ($1.8 million) rank fourth and fifth, respectively.</FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
