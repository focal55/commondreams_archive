<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - August 11 - One year after the largest blackout in U.S. history, the Bush Administration and Congress have done nothing to prevent future electricity blackouts, according to new radio ads paid for by a coalition of 22 national environmental groups. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Northeast-Midwest blackout on Aug. 14, 2003, left over 28 million people in Michigan, New York, Ohio and other states without electricity for up to four days. Nonetheless, the Administration and Congress have done nothing to increase the reliability of the electricity grid, reduce demand via energy efficiency, or spur renewable energy. The coalition of 22 national environmental organizations, Save Our Environment (see note), will air ads pointing out this failure on radio stations in Akron, Canton, and Toledo, Ohio and in Kalamazoo and Lansing, Michigan. All of these cities lost power during the blackout. The ad, titled &quot;In the Dark,&quot; was produced by Haddow Communications. It will air in the five media markets 15 to 25 times a day from Wednesday, August 11 through Saturday, August 14, the first anniversary of the blackout. The ad copy and list of stations where the ad will air is attached; an MP3 file of the ad audio is available by contacting Dan Weiss at 202-478-6307 or <a href="mailto:dweiss@mrss.com">dweiss@mrss.com</a>. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Bush Administration and Congressional leaders promote policies that could leave us in the dark again,&quot; said Anna Aurilio, Legislative Director of U.S. PIRG, which is a member of Save Our Environment. &quot;They are pushing an energy bill that leaves us at risk for future blackouts, while they squander taxpayer dollars on dirty fuels such as coal, oil, and nuclear power.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;These ads are a wake up call for the Bush Administration and Congress. They must act now to make electricity more reliable, renewable, and efficient,&quot; said Debbie Boger, Deputy Legislative Director of Sierra Club, another member of Save Our Environment. &quot;Increased reliability, energy efficiency, and more renewable power will reduce the risk of future blackouts, create jobs, and reduce pollution.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A recent analysis by Synapse Energy Economics found that increasing energy efficiency and renewable energy, and distributed generation would save an estimated $36 billion annually by 2025. At the same time, it would reduce the harmful public health and environmental effects of electricity generation. The report is available at <a href="http://www.newenergyfuture.com" target="_new">http://www.newenergyfuture.com</a>.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since the Aug. 14, 2003, blackout, the Bush and Administration and Congressional leaders have held reliability standards hostage to passage of the energy bill, H.R. 6, which contains $31 billion in taxpayer handouts to industry. It would encourage more oil drilling, coal consumption, and nuclear power. More than 100 newspapers have editorialized in opposition to H.R. 6, including The Akron Beacon Journal, Dayton Daily New, Detroit News, Kalamazoo Gazette, Toledo Blade, and The Wall Street Journal. The House of Representatives passed the bill twice, but the Senate blocked it twice. Despite the fact that it leaves consumers more vulnerable to blackouts, proponents of H.R. 6 may use the anniversary of the blackout as an excuse to revive it.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rep. John Dingell (D-MI) and Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) have introduced stand-alone reliability legislation, H.R. 3004 and S. 2014, and that would be a good first step to make the electric grid more reliable. Instead, Congressional leaders continue to promote the failed policies in H.R. 6, which does little to increase the reliability, renewability, or efficiency of our electricity. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Reps Dingell and Tim Bishop (D-NY) are circulating a &quot;discharge petition&quot; that would force the House of Representatives to vote on H.R. 3004, if a majority of the House signs the petition. They have 169 out of 218 signatures required to force a vote, and will continue to seek signatures when Congress returns on September 7.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Following is a list of stations the ads will run on:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AKRON, OH: WAKR-AM, WKDD-FM, WNIR-FM</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CANTON, OH: WHBC-AM, WHBC-FM, WZKL-FM</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TOLEDO, OH: WKKO-FM, WRQN-FM, WRVF-FM, WTOD-AM</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KALAMAZOO, MI: WKFR-FM, WKZO-AM, WQLR-FM</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LANSING, MI: WILS-AM, WITL-FM, WJIM-FM, WFMK-FM</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">------</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NOTE: Save Our Environment is a coalition of 22 major national environmental organizations including the Sierra Club, U.S. PIRG, and the Natural Resources Defense Council.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">------</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Save Our Environment Radio :60 &quot;In the Dark&quot; August 4, 2004</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Voice over:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The day the earth stood still.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On August 14, 2003 air conditioners, street lights and anything that needs power shut down when parts of the Northeast and Midwest power grid failed, stranding 50 million people in the worst blackout in U.S. history. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Background:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The blackout affected more than 4.1 million people in Ohio, and 5.9 million people in Michigan.

It has been opposed by over 100 major newspapers across the country, including the Wall St. Journal, Detroit News, Kalamazoo Gazette, Akron Beacon Journal, Toledo Blade, and Dayton Daily News.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Given the administration's slavishness toward the energy industry, it is no surprise that the bill has been turned into a bazaar full of goodies for the oil and gas crowd.
