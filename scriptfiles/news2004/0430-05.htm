Solomon said today: &quot;In the wake of major U.S. military actions in Fallujah and elsewhere in Iraq during April, top U.S. officials such as Donald Rumsfeld and Colin Powell have condemned al-Jazeera while putting intense pressure on Qatar's government -- a key U.S. ally in the region -- to rein it in. Officials in Washington keep saying they want to encourage democratization in the Middle East, but the Bush administration's moves to throttle al-Jazeera certainly indicate otherwise. Yet there are ways that the U.S. government could legitimately reduce the negative coverage it gets on al-Jazeera. For instance, if President Bush wants al-Jazeera to stop airing grisly footage of dead Iraqi civilians, as commander in chief he could order U.S. troops to stop killing them.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">REESE ERLICH, <A HREF="mailto:rerlich@pacbell.net">rerlich@pacbell.net</A></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Erlich, a foreign correspondent who has covered the Middle East extensively for 20 years, contends that the Bush administration is launching dangerous attacks on freedom of the press. &quot;The closing of the al-Hawza newspaper in Baghdad and strong-arming the government sponsor of al-Jazeera are the ultimate in 'blame the messenger' mentality,&quot; Erlich said today. &quot;The U.S. is losing the war in Iraq and is increasingly isolated politically in the Arab world, so what's its response? Blame the media. The U.S. media wouldn't accept such an argument from Bush the candidate, so why accept it from Bush the commander in chief?&quot; Erlich has done freelance reporting for NPR News, the San Francisco Chronicle and the Christian Science Monitor.
