In addition, the National Press Club respectfully requests that you reconsider your decision not to alter your personal policy prohibiting radio and television journalists from also recording your comments for broadcast. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In an April 9 letter to the Reporter's Committee for Freedom of the Press, you made clear that you were not happy with a U.S. marshal's seizure and erasure of two reporters' tape recordings of a speech you made at a Hattiesburg, Miss., high school. You also indicated you would tell those who handle your security that, even though they do not fall under your supervision, they should be aware of your revised preference regarding tape recordings. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">We greatly appreciate those actions but hope you will consider that electronic correspondents are entitled to the same First Amendment protections as print journalists. As professional journalists, we of course would respect your right to make off- the-record remarks if you and your hosts agree to do so. But since you have agreed that your on-the-record remarks can be recorded and written down by print reporters, then radio and TV reporters should be allowed the same access. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The National Press Club's nearly 4,000 reporters, editors, public-information officers and news sources hope you will reconsider this position. If you disagree, we would appreciate hearing your rationale. And we thank you again for your swift and strong response to the Hattiesburg incident. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Sincerely, </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Sheila Cherry</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">President </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">National Press Club </FONT></P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">------</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">April 9, 2004</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Benigno G.

Rube, according to press reports, forced journalists with The Associated Press and The Hattiesburg American to erase their audiotapes. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">We are alarmed because the action abuses basic press freedoms. More specifically, the forced erasure violates the Privacy Protection Act, U.S.C. 2000aa (a), which, except in extremely limited cases, exempts the press against law enforcement searches and seizures of tape recordings, notes, documents and other materials collected during newsgathering. As far as we know, the journalists in this case did not commit crimes, nor did the seizure prevent death or serious bodily injury, two circumstances which would have justified seizure. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">We are also concerned that the erasure took place without the consultation of Attorney General Ashcroft. Department of Justice guidelines (28 C.F.R. 50.10) require that all department employees get approval of the Attorney General before forcing a reporter to turn over materials. We are disappointed that the deputy marshal ignored and violated both the Privacy Protection Act and longstanding Department of Justice guidelines in dealing with reporters who were simply doing their constitutionally protected jobs. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">On behalf of the National Press Club's nearly 4,000 reporters, public information officers and regular news sources, I strongly urge you to do all in your power to ensure that all employees of the Justice Department understand and adhere to the Privacy Protection Act and the Department's own guidelines and how they relate to the news media.
