[2] These countries accuse the European Union of blocking trade in GM crops and foods and May 25 is the official deadline for WTO countries to submit evidence in the complaint.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The signatures were delivered after the WTO's public symposium (25-27 May) was opened by WTO director-general Supachai Panitchpakdi and European chief trade negotiator Pascal Lamy, among others.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Friends of the Earth International Trade Campaigner Alexandra Wandel said in Geneva:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Tens of thousands of individuals around the world have signed this petition to send a clear message to the WTO to take their hands off our food.  The World Trade Organisation has no right to impose GM crops and food on any country. All around the world, , including in the US, Argentina and Canada, people have backed this call. We will not be bullied by the United States, biotech companies or the WTO.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Campaigners from Friends of the Earth International, which initiated this 'bite-back: WTO hands off our food' campaign, held two banners saying 'WTO: Hands Off our Food' and 'WTO = bio-hazard'</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Friends of the Earth International, the world's largest grassroots environmental federation with 68 national member groups in as many countries and more than one million individual members, wants the US, Canada and Argentina to drop their complaint.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">BACKGROUND INFORMATION:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In May 2003 the US, Canada and Argentina filed a complaint with the WTO. The countries claim that a European Union de-facto moratorium and various national bans on genetically modified crops made them lose millions of dollars of potential exports.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">By mounting this WTO dispute the US and other GM crops exporters are trying to force genetically modified food into the European Union and other parts of the world where citizens have serious and legitimate concerns about the risks of GM foods and crops for consumers, farmers, wildlife and the environment.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">If the WTO rules in favour of the US-led coalition the EU faces economic sanctions or must accept more GM food. Such a decision would also make it more difficult for developing countries to protect their citizens from risks associated with GM crops and foods. But it will help biotech corporations access new markets more easily, particularly in the South. Signatories believe that decisions concerning regulation of international trade in GM organisms should be made in accordance with the UN Biosafety Protocol and not by the World Trade Organisation.</FONT></P><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
