<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - June 22 - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and state governments appear to be underreporting refinery and chemical plant toxic air emissions -- including known carcinogens benzene and butadiene -- on the &quot;startling magnitude&quot; of at least 330 million pounds per year, according to a new study released today by the Washington, D.C.-based Environmental Integrity Project (EIP) and Galveston Houston- Association for Smog Prevention (GHASP).  The study is being released ahead of EPA's release of the 2002 Toxic Release Inventory (TRI), expected to come out this week.  The EIP-GHASP analysis finds that the presence of the carcinogens benzene and butadiene in the air in the United States may be four to five times higher than the level the EPA reports to the public.     The study, which is based on findings by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ), applies the Commission's findings on the underreporting of certain toxic emissions nationwide and concludes that at least 16 percent of toxic air emissions from all sources &quot;have been kept 'off the books.'&quot;</FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">    Additionally, the EIP-GHASP study notes that the EPA for years has knowingly underreported the air pollution data in its annual TRI data.  The study concludes:  &quot; ... EPA has failed to improve monitoring and reporting of toxic air pollution.  In fact, EPA has moved in the opposite direction and has weakened some federal monitoring requirements ... in 2004, EPA adopted new rules that actually weakened air emission reporting requirements ... EPA's old rules required that major air pollution sources conduct monitoring sufficient to reveal whether or not the source was complying with federal pollution limits ... EPA revised these rules to only require monitoring that occurs more than once every five years.  Such infrequent monitoring is clearly inadequate for tracking compliance and means that more sources will be using emission calculations and estimations, rather than actual monitoring, to report emissions.  This is obviously a step in the wrong direction.&quot;</FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">    Environmental Integrity Project Counsel and Equal Justice Works Fellow Kelly Haragan said: &quot;The public is being exposed to far more toxic air pollution than the EPA acknowledges for the record.  It is time that EPA and the states deal with the problem of inaccurate and flawed reporting of toxic releases.  Systematic underreporting happens today because most air pollution is now estimated -- not monitored.  To make matters worse, the 'guesswork' is being done by the polluters who have the incentives to keep the numbers as low as possible.  Refineries and chemical plants report their toxic emissions under an honor system that is based on calculations that are outdated and inaccurate.  Instead of cleaning up this problem, the EPA has further weakened monitoring rules and continues to knowingly feed the public inaccurate data regarding toxic air emissions.&quot;</FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">    GHASP Director John Wilson said:  &quot;We are tired of industry accounting tricks that always seem to show pollution releases dropping rapidly, while air quality improvements seem so slow.  It is time for EPA and the states to require real measurements from industry, and take forthright action to protect the public from chemicals that cause cancer, respiratory, cardiovascular and reproductive disease.&quot;</FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">    Louisiana Bucket Brigade Director Anne Rolfes of New Orleans, LA., said: &quot;Communities living around chemical plants and refineries have a right to know what they are breathing.  The chemicals released around them are known to be toxic and cancer-causing.  For EPA to knowingly report inaccurate toxic pollution estimates is shocking.&quot;</FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">    Eboni Cochran, a member of the Rubbertown Emergency Action (REACT) in Louisville, KY., said:  &quot;When one of the rubber plants shut down in my community, butadiene levels dropped dramatically.  We were surprised that the so-called experts didn't expect the pollution to drop so much.  Maybe they believed the company's pollution reports.  My neighborhood has high levels of cancer and among the highest rates of asthma in Louisville, so maybe now wecan deal honestly with the problems.&quot;</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">    KEY STUDY FINDINGS</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">    Entitled &quot;Who's Counting:  The Systematic Underreporting of Toxic Air Emissions,&quot; the EIP-GHASP report finds:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">    * State pollution rankings change dramatically.  Applying the Texas      formula nationwide results in states with chemical plants and refineries      climbing up the EPA's list of states with the most air pollution.  The      following six states underwent the largest percentage adjustments in the      report, in terms of pounds of adjusted pollution:  Texas 159.6 million      pounds (155 percent); New Mexico 1 million pounds (100 percent);      Louisiana 56 million pounds (74 percent); Oklahoma 7.1 million pounds      (41 percent); Iowa 8.7 million pounds (36 percent); and Illinois 17.5      million pounds (30 percent).  The adjusted data also reveal at least 5      million pounds of unreported emissions in Kentucky, Mississippi,      Pennsylvania and Ohio.  Texas moved from third to first place in the      overall TRI rankings, with Louisiana jumping from ninth place to second.      The report notes that further studies are needed to document the extent      of underreporting for chemicals beyond the ten included in the EIP/GHASP      report.  Factoring in the underreporting of additional chemicals would      likely further shift the state rankings.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">    * Major jump in carcinogens seen.  The adjusted data show an increase of      432 percent for butadiene (a major carcinogen), 417 percent for      ethylene, and 440 percent for propylene.  According to polluter data      reported to the 2001 TRI, nearly six million pounds of benzene, another      known carcinogen, were released into the nation's air.  The adjusted      data show this number to be more than 20 million.  Both benzene and      butadiene are associated with cancers including leukemia.  All 10      pollutants are also associated with the risk of one or more non-cancer      chronic diseases, especially respiratory and developmental diseases.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">    * Current EPA reporting is deeply flawed and misses a great deal.  In      2001, the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) called on EPA to improve      its oversight of emissions reporting from large facilities.  The GAO      study documented that only 4 percent of all emissions &quot;determinations&quot;      were made using direct monitoring or testing.  The other 96 percent were      made based on estimates calculated using emissions factors.  Emissions      factors were developed by U.S. EPA as a means of estimating the long-      term average emissions for all facilities in a particular source      category.  However, these factors often are not accurate for calculating      a particular facility's emissions.  EPA acknowledges that its emission      factors are not accurate and yet, earlier this year, adopted a rule      limiting the amount of air monitoring large sources are required to      conduct.  This change allows more facilities to rely on EPA's inaccurate      emission factors.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">    To see a full PDF file copy of the report and a related news release go to the Environmental Integrity Project Web site at <A HREF="http://www.environmentalintegrity.org" TARGET="_new">http://www.environmentalintegrity.org</A>.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">    RECOMMENDATIONS</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">    The EIP-GHASP report urges the follow steps by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">    * EPA should amend its regulations to clearly require that all major      sources conduct monitoring sufficient to demonstrate whether or not they      are in compliance their federal emission limits.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">    * EPA should prioritize review of state-issued permits under federal law      to ensure that adequate monitoring is required.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">    * EPA should set a schedule to re-examine its emission factors within two      years.  Priority should be placed on emissions factors for toxic      chemicals and on those that are known to be unreliable.  These include       flares, fugitives and cooling towers at refineries and chemical plants.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">    * EPA should clarify that its emission factors should not be used in the       permitting process (for determining permit applicability or emission       limits) or for permit fee calculations.  Actual emissions estimates       based on plant-specific data should be used.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">    The EIP-GHASP report also notes:  &quot;Likewise, states should take independent action to ensure that state-issued Title V permits require adequate monitoring, and that emission factors are not the sole basis for emissions estimates used in other circumstances such as fee calculations.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">    METHODOLOGY</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">    Studies by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality have actually quantified the extent to which refineries and chemical plants in Texas underreport certain toxic emissions.  The new study reveals that, if Texas' results are applied nationwide, refineries and chemical plants failed to report at least 330 million pounds of toxic hydrocarbon emissions, including known carcinogens like benzene and butadiene.  Texas officials limited their research to certain hydrocarbons believed to play a major role in causing rapid ozone formation in the Houston area.  Of these, 10 hydrocarbons --ethylene, toluene, hexane, xylene, propylene, styrene, benzene, cyclohexane, ethylbenzene and butadiene -- are chemicals that are reported to the TRI.  In this report, the 2001 TRI levels reported for chemical plant and refinery emissions of those 10 hydrocarbons are adjusted based on the methodology developed by Texas.  Emissions were adjusted for only chemical plants and refineries in four Standard Industrial Codes (SICs).</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">    ABOUT THE GROUPS</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">    Founded by former EPA official Eric Schaeffer, the Environmental Integrity Project (<A HREF="http://www.enviromentalintegrity.org" TARGET="_new">http://www.enviromentalintegrity.org</A>) is a nonpartisan and nonprofit organization established in March of 2002 to advocate for more effective enforcement of environmental laws.
