<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - July 15 - Renowned documentary film personalities, Lila Lipscomb, &#147;Fahrenheit 9/11&#146;s&#148; soldier&#146;s mother, and Ray McGovern, of &#147;Uncovered: The Whole Truth About The Iraq War,&#148; will be in Milwaukee at the 17th Annual Peace Action National Congress this weekend. </FONT></p><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Peace Action (<A HREF="http://www.peace-action.org" TARGET="_new">www.peace-action.org</A>), is hosting a Voice of Democracy (<A HREF="http://www.VoDemocracy.org" TARGET="_new">www.VoDemocracy.org</A>) event featuring Lila Lipscomb and Ray McGovern.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The program is Saturday July 17th at 7:30 PM in the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee Student Union, Ballroom, 2200 E. Kenwood Blvd in Milwaukee.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Lipscomb is shown in Fahrenheit 9/11 reading from the last letter sent home by her son, Sgt. Michael Pederson, who was killed in Iraq. In the letter, Pederson expressed disillusionment with the war and anger against Bush, &#147;He got us out there for nothing whatsoever,&#148; Pederson wrote. &#147;I am so furious right now, Mama.&#148; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Lila Lipscomb said she believes that American troops in Iraq should be withdrawn immediately.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Ray McGovern, co-founder of Veteran Intelligence Professionals of Sanity, said he feels that the Bush administration&#146;s current statements about the possibility of canceling the elections due to terrorism are terrorist acts in themselves.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;The combination of perspectives on Bush&#146;s illegal Iraq war from Lila Lipscomb and Ray McGovern gives a balance of the personal and the analytical that cannot be discounted or ignored. Ray&#146;s 27 years experience as an analyst at the CIA brings the insight of a professional who provided intelligence information and assessments to highest levels of the U.S. government. Lila brings the experience of an everyday American who suffered great personal tragedy and loss due to the misuse and politicizing of intelligence information by the Bush administration,&#148; said Kevin Martin, Executive Director of Peace Action.</FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
