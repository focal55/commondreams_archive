<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - March 17 - In mid-November 2003, Invacare Corporation's CEO A. Malachi (&quot;Mal&quot;) Mixon III (pictured) announced that his company, which makes wheelchairs and other medical equipment, was shutting down its Elyria, OH facility and opening up a plant in China. According to news reports (despite company assurances to the contrary), 300 of the 500 workers - those classified as &quot;temporary&quot; - at the plant would lose their jobs.[1]</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The same day, the company announced it was opening a call-center in India to &quot;'test' how it will economically operate,&quot;[2] a move that threatened the continued employment of 120 workers at its similar customer service facility in Elyria.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The local daily newspaper, The Morning Journal, asked in an editorial, &quot;And how long can the 200 remaining 'regular' workers, and others, expect it to be until the low-wage Chinese also offer to make some of Invacare's more complex products?&quot;[3]</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The CEO had already answered the question: On November 14, the Plain Dealer reported that Mixon and his advisors had estimated that &quot;half of Invacare's manufacturing could be in China in five years.&quot;[4]</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Mixon made the announcements at an analysts' meeting in Cleveland, not with workers at the Elyria plant.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">At the Same Time, Mixon Was Busy Raising Money for Bush</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Less than two weeks after the announcement of the new Chinese venture, Mixon was the chairman of a special interest fundraising event that brought in $750,000 for President George W. Bush's re-election campaign. Vice President Dick Cheney traveled to Cleveland to speak at the event.[5]</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Mixon has raised at least $200,000 for Bush's campaign, earning him elite status as a &quot;Ranger.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Bush Doesn't Get It</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The fact that there are far too many stories like this one eludes President Bush who, during a speech at another plant in Ohio in April 2003, claimed that his tax breaks mean &quot;more money for investments, more money for growth and more money for jobs.&quot;[6] The Bush Administration projected a net job growth in Ohio of 70,500 jobs from June 2003 to January 2004. Instead, 11,800 jobs have been lost in Ohio over that time period.[7]</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Perhaps he is spending too much of his time catering to the needs of those who raise hundreds of thousands of dollars for his campaign, like Invacare CEO Mal Mixon.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">So far, the tax breaks have meant &quot;more money&quot; for wealthy CEOs. Mixon made $2.2 million in 2002.[8] That clearly places him in the wealthiest one percent of Americans who received a disproportionate of the benefits of the Bush tax plan. Citizens for Tax Justice estimates that the average tax savings for the wealthiest one percent of Americans is $662,569 over ten years.[9]</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Ohio: Bush's Personal ATM</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">This Special Interest Spotlight is the second in a series of short reports on President Bush's fundraising in Ohio. The state has become one of the President's most reliable sources of campaign contributions.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Bush-Cheney '04 Inc. currently has disclosed having 11 'Rangers' (those who raise $200,000) and 15 'Pioneers' (those who raise $100,000) from Ohio. Compare that to other comparably sized battleground states - Michigan has just five Rangers and 12 Pioneers, and Pennsylvania has only five Rangers and four Pioneers[10] - and you see Ohio's prominence. Bush's campaign has already held five major fundraisers in Ohio, raising approximately $5.25 million at these events alone.[11]</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Surprisingly, Cincinnati's 45243 zip-code ranks second only to New York City 's 10021 as the most lucrative fundraising zip-code for Bush, surpassing wealthy communities in Houston, Dallas and even Beverly Hills.[12]</FONT></P><P></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">NOTES</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">[1] Mike Sakal, &quot;Invacare will move work to China plant,&quot; The Morning Journal, November 15, 2003.
