<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - March 31 - Rob Kampia, executive director of the Washington, D.C.-based Marijuana Policy Project, will testify on Thursday at a hearing of the House subcommittee whose chairman called him &quot;an articulate advocate for an evil position&quot; at their last such encounter, in March 2001. Kampia and MPP Director of Government Relations Steve Fox will be available for interviews before and after Kampia's testimony.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">   The hearing of the Criminal Justice, Drug Policy, and Human Resources Subcommittee, scheduled for 2:00 p.m. EST, is titled &quot;Marijuana and Medicine: The Need for a Science-Based Approach.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">   Subcommittee Chairman Mark Souder (R-IN) is one of the House's most vehement opponents of medical marijuana. In remarks prepared for the hearing, Kampia castigates Souder for his long history of ignoring scientific findings on medical marijuana: &quot;Last year, during a debate on the House floor, Chairman Souder said, `[Marijuana] does not help sick people. ... There are no generally recognized health benefits to smoking marijuana.' Chairman Souder could not be more wrong. ... I hope that he eventually abandons his reliance on myths and lies and embraces an approach based on science.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">   Kampia will also address the multiple ways in which current federal policies continue to obstruct and delay scientific research into the medical uses of marijuana.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">      WHAT: Hearing of the Criminal Justice, Drug Policy, and Human            Resources Subcommittee, &quot;Marijuana and Medicine: The Need            for a Science-Based Approach.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">       WHO: MPP Executive Director Rob Kampia and other invited            speakers.
