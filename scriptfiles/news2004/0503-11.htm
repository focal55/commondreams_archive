<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - May 3 - Reports to be released in 12 states will warn that changes to the Roadless Area Conservation Rule would destroy most of the remaining roadless areas in our national forests that remain intact. The reports, embargoed for May 4, will mark the three- year anniversary of Agriculture Secretary Ann M. Veneman's pledge to uphold the provisions of the 2001 rule. Changes to the rule protecting the last pristine roadless portions of America's national forests threaten to ravage millions of acres with commercial logging, road-building and mining. Despite Secretary Veneman's pledge, Agriculture Undersecretary Mark E. Rey recently announced that changes to the rule were imminent. Environmental groups expect the changes to follow the Bush Administration's practice of favoring logging interests instead of protecting old- growth forests for future generations. These reports specifically deal with national forests in the following states: Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, Oregon, Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Idaho, Montana and New Hampshire. Government statistics show that a reversal of the Roadless Rule could result in the complete loss of roadless forests in 11 of the 50 states. Among them are the politically important states of Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri and Wisconsin. Online copies of the reports and high resolution forest photos will be available at <A HREF="http://www.ourforests.org" TARGET="_new">http://www.ourforests.org</A>. </FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">National Event: An event with Members of Congress and environmentalists will be held Wednesday, May 5, at Noon on the Cannon House Office Building Terrace in Washington, DC.
