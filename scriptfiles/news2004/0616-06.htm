<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">CAMBRIDGE, MA - June 16 - The Progressive Government Institute (PGI), a non-partisan educational organization dedicated to ensuring transparency and accountability in the Executive branch of the federal government, today released the names of four individuals who it believes are well qualified to serve as Secretary of Commerce</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;When the voters head to the polls this November they have a right to know what kind of leadership to expect,&quot; said PGI Founder Dal LaMagna.  &quot;One of the most important measures of that leadership is the kind of people our President surrounds him or herself with, starting with the individuals named to serve in the Cabinet.  PGI argues that presidential candidates should name Cabinet picks before the election, so that those decisions can be vetted by the electorate.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Senator Kerry is spending this week highlighting his differences with the Bush Administration on economic policy.  The PGI believes that Senator Kerry can further define the differences between his vision for the nation's economy by sharing with voters the names of individuals he would consider well qualified to serve in his Administration as Secretary of Commerce,&quot; said PGI Executive Director Ted Carr. &quot;The PGI has carefully vetted the resumes of several individuals who we feel would promote progressive economic policy if they were to be named to the post.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The PGI recommends the following individuals for Secretary of Commerce: *Jeff Gates: Former counsel to the US Senate Committee on Finance and President of the Shared Capitalism Institute.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">*Jerry Mander: President of the International Forum on Globalization and author of numerous books and articles on economic policy.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">*Jon Cavanaugh: Director of the Institute for Policy Studies and former economist for the U.N.
