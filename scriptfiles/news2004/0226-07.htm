<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - February 26 - Green Party leaders said today that a Pentagon report on security threats posed by global climate change demonstrates the need for drastic political action to bring the crisis and possible solutions to the attention of American voters.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;There's no better proof that we need a Green Party, with Green candidates running at every level from President to town council member,&quot; said Ben Manski, Wisconsin Green and co-chair of the Green Party of the United States.  &quot;The Bush Administration denies the human factor involved in global climate change and tried to hush up the report.  Most of the Democrats, including Sen. Kerry (D.-Mass.) will allow only minimal measures that barely step on the toes of industry.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The report, revealed by The Observer (U.K.) in a February 22 article (<A HREF="http://observer.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,6903,1153513,00.html" TARGET="_new">http://observer.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,6903,1153513,00.html</A>), warns of sharp drops and rises in average temperatures around the world, massive famines, threats to coastal cities, and wars (possibly nuclear exchanges) over resources in coming decades. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Commissioned by Pentagon defense adviser Andrew Marshall and written by Peter Schwartz, C.I.A. consultant and former head of planning at Royal Dutch/Shell Group, and Doug Randall of the Global Business Network, the report asserts that global climate change &quot;should be elevated beyond a scientific debate to a U.S. national security concern.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Green Party and its candidates have called for:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">-- Conversion from fossil fuel use to safe, clean, renewable energy (solar, wind, fuel cell), through legislation, regulation, and taxation</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">-- Reduction in emissions of carbon and other greenhouse emissions</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">-- Assistance for other nations, especially in poor and developing parts of the world, with similar conversion</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">-- An end to privatization and reckless exploitation of resources (especially fresh water, forests and biodiversity, energy sources); dismantling of international trade authorities and policies like privatization that benefited corporate investors instead of human populations and the environment</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">-- An end to public subsidies for fossil fuel and nuclear industries</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">-- Energy conservation, carbon taxes to discourage oil consumption, and improved energy-efficient public transportation</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">-- Renegotiation of the Kyoto Agreement to address the seriousness of the crisis</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Greens recall that the Clinton-Gore Administration, under pressure from fossil fuel lobbies, obstructed enactment of the Kyoto protocols in November 2000, during the international Hague conference on global climate change.  In March 2001, President Bush withdrew the U.S. from the agreement. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">A report just released by the Union of Concerned Scientists found a &quot;well-established pattern ofsuppression and distortion of scientific findings by high-ranking Bush administration political appointees across numerous federal agencies&quot; including climate change research, with &quot;consequences for human health, public safety, and community well-being.&quot;</FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
