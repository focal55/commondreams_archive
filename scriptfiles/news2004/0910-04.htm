<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - September 10 - The Coalition to Stop Gun Violence (CSGV) today lauded Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry for calling for an extension of the federal assault weapons ban. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Speaking at a town hall meeting in St. Louis, MO, Senator Kerry said &quot;;Every law enforcement officer in America doesn't want us selling assault weapons in the streets of America, but George Bush, he says, 'Well, I'm for that.'&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Kerry voted to extend the ban on March 2, 2004.  During the 2000 campaign, President Bush said he supported the ban, but has done nothing to save it. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Josh Horwitz, Executive Director of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, had this to say: &quot;John Kerry is the only candidate willing to stand up for law enforcement, and against a gun lobby that is increasingly out of touch with the public and mainstream gun owners.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">George W. Bush tells the American people to trust what he says.  But with the expiration of the assault weapons ban, the President is flip flopping and breaking his four-year promise on this important public safety issue.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
