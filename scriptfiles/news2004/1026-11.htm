<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- October 26 
--Every four years, voters head to the polls to select our nation's president. 
The process begins with a series of primaries and caucuses in the winter and spring 
and culminates with the general election in November. With the 2004 presidential 
election fast approaching on Nov. 2, the Census Bureau has culled from previously 
released statistical reports the following election-related facts:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>The 
Electoral College</b></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><B>8:</B> 
The number of states that gained electoral votes, based on Census 2000 results, 
since the last presidential election in 2000. Four of these states Arizona, Florida, 
Georgia and Texas each gained two votes. The other four California, Colorado, 
Nevada and North Carolina gained one apiece. <a href="http://www.census.gov/prod/2001pubs/c2kbr01-7.pdf" target="_new">http://www.census.gov/prod/2001pubs/c2kbr01-7.pdf</a></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><B>10:</B> 
Number of states with fewer electoral votes in 2004 than in 2000. Two states New 
York and Pennsylvania each lost two votes. The other eight Connecticut, Illinois, 
Indiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Ohio, Oklahoma and Wisconsin each lost one vote.
