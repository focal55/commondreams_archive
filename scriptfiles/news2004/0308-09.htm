<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - March 8 - Statement of Carl Pope, Sierra Club Executive Director</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;The Environmental Protection Agency announced the latest proposed additions to the Superfund National Priority List today, but the Bush administration has quashed the importance of this announcement by refusing to support the polluter-pays principle.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;The Bush administration is forcing communities to wait and taxpayers to pay for toxic cleanups. Already, 1 in 4 Americans, including 10 million children, lives within 4 miles of a toxic waste site that is considered a Superfund cleanup priority.  </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;Although it is important to continue to recognize sites like these 11 deserve attention, the rate of site listings and cleanups will continue their downward spiral under this administration. With the cleanup program bankrupt of polluter funds, even sites that make it on the list will compete with other important environmental programs for scarce resources.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;If corporate polluters are held responsible for their toxic messes, we can afford to protect the health and safety of American communities.  The Senate will have a chance to make this possible later this week.&#148;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>The EPA today announced a proposed rule for listing the following sites to the Superfund National Priority List:</B></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">IN - Jacobsville Neighborhood Soil Contamination - Evansville</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">LA - Devil's Swamp - Ewell Property - Scotlandville</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">MO - Annapolis Lead Mine - Annapolis</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">MS - Picayune Wood Treating - Picayune</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">NM - Grants Chlorinated Solvents Plume - Grants</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">NY - Diaz Chemical Corporation - Holley</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">NY - Peninsula Boulevard Ground Water Plume - Hewlett</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">PA - Ryeland Road Arsenic - Heidelberg Township</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">PR - Cidra Ground Water Contamination - Cidra</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">VT - Pike Hill Copper Mine - Corinth</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WV - Ravenswood PCE Ground Water Plume - Ravenswood</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>BACKGROUND</B></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>What a &#147;Site Listing&#148; Really Means for Toxic Cleanups</B></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Once a site is listed on the NPL, it takes on average 11 years before the cleanup is complete. And, without the polluter-funded trust fund, sites will now have to compete with other cash-strapped federal environmental programs. The rate of completed cleanups has fallen by 50 percent during the Bush administration compared to 1997-2000, and site listings have slowed down as well. The Bush administration has added an average of 23 sites a year to the Superfund list compared with an average of 30 sites from 1993 to 2000, a drop of 23 percent.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>Senate Expected to Vote on &#147;Polluter Pays&#148; Amendment during Budget Process</B></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">On Wednesday, Senators Corzine, Boxer and Lautenberg are expected to cosponsor an amendment to the Budget Bill. This is a straight reauthorization of the polluter pays fees.  Last year, a vote on a similar measure was defeated 43-56, and we expect another close vote this week.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>Report Details how Bush Administration Distorts Truth about Superfund Cleanups</B></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is misleading the public about the Bush Administration&#146;s failure to clean up toxic waste sites and protect public health, according to a new analysis released by the U.S. Public Interest Research Group and Sierra Club. The report, The Truth About Toxic Waste Cleanups: How EPA is Misleading the Public About the Superfund Program, analyzes actual EPA statements and shows that the Bush administration has provided confusing, misleading, and even false information to reporters and the public. The report is available at <A HREF="http://www.sierraclub.org/toxics/factsheets/cleanups.pdf" TARGET="_new">http://www.sierraclub.org/toxics/factsheets/cleanups.pdf</A>.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>Inspector General Report Documents Funding Shortfall for Superfund Cleanups</B></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">An Environmental Protection Agency Inspector General's report released in January admits that the Bush Administration failed to adequately fund the clean up of hazardous toxic waste sites in FY2003. The report, a response to inquiries from U.S. Senators Barbara Boxer and Jim Jeffords and U.S. Representatives John Dingell and Hilda Solis, admits to a $174.9 million shortfall in clean up funding and underscores the Bush Administration's willingness to leave communities at risk from toxic waste at Superfund toxic waste sites around the country instead of holding polluting companies accountable.
