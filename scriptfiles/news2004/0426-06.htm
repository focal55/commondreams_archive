<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - April 26 - The Senate Judiciary Committee has scheduled an April 27 confirmation hearing on the nomination of Starr Report co-author Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.  In a <A HREF="http://www.pfaw.org/pfaw/dfiles/file_322.pdf" TARGET="_new">report released today</A>, People For the American Way urges senators to reject the nomination.</FONT></p><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The PFAW report documents that Kavanaugh&#146;s legal career has been almost entirely devoted to right-wing partisan and ideological pursuits that raise deeply troubling questions about the impact he could have on Americans&#146; rights and freedoms as an appeals court judge. The report also notes that his legal resume &#147;pales in comparison&#148; to other D.C. Circuit nominees.</FONT></P><P> </P><P>            <FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;A lifetime appointment to a powerful federal appellate court should not be a reward for a highly partisan political warrior,&#148; said People For the American Way President Ralph G. Neas.  &#147;This nomination is more evidence that the White House views the nomination process as a political weapon rather than a means to getting excellent mainstream judges on the appeals courts.  President Bush is committed to political confrontation rather than bipartisan consultation and compromise.&#148;</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The PFAW report examines:</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&middot;        Kavanaugh&#146;s key role in the Bush Administration&#146;s nomination of far-right ideologues to positions on the federal appeals courts.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&middot;        Kavanaugh&#146;s coauthorship of the Starr Report&#146;s section on grounds for impeachment, an ideological document that even some conservative legal commentators have criticized.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&middot;        Kavanaugh&#146;s attacks on executive privilege as a Starr prot&eacute;g&eacute; and, in contrast, his leading role in developing and defending the Bush Administration&#146;s unprecedented and excessive claims to executive branch secrecy.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&middot;        Kavanaugh&#146;s relative inexperience, particularly compared with previous nominees to the important D.C. Circuit.  For example, of the ten cases he reported as his &#147;most significant,&#148; in two he did nothing more than file friend of the court briefs.  In one case, Kavanaugh filed a brief before the Supreme Court arguing for a ruling that would have left public school students vulnerable to a range of coercive religious practices. Kavanaugh&#146;s position was rejected by the Court 6-3.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">For more information on judicial nominations, see <A HREF="http://www.pfaw.org/go/independent_judiciary" TARGET="_new">http://www.pfaw.org/go/independent_judiciary</A></FONT></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
