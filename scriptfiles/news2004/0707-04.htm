<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - July 7 - Green Party members and candidates are appealing to movie-goers who were moved by Michael Moore's documentary 'Fahrenheit 9/11' to support Green candidates, including Green national nominees David Cobb and Pat LaMarche.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;We owe Michael Moore a debt of gratitude for exposing how the Bush Administration betrayed the American people,&quot; said David Cobb, the Green Party's nominee for President.  &quot;But voting for Democrats is not the solution.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Greens have maintained steady opposition to the invasion of Iraq, the USA Patriot Act, and other damaging Bush policies, while Democrats like Sen. John Kerry voted for them,&quot; added Cobb.  &quot;Sen. Kerry also voted to transfer war power from Congress to President Bush, in violation of the U.S. Constitution.  Kerry also wants to send 40,000 additional troops to Iraq.  We agree that it's time to evict Bush, but if you vote for Kerry because you oppose the war, you're throwing away your vote.  This is especially true if you vote in one of the 35 to 40 neglected non-swing states where the outcome on Election Day is virtually certain.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Many of the allegations of deceit and conflicts of interest presented in 'Fahrenheit 9/11' were raised by the Green Party in late 2002 and early 2003 &lt;http://www.gp.org/press_archive.html&gt;.  Greens disputed President Bush's claims that Saddam Hussein possessed WMDs, conspired with al-Qaeda, and represented an imminent threat to the U.S. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Green Party of the United States formally called for President Bush's impeachment in July 2003.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Michael Moore shows how Democrats failed to challenge radical Bush ideologues like Rumsfeld and Ashcroft,&quot; noted Pat LaMarche, the Green vice presidential candidate.  &quot;Democrats have also proven themselves capable of similar destructive and antidemocratic policies.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Remember that the Clinton Administration dropped bombs on Iraqi civilians,&quot; LaMarche added.  &quot;Clinton Secretary of State Madeleine Albright declared 'the price is worth it' when asked about the deaths of over half a million children because of the sanctions against Iraq ['60 Minutes', May 12, 1996].  And the 1996 Anti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, signed by Clinton, undermined constitutional protections five years before the USA Patriot Act.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;We challenge all those outraged by what they saw in 'Fahrenheit 9/11' to learn about David Cobb and Pat LaMarche, their local Green candidates, and the Green Party, the party that stands for We The People and the health of our planet instead of corporate power and military aggression.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Cobb/LaMarche 2004/<A HREF="http://www.votecobb.org" TARGET="_new">http://www.votecobb.org</A></FONT></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
