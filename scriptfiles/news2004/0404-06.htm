<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - April 2 - The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) today called for a Pentagon investigation of a photograph circulating on the Internet that apparently shows an American soldier mocking an Iraqi child.</FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">    The photo sent to CAIR seems to be of an American soldier standing next to two Iraqi children who are giving the thumbs-up sign.  One child holds a hand- lettered sign in English that reads: &quot;Lcpl Boudreaux killed my Dad, th(en) he knocked up my sister!&quot; (&quot;Knocked up&quot; is American slang for making someone pregnant out of wedlock.)  SEE: <A HREF="http://www.cair-net.org/images/lcpl11.jpg" TARGET="_new">http://www.cair-net.org/images/lcpl11.jpg</A> &quot;If the United States Army is seeking to win the hearts and minds of the Iraqi people, this is the wrong way to accomplish that goal,&quot; said CAIR Executive Director Nihad Awad.  &quot;Defense Department officials must take action to let military personnel know that such offensive behavior harms America's image and will not be tolerated.&quot;</FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">    Awad said CAIR has also received an anonymous letter from a soldier who recently returned from Iraq that claims a commanding officer engaged in inappropriate conduct with prepubescent Iraqi girls.  The letter states that the officer, who was named by the writer, referred to the girls as &quot;pre-rag heads&quot; and coerced local Iraqi leaders to provide them in exchange for protection by American soldiers. (The officer's military unit was also named in the letter.)</FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">    The letter-writer indicated revulsion at the officer's alleged actions. He or she wrote: &quot;The thought of all this makes me sick to my stomach.  I am afraid to bring this to anyone in the Army, because I am doubtful that they would believe a soldier over the Battalion Commander.&quot; &quot;These reports point to a disturbing pattern of behavior that needs to be addressed by our military,&quot; said Awad. </FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">    CAIR, America's largest Islamic civil liberties group, has consistently condemned all terrorist acts, whether carried out by individuals, groups or states.</FONT></p><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
