<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - February 24 - The national advocacy group Dads and Daughters launched a grassroots campaign today urging University of Colorado President Elizabeth Hoffman and the Board of Regents to fire head football coach Gary Barnett following allegations that the football program uses sex parties and strippers as a recruiting strategy.  So far, seven women, including Katie Hnida the only female to ever play for the team, have reported being raped by football players during Barnett's era as coach. </FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Barnett was placed on paid administrative leave after telling reporters, &quot;You know what guys do-they respect your ability.  Katie was a girl, and not only was she a girl, she was terrible.&quot;</FONT></P><P> <FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Barnett's response to Katie Hnida's claims is nothing less than justification of abuse, maltreatment and violence against women,&quot; Dads and Daughters Program Manager John Ball says. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Dads and Daughters is urging everyone to visit <A HREF="http://dads.e-actionmax.com/showalert.asp?aaid=526" TARGET="_new">http://dads.e-actionmax.com/showalert.asp?aaid=526</A> and send a letter to the President Hoffman and the Board of Regents, saying you want them to preserve the integrity of their great institution by immediately terminating coach Barnett.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Dads and Daughters (<A HREF="http://www.dadsanddaughters.org" TARGET="_new">www.dadsanddaughters.org</A>) is the national advocacy nonprofit for fathers and daughters.
