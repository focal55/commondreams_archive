<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BOSTON -- December 22 -- <em>You can work within the framework of democracy to bring about a better distribution of wealth.</em><br>  
- Dr. Martin Luther King, Nov. 4,1956<br>
<br>
<em>Every American deserves to be an owner in the American Dream</em>. <br>
- George W. Bush, Feb. 28, 2002<br>
</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since 2000, people of color have lost ground gained in the 1990s, according to a new report from United for a Fair Economy, &quot;TheState of the Dream 2005: Disowned in the Ownership Society,&quot; available to journalists on the web later this week.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As the nation prepares for the King holiday on January 17 and for the inauguration of President Bush on January 20, there will be overlap between the stated economic visions of the slain civil rights Leader and the President. But the actual policies of the first Bush administration moved the U.S. away from that vision, the report finds.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The State of the Dream&quot; presents evidence that African Americans, Latinos (Hispanics) and Asian Americans have gone backwards on unemployment, income and poverty since 2000, after making significant strides from 1988 to 2000.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While the President has taken credit for rising home ownership among people of color, in fact the report shows that black, Latino, Asian and Native American homeownership rates remain far below white rates. Inheritances, pensions, and ownership of stocks and businesses are also racially skewed.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While President Bush's inauguration speech is almost certain to contain references to his Ownership Society campaign theme, his promises to privatize Social Security and cut taxes will have the effect of further limiting asset-building opportunities for people of color, thus widening the racial wealth divide. The report suggests policy solutions that would lead to a true Ownership Society and to the realization of Dr. King's dream of equality.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable --></td></tr>
