<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - April 15 - Regular taxpayers will pay 315 percent more in 2004 to clean up toxic waste sites than in 1995, the year Superfund&#146;s polluter pays fees expired. As average taxpayers file returns this April 15th, corporate polluters nationwide continue to enjoy a $4 million-a-day tax holiday. </FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;Every April 15th, American families pay their taxes, but corporate polluters are let off the hook for toxic waste site cleanups,&#148; said Julie Wolk, Environmental Health Advocate for U.S. PIRG. &#147;By opposing the reinstatement of Superfund&#146;s polluter pays fees, the Bush administration is charging regular taxpayers, instead of polluting industries, for toxic cleanups,&#148; she said.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Since Congress allowed Superfund&#146;s polluter pays fees to expire in 1995 and the trust fund is now essentially bankrupt, the cost to American taxpayers has increased from $300 million to $1.27 billion, a 315 percent increase. This comes at a time when revenues from corporate taxes nationwide fell from $207 billion in 2000 to $132 billion in 2003, a decrease of 36 percent (Center for Budget Policy and Priorities). The Bush administration is the first administration that has not collected or supported reinstating the fees in the program&#146;s 23 year history, and the Senate recently rejected an amendment to reinstate the fees by a narrow margin.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;Without the polluter pays fees, toxic waste cleanup competes with every other government program for scarce taxpayer money&#147; said Wolk. &#147;Reinstating the fees would not only shift the burden of paying for toxic cleanups back on to polluting industries, but would also provide a dedicated funding source for the cash-strapped program,&#148; she continued. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Last year, the Bush administration cleaned up only 40 Superfund toxic waste sites compared to an average of 87 sites per year in the middle and late 1990&#146;s. The EPA Inspector General recently reported a $175 million funding shortfall for fiscal year 2003, and a recent General Accounting Office letter showed a 35 percent decrease in funding for the program since 1993. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;Communities across the country are at risk of chemical exposure and disease, and now they&#146;re being charged with the cleanup costs as well,&#148; said Wolk. &#147;Congress should reinstate Superfund&#146;s polluter pays fees, re-fund the program, and demand that the Bush administration start cleaning up more toxic waste sites,&#148; she concluded.</FONT></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
