- January 8 - Climate change will threaten extinction for a quarter of the world's species by 2050, according to a new report by leading international scientists and published by the magazine Nature.</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The United Nations said that this prospect is a major threat to the human population since most people on the planet directly rely on nature for their survival.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The terrifying scientific report highlights the scale and urgency of efforts needed to tackle climate change. This must involve urgent action by governments, industry and individuals to reduce their use of fossil fuels (coal, oil and gas) which produces carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Friends of the Earth today published in London five ways for the public to reduce its carbon emissions (see www.foe.co.uk/campaigns/climate).</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Friends of the Earth also called for urgent government action on climate, in particular in the United States. The US is the world's largest polluter, but President Bush has refused to sign up to the Kyoto climate treaty, the only international agreement to tackle climate change.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;This report highlights the terrifying impacts of global climate change. It is essential that we all take action to reduce the level of greenhouse gases we emit. If we don't, not only will the natural world be threatened, but also the lives and livelihoods of people across the planet. Governments and businesses are still not taking the issue seriously. Householders too have an important role to play,&quot; said Friends of the Earth International Vice-Chair Tony Juniper.</FONT></P><P></P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p></font><!-- #EndEditable -->
