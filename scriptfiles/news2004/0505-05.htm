<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">PHILADELPHIA, PA - May 5 - Companion bills introduced Tuesday in the Senate by Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-MA) and in the House of Representatives by Reps. Luis Gutierrez (D-IL) and Robert Menendez (D-NJ) propose changes in federal immigration law advocated by immigrant communities for years. </FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Immigrant, labor, faith and other community leaders welcome the Safe Orderly Legal Visas and Enforcement Act  (SOLVE), which (1) legalizes immigrants living and working in the US; (2) reunifies immigrants with family members; and (3) establishes a new temporary employment program with stronger protections for workers. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Staff in offices of the American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) around the country will be available for press interviews. Those cities are: Austin, TX ; Baltimore, MD ; Denver, CO ; Des Moines, IA ; Miami, FL ; Newark, NJ ; New York, NY ; Portland, OR ; Visalia and San Francisco, CA ; and Tucson, AZ. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;Immigrants are a vital part of the country but have been treated unfairly by a broken immigration system,&#148; states Camilo Perez-Bustillo, migration and mobility goal director for Project Voice &#151; AFSC's national immigrant rights initiative.  &#147;True immigration reform must provide a safe and sure path to permanent legal status, and ultimately citizenship, for all immigrants living and working in the U.S.   This legislation marks an important step forward.&#148; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">AFSC has long promoted respect for the basic human rights and dignity of immigrants and refugees living in the U.S. and migrants around the world.  Project Voice combines local and national work to strengthen the role of immigrants and immigrant-led organizations in setting the national agenda for immigration policy and immigrants' rights, and builds on the work of local offices throughout the U.S. by engaging in grassroots organizing with and service provision to immigrant communities. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;We don't just want jobs, but a better quality of life and this could only happen by living in this country,&#148; explained one undocumented immigrant from Tucson, Arizona.  &#147;For this reason, we come to look for better employment opportunities, better salaries, better opportunities, and a better legacy for our children. We don't want to do harm. We want to live within the law but we need opportunities.... All of us want the same thing: to be in this country legally as workers, as residents.&#148;  </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The AFSC carries out service, development, social justice, and peace programs throughout the world. Founded by Quakers in 1917 to provide conscientious objectors with an opportunity to aid civilian war victims, AFSC's mission and achievements won worldwide recognition in 1947 when it accepted the Nobel Peace Prize, along with the British Friends Service Council, on behalf of all Quakers.                       </FONT></P><P></P><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
