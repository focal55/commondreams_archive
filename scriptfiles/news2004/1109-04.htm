<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- November 9 -- Sierra Club today announced that its 2004 electoral efforts resulted in an unprecedented turnout by new environmental voters in a presidential election.  Sierra Club Votes, the national grassroots organization's &quot;527&quot; campaign, targeted nearly 500,0000 prospective environmental voters in nine battleground states with a massive canvassing, phone banking and direct mail effort.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Our goal was to make people who care about environmental issues vote in record numbers,&quot; said Sierra Club Executive Director Carl Pope.  &quot;We succeeded, and mobilized hundreds of thousands of new environmental voters.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sierra Club Votes staff and volunteers made 4.7 million direct contacts. These contacts included over 1 million door-knocks, 1.5 million phone calls, 2.2 pieces of direct mail and 350,000 emails.  Additionally, the campaign recruited more than 12,000 new volunteers - including more young people and minorities than ever before.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Sierra Club has never been stronger, and the environmental community building work we&#146;ve done over the last two years is the right foundation for the future,&quot; continued Pope.  &quot;Our members and new activists will continue to work together to hold the Bush administration, Congress and corporate special interests accountable for their destructive environmental policies and practices.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition to its Sierra Club Votes campaign, the Sierra Club mobilized its members and political committee in the 2004 election:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Member Communication:</b><br>Through its membership-focused program, Sierra Club mobilized its 750,000 members to vote and to help contact targeted voters in battleground states. More than 250,000 of these members in 20 states were specifically targeted through an intense program that included 1.5 million pieces of direct mail and 1.5 million phone calls.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Sierra Club Political Committee:</b><br>The Sierra Club Political Committee endorsed John Kerry, made over 220 House and Senate endorsements, and contributed nearly $400,000 to key races.  The Political Committee&#146;s support ultimately helped secure over 170 victories.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Sierra Club&#146;s Political Committee focused its financial resources on the closest, most competitive races in the country,&quot; said Joe Fox, Sierra Club Deputy Political director. &quot;The real strength of the Sierra Club continues to be our members, and there were Sierra Club volunteers in every state in the country working for endorsed candidates in Presidential, Senate, and House races.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Two of the greatest victories for the environmental community occurred in Illinois.  Senator-elect Barack Obama and Congresswoman-elect Melissa Bean will provide the kind of leadership - optimistic, strong-willed, and conscientious - so desperately needed in our nation's capital. Additionally, Connecticut voters wisely chose to retain Congressman Chris Shays, one of the strongest fighters for responsible environmental policy on either side of the aisle.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Sierra Club Efforts:</b></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pope predicted that the second term of the Bush administration will attempt to complete its dismantling of the environmental protections:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We can expect more government secrecy, more suppression of basic scientific data - even efforts to deny citizens the basic right to appear in court to defend themselves and their communities against environmental assaults and dangers,&quot; he said.  &quot;But our 750,000 members and new volunteers will not be deterred -- we will remain active to hold the Bush administration and Congress accountable. Congress will face the judgment of the voters in two years. And two years after that, both parties will again be vying for the White House.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The work the Sierra Club over the past two years - rebuilding environmental community across this country - is the right work.  We're just going to have to reach even more Americans to explain how the Bush administration's environmental policies are putting their families at risk,&quot; continued Pope.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greg Haegele, Sierra Club National Political Director, said the Club's direct contact program targeted people who care deeply about the environment, but had voted infrequently in recent elections. &quot;Our objectives were to educate them about the candidates' environmental records and to convince them to vote,&quot; Haegele said. &quot;Our polling and research indicated that there were enough voters who care about the environment -- especially protecting clean air, clean water and wilderness -- to make a difference.  The people we reached and motivated has demonstrated the power and potential of the environmental vote.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Sierra Club Votes campaign has been operating since January in New Hampshire and since August in eight other states, including Ohio, Florida, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Oregon, New Mexico, Minnesota and Wisconsin.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For the first time in its history, Sierra Club also incorporated an Internet outreach campaign into its voter education efforts. The Sierra Club Votes website and coordinated email outreach were used to recruit volunteers, educate voter targets, and disseminate information about events and issues.  The Internet outreach campaign also helped coordinate the Club's Road to Somewhere program, which permitted members in non-battleground states to help contact voters in battleground states. Through the Road to Somewhere program, Sierra Club members signed up to travel to targeted battleground state for canvasses, make phone calls to voters, and send  thousands of postcards to targeted voters.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>SIERRA CLUB VOTES EFFORTS - PHONE BANKING AND DIRECT CONTACT:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> OHIO:                                 Phone Calls:      23,926               Doors Knocked:    41,901  Volunteers:       266                  </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">OREGON :Phone Calls:         26,719                Doors Knocked:       20,632             Volunteers:          770</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NEVADA: Phone Calls:      28,143               Doors Knocked:    31,809 Volunteers:       665                  </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">FLORIDA: Phone Calls:         16,595 Doors Knocked:       27,032             Volunteers:          448</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WISCONSIN:Phone Calls:      25,298                Doors Knocked:    25,984               Volunteers:       305                  </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> MINNESOTA:                             Phone Calls:      5,715                 Doors Knocked:    24,093               Volunteers:       1,354</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> NEW HAMPSHIRE: Phone Calls:      20,983 Doors Knocked:    17,883               Volunteers:       564</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> NEW MEXICO: Phone Calls:      2,985 Doors Knocked:    2,003                Volunteers:       95                   </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> PENNSYLVANIA: Phone Calls:      45,573 Doors Knocked:    85,312                Volunteers:       1,442                </font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
