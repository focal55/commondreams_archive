<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - September 1 - The Republicans are trying their hardest to keep the hard core anti-choice movement under wraps during this convention, but sometimes they just can't help themselves. As reported by The New York Times, Senator Sam Brownback, Ralph Reed and other anti-choice leaders &#150; including White House and Bush Campaign staffers -- took advantage of a closed-door conservative rally yesterday to finally let loose and reveal the true intentions of the GOP: passing anti-choice laws, nominating anti-choice judges, and writing discrimination into the Constitution. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NARAL Pro-Choice America Interim President Elizabeth Cavendish said, &#147;We now see that when the cameras are away, the anti-choicers will play. The GOP has been trying to pull the wool over our eyes all week by using moderate voices to represent the party, while we know that George Bush and his anti-choice friends have been doing everything in their power to restrict a woman&#146;s right to choose. In fact, conservatives actually run the White House, Senate and the House, while moderates are only window dressing. Fortunately their plans to keep their real agenda secret were foiled and all of America can see the true colors of this anti-choice, anti-privacy Bush Administration.&#148;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With the headline, &#147;A Senator&#146;s Call to &#145;Win This Culture War,&#148; the article captured the goings-on of this top-secret meeting. Some highlights:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Billed as ''the Family, Faith and Freedom Rally,'' e-mail invitations were sent to Christian conservatives in New York for the convention. The event was organized by the Bush-Cheney campaign ''to celebrate America and President George W. Bush, and called Mr. Bush ''a conservative leader who shares our values, who takes a strong stand for his faith.''</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Courts have conducted ''a 40-year assault on the Constitution.'' Courts, he argued, had wrongly overstretched ''separation of church and state'' to mean ''removal of church from state.'' &#150; Sen. Brownback.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* &#147;We are going to keep moving this agenda forward.&#148; &#150; Sen. Brownback, vowing to introduce anti-choice bills in Congress.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Also in attendance were Bush deputy political director Christian Myers and Timothy Goeglein, the White House liaison to Christian groups, famous for comments such as the importance of having, &#147;a specific plan, a specific pro-life plan, to end abortion on demand. It's very important to say; it goes to a central tenet of the Republican Party.&quot;</font></p><p></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
