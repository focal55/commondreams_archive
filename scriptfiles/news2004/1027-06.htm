<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- October 27 -- Ralph Nader has received more than $125,000 from GOP donors and consultants, including $11,250 from donors to the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth &#150; a larger figure than previously reported, United Progressives for Victory said today. </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">UPforVictory.com's latest research draws on press reports and Federal Election Commission [FEC] filings and excludes unreported in-kind contributions made by the GOP in circulating and defending Nader's ballot petitions in many states. In particular, the report shows:</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Swift Boat Veterans for Nader? Eight donors to the infamous Swift Boat Veterans for Truth 527, who have given $31,000 to air attack ads on Kerry's military service, have also given Nader $11,250. [FEC]</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">         Right-Wing, Corporate Support. Five of the largest donors to the Club for Growth, a right-wing, anti-government, anti-tax group that has targeted moderate Republicans, have given $7,500 to Nader. They have given $450,000 to the Club for Growth in the past three election cycles.  Seven contributors to the Pro-Growth Action Team, another right-wing PAC, have given Nader $7,000. [FEC]</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">         Bush-Nader: GOP-Funded Ballot Efforts</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">        In Nevada, Republican operative Steve Wark raised $30,000 for Choices for America, a group that paid for signature-gathering for Nader's ballot effort in Nevada. [Las Vegas Review Journal, 8/25/04]</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">        In New Hampshire, Republican consultant David Carney, his wife and his business associate donated $6,000 in in-kind contributions to Nader to cover the cost of petition gathering that Carney initiated on Nader's behalf. That makes Carney, the former political director in George H.W. Bush's White House, responsible for 3 out of every 5 dollars that Nader raised in the Granite State. [FEC]</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">        In Michigan, the Republican party made a $3,400 in-kind contribution to Nader to help his petition-gathering; Nader made it onto the ballot there after the Republicans turned in 45,000 signatures for him and went to court for him. [FEC]</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">         The New Nader Raiders. Nader has received $20,000 from just seven millionaire couples who are major GOP contributors, including:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">        Jack and Laura Dangermond who gave Nader $2,000 apiece &#150; and $25,000 to the National Republican Congressional Committee. [FEC]</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">        Jeno Paulucci and his wife Lois, who have given Nader $2,000 each &#150; and $150,000 to GOP causes since 2000. [FEC]</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">        Richard and Pamela Egan, who raised $200,000 for Bush's inaugural and gave $2,000 each to Nader. [FEC]</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">        Thomas and Catherine Walkey, who gave Nader $2,000 each and &#150; this election alone &#150; have given more than $50,000 to the Bush campaign and GOP groups. [FEC]</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Right-Wing Support Comes as Progressives Abandon Nader</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pro-Bush individuals, operatives and groups have made a blatant effort to boost Nader's candidacy in battleground states to undermine Kerry's candidacy. That support has been crucial, given that Nader's longtime progressive supporters have abandoned him in 2004. Consider:</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">         Winona LaDuke, Nader's 1996 and 2000 running mate, has endorsed Kerry</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">         Nearly 80 &quot;Nader Raiders&quot; and former Nader associates released a statement opposing Nader's candidacy last week and are running ads in battleground states against him.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">         More than 70 members of Nader's 2000 Citizens Committee, including Noam Chomsky, Michael Moore and Susan Sarandon, have urged swing state voters to support Kerry.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">         More than 50 peace and anti-Iraq war leaders have released a letter opposing Nader's candidacy.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">         More than two dozen women's issues leaders, including feminist Gloria Steinem and the past and current presidents of NOW, have said they oppose Nader's presidential bid.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">         More than 30 national and state health care advocates have said they oppose Nader's candidacy.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">         Progressive leaders in swing states &#150; including Wisconsin, Oregon, Minnesota, Nevada and Colorado &#150; have spoken out against Nader's candidacy in those states. [See www.upforvictory.com for these statements]</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">         The Green Party chose not to nominate Nader to its ticket, as it had in 2000. The consumer advocate then turned to the Reform Party, which espouses anti-immigrant policies and was represented four years ago by arch-conservative Pat Buchanan. The Reform Party's chairman has called for the death penalty for abortion providers, vote for Bush in 2000 and told a Pittsburgh newspaper, &quot;I'm doing everything I can to make sure John Kerry never gets around the White House.&quot;</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Swing State Polls Suggest Nader Could Play Spoiler Role</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Not only has Nader abandoned by progressive leaders &#150; his backing at the grassroots level has also declined over the course of the 2004 campaign. In polling done by Democrat Stan Greenberg, Nader's support in battleground states has declined from 3 percent this summer to 1.5 percent now, according to The Washington Post. Nevertheless, the polls also suggest that, with the race between George W. Bush and John Kerry neck and neck in key battleground states, Nader is still poised to play the role of spoiler and could hand to Bush another four years in the White House. </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">         Nationally, the Zogby poll shows Bush and Kerry tied at 45% apiece, with Nader getting 2%.
