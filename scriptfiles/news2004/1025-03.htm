<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- October 25 -- A report released today by The Fund for Peace (FfP) calls for postponing elections in Iraq for six months. The situation in Iraq has reached the highest level of conflict risk in 12 social, economic and political/military indicators.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The study, the third in the series, was done with the Fund's conflict assessment methodology, which is updated every six months to evaluate progress towards sustainable security.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the last report, Dr. Pauline H. Baker, president of The Fund for Peace and author of the series, foresaw a &quot;Lebanization&quot; of Iraq, or civil war, as the likely outcome among five scenarios. The current report, covering the period from April through September 2004, concludes that this forecast has been fulfilled even more quickly than anticipated as violence grows significantly worse throughout the country. The high conflict risk does not merely reflect the increased violence, but rather deeper trends that show the impact of that violence on society as a whole.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A postponement of the elections scheduled for January 2005 is advocated. Other crises have shown that bad elections can be worse than no elections. As UN Secretary General Kofi Annan observed, legitimate elections cannot be held if current security conditions persist. Postponement of elections would give coalition forces more time to train and test Iraqi security forces, provide the interim government and the UN with more time to prepare for elections, and allow more political parties to form. The report also calls for NATO to speed up implementation of its training programs and for the U.S. Congress to authorize fast-track disbursement of appropriated funds to accelerate reconstruction and create jobs.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;As this and other recent reports have shown, the coalition forces invaded a 'paper tiger,'&quot; said Dr. Baker. &quot;Now we are riding that tiger, whose wounded fury is turning on itself and on us.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report can be accessed on The Fund for Peace website: <a href="http://www.fundforpeace.org/publications/reports/reports.php%20/" target="_new">http://www.fundforpeace.org/publications/reports/reports.php </a></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
