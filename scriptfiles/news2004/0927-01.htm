<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - September 27 - NARAL Pro-Choice America, the nation's leading advocate for personal privacy and a woman's right to choose, today released a new report detailing potential consequences of re-electing President Bush and a new TV ad campaign aimed at preventing that from happening.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report -- The Price of Four More Years -- spells out the ways in which Bush's re-election could both threaten a woman's right to choose and, ironically, lead to an increase in the number of abortions performed. It points to an upcoming &quot;perfect storm&quot; of potential Supreme Court vacancies and cases affecting reproductive rights that are likely to come before the Court, as well as the likely consequences of continuing current Administration policies such as blocking over-the-counter sale of morning-after pills, shifting funding toward abstinence-only programs, and banning aid to international women's health organizations.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Elizabeth Cavendish, interim president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, said: &quot;This report makes clear the extent to which President Bush has quietly made limiting women's choices a hallmark of his presidency. Continuing those policies for four more years could be absolutely devastating. That's why we're doing everything we can to stop that from happening. Our new TV ads take our campaign to the airwaves, complimenting a campaign that's already made a major impact on doorsteps, living rooms, phone lines and computer screens across the country.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cavendish released the report at a National Press Club event this morning, where she also previewed two television advertisements that will begin airing shortly in the battleground states of Oregon, Washington, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and New Hampshire. The ads echo the report's message, with one stating that &quot;We weren't quite sure what he'd doNow we know it matters,&quot; before reviewing Bush's record of rolling back privacy protections and other attacks against the right to choose. The other ad focuses on Bush Administration's actions -- such as the ban on most stem cell research -- that place ideology ahead of medical science. It urges viewers to &quot;Stop George Bush from playing doctor.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The ads and report can be viewed at <a href="http://www.BushvChoice.com" target="_new">http://www.BushvChoice.com</a>.</font></p><p></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
