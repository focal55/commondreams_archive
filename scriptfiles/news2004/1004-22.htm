<blockquote><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CHERBOURG, France -  October 4  - Greenpeace has been summoned to 

appear in the Cherbourg Court tomorrow, where it will face a request by 

Areva, through its subsidiary Cogema, and British Nuclear Fuels Ltd 

(BNFL), for an injunction preventing it from approaching within 300m of 

the two ships carrying plutonium from the US to France or within 100m of 

the Cherbourg harbour.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">



The nuclear companies are further seeking to keep the international 

organisation from getting closer than 100 m from the road that the 

nuclear transport will take from the harbour to the La Hague plant.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">



"Once more the nuclear industry is trying to gag peaceful protest. They 

have nothing to fear from Greenpeace, rather the courts time would be 

better focussed on the threat posed by 140kg of bomb grade plutonium 

traversing the high seas and France's highways," said Tom Clements of 

Greenpeace International.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The hearing will take place in Cherbourg Court 

tomorrow, Tuesday October 5th, at 2:30 p.m.



The plutonium, sent by the US National Nuclear Security Administration 

(NNSA), left the port of Charleston, South Carolina, on September 20. 

The Pacific Teal and Pacific Pintail, operated by BNFL, are approaching 

Cherbourg where an international flotilla of French, English and Irish 

protest vessels are waiting.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">



In contrast to recent statements made by the U.S. Government and BNFL 

this is not a one-off shipment of plutonium It is the first instalment 

of 68 tonnes of plutonium from US and Russian stockpiles to be put on 

the world's roads and seas at a time when terrorists are actively 

seeking such material.



</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greenpeace wants and immediate end to plutonium production and 

separation and believes current stocks both civil and military should be 

treated as nuclear waste not shipped around the world as reactor fuel.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 

Plutonium should be mixed with radioactive waste, solidified or 

vitrified, and stored. This approach would be cheaper, faster, safer, 

and more secure.



Earlier today, Eugene Riguidel, one of France's most famous sailors, 

John Castle of Guernsey and Pernilla Svenberg from Greenpeace 

International were released from the military arsenal in Cherbourg. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">They 

were arrested yesterday for mounting a peaceful protest inside the 

military port against the plutonium shipment.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">



"We have a military exclusion zone in Cherbourg against small yachts 

while plutonium transports are free to threaten the lives and 

livelihoods of everyone in their wake, it is the trade in nuclear bomb 

material that should be banned not peaceful protest," said Eugene 

Riguidel, after spending a night in jail.
