<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - September 9 - Today&#146;s bi-partisan vote in the House in favor of the Obey-Miller amendment to restore overtime protection for workers is a great victory for America&#146;s workers and a clear signal to the Bush Administration that it should repeal its pay cut. This is the fifth time Congress has voted to stop the Administration from slashing paychecks for up to six million workers. Despite intense lobbying efforts by the White House and the Department of Labor, today&#146;s vote to repeal portions of the new regulation that restrict overtime eligibility sends a strong message to the White House: America&#146;s workers, leaders and communities do not support his overtime pay cut, and President Bush should back off his threats to veto this important protection for workers&#146; overtime pay. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This victory is not the end of working men&#146;s and women&#146;s fight to save overtime pay. We call on the president to withdraw his veto threat or explain why he would kill the important Labor-HHS appropriations bill which provides funds for education and health care--simply because it includes the Obey-Miller overtime amendment to undo his pay cut. An overwhelming majority of America&#146;s workers and both houses of Congress have repeatedly called on the Administration to withdraw the new regulation but the Bush Administration has ignored their concerns. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The ball is now in the president&#146;s court. We will continue to keep up the pressure to translate today&#146;s win into a larger victory in the battle to save overtime pay.</font></p><p></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
