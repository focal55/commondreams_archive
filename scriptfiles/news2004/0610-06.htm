<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - June 10 - The Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence hailed the 4-1 ruling today by the Supreme Court of Rhode Island in Mosby v. McAteer, upholding the constitutionality of Rhode Island's long-standing law restricting the carrying of concealed weapons to persons with a legitimate need. The Court strongly rejected arguments by the gun lobby that an &quot;individual right to bear arms&quot; provides a right to carry hidden, loaded weapons in public. Instead, the Court held that the restrictive concealed carry law &quot;is reasonable legislative regulation of weapons that falls squarely within the state's police power.&quot;</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Brady Center's Legal Action Project filed an amicus (friend of the court) brief in the case in support of Rhode Island's restrictive concealed carry law. The Brady Center was joined in its amicus brief by the Rhode Island Police Chief's Association and the Rhode Island Chapter of the Million Mom March.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;We applaud the Supreme Court's ruling severely restricting the carrying of hidden, loaded weapons in public,&quot; said Daniel R. Vice, Staff Attorney for the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence. &quot;This ruling will protect the public and police officers from the proven dangers of concealed weapons.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Supreme Court of Rhode Island's ruling follows a similar ruling last year by the Ohio Supreme Court in the case Klein v. Leis, upholding Ohio's restrictions on the carrying of concealed weapons. The ruling by the Supreme Court of Rhode Island today is the first ruling in Rhode Island squarely addressing whether citizens have a right to carry hidden, loaded weapons in public.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Recent studies have linked laws allowing the carrying of concealed weapons to increases in violent crime. A 2003 study by prominent Stanford University Law and Economics Professor John Donohue examined crime data in states with lax concealed carry laws (referred to as &quot;shall-issue laws&quot; because police in those states are required to allow most people to carry concealed weapons) and concluded, &quot;The overwhelming story is that most states experienced increases in crime from the passage of shall- issue laws.&quot; There have been &quot;increases in violent crime, murder and robbery when shall-issue laws are adopted.&quot;(a)</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Brady Center's Legal Action Project was assisted in this litigation by the law firm Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence is a national non- profit organization working to reduce the tragic toll of gun violence in America through education, research and legal advocacy. Through its Legal Action Project, the Brady Center provides pro bono legal assistance to gun violence victims and public entities seeking to establish legal principles that will reduce gun violence. The programs of the Brady Center complement the legislative and grassroots mobilization efforts of its sister organizations, the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and the Million Mom March.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Note (a): John J.
