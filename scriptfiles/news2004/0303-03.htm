<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - March 3 - Statement of CSPI Executive Director Michael F. Jacobson </FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">McDonald&#146;s made a move in the right direction by stopping sales of &#145;supersized&#146; French fries and soft drinks. I hope it is an indication that the company is paying more attention to obesity, heart disease, and other diet-related diseases. McDonald&#146;s competitors should immediately follow suit and begin normal-sizing their largest menu items. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">However, the last time McDonald&#146;s made a big public-relations splash about nutrition&#151;by announcing that it would switch to a healthier frying oil&#151;it quietly went back on its word. If McDonald&#146;s truly cared about its customers&#146; hearts and arteries, it would reformulate its cooking oil to eliminate trans fat. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">And if McDonald&#146;s wanted to encourage healthy lifestyles and boost sales of its most healthful products, it would also put calorie counts right on its menu boards. After all, a large order of McDonald&#146;s French fries has 540 calories, and a medium fries has 450 calories. Consumers who are trying to maintain a healthful weight deserve to have that kind of information available while waiting in line. </FONT></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
