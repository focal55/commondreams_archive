Ballot measures that voters will consider on Tuesday include:</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">    MONTANA: Initiative 148 would permit medical use of marijuana with a physician's recommendation. Passage would make Montana the 10th state with a medical marijuana law and the second to pass one this year. </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">    OREGON: Measure 33 would strengthen Oregon's existing medical marijuana law by allowing registered patients to obtain their medicine from state-regulated dispensaries. </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">    ALASKA: Measure 2 would replace marijuana prohibition with a system of taxation and regulation.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">    ANN ARBOR, MI: Proposal C would amend the city charter to allow medical use of marijuana without fear of arrest under local law.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">    COLUMBIA, MO: Proposition 1 would permit medical use of marijuana without fear of arrest; Proposition 2 would treat misdemeanor marijuana possession cases as civil matters in municipal court, reducing penalties to a maximum $250 fine (instead of a possible year in jail), with no criminal record.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">    OAKLAND, CA: Measure Z would make personal marijuana offenses the lowest priority for local law enforcement and put the city on record as supporting taxation and regulation of marijuana.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">    BERKELEY, CA: Measure R would increase the amount of medical marijuana patients are allowed to possess and facilitate establishment of dispensaries.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">    MASSACHUSETTS: Voters in 12 districts will consider nonbinding public policy questions dealing with medical marijuana or removal of criminal penalties for personal marijuana possession by adults.</font></p><p align="LEFT">    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Election Day could be a watershed day for the marijuana policy reform movement,&quot; said MPP Executive Director Robert Kampia, who is available for interviews through election night. &quot;The White House drug czar's office has been using taxpayer money to campaign against our initiatives.  The White House's vigorous opposition to our ballot initiatives demonstrates how significant these initiatives are.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">    <i>With more than 16,000 members and 150,000 e-mail subscribers nationwide, the Marijuana Policy Project is the largest marijuana policy reform organization in the United States.
