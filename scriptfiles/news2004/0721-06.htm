<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - July 21 - Statement by David Hamilton, Director, Global Warming and Energy Program, Sierra Club</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> Today, the Sierra Club applauds the release of the Congressional Black Caucus' Energy and Climate report which details how global warming will disproportionately impact the physical and economic health of African-Americans.  We join the Caucus in calling on the Bush administration and leaders in congress to take action to curb this environmental crisis.  The current stalling and denial tactics of the Bush administration and Congressional leadership are leaving communities, especially low-income communities of color, at risk.    </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Caucus' independent report spotlights three important findings: that African Americans will be disproportionately burdened by the health effects of global warming; that African Americans are less responsible for contributing to global warming than other Americans; and that the policies intended to mitigate global warming can generate large health and economic benefits for African Americans if they are structured and implemented correctly.  America is a wealthy nation that has wrongly given itself the right to waste energy and pollute to a degree that disproportionately impacts low-income and minority communities, the environment, and other nations.  Our leaders have put the oil, coal, and gas industries ahead of our people and our planet.  This is something we cannot ignore.  </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">We congratulate the Congressional Black Caucus for leading the way toward understanding inequality of energy policy and global warming.  We look forward to working closely with the Congressional Black Caucus to take action in curbing global warming by instituting decisive measures to increase our nation's energy efficiency and use of renewable energy, and reduce our emissions of global warming pollution.</FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
