<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - July 23 - As the presidential  campaigns focus on the coveted undecided vote during the last  three months before the November election, they would be well  advised to focus on women voters, according to leading women's  groups. Today, more women than men are undecided about who they  will vote for in the presidential election, a review of recent  national and state polls prepared by Votes for Women 2004 shows. </FONT><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">   Women outnumbered men among undecided likely voters in a  number of national polls released recently, including:</FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">   -- Women are 65 percent of undecided voters nationwide,  according to the George Washington University's Battleground 2004  Poll conduced June 20-23 (n equals 1,000) by Lake, Snell, Perry ||  Associates and the Tarrance Group.
