<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - September 29 - In response to the Environmental Protection Agency's decision to send a Clean Air Act violation notice to Northern Indiana Public Service Corp., the Sierra Club issued the following statement by Nat Mund, Sierra Club Air Quality Expert:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Most Americans think it is their government's job to protect them from air and water pollution. Unfortunately, because of the Bush administration's weak record on environmental enforcement, the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) action against Northern Indiana Public Service Corp. is the exception rather than the rule. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;According to Justice Department files obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, there has been a 23% drop in the criminal prosecution of environmental lawmakers since the Bush administration took office in 2001.  Two new reports from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC), a university-connected provider of government data, also reveal that this administration is letting polluters off the hook.  In addition to tracking the overall drop in environmental enforcement, TRAC found that the U.S. Attorneys and their assistants in federal district offices across the country have declined to prosecute almost 60% of the cases against polluters brought to them since 2001.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Bush Administration is misleading the public by claiming to enforce the Clean Air Act after leaving it largely dormant for almost four years.   EPA should be moving forward to protect other communities from the dangers of power plant air pollution.  Earlier this month, the Sierra Club sued to enforce the Clean Air Act against a power plant in Ohio, because the EPA had failed to do its job. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;There is a better way.  Enforcing our clean air laws reduces soot and smog forming pollution and protects kids and others at risk from asthma attacks and other respiratory problems.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To access data on the drop environmental enforcement drop under the Bush administration, go to:  <a href="http://trac.syr.edu/tracreports/environ/65" target="_new">http://trac.syr.edu/tracreports/environ/65</a></font></p><p></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
