<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- November 15 -- This Thursday, the Project On Government Oversight (POGO) will present its  Beyond the Headlines Award to Mr. Anthony Rizzo, Jr., a whistleblower and security guard at the Salem &amp; Hope Creek nuclear power plants. POGO offers the award to honor an activist, journalist, politician, or whistleblower who has gone the extra mile to positively impact public policy. In the spirit of our mission, this award recognizes individuals who draw attention to problems and work toward permanent remedies.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mr. Rizzo is one of the most important nuclear power plant guards with whom POGO has worked. He collaborated with POGO for over a year explaining the system he has been a part of for his entire professional life. Mr. Rizzo came to Washington on numerous occasions on his own time in order to meet with over a dozen congressional offices to brief them about his experiences and concerns regarding nuclear security. A strong union leader, Mr. Rizzo then organized 40 of his colleagues to meet Commissioner Ed McGaffigan to make these concerns known to the <a href="http://www.nrc.gov/" target="_new">Nuclear Regulatory Commission</a> (NRC).</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mr. Rizzo made yet another trip to Washington, DC, in order to testify on behalf of guards before an NRC public hearing on training and overtime problems. He went head to head with industry representatives - the only nuclear security guard to attend this meeting. In large part because of Mr. Rizzo's commitment, the NRC issued policies to both increase training and to limit required overtime for guards. POGO is thrilled to present the Beyond the Headlines Award to Mr. Rizzo for his outstanding work.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mr. Rizzo will receive the Beyond the Headlines award on Thursday, November 18, 2004. The fundraiser will be held at 122 Maryland Avenue, NE, Washington, DC at 5:30 pm. Please contact POGO at (202) 347-1122 or danni@pogo.org to RSVP. Journalists may attend the event for free.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To learn more about Mr. Rizzo, read his hometown newspaper's editorial &quot; Whistle-blower's Award  Deserved&quot; at <a href="http://www.nj.com/editorials/gloucester/index.ssf?/base/news-0/1098173704256880.xml" target="_new">http://www.nj.com/editorials/gloucester/index.ssf?/base/news-0/1098173704256880.xml</a></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For more information about the Beyond the Headlines Award, go to <a href="http://www.pogo.org/p/x/beyondhead.html" target="_new">http://www.pogo.org/p/x/beyondhead.html</a></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>POGO investigates, exposes, and seeks to remedy systemic abuses of power, mismanagement, and subservience by the federal government to powerful special interests.
