<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - May 12 - Forty-two women's, health, and religious organizations (list below) today joined Members of Congress and a long list of medical and public health organizations and scientists in denouncing the Food and Drug Administration's denial of over-the-counter status for emergency contraception. </FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Speaking at a press conference convened by Congresswoman Louise M. Slaughter (D-N.Y.) and Congressman Christopher Shays (R-Conn.), representatives of the organizations called for quick and decisive action to make emergency contraception as widely and easily available as possible. Many of the 27 organizations- including the American Civil Liberties Union, NARAL Pro-Choice America, the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice, the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association, the National Partnership for Women and Families, and Population Connection-called for an inquiry into the FDA process. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The FDA's denial came after the FDA's own scientific advisory panel overwhelmingly recommended that emergency contraception-a higher dose of ordinary birth control pills-be made available to women over-the counter. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Many of the organizations echoed Congresswoman Slaughter's comment that &quot;The FDA claims it wants to protect young women's health, but it is clear they are concerned instead about partisan politics.&quot; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Half of all pregnancies in the United States are unintended. Medical experts agree that over-the-counter access to emergency contraception could dramatically reduce rates of unintended pregnancy and, therefore, the need for abortion. However, time is of the essence because emergency contraception must be taken within 72 hours after unprotected sex or contraceptive failure; taken without that time period, emergency contraception can reduce the average risk of pregnancy by up to 89 percent. Emergency contraception prevents a pregnancy; it has no effect on an established pregnancy and does not cause an abortion. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The organizations are: </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Abortion Access Project; American Civil Liberties Union; American Humanist Association; American Medical Women's Association; American Public Health Association; American Society for Emergency Contraception; Association of Reproductive Health Professionals; Catholics for a Free Choice; Center for Reproductive Rights; Clara Bell Duvall Project, ACLU-PA; Commission on Social Action of Reform Judaism; Disciples for Choice; Family Planning Advocates of New York State; Feminist Majority; Medical and Health Research Association of New York City, Inc; Minnesota Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice; NA'AMAT USA; NARAL Pro-Choice America; NARAL Pro-Choice New York; National Abortion Federation; National Association of Nurse Practitioners in Women's Health; National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association; National Health Law Program; National Network of Abortion Funds; National Organization for Women; National Partnership for Women and Families; National Women's Health Network; National Women's Law Center; Nebraska Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice; New York State Coalition Against Sexual Assault; People for the American Way; Pharmacy Access Partnership; Physicians for Reproductive Choice and Health; Planned Parenthood Federation of America; Planned Parenthood of New York City; Population Connection; Pro-Choice Public Education Project; Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice; Reproductive Health Technologies Project; Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States; United Church of Christ Justice and Witness Ministries; Women's Health and Family Planning Association of Texas</FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
