<p>LOS ANGELES - The kids have spoken, and it's Sen.
John Kerry with a convincing victory over President Bush on
Nov. 2.
<p>
 An unusual opinion poll that has correctly predicted the
winner of the last four presidential elections has given
Democratic challenger Kerry 57 percent against 43 percent for
Bush, according to results released on Wednesday.
 <p>
 The Nickelodeon cable channel, better known for programs
"SpongeBob Squarepants" and "Jimmy Neutron," conducted "<a href="http://www.nick.com/all_nick/specials/kidsPickThePresident/index.jhtml" target="_new">Kids
Vote</a>," an online survey of almost 400,000 children on Tuesday.
 <p>

 The latest Reuters/Zogby poll showed Bush and Kerry in a
dead heat two weeks before the Nov. 2 election. Other polls
also showed them in a statistical tie or Bush holding a slim
lead.
 <p>
 Nickelodeon, a unit of Viacom Inc., has organized its poll
every election since 1988, and has a 100 percent record of
picking the winner.
 <p>
 "The 'Kids' Vote' seems to work as a good barometer of the
actual presidential vote because, developmentally, kids between
the ages of two and 11 share the same opinions and outlooks as
their parents," said Cyma Zarghami, president of Nickelodeon
Television.
 <p>
 The survey was the final step in a yearlong political
awareness campaign on Nickelodeon.
