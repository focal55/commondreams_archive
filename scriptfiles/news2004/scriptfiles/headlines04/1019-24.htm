<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON - President Bush tried yesterday to make his resolute and unflinching conduct of the War on Terror the deciding factor of the US presidential election.

<p>He said that his opponent, John Kerry, failed to understand the post-September 11 world and was offering voters a “mirage of safety”.

<p>Accusing his Democrat rival of a “September 10 attitude”, Mr Bush said the choice facing voters was between a commander-in-chief who would stay on the offensive against terrorism and one who would take action only after the US was attacked.

<p>In the War on Terror there was “no place for confusion and no substitute for victory”, he said. “You can count on me to fight our enemies and to defend our freedom.”

<p>He said that Senator Kerry had alienated America’s allies in Iraq, including Britain, by dismissing their contributions.

<p>The President’s message was delivered at his most unlikely campaign stop so far, Marlton, New Jersey, regarded not long ago as Democrat territory and deeply hostile. But Mr Kerry’s lead in the Garden State has been whittled down from 16 points in early summer to nothing today. At the same time, Mr Bush’s campaign is making a late charge to win its 15 electoral college votes, which have not delivered a Republican presidential candidate since George Bush senior in 1988.

<p>Because of its proximity to New York, across the Hudson River, it was no coincidence that Mr Bush delivered his War on Terror message standing in New Jersey in front of a backdrop stating “A Safer America”. The state lost 700 citizens in the 2001 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Centre and Washington.

<p>Mr Bush’s visit to New Jersey was symptomatic of the aggressive strategy that his campaign has mapped out for the run-in to November 2, campaign aides said.

<p>Matthew Dowd, Mr Bush’s chief pollster, said that the President would spend two thirds of the final fortnight campaigning in states won by Al Gore in 2000 and only a third defending his own territory.

<p>Mr Bush was introduced by Bernard Kerrick, a former New York police chief familiar to millions of New Jersey voters as the man who was at the shoulder of Rudolph Giuliani, the former Mayor of New York, on 9/11. Republican campaign chiefs said that Mr Bush had seized the post-debate momentum and was well placed to win on November 2.

<p>Mr Dowd said that no challenger who trailed an incumbent after the prime-time presidential debates had gone on to win. Mr Kerry tried to get back on the offensive with a new campaign poster blaming Mr Bush for “the mess” the US found itself in and declaring it “time for a new direction”.

<p>“In Iraq, American troops are attacked 87 times a day. At home, the Bush Administration has acquired just 530 doses of licensed anthrax vaccine for America’s civilian population. In Afghanistan, the Bush Administration relied on warlords to go after Osama bin Laden,” the Kerry advert claimed.

<p>The Bush campaign also unveiled a new advertisement in tune with Mr Bush’s message of the day.

<p>It blamed Mr Kerry and “liberals in Congress” for being on the wrong side of every national security issue of the past 25 years.

<p>The independent presidential candidate Ralph Nader, who could ruin John Kerry’s chances, yesterday strongly criticised Tony Blair for backing the Iraq war.

<p>He portrayed the Prime Minister as a lapdog of President Bush, a man he describes as a monster, a “giant corporation disguised as a human being”.

<p>“Sometimes British prime ministers believe that the only way they can attain the world stage now is to side with the White House,” he said.

<p>Having realised his “big mistake” — the failure to find weapons of mass destruction — Mr Blair had been forced to rationalise the invasion as a movement to liberate Iraqis from a despot’s evil clutches.
