<p>&nbsp;Over the stern objections of a judge from Puerto Rico, a federal appeals court in Boston ruled yesterday that US citizens living in Puerto Rico do not have the right to vote in presidential elections.

<p>In a two-page opinion, the US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, relying on two prior rulings, concluded that the US Constitution does not confer voting rights on Puerto Rico, an American territory whose residents were granted US citizenship in 1917.

<p>But in a sharply worded dissent, Judge Juan R. Torruella of Puerto Rico wrote, ''What we have in this case is without question the creation and perpetuation of substandard, second-class citizens, with less rights than those enjoyed by the main class of US citizens."

<p>Torruella wrote that voting is a ''fundamental right inherent in citizenship" and that the US government has violated the civil rights of its citizens living in Puerto Rico and broken international treaties by refusing to let them vote in presidential elections.

<p>''This total inaction is particularly poignant at this moment in our history, when we seek to convince the inhabitants of far-flung places of the world of the democratic process and the validity of its expression through the ballot box," wrote Torruella.

<p>Close to 3,500 US soldiers from Puerto Rico have been dispatched to Iraq and Afghanistan, and 20 were killed in Iraq as of Sept. 28, the judge said.

<p>The Justice Department had argued to the court last week that the Constitution would have to be amended or Puerto Rico would have to become a state to make its residents eligible to vote for president.

<p>Puerto Rico lawyer Gregorio Igartua, who has appealed to the court three times, said he was not discouraged by the ruling, because Torruella, who had sided with the majority in the past, was now firmly on his side.

<p>He also pointed out that the majority opinion, by Senior Circuit Judge Levin H. Campbell and Judge Jeffrey R. Howard, suggested that the case was destined for a hearing before the full court and, ultimately, the US Supreme Court.

<p>''They leave the door open," said Igartua, adding that he plans to file an appeal Monday.
