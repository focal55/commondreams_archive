<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->LONDON - Oil-producing countries are among the most 
corrupt, a new survey by <a href="http://www.transparency.org/" target="_new">Transparency International</a> shows.
<p>
					  
					  A corruption perceptions index produced by the independent Berlin-based 
organisation shows that ''oil-rich Angola, Azerbaijan, Chad, Ecuador, 
Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Libya, Nigeria, Russia, Sudan, 
Venezuela and Yemen all have extremely low scores,'' Transparency 
International (TI) chairman Peter Eigen said at the announcement of the 
2004 index in London Wednesday.
<p>

Oil has emerged as the area that attracts most corruption, along with 
construction works and defence, the survey shows. The common corrupt 
thread ''that ties all three together is public procurement,'' Jeff 
Lovitt from TI told IPS. The right to drill, royalties and such 
transactions in the oil business mean a lot of dealing with government, 
and corruption follows, he said.
<p>
The ''curse of oil'' meant that many resource-rich countries were way 
down on the list of countries in the corruption index, and also 
therefore among the poorest, Lovitt said.
<p>
In oil-rich countries ''public contracting in the oil sector is plagued 
by revenues vanishing into the pockets of western oil executives, 
middlemen and local officials,'' Eigen said. 
<p>
TI is urging western governments to oblige their oil companies to 
publish what they pay in fees, royalties and other payments to host 
governments and state oil companies. ''Access to this vital information 
will minimise opportunities for hiding the payment of kickbacks to 
secure oil tenders, a practice that has blighted the oil industry in 
transition and post-war economies,'' said Eigen.
<p>
Iraq presents a particular need, he said. ''The future of Iraq depends 
on transparency in the oil sectoràwithout strict anti-bribery measures, 
the reconstruction of Iraq will be wrecked by a wasteful diversion of 
resources to corrupt elites.''
<p>
Corruption was perceived to be most acute in Bangladesh, Haiti, Nigeria, 
Chad, Burma, Azerbaijan and Paraguay. The cleanest countries were 
Finland, New Zealand, Denmark, Iceland, Singapore, Switzerland and 
Norway. 
<p>
Britain came in at position 11 followed by Canada (12), Germany (15) the 
United States (17), Chile (20), France (22), Japan (24), Israel (26), 
Brazil (59), Thailand (64), Sri Lanka (67), China (71) Egypt, Morocco 
and Turkey (77), India and Russia (90) and the Philippines (102). 
<p>
The index does not follow a predictable pattern of rich nations being less 
corrupt than poor ones, though that is the broad trend. Botswana comes 
at position 31 while Italy is 42, South Africa is 44 while Greece is 49.
<p>
But more than giving 'marks' to countries, the survey points to the 
dangers corruption brings to many of the developing countries 
particularly. TI estimates that at least 400 billion dollars is lost 
worldwide every year due to bribery in government procurement.

<p>
''If we hope to reach the Millennium Development Goal of halving the 
number of people living in extreme poverty by 2015, governments need to 
seriously tackle corruption in public contracting,'' Eigen 
said. ''Corruption robs countries of their potential.''
<p>
The TI index is a perceptions index; it does not arise from any direct 
study carried out by TI. TI calls it ''a poll of polls'' that 
reflects ''the perceptions of business people, and country analysts, 
both resident and non-resident.'' The corruption perceptions index draws 
on 18 surveys provided to TI between 2002 and 2004, conducted by 12 
independent institutions. 
<p>
This inevitably raises several questions about the methodology behind 
the TI index, where varying surveys by several institutions in different 
areas are brought together to give a single list of ranking.
<p>
But the surveys on which the index is based ''were selected on the basis 
that similar questions were asked about corruption,'' Lovitt said. A 
high confidence and low confidence range included in the TI index covers 
differences in survey methodologies, Lovitt said. The findings therefore 
have a ''high degree of consistency,'' he said.
<p>
The index also includes only those countries that feature in at least 
three surveys. TI acknowledges that ''many countries - including some 
which could be among the most corrupt û are missing because there simply 
is not enough survey data available.''
