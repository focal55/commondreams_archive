<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->STOCKHOLM - Bush Plans to Screen Whole U.S.  Population for Mental Illness', read the headline in the 
'British Medical Journal' (BMJ) and the project, with 
increasingly controversial drug treatment at its core, is 
underway as you read this.

<p>Structures to put the scheme in place have been developed under  a so-called "Federal Action Agenda," announced in Washington on 
Jun. 9, and include mandatory mental health screening, which the 
plan recommends be linked with "treatment and supports". 

<p>The plan's full details have yet to emerge as the Action Agenda  still "has not been publicly released," according to A Kathryn 
Power, director of the Centre for Mental Health Services (CMHS), 
the Bush administration body spearheading the effort. 

<p>Developed by the President's New Freedom Commission On Mental  Health, the effort, critics charge, is a pharmaceutical industry 
marketing scheme to mine customers and promote sales of the 
newest, most expensive psychiatric medications. 

<p>Under 'New Freedom', mental health screening of adult Americans  is slated to occur during routine physical exams while that of 
young people will occur in the school system. Pre-school children 
will receive periodic "development screens." 

<p>The plan highlights the importance of "state-of-the art  medications," though a scandal has erupted recently regarding 
the safety and effectiveness of the main types of drugs in 
question, particularly antidepressants. Deadly side effects of 
these drugs have already claimed numerous lives. 

<p>In mid-September an advisory committee of the U.S. Food and  Drug Administration (FDA) said antidepressants should come with 
"the nation's strongest warning" that they can cause suicidal 
behaviour in children and young people. 

<p>Recently released studies by famed British scientist and  psychiatrist Dr David Healy highlight that some of these drugs 
-- Seroxat and Prozac, both SSRI antidepressants -- appear linked 
to "homicidal" behaviour in adults. 

<p>"In the last 50 years, the quality of the new drugs hasn't  matched the hype," says Healy, author of 'Let Them Eat Prozac' 
and the person responsible for originally blowing the whistle on 
the link between antidepressants and suicide in children. 

<p>Asked if he was saying: "the major breakthroughs, then, have  been in terms of marketing instead of medicine," the drug 
scientist told IPS: "Yes, I think so. And that extends all the 
way to having their (the pharmaceutical industry's) policies put 
forward by departments of health in the U.S., the UK -- things 
like the Bush plan." 

<p>Drug therapy based upon "evidence-based" practices is the  backbone of the New Freedom programme's approach to treatment. 
But such practices have now been badly tarnished, with recent 
findings indicating the drug industry (called 'Big Pharma' by 
critics) has manipulated what were thought to be independent 
evaluations of new drugs, as reported in previous IPS stories. 

<p>An Apr. 24, 2004 article in the British medical journal  'Lancet' said while, "selective reporting of favourable research 
should be unimaginable," it appeared ongoing, distorting findings 
in the drug industry's favour. 

<p>"In a global medical culture, where evidence-based practice is  seen as the gold standard for care, these failings are a 
disaster," the journal charged. 

<p>While questions surround the dangers of drugging large numbers  of citizens, also notable is who the New Freedom plan envisions 
will deliver psychiatric services. 

<p>"Mental health education and training will be provided to  general health care providers, emergency room staff and first 
responders, such as law enforcement personnel and emergency 
medical technicians, to overcome the uneven geographic 
distribution of psychiatrists, psychologists and psychiatric 
social workers," the plan states. 

<p>New Freedom, "the future of mental health care in America," is  being rolled out on a state-by-state basis, according to Power, 
who added in an Aug. 13 speech that the federal role is to 
"motivate, facilitate, and compel change." 

<p>According to Dr John Read -- one of the Pacific's leading  authorities on psychiatric medications, author of 'Models of 
Madness', and director of clinical psychology at the University 
of Auckland -- "this is all about expanding the market for drug 
companies." 

<p>On Sep. 13, U.S. Congressman Ron Paul, a medical doctor,  denounced the Bush plan for its "forced mental health screening 
for every child in America," pointedly writing in a weekly column 
on his website, the "obvious beneficiary of the proposal is the 
pharmaceutical industry." 

<p>According to Paul, who had introduced an amendment to eliminate  funding for the plan, "Soviet communists attempted to paint all 
opposition to the state as mental illness." 

<p>Read also warns that the New Freedom plan "conjures up the  image of 'state control' of private lives, extending to an 
individual's feelings ... the increasing medicalisation of life 
problems and the massive increase in the prescriptions of all 
types of psychiatric drugs is 'social control'." 

<p>According to noted Canadian-American psychologist, educator and  author Dr Daniel Burston, "any number of things that are, or 
could be, perfectly natural responses to an environment can be 
construed as a sign of mental disorder." 

<p>Read told IPS that New Freedom appears essentially a way to  "identify between 10 and 20 percent of the population who will 
be labelled … offered nothing other than medication in 90 percent 
of the cases, and the drug companies will be laughing all the way 
to the bank." 

<p>According to Power, about 20 percent of the U.S. population is  "experiencing mental disorders in any given year." 

<p>In Auckland, on Sep. 16 to discuss the Bush plan, Power also  said that an associate, Charles Curie, was working with mental 
health ministers from Australia, New Zealand, and the UK to 
"promote policy innovation that fosters improved mental health 
around the world." 

<p>Allen Jones, a "whistleblower" who worked as an investigator in  the Pennsylvania State office of the Inspector General, voiced 
concerns similar to Read's, linking the pharmaceutical industry 
to many of those who developed Bush's New Freedom plan. 

<p>The industry was also instrumental in funding a prior state  scheme that became a "model programme" for the Bush plan, the 
Texas Medication Algorithm Project (TMAP). 

<p>TMAP favours use of the newest medications over older, much  less costly alternatives. 

<p>It began in 1995, while Bush was Texas' governor. According to  the 'British Medical Journal', "the project (TMAP) was funded by 
a Robert Wood Johnson (as in Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceuticals) 
grant and by several drug companies." 

<p>On Jun. 19 the journal reported that Jones believed "the same  'political-pharmaceutical alliance' that generated the Texas 
project was behind the recommendations of the New Freedom 
Commission." 

<p>According to his report, the effort would "consolidate the TMAP  effort into a comprehensive national policy to treat mental 
illness with expensive, patented medications of questionable 
benefit and deadly side effects," added the Journal. 

<p>New Freedom's pharma-oriented programmes have garnered  considerable and broad support, including from the Carter 
Centre, the organisation founded by former President Jimmy Carter 
and best known for its human rights programmes and election 
monitoring. 

<p>The "Carter Centre Mental Health Programme supports the spirit  and findings of the President's New Freedom Commission on Mental 
Health report," says Thomas H Bornemann, director of the 
Georgia-based centre's mental health programme. 

<p>He added the centre is, "engaged with a variety of partners to  use the report as a platform to transform the current mental 
health system. Two of the programme's annual Rosalynn Carter 
Symposia on Mental Health Policy (2003 and 2004) are dedicated to 
meet the challenges of funding and achieving these goals." 

<p>According to the Carter Centre, 77 percent of its budget is  devoted to health programmes, with 6.6 percent of the budget 
going to peace activities. Drug firms such as GlaxoSmithKline, 
Merck & Co, Pfizer, and Wyeth are listed as having provided one 
million dollars or more to the centre, as is the Robert Wood 
Johnson Foundation, associated with Johnson & Johnson and TMAP. 

<p>Queries to the Carter Centre regarding the total amounts of  pharmaceutical industry funding, the programmes that that money 
was applied to and the industry's influence on the centre's 
policy, were not answered. 

<p>But in the "donated goods and services" section of the notes to  the centre's annual report's financial statements it is written 
that unattributed "medication" donations totalled 54 million 
dollars in 2003 and 43 million dollars in 2002. 

<p>The centre's "total expenses" for those years were respectively  82 million dollars and 85 million dollars, according to its 
website. 

<p>Critics have repeatedly charged the drug industry with using  its wealth and power to manipulate advocacy and professional 
groups. The non-profit National Alliance for the Mentally Ill 
(NAMI) has repeatedly faced such criticism, as has the American 
Psychiatric Association (APA), which have both endorsed New 
Freedom. 

<p>Nevertheless, Read observed of New Freedom: "I would guess that  there are some ... who genuinely believe that these ideas are 
good for people, and completely unaware of the sinister 
connotations, the Orwellian connotations and the huge advantages 
for the drug companies ... well-meaning, but totally misguided 
people.".
