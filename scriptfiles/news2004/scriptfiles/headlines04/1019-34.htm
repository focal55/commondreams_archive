<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->MADRAS - Indian security forces last night shot dead Koose Muniswamy Veerappan, the leader of an ivory smuggling gang who is thought to have killed as many as 150 people.

<p>Veerappan, 60, had been on the run since the late 1960s when he started a smuggling career that saw thousands of elephants killed for their tusks and countless tons of sandalwood taken from the jungle.

<p>Over the years, he attained an almost mythic status. Famous for his elaborate handlebar moustache, he went into hiding in the vast rainforests of India's southern states of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala, earning himself the nickname Jungle Cat.

<p>He was revered by some as a Robin Hood-style hero who gave money to impoverished locals, and they in return helped him evade capture on several occasions.

<p>At least two Bollywood movies have been inspired by his story.

<p>But Veerappan was also a ruthless criminal who was said to have carried out his first murder at the age of 17. Among the atrocities he committed was the beheading of a forestry official in the mid-1980s.

<p>As well as carrying out kidnappings, his gang ambushed police patrols with bombs and landmines and stole equipment from the armed forces. Police said he terrorised locals by stringing up the bodies of suspected police informants from trees.

<p>Veerappan made headlines around the world in 2000 when his gang kidnapped 71-year-old Bollywood movie star Rajkumar and held him hostage for 108 days. Efforts to arrest the bandit were stepped up, but he still managed to kidnap a regional politician who was later found dead in the forest in 2002.

<p>"It is like the killing of a demon," said Rajkumar's son Raghvendra in reaction to the news of the bandit's demise.

<p>He finally met his end when paramilitary task force caught up with him outside a small village 200 miles south of Madras, the capital of Tamil Nadu.

<p>Veerappen and some of his gang were travelling in a vehicle - reportedly disguised as an ambulance - when they were challenged by police. After twice refusing to give himself up, he reportedly opened fire and was killed in the ensuing gun battle along with three other gang members.

<p>Reports that his body had been taken to the nearby city of Dharmapuri did not initially stop conspiracy theories from emerging. A report in today's Times of India said there was speculation about whether it was really Veerappan that was inside the vehicle when it was fired upon.

<p>Despite the vehicle being riddled with bullets, the paper also noted that Veerappan's body had only two head wounds, prompting speculation he may have been captured and killed by police at the weekend who then needed to stage the encounter with the vehicle.

<p>There were also reports that the body was missing the famous moustache and did not look like his photographs, but those and any other rumours were dispelled today when his body was shown in public.

<p>Political intrigue also surrounds Veerappan, with claims that some politicians were in his pay.

<p>"The political connections have to be investigated," said Abdul Kareem, a retired police official from the southern city of Mysore whose son, a policeman, was killed by Veerappan's gang in a 1992 ambush. "If they had caught him alive, lots of secrets would have tumbled out."

<p>Despite his brutal treatment of those who double-crossed him, the Associated Press quoted an intelligence source as saying that an associate of Veerappan's had given away his position before last night's gunbattle.

<p>"This was the easternmost point he has ever come ... in the last 15-20 years," task force chief K Vijaykumar said today. "It became more and more easy for us to monitor him. We watched him for several days." Veerappan was born in Gopinatham, a village in Karnataka, in 1952. He started smuggling in 1969 and was arrested for the first time in 1972.

<p>In 1996 he offered to surrender in exchange for an amnesty. But none was forthcoming, and in 1997 he kidnapped nine forestry service officials and held them for 44 days. Later that year he again offered to surrender in exchange for a two-year sentence and a cash pay-off.

<p>In July 1993, Veerappan - who had a 20 million rupee (£243,000) bounty on his head - was said to have strangled his newly born female baby because she was the third girl in a row born to him.

<p>When asked what she saw in him, Veerappan's shepherdess wife Muthulakshmi reportedly replied: "His moustache and notoriety."
