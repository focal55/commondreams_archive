<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - January 29 - The National Director of Win Without War today called on the media to more aggressively challenge the White House&#146;s ongoing promotion of proven falsehoods regarding the Iraq invasion and weapons of mass destruction. Failure to do so, he claimed, has led a majority of Americans to believe as fact erroneous claims the administration continues to repeat.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;Having successfully misled the world about the reasons for going to war, the Bush Administration now seems to believe that it can distort its way out of embarrassing disclosures that Saddam Hussein did not have weapons of mass destruction stockpiled and that there was no meaningful linkage between Osama bin Laden and Saddam,&#148; said former Congressman Tom Andrews, National Director of the anti-war organization. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">A Gallup Poll last month showed 53% of Americans still believe Saddam Hussein was personally involved in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the U.S., largely because of exaggerated claims by the Administration to support its invasion of Iraq. The Administration continues to speak of the linkage in the face of clear evidence that it is wrong.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>Media is Part of the Solution</B></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;When 53% of the American people believe a lie, it is cause for alarm. It is the responsibility of a free press and the legislative branch of government to set them straight. The American people are not stupid. They are victims of what appears to be a carefully calibrated, conscious effort by the White House to make people believe that which is not true. Americans are confused because the Administration wants them that way,&#148; Andrews said.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;The media shares responsibility for this alarming problem and is a key to its resolution. It has a special obligation to expose the truth and call the deceptions what they are. For starters, reporters need to be informed and ready to challenge misstatements,&#148; he said.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Andrews cited as an example the Thursday interview of Vice President Cheney with National Public Radio&#146;s Juan Williams. Cheney reiterated the tired claim that military trailers found in Iraq were bio-weapons labs on wheels. He called them, once again, &#147;conclusive evidence&#148; that Saddam had a significant WMD program.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;Mr. Williams let this stand. By not questioning or challenging this claim, he left NPR&#146;s audience reason to accept a lie as the truth!&#148; Andrews said. The former Maine Congressman said Congress also was failing to exercise its responsibility. &#147;As an equal, separate branch of government the Congress has an obligation &#150; no matter which party controls it &#150; to be a watchdog over actions and claims by the executive branch. Truth should not be partisan.&#148;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In a January 9 interview, Cheney quoted an article in The Weekly Standard as his &#147;best source&#148; on ties between Saddam and Osama. But the Defense Department dismissed the article as inaccurate and said information leaked to the writer was harmful, &#147;deplorable and (possibly) illegal.&#148;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;It is time for the Bush White House to take responsibility and admit that it was wrong when it told the American people that weapons of mass destruction and links between Saddam and the terrorism of 9/11 were legitimate reasons for invading and occupying Iraq,&#148; said Andrews. &#147;But whether it does so or not, the media and the Congress should be speaking out and exposing White House deceptions.&#148;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><I>Win Without War is a coalition of national organizations representing broad constituencies that aim to keep America safe by advocating that international cooperation and enforceable international law provide the greatest security for the United States and the world.
