<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">SAVANNAH, GA - June 10 -  <A HREF="http://www.jubileeusa.org" TARGET="_new">Jubilee USA Network</A> and the <A HREF="http://www.50years.org" TARGET="_new">50 Years Is Enough Network</A> expressed disappointment this afternoon at the failure of the G-8 leaders to take decisive action by committing to support 100% multilateral debt cancellation for impoverished nations.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Over the past several days press reports had indicated that UK Prime Minister Tony Blair had put forth a proposal for 100% debt cancellation for poor countries. This afternoon, however, the leaders of the Group of Eight wealthy nations instead announced a meager 2-year extension of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative instead of a definitive commitment to full cancellation.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;At this critical moment, when every minute another African child dies of AIDS, the global community needs 100% cancellation of multilateral debt without harmful conditions,&quot; said Marie Clarke, National Coordinator of the Jubilee USA Network. &quot;By failing to seize the opportunity, the G-8 has once again chosen baby steps over bold action.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">HIPC, even by IMF and World Bank standards, has failed to provide an exit from the debt crisis. After eight years of the HIPC program, two things are clear: when countries have more access to their own resources they use them well, but HIPC has been too little relief, too slow, for too few countries and with too many conditions.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Indebted countries need 100% debt cancellation without deadly conditions on the occasion of the IMF and World Bank's 60th Anniversary year,&quot; said Njoki Njehu, Director of the 50 Years is Enough Network. &quot;Cancellation of impoverished country debt by the IMF and World Bank must be financed through their own resources.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Bi-partisan legislation calling for the IMF to cancel 100% of the debts of 50 nations without harmful conditions has been introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives. The JUBILEE Act, HR 4511, will legislate what the G-8 has failed to propose.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Jubilee USA Network, the 50 Years Is Enough Network, and the broader debt cancellation movement will turn up the heat on global leaders and the multilateral creditors in the coming months. &quot;President Bush and the G-8 might have found it hot in Georgia in June, but we will turn up the heat even more in this election year on the issue of debt cancellation. We will be bringing our calls for 100% cancellation to  pulpits throughout the country, to the halls of Congress with the JUBILEE Act, and to the streets,&quot; said Clarke.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Earlier this week, Jubilee USA Network released a letter signed by more than 250 religious leaders, including Jesse Jackson and leaders of Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish denominations calling for 100% cancellation of the debts of impoverished nations without harmful conditions in light of the AIDS crisis.</FONT></P><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
