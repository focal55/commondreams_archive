<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - February 6 - Statement by Rep. Henry A. Waxman:</FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;This commission may provide President Bush with political cover, but it won't result in the investigation that the nation needs. The scope of the commission insulates the White House from review. The commission has been told to ignore the elephant in the middle of the room, which is how the intelligence was used and misused by President Bush, Vice President Cheney, and other senior Administration officials. A commission appointed and controlled by the White House cannot be truly independent.</FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;A much better approach would be a congressionally appointed commission like the one Senator Corzine and I have been proposing for months.&quot;</FONT></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
