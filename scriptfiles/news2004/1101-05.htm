Rapoport is the president of Demos, a non-partisan, non-profit organization </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">and former Secretary of the State of Connecticut. He said today: &quot;As the election approaches, chilling reports continue to surface of major efforts to prevent people from voting. Legions of partisan 'challengers' are being readied for the polls tomorrow; misinformation has been spread on polling dates and locations; and tens of thousands of new Ohio registrants are being challenged. All appear to be organized campaigns. ... But it's not too late to avoid disaster. Even at this late hour many election officials are taking steps to maximize access, and minimize disruptions at polling places. All should follow that lead.&quot;</font><br>

President of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, Crowley said today: &quot;We are concerned that challenges of voters will effectively suppress the vote of homeless people and other poor people. We have evidence that homeless and poor people are way over represented among those who have been </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">challenged in Ohio and quite likely Pennsylvania.&quot;</font><br>
