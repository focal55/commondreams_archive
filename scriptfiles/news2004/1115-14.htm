<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- November 15 -- The Children's Defense Fund and 72 other groups concerned about protecting the health of children teamed up today to urge Congress to restore nearly $1.1 billion in expired State Children's Health Insurance (SCHIP) funds before adjourning for the year. The money reverted to the Treasury on Sept. 30 when the federal government closed the books on its 2004 budget. In letters to every House and Senate member, the coalition argued that it is essential to use these funds to maintain insurance coverage of children in low-income working families. Never before has Congress left these funds in the Treasury rather than use the money to provide health coverage to children who need it most.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SCHIP serves nearly 6 million children, but more than 200,000 could lose coverage by 2007 if the money is not rescued from this &quot;use-it-or-lose-it&quot; rule. Otherwise, six states are likely to have insufficient 2005 funding to cover all children enrolled in their SCHIP programs, and by 2007 as many as 18 states could face similar shortfalls.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Before sending today's letter to every representative and senator, CDF(r) gathered endorsements from a broad swath of public and private organizations concerned with children's health coverage. Signatories included Catholic Charities USA, United Way of America, the Jewish Council for Public Affairs, National Association of Public Hospitals and Health Systems, Ascension Health, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the National Council of La Raza, Church Women United, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the National Urban League, the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) and the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors. A complete list is below.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It would be unconscionable for the 108th Congress to call it quits without protecting these children only weeks after finding the time and energy to lavish absurd tax breaks on wealthy corporations,&quot; said Gregg Haifley, deputy director of government relations for the Children's Defense Fund. &quot;In the few remaining days of this lame-duck session, our lawmakers have the opportunity to salvage the full benefit of this program in the same bipartisan spirit that helped to create it seven years ago.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Here is a complete list of signatories:</b></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN) Alan Guttmacher Institute Alliance for Children and Families Ambulatory Pediatric Association American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry American Academy of Pediatrics American Association of People with Disabilities American Association on Mental Retardation American Dental Hygienists' Association American Friends Service Committee American Pediatric Society American Psychiatric Association American Psychological Association AMERIGROUP Association for Community Affiliated Plans Association of Medical School Pediatric Department Chairs Ascension Health Association of Maternal &amp; Child Health Programs Catholic Charities USA Catholic Health Association of the United States Center for Adolescent Health &amp; the Law Center for Medicare Advocacy Inc.
