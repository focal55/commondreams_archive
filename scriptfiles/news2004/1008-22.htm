WASHINGTON -  October 8 - The monthly Bureau of Labor Statistics jobs report in out and the outlook
in sluggish at best. A mere 96,000 jobs were added for
the month of September and the unemployment rate remained about 5.4%. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An
increase of 150,000 jobs per month is needed in order to
 just match regular growth in the work force.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
The numbers mean that Bush will end his term with fewer people working
than he began.
 In January 2001 there were roughly 800,000 for jobs than in September
2004. For the first time since 1932 or when Herbert Hoover's
 Administration has a president seen fewer employed when he ended his 
 term
than when he started.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The record is even worse when the private sector situation is reviewed 
 and
government employment figures are excluded. (Government
 jobs increased over 900,000 between January 2001 and September 2004). Looking at the private sector alone there were 1.7 million
 fewer jobs in September 2004 than in January 2001.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> During this anemic recovery wage and salary increase has been a mere 
 1%
and contrasts sharply with the average 4% gain during past
 recessions. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the past year alone average hourly and weekly earnings 
 in
real terms have actually declined. Wages now comprise the
 lowest share of GDP since 1929, and the typical American family has 
 lost
about $1500 in real income since Bush's term began in
 2001.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The irresponsible fiscal policy of the Bush Administration, with its
staggering deficits and the resulting trillions in federal
 debt, means the average middle income taxpayer pays  $21,068 more in 
 taxes
in the 2001-2006 period.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"These numbers fly in the face of the patented White House and Bush
campaign rhetoric that the economy and job growth are strong
> and adds yet another level of dishonest relations with the American
public," notes ADA spokesperson Don Kusler.
