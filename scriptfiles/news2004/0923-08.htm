<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - September 23 - &quot;President Bush received millions in campaign donations from those who are profiting from his Medicare plan,&quot; said David Donnelly, director of Campaign Money Watch. &quot;Insurance companies, HMOs, and pharmaceutical corporations will make more than $147 billion from Bush's Medicare plan, while seniors get record increases in Medicare premiums.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The ad buy is scheduled to begin on television stations in the Green Bay/Appleton and La Crosse/Eau Claire media markets Thursday. The two markets cover some of the most hotly contested regions in the country.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is the second advertising ad Campaign Money Watch has run. Earlier in September, it ran advertising on the Bush/Cheney White House giving a multi-billion, no-bid contract to Halliburton Corporation, Cheney's former company. The Vice President received a $20 million severance package from the company in 2000 and still receives annual compensation worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Bush must be held accountable for the special interest deals that have marked his Administration,&quot; commented Donnelly. &quot;He has place rewarding his donors above the public interest time after time, and voters need to know.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Both ads can be viewed at <a href="http://www.campaignmoney.org" target="_new">http://www.campaignmoney.org</a>.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Campaign Money Watch is a 527 group that works to hold elected officials accountable for the special favors they do for political contributions.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ad script :&quot;George Bush got his: $6.6 million in campaign cash from insurance and big drug companies,&quot; the ad entitled &quot;The Bill&quot; begins, showing a picture of Bush speaking to seniors. &quot;And they got theirs: Bush's Medicare plan gives insurance and drug corporations $147 billion. What did you get? The bill. Wisconsin seniors alone will pay $106 million more in Medicare premiums next year, a record increase. Don't give Bush and the insurance companies another chance to gut Medicare.&quot;</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
