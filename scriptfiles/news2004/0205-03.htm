<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - February 5 - A comprehensive report released today by People For the American Way explores mismanagement and failed policies in Florida's education system under Governor Jeb Bush and Education Commissioner Jim Horne.  </FONT></p><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The report, &quot;Dereliction of Duty: Florida's Failed Education Policy,&quot; is an accounting and analysis of how Florida's policies on vouchers, tuition tax credits, homeschooling, high stakes testing, class size reduction and even the management of the state's pension fund have done a disservice to students, parents and taxpayers. </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Dereliction of Duty is available at: <A HREF="http://www.pfaw.org/go/derelictionofduty" TARGET="_new">http://www.pfaw.org/go/derelictionofduty</A></FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;This report will help People For the American Way's more than 45,000 Florida members and supporters shed light on the failings of the state's education policies,&quot; said Ralph G. Neas, president of People For the American Way.  &quot;Instead of providing a strong public education for every child, Governor Bush's administration has zealously pursued risky experiments and played political games when they should have been developing meaningful policies.&quot;</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The report documents:</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&sect;         The atrocious oversight and mismanagement of Florida's voucher and tuition tax credit programs that has prompted state officials to conduct five separate investigations.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&sect;         Florida's diversion of more than $8 million in public taxpayer money to support students who are being homeschooled, even though state law forbids the use of state funds for home schools.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&sect;         The enormous disparity between the inflexible expectations forced on public schools, and the complete lack of meaningful accountability for private schools accepting public dollars. </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&sect;         Governor Jeb Bush's campaign to repeal the voter approved amendment to reduce class size, while ignoring special interest exemptions and corporate tax breaks that cost the state billions each year.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&sect;         The Florida Board of Administration's decision to invest the state's employee pension fund, which includes the earnings of education employees, in a company that is not only financially unstable and unprofitable, but that also threatens public education by attempting to privatize it.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Dereliction of Duty  is one of a series of reports on vouchers, tuition tax credits, the voucher movement and other important issues in education.
