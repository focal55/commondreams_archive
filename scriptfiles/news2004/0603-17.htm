<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - June 3 - WILLIAM CHRISTISON, <A HREF="mailto:bill@christison-santafe.com">bill@christison-santafe.com</A></FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Christison is former director of the CIA's Office of Regional and Political Analysis. He said today: &quot;It's a good thing that Tenet resigned, with one major proviso -- Tenet should not become a scapegoat for others above him. What Tenet essentially did was allow himself to be co-opted, making it a practice to tell the administration what they wanted to hear rather than to be an independent check.... There is a need to split the covert operations half from the analytical half of the CIA. To have one person in charge of both creates enormous conflicts.&quot;</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">RAY McGOVERN, <A HREF="mailto:rmcgovern@slschool.org">rmcgovern@slschool.org</A>, <A HREF="http://www.veteransforcommonsense.org/article.asp?id=538" TARGET="_new">www.veteransforcommonsense.org/article.asp?id=538</A>, <A HREF="http://www.accuracy.org/press_releases/PR031803.htm" TARGET="_new">www.accuracy.org/press_releases/PR031803.htm</A></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">McGovern worked as a CIA analyst for 27 years. Before the invasion of Iraq he co-authored the article &quot;Cooking Intelligence for War&quot; with other members of the steering group for Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity. He said today: &quot;The Senate was just about to come out with a report excoriating Tenet's tenure at the CIA. He's clearly being served up as a sacrificial lamb. The irony is that he did everything he could to help the administration in its drive for war in Iraq, so there's some poetic justice here. Clearly, the problem wasn't really 'intelligence failures' -- the decision for war was made well before the National Intelligence Estimate. Rather, the intelligence was made to fit what the administration wanted.&quot; McGovern is available for a limited number of interviews.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">JO WILDING, <A HREF="mailto:www.wildfirejo.org.uk">www.wildfirejo.org.uk</A></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Currently in California, Wilding will be in the U.S. until mid-June.

Osheroff is a veteran of World War II and the Spanish Civil War, fighting with the Lincoln Brigade. He said today: &quot;For me, World War II was a chance to fight the same fight I had joined in the Spanish Civil War, the fight against fascism. I was married with a child and likely wouldn't have been called up in the draft, but I enlisted in the infantry. I served in France -- after Normandy, in what were mostly mop-up operations and police work -- and then in Germany. One thing people ignore about World War II is the harsh racism. I remember lectures in the Army from officers who said directly: We are fighting two wars. One against people like us (the Germans) and one against those cowardly yellow bastards.... In Army records, those of us who were leftists and had fought in Spain were labeled 'premature anti-fascists,' and it's clear we were treated differently. In my infantry unit I was recommended for Officer Candidate School, but once my background became known that was rescinded. When my unit shipped out to Europe, I was left behind. I had to fight to get them to allow me to go overseas and fight. All this talk about the 'greatest generation' typically leaves out the people who fought in the Spanish Civil War.&quot; Osheroff continued his activism, working in the civil rights movement in Mississippi in 1964, and has made two films: &quot;Dreams and Nightmares&quot; and &quot;Art in the Struggle for Freedom.&quot;</FONT></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
