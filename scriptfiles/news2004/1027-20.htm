<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SAN FRANCISCO, CA -- October 27 -- Drummond Pike, founder and president of The Tides Family of Organizations, has been selected to receive the Outstanding Foundation Professional Award at the 2004 National Philanthropy Day Awards Luncheon in San Francisco. This annual award is sponsored to thank a foundation professional who individually initiates creative nonprofit efforts and who works to develop partnerships in the nonprofit and philanthropic sectors. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Drummond was selected for his unique contributions in developing the field of grantmaking. Throughout his career, he has supported grassroots and public interest organizations through environmental and social change philanthropy. Drummond founded Tides Foundation in 1976 and pioneered the use of donor advised funds to support grassroots and public interest organizations on a national scale. Drummond's entrepreneurial approach to promoting healthy societies also led to the creation of Tides Center, the largest fiscal sponsorship organization in nation. Through his leadership, Tides has also fostered the creation of Groundspring.org, Thoreau Center for Sustainability and Tides Canada Foundation. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We are pleased to recognize the legacy and significant contributions of Drummond Pike to the philanthropic sector,&quot; said Lorraine Carlson, President of the Board, Association of Fundraising Professionals, Golden Gate Chapter (AFP-GGC).  &quot;Drummond's vision to move away from the traditional foundation model changed philanthropy as we knew it in the seventies, and he is still challenging and changing the way that it works today. His goal of removing obstacles between people and their good intentions has grown into a impressive network of organizations providing a full spectrum of services to donors and nonprofits.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Over the course of its 28 years, Tides Foundation has granted more than $400 million to thousands of nonprofit organizations working for positive social change. The foundation works with individual and institutional donors committed to a society based on fairness, equal justice and equally shared economic opportunities and it promotes environmental sustainability and a robust democratic process. In addition, Tides provides management and support services to more than 25 small private foundations, as well as the membership-based Threshold Foundation. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Drummond is one of seven leaders in philanthropy who will be honored during this year's National Philanthropy Day events in the Bay Area hosted by The Association of Fundraising Professionals, Golden Gate Chapter, and Northern California Grantmakers. He was chosen for the award by unanimous agreement of a committee of nonprofit, philanthropic, and community leaders from throughout the Bay Area. The award ceremony will take place at a gala luncheon on Monday, November 15, 2004, at the San Francisco Marriott. It is hoped that the giving spirit of the awardees will inspire other individuals and organizations and spread the impact of community-giving.
