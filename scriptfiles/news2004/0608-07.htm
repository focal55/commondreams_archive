<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">BRUNSWICK, GA - June 8 - Alternative G8 Summit activities moved into full gear today as over 200 people gathered at two war memorials in the small southern rural town of Brunswick to honor the soldiers and citizens who have lost their lives as a part of the human cost of United States empire building and to call for an end to the US occupation of Iraq. The memorials were followed by a sweltering 3 mile march to the Fair World Fair and The Other Economic Summit - alternatives to the G8 meetings.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The three hour event began with a powerful dedication by Rev. Timothy MacDonald of  new memorial at the courthouse brought by the protestors which read: &quot;In memory of the victims of US empire.  Those who have died from racism, genocide and environmental destruction. We honor you. We will not forget.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">This dedication was followed by a short walk to a separate and significantly less celebrated war memorial for people of color.  At the base of a single monument, walkers placed flowers and listened as Harry Lyde, local activist and Georgia Green Party treasurer, addressed the crowd.  Youth activists led chants and energized the participants with dancing and games.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Today's march was a huge success, said Lisa Fithian, National Co-Chair for United for Peace and Justice. &quot;In a rural community of 15,000 people that has been occupied by an army of over 20,000 police and military personnel, it's amazing  to have several  hundred people marching for an end to the war and it sends a powerful statement to G8 leaders.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Over 30 groups are participating in alternative G8 activities, many represented during the march.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The march represented the rich diversity of the local, state, national and international groups that are working together to hold the G8 accountable to the needs of six billion people,&quot; explained Carol Bass of Georgia Peace and Justice movement.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The march was decorated with colorful banners and creative props, though all the activities were held under the intrusive eye of Federal undercover and video surveillance.  A giant 8-ball was rolled along the ground, a huge round parachute banner was carried by dozens of people, and a giant banner led with the words: Bush Lied: Who Died?</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The G8 is a slap in the face to the people who built and live in this community,&quot; said Yolanda Carrington, a member of Hip Hop Against the Racist War. &quot;The meetings are being held on a private island that local citizens can't even get to.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">For more information about the mobilization against the G8 Summit, visit <A HREF="http://www.nog8.org" TARGET="_new">http://www.nog8.org</A></FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
