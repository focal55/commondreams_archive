<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - September 21 - The Department of Justice&#146;s $280 billion claim against the tobacco industry, which goes to trial today after five years of pretrial wrangling, is being hailed as a victory for public pressure. The eight corporations facing litigation, including Philip Morris/Altria, the world&#146;s largest tobacco corporation, are being called on to answer charges of collusion and deception that stretch back more than 50 years. Since 1993 Infact has been challenging Philip Morris/Altria to stop promoting tobacco to young people and to stop interfering in public health policy.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The tobacco industry has been lying to the public about the dangers of its products for decades,&#148; says Kathryn Mulvey, Executive Director of Infact. &#147;Now, despite moments when it appeared that the Bush Administration was ready to let Big Tobacco off the hook, we are at the beginning of a trial that is an important step forward in holding the tobacco industry accountable for years of deceit and death.&#148;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The trial begins as global momentum continues to build behind the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), the world&#146;s first public health and corporate accountability treaty. The global tobacco treaty becomes international law after the 40th country ratifies; 31, including Norway and India, have already done so. While the Department of Justice case will potentially bring the tobacco industry to task in the United States, the FCTC will change the way it does business in countries around the world.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Infact spokespeople will be available for comment throughout the trial.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
