<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- November 8 -- Americans between the ages of 18-29 were the only age group to support John Kerry over George Bush, and they did so by a 10-point margin (54-44).   At least 21 million voted in Tuesday&#146;s presidential election&#151;an increase of 20% from the 2000 election, according to MoveOn Student Action.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Young people proved on Tuesday that we could not be deceived and we could not be ignored,&#148; said Ben Brandzel, Project Director of MoveOn Student Action.  &#147;We would not be manipulated away from our core values of truth, compassion, and intelligent government, giving Kerry a 10 point margin of victory. As a generation, we held our ground and proved progressives have a bright future in this country.&#148;</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Because youth turned out in higher numbers than ever before, they kept pace with this year&#146;s exceptional turnout of Americans of all ages. Voters between the ages of 18-29 constituted the same proportion of all voters as they did in 2000&#151;about 18% of the vote.  Performance was the highest youth turn out since the voting age was lowered to 18.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to the Center for Information &amp; Research on Civic Learning &amp; Engagement, youth voted at an even higher rate than the national average in the battleground states. In the 10 most contested states, the voting rate for young people was 64% of eligible voters, up 13% from 2000. This compares to turnout of 47% of eligible youth in the 40 remaining states. (<a href="http://www.civicyouth.org/" target="_new">www.civicyouth.org</a>)</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MoveOn Student Action, a group with 215,000 members affiliated with 2,300 universities in all 50 states, was one of the driving forces behind the progressive youth turnout. The largest network of any student based political group, MoveOn Student Action organized more than 960 public screenings of Going Upriver, a documentary about John Kerry&#146;s heroism in Vietnam, on campuses across the country. In October, the group launched its &#147;Feel a Draft?&#148; campaign to engage students about the possibility of a military draft.  Campaign ads about a possible draft ran in 150 college papers, and 71,000 students signed an open letter to President Bush that ran in the New York Times demanding an end date to youth casualties in Iraq. On Election Day, members made over 25,000 turnout calls to progressive youth in key swing states.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MoveOn Student Action is a project of the MoveOn Voter Fund and Click Back America.
