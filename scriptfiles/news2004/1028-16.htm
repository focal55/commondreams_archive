<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- October 28 -- As part of its long- term nonpartisan voter education, registration and mobilization campaign, &quot;Que Nada Nos Detenga&quot; ('Let Nothing Stop Us'), the government of Puerto Rico successfully registered more than 336,000 mainland Puerto Rican and Hispanic voters since that campaign was launched in July 2002. In three crucial battleground states -- Florida, Pennsylvania and Ohio -- nearly 100,000 new voters have been registered.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">More than 3.4 million Puerto Ricans reside on the U.S. mainland where, according to the Synovate 2004 Hispanic Blue Book, 75 percent of eligible Puerto Ricans are registered to vote -- more than any other Hispanic subgroup. In the last ten years, the Puerto Rican population on the mainland has grown by nearly 30 percent, including over 100 percent growth in Florida, 59 percent in Pennsylvania and 44 percent in Ohio.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Trends indicate that neither Republican nor Democratic parties can take the Puerto Rican vote for granted, and candidates who pay attention to the issues that are important to the Puerto Rican community are most successful. 2002 exit poll data revealed 87 percent reported that issues that &quot;impact and affect Puerto Rico&quot; are very important to them. 2003 exit poll data indicated 49 percent of Puerto Ricans chose to vote because they felt &quot;their voice needs to be heard&quot; and 28 percent because &quot;the issues are important to me,&quot; yet only 20 percent indicated they voted because the &quot;candidates or parties on the ballot need my support.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- 3.4 million Puerto Ricans live on the mainland U.
