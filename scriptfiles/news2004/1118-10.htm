<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- November 18 -- The agency that is supposed to police compliance with federal civil service rules is itself circumventing civil service rules by using no-bid consultants and hiring on a non-competitive basis, according to Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER). <a href="http://www.osc.gov/" target="_new">The U.S. Office of Special Counse</a>l (OSC) is withholding records about its own personnel practices, including a contract with a former Catholic boarding school headmaster to serve as a special consultant, according to a lawsuit filed today by PEER under the Freedom of Information Act.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The current Special Counsel, Scott Bloch, is a religious conservative who had served as deputy director in the Justice Department&#146;s Office of Faith-Based Initiatives. Since becoming Special Counsel in January, Bloch has brought in a series of special consultants and non-competitive hires, including recent graduates of the ultra-conservative Ave Maria law school. A number of these new non-competitive hires have been assigned to career positions, working for career managers who had no input into their selection; in fact, the managers did not meet the new hires until the day they started work &#147;Scott Bloch&#146;s personnel practices are taken straight from The DaVinci Code rather than the civil service manual,&#148; stated PEER </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Executive Director Jeff Ruch, pointing to what OSC staff members call Bloch&#146;s own &#147;palace guard.&#148; &#147;The mission of the Special Counsel is to protect the merit system, not subvert it.&#148;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PEER is seeking copies of contracts and work products for &#150;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Alan Hicks, a former headmaster of St. Gregory&#146;s Academy, a Catholic boarding school, who left in the wake of allegations concerning priests sexually preying on young students. Bloch has retained Hicks as a special consultant; and</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">No-bid management consultant contracts let by Bloch. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although OSC is struggling under large and growing backlogs of whistleblower disclosures and complaints, Bloch has increased the number of confidential assistants that report directly to him. By PEER&#146;s estimates, approximately 10 percent of the OSC staff positions are now personal picks by Bloch. Recently, the long-time Director of OSC&#146;s own Department of Human Resources, and her primary assistant, recently resigned their positions, and left the agency, giving only a few days notice.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ironically, one of OSC&#146;s duties is to oversee administration of the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/04foia/" target="_new">Freedom of Information Act</a> (FOIA). Yet, when PEER requested its contract files, OSC sent a form letter stating that &#147;due to the departure&#148; of its FOIA officer &#147;and a queue of pending requests&#148; that there would be some delay in response. Three months later in September, PEER appealed OSC&#146;s continued non-response and received another, virtually identical form letter. PEER&#146;s suit under FOIA seeks the contract records it originally sought in June.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The purpose of the Freedom of Information Act is to increase the transparency of government but Mr. Bloch appears dedicated to keep his agency&#146;s operations opaque,&#148; Ruch added, noting that Bloch has yet to release any documents about what he has done since he took office in January. &#147;How can OSC monitor the Freedom of Information Act when it does not even answer its own mail?&#148;</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
