<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- December 2 -- NARAL Pro-Choice America, the nation's leading advocate for personal privacy and a woman's right to choose, today praised Representative Henry A. Waxman for releasing a devastating report &quot;The Content of Federally Funded Abstinence-Only Education Programs.&quot; The Waxman report highlights the dangers posed to teens by abstinence-only programs-programs the Bush administration has funded over comprehensive sex education. Abstinence-only funding skyrocketed under President Bush to approximately $170 million a year and reaches millions of our nation's young people.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to the report: &quot;over 80 percent of the abstinence- only curriculacontain false, misleading, or distorted information about reproductive health.&quot; The report points to studies that prove that abstinence-only programs actually increase the likelihood that participants will engage in risky behaviors by providing false information such as suggestions that condom use does not prevent the transmission of HIV/AIDS.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nancy Keenan, President of NARAL Pro-Choice America, said: &quot;I applaud Representative Waxman for having the courage to expose the many ways this administration is endangering the health and lives of young Americans. They are actually requiring teachers to teach students blatant and dangerous falsehoods. NARAL Pro-Choice America has consistently fought for comprehensive, age appropriate sex education in our classrooms. Only when people are armed with complete and accurate information can they make appropriate decisions. It's time for Congress to wake up to the truth and block George Bush's relentless drive to shift federal funding into these ideological programs instead of responsible, medically accurate sex education.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among other findings the report shows that abstinence-only curricula:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Teach stereotypes that reinforce male sexual aggressiveness: &quot;A male is usually less discriminating about those to whom he is sexually attracted. Women usually have greater intuitive awareness of how to develop a loving relationship.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Blur science and religion: The curricula uses religious views on when life begins as scientific fact. The blastocyst is described as &quot;snuggling&quot; into the uterus at the beginning of uterine implantation.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Undermine girls' achievement: &quot;Women gauge their happiness and judge their success by relationships. Men's happiness and success hinge on their accomplishments.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For more information on the report visit http://www.prochoiceamerica.org and the entire report is available at http://www.democrats.reform.house.gov/</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
