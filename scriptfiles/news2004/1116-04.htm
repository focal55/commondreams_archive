<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">FLORIDA -- November 16 -- A state appeals court has struck down Florida's voucher program, holding that it clearly violates a provision of the Florida Constitution by funneling tax money to religious schools.</font><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 1st District Court of Appeal, sitting as a full panel en banc, ruled Nov. 12 that Gov. Jeb Bush's Florida Opportunity Scholarship Program (OSP) fails to pass constitutional muster. </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This is the third straight defeat for vouchers in Florida,&quot; said Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United. &quot;Giving tax money to religious schools clearly violates the state constitution, and court after court has ruled that way. I hope Gov. Bush and state legislators get the message that you can't force Florida taxpayers to support religion.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Americans United is among the organizations supporting the lawsuit challenging the state voucher law. The groups contend that the program violates Article I, Section 3 of the Florida Constitution, often called the &quot;no-aid provision,&quot; which bars direct or indirect diversion of tax aid to &quot;any sectarian institution.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Florida court agreed, declaring that to uphold the program it would have to &quot;ignore both the clear meaning and intent of the text and the unambiguous history of the no-aid provision.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Observed the court, &quot;There is no dispute in this case that state funds are paid to sectarian schools through the OSP vouchers. Thus, we hold the OSP unconstitutional under the no-aid provision to the extent that the OSP authorizes state funds to be paid to sectarian schools.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The court also rejected arguments that the U.S. Constitution's religious freedom provisions mean that the state must provide vouchers. It noted that the U.S. Supreme Court rejected this argument in a ruling earlier this year in the Locke v. Davey case.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Florida legislators passed the voucher program in 1999, with strong backing from Gov. Bush. It provides vouchers for parents in public schools deemed &quot;failing.&quot; More than half of the program's participants are attending religious schools.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Religious schools taking part in the program may require students to attend religious instruction classes but cannot compel them to pray or take part in other forms of religious worship.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The ruling in the Bush v. Holmes case was 8-5, with an additional justice partially agreeing with both the majority and the dissent. Due to Florida law, the ruling will be automatically appealed to the Florida Supreme Court.<br></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
