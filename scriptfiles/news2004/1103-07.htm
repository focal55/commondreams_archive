<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NEW YORK, NY -- November 3 -- Hundreds of gay and lesbian rights supporters converged on New York's Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual &amp; Transgender Community Center on Election Night to watch the returns. Election results, meanwhile, showed that constitutional bans on same-sex marriage passed in 11 states.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The outcome highlights that the battle for equality for our community is far from over,&quot; says Richard Burns, executive director of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual &amp; Transgender Community Center, the largest LGBT community center on the East Coast.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Marriage, the composition of the U.S. Supreme Court, adoption rights and HIV education are just a few of the important issues that are on the line for our community. It's critical that we start strategizing and mobilizing now,&quot; adds Miriam Yeung, the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual &amp; Transgender Community Center's public policy &amp; government relations director.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To that end, the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual &amp; Transgender Community Center is sponsoring a free community summit titled &quot;What Next? What's in Store Post-Election '04?&quot; on Thursday, November 18, at 6:30 p.m. Members of the community, including activists and legal scholars, will discuss the results of Election 2004 and begin strategizing for the future. The entire LGBT community is invited to attend and make their voices heard. The Center is located at 208 West 13th Street in New York City.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Established in 1983, the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual &amp; Transgender Community Center is the largest LGBT multi-service organization on the East Coast and second largest LGBT community center in the world.
