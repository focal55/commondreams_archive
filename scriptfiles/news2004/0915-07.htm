<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">GYEONGJU, SOUTH KOREA - September 15 - As hundreds of public health advocates meet in Gyeongju, South Korea, this week for the 7th Asia Pacific Conference on Tobacco or Health (APACT), momentum is building for the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC). As of today, 31 countries have ratified the FCTC, which enters into force and becomes international law after 40 ratify it. The US-based corporate accountability organization Infact, other members of the Network for Accountability of Tobacco Transnationals (NATT), and public health groups throughout the region are urging Asia Pacific countries to be among the first 40 to ratify.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;This is truly an exciting time in the movement challenging the tobacco industry,&#148; says Kathryn Mulvey, Executive Director of Infact. &#147;So many of our allies in the Asia Pacific region have shown great strength and courage over the years in helping to make this treaty a reality. Now, momentum is truly on our side and the winds of change are blowing. The APACT conference is a great opportunity to push the treaty ahead in this critical phase.&#148;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nearly five million people die every year from tobacco-related industries, an epidemic driven by transnational tobacco corporations like Philip Morris/Altria, British American Tobacco (BAT) and Japan Tobacco International (JTI). The Asia Pacific region has been particularly impacted by the expansion of tobacco transnational corporations, and in a show of inspiring solidarity, many countries from the region have been leaders throughout the FCTC process.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Once implemented, the treaty will reverse the rising death toll directly attributable to tobacco, saving millions of lives in the process, and will change the way that tobacco corporations do business both in the Asia Pacific region and around the world.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;As we approach the 40th ratification of this historic treaty, tobacco industry attempts to stall the process seem to be intensifying across the globe. We are urging government officials and public health advocates to remain vigilant to Big Tobacco&#146;s dirty tricks,&#148; says Mulvey.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since FCTC negotiations began, global tobacco corporations have attempted to water down and delay the treaty. According to Philip Morris/Altria&#146;s internal documents, the tobacco giant received advice from the notorious public relations firm Mongoven, Biscoe and Duchin that &#147;a comprehensive strategy to influence the&#133;UN/WHO policies would be enhanced significantly by establishing an NGO&#133;&#148; Documents show Philip Morris/Altria profiled regions to determine those countries that would support the Convention, and also be susceptible to industry influence. Philip Morris/Altria also opposed central provisions of the treaty, including the ban on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship (such as the corporation&#146;s notorious Marlboro Man).</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The FCTC, initiated by the World Health Organization, sets precedents for international regulation of other industries that threaten health, the environment and human rights, such as the pharmaceutical, oil, water, and food and agribusiness industries.</font></p><p></p><p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">###</font></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
