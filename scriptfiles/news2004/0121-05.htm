<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">DURHAM, N.C. &#150; January 21 - A team of investigative reporters in Iraq have uncovered a pattern of waste and abuse among U.S. companies receiving multi-billion-dollar &#147;reconstruction&#148; contracts in the country, including massive over-charges for projects; shoddy work or a failure to complete tasks; and ignoring local experts who contend they could do the job better and cheaper.</FONT><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The in-depth report by Pratap Chatterjee and Herbert Docena, published in the latest issue of Southern Exposure magazine (<A HREF="htpp://www.southernstudies.org" TARGET="_new">www.southernstudies.org</A>), is one of the first on-the-ground accounts of how U.S. taxpayer money given to Bechtel, Halliburton and other companies is being spent. </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The investigative team spent three weeks in Iraq visiting project sites, analyzing contracts, and interviewing dozens of administrators, contract workers, and U.S. officials. Among the findings:</FONT></P><UL><LI><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Despite over eight months of work and billions of dollars spent, key pieces of Iraq&#146;s infrastructure &#150; power plants, telephone exchanges, and sewage and sanitation systems &#150; have either not been repaired, or have been fixed so poorly that they don&#146;t function.<BR></FONT></LI><LI><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">San Francisco-based Bechtel has been given tens of millions of dollars to repair Iraq&#146;s schools. Yet many haven&#146;t been touched, and several schools that Bechtel claims to have repaired are in shambles. One &#147;repaired&#148; school was overflowing with unflushed sewage; a teacher at the school also reported that &#147;the American contractors took away our Japanese fans and replaced them with Syrian fans that don&#146;t work&#148; &#150; billing the U.S. government for the work.<BR></FONT></LI><LI><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Inflated overhead costs and a byzantine maze of sub-contracts have left little money for the everyday workers carrying out projects. In one contract for police operations, Iraqi guards received only 10% of the money allotted for their salaries; Indian cooks for Halliburton subsidiary Kellogg, Brown &amp; Root reported making just three dollars a day.</FONT></LI></UL><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The report also reveals further details of Halliburton&#146;s contracts: for example, that of Halliburton&#146;s $2.2 billion in contracts, only about 10% has gone to meeting community needs &#150; the rest being spent on servicing U.S. troops and rebuilding oil pipelines. Halliburton has also spent over $40 million in the unsuccessful search for weapons of mass destruction.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;A handful of well-connected corporations are making a killing off the devastation in Iraq&#148; observes Chris Kromm, publisher of Southern Exposure. &#147;The politics and process behind these deals have always been questionable. Now we have first-hand evidence that they&#146;re not even doing their jobs.&#148;</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Also featured in the winter 2003/2004 issue of Southern Exposure, on sale this month, is an expose of the increasingly powerful Washington arms lobby by investigative reporter Jason Vest. </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><I>Southern Exposure is published by the Institute for Southern Studies, a non-profit research center based in Durham, N.C.
