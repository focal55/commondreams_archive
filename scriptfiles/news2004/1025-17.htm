<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- October 25 -- The United States Election Assistance Commission (EAC), a national clearinghouse and resource for information and review of procedures with respect to the administration of Federal elections, has released the top ten tips voters should know before they vote.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After the 2000 election, Congress created the U.S. Election Assistance Commission and charged it with administering voluntary guidelines for election requirements and maintaining a clearinghouse of information on election procedures. For the 2004 presidential vote, the Commission has created this voters' rights guide:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1. Before you show up to vote, contact your local election official to confirm your name is on the registration list.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2. Each state has different voter identification requirements. You should know what is required in your state before you go to vote.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3. Familiarize yourself with the voting device used in your jurisdiction.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">4. Know what time the polls open and close.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">5. Know how and when to apply for absentee ballot if you are not going to be able to get to your polling place on Election Day.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">6. Know your options for early voting.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">7. Become acquainted with the candidates and issues on the ballot.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">8. Each polling location must post a sign up explaining your rights as a voter.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">9. If you go to the polls and your name is not on the list and you believe you are registered to vote in that jurisdiction, ask for a provisional ballot.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">10. If you feel your rights have been violated, you can file a complaint with your state election officials. Every polling place must be able to provide contact information about where you can file the complaint.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To report any voting problems or irregularities, the U. S. Elections Assistance Commission can be reached at 1-866-747-1471 or e-mailed at havainfo@eac.gov</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">---</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The U.S. Election Assistance Commission was created by the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA). The Commission is charged with administering voluntary guidelines for election requirements under HAVA, maintaining a clearinghouse of information regarding election administration procedures including testing and certification of election equipment, and administering the Election Assistance and Help America Vote Programs. The EAC commissioners are DeForest B. Soaries, Jr., Chairman; Gracia M. Hillman, Vice Chair, Paul DeGregorio and Ray Martinez III. </font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
