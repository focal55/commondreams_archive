<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">GENEVA, SWITZERLAND - April 21 - A comprehensive report released on the eve of the World Bank&#146;s spring meeting in Washington has concluded that the world community is simply not doing nearly what it could and should to tackle poverty, war, ignorance and disease. A team of over 40 experts from around the world, overseen by a distinguished steering committee, has concluded that governments, international organizations, business and civil society are engaging in only about one-third of the effort necessary to realize the United Nations Millennium Declaration Goals. </FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The first annual report of the World Economic Forum&#146;s Global Governance Initiative (GGI) represents a year-long independent analysis by seven groups of some of the world&#146;s leading experts in the areas of peace and security, poverty, hunger, education, health, environment and human rights. In September 2000, at the Millennium Summit of the United Nations, leaders from 189 countries endorsed a set of objectives in these areas, many with a specific deadline of 2015. This report provides a &#145;benchmark&#146; on efforts to tackle these goals. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">As well as comprehensive analysis, the report also marks efforts by the international community on a scale of 0 to 10 on such issues as poverty, health, hunger, security, education, the environment and human rights. The report finds that during 2003 in no single area did the international community warrant more than a score of 4 on a scale of 0 to 10 measuring the level of effort and cooperation necessary to achieve the goals. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The report highlights a number of disturbing trends. For example, the proportion of hungry people is likely to increase in the Middle East, sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. At least 96 countries are not on track to reach the target of universal primary education by 2015, and 104 million children are not even enrolled in primary school. Financial donors have fallen short in providing the US$ 300 million necessary to sustain commitments under the Fast Track Initiative, which is the global effort to spur real progress on education. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">There is also little evidence that the world is making a serious effort to curb greenhouse gas emissions, despite the fact that they can harm agricultural production, water supply and forests, and lead to vector-borne diseases. Although 12% of the earth&#146;s land surface is now ostensibly protected, the world is spending less than US$ 7 billion a year to make that protection meaningful, compared to the over US$ 30 billion needed to properly implement protections. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In a number of areas, however, substantial progress is visible. In health, the Roll Back Malaria campaign has tripled international spending to more than US$ 200 million and has led to cost-effective technologies and greater investment in basic infrastructure. Aggressive domestic policies and private initiatives have helped a number of countries move toward halving their poverty levels by 2015. China in particular made significant strides by increasing fiscal spending on poverty reduction and launching food-for-work programmes. Little noted in 2003 was the positive sign that no new civil wars broke out, indicating an improvement in the international community&#146;s conflict resolution and prevention capabilities. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Achieving success in other areas, however, will require the world&#146;s rich countries to match their verbal commitments with resources and action. Of particular concern, notes the report, was that the WTO Cancun negotiations failed to agree on a framework to open markets to agricultural products from the developing world, leaving them at a continuing disadvantage. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Commenting on the findings, Richard Samans, Managing Director and Head of the World Economic Forum&#146;s Global Institute for Partnership and Governance said, &#147;This is the first year that we have produced such a report, and although the &#145;headline&#146; findings are disappointing, it does at least point the way to how improvements can be made. We hope that this report will become a benchmark against which the international community can begin to measure their success or failure in dealing with the fundamental problems of the world. The report shines an independent spotlight on the large gap between our collective aspirations and actions.&#148; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">While the report dedicates a chapter to each of the issues, it also highlights interdependencies among them. Better education, for example, has proven instrumental in spurring economic growth, which in turn offers a sustainable path toward alleviating poverty and hunger. However, AIDS is killing teachers faster than they can be replaced in parts of Africa, where education for girls proves one of the surest means to fight the disease. An additional US$ 5.6 billion (from the current US$ 1.5 billion) in development assistance is needed annually to support basic education, the report states. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;The attempt to link the security sector with the development agenda is particularly significant. Focusing on the security and development nexus will go a long way in pushing the global agenda for the benefit of all who suffer daily threats and poverty,&#148; said Sadako Ogata, President of the Japan International Cooperation Agency. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Global Governance Initiative uniquely evaluates the contributions of the private sector and civil society in addition to governments and international organizations toward achieving the goals. Sir Mark Moody-Stuart, Chairman of Anglo American Plc, commented, &#147;All elements of society need to work much more effectively if we are to meet the goals by 2015; no one group on its own can achieve the goals.&#148; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;To achieve human dignity for all, internationally agreed targets must be considered simultaneously and through coordinated strategies which identify the different responsibilities of all actors in society,&#148; adds Mary Robinson, Executive Director of the Ethical Globalization Initiative. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Please view (PDF file) for your information the <A HREF="http://www.weforum.org/documents/special_activities/GGI_Executive_Summary.pdf" TARGET="_NEW">Global Governance Executive Summary 2004 </A></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Steering Committee members: Strobe Talbott, President, The Brookings Institution; Maurice Strong, President, University for Peace; Yotaro Kobayashi, Chairman, Fuji Xerox Company; Mirai Chatterjee, Coordinator, Self-Employed Women&#146;s Association; Walter Fust, Director-General, Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation; John English, Executive Director, Center for International Governance Innovation; Jim Balsillie, Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer, Research in Motion; Simon Maxwell, Director, Overseas Development Institute; Youssou N&#146;Dour, Artist and Chairman, Youth Network for Development Foundation; Moises Naim, Editor-in-Chief, Foreign Policy magazine; Kumi Naidoo, CEO, Civicus; Surin Pitsuwan, Member, Royal Thai Parliament; Mary Robinson, Executive Director, Ethical Globalization Initiative; Sir Mark Moody-Stuart, Chairman, Anglo American Plc; Njongonkulu Ndungane, Anglican Archbishop of Cape Town, South Africa; Carlos Bulgheroni, Chairman, Bridas Corporation; Fran&ccedil;ois Heisbourg, Director, Fondation pour la Recherche Strat&eacute;gique; Christine Loh, Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Civic Exchange; John Ruggie, Director, Center for Business and Government, John F.
