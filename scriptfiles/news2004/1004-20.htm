BOSTON - October 4 - Thousands of citizens lobby debate moderator Gwen Ifill of PBS to question Cheney's connections to Halliburton during the Vice Presidential debate Tuesday night in Cleveland

 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="http://www.campaignmoney.org">Campaign Money Watch</a> launched an on-line lobbying effort to ensure that the vice presidential debate between Dick Cheney and John Edwards includes questions about the Bush Administration's special treatment of Halliburton Corporation, Cheney's former company. The debate, to take place Tuesday evening in Cleveland, will be moderated by Gwen Ifill of PBS's NewsHour and Washington Week.

 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Dick Cheney was given $20 million by Halliburton just five days before he left to be George Bush's running mate in 2000, and continues to receive hundreds of thousands of dollars in deferred compensation," said David Donnelly, director of Campaign Money Watch. "Halliburton got a no-bid, multi-billion dollar contract, and now it can't even account for $1.8 billion of the $4.3 billion it received.

 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We respectfully urge Ms. Ifill to ask the Vice President why Halliburton got this no-bid multi-billion dollar contract and whether he thinks it was the right company to receive it."

 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The email campaign was launched Friday afternoon. Thousands of citizens have already sent emails to Ifill urging her to be direct and tough in her questioning of the Administration's favoritism towards Halliburton.

 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Campaign Money Watch has aired advertisements criticizing the Bush/Cheney Administration awarding Halliburton the no-bid contract. Visit the organization's home page, <a href="http://www.campaignmoney.org" target="_new">http://www.campaignmoney.org</a>, to view the TV spot.
