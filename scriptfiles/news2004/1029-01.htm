<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WEST PALM BEACH, FL -- October 29 -- Thirty international observers preparing for their delegation to witness the elections in Florida circled &#147;intimidation of voters&#148; on their observation checklists as news reports Thursday focused on a &#147;challenge list&#148; of nearly 2,000 voters in predominantly black and traditionally Democrat areas of Jacksonville, Fla. A team of international observers from the Voting Justice Project of Pax Christi USA (<a href="http://www.paxchristiusa.org/" target="_new">www.paxchristiusa.org</a>) and the NAACP <a href="http://www.naacp.org/" target="_new">(www.naacp.org</a>) are set to document their observations at polling precincts in Duval County.</font>
<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A BBC Newsnight investigation revealed a document containing the list which was obtained from inside Bush campaign headquarters. A Tallahassee election supervisor stated that &#147;the only possible reason why they would keep such a thing is to challenge voters on Election Day.&#148;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;This is the exact kind of situation that our team of international observers is being trained to document,&#148; said Dave Robinson, executive director of Pax Christi USA. &#147;The existence of such a list points to the very real possibility that we will again see voters in Florida denied their fundamental rights as citizens of this country&#151;the right to vote. Our international delegation of observers will make sure that such intimidation is thoroughly documented and reported.&#148;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Problems were also being reported in Broward County, where thousands of absentee ballots had not reached voters&#146; homes. The international delegation is also set to observe in Broward County.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Our international observers are getting a crash course this week in all the things that could go wrong with the election process,&#148; said Robinson. &#147;From all of the problems in the 2000 election to these missing ballots to problems with electronic voting machines, they&#146;re understanding just how important their presence can be in helping to assure a fair, open election on Tuesday.&#148;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pax Christi USA and the NAACP will be bringing international election observers from 15 countries to observe polling stations in four Florida counties which were at the center of the controversies of the 2000 election&#151;Duval, Broward, Palm Beach and Miami-Dade. The delegation will hold a press conference on Monday, November 1, at 7:00 a.m. at the Mizell Cultural Center, 1409 NW 6th Street in Ft. Lauderdale.</font></p>
