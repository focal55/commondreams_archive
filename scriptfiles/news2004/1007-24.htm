<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - October 7- A group of professors and scholars specializing in management, 
business, and economics have banded together to express their
dismay at the Bush Administration's economic and labor policies.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The group of nearly 30 academics have signed the petition included 
 below:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION IS THE ALLY OF UNION-BUSTERS AND THE ENEMY OF
WORKING AMERICANS
</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> America needs a change at the top. As professors and scholars of
management, we are charged with educating the next generation of
 leaders. As citizens in a democracy, we take seriously our 
 responsibility
to speak out on matters of public policy, especially
 when the common good and the long term viability of the economy are at
stake. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We cannot be silent while the Administration of
 George W. Bush attacks the gains of working people over the past 
 hundred
years. It would be bad enough if the Bush administration
 were merely trying to turn the clock back to the "good old days" of
untrammeled managerial prerogatives and unfettered markets.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In
 reality, however, this administration is forging an ever more noxious 
 mix
of private economic interests and covert public power.
 Our economic, social, health, and environmental security is threatened 
 as
never before. 
 The Bush majority on the National Labor Relations Board has stripped
rights from health care workers, denied protection to a
 significant fraction of private university employees, weakened 
 penalties
for egregious labor law violators, and challenged state
 laws banning the use of taxpayers' money in anti-union drives.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The 
 NLRB is
supposed to enforce workers' rights, but the Bush
 administration seeks to make it the ally of union-busters. There is a
gaping and expanding hole in American democracy. 
 The Bush administration has issued a regulation that denies millions 
 of
workers their right to overtime pay. The formation of the
 Department of Homeland Security has carried a huge price tag in
compromised civil liberties, including the abolition of all
 collective bargaining rights for the 170,000 federal workers 
 transferred
into that huge department. Rules to limit the spread of
 tuberculosis have been dropped to please big business. The 
 Occupational
Safety and Health Administration has become more "business
 friendly," which means that standards to protect workers from toxic
chemicals are killed before they can help.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Ten years of
 research on ergonomics were trashed because the Administration does 
 not
feel the pain of carpal tunnel syndrome. Bush's chief
 economist sees outsourcing as good as long as his job is secure.
 We cannot remain silent as the Administration harnesses the power of
government to serve the special interests of the super-rich
 at the expense of ordinary, working Americans. Most of our students 
 stand
to lose as their workplaces become more dangerous, their
 jobs less secure, their freedom of expression more constrained. Even 
 an
MBA degree cannot save you when the most powerful state on
 earth wages class war on its working people.
