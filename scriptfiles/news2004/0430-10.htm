<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - April 30 - Over 100 companies and national organizations called upon the Senate leadership today to take immediate action on S.1637, the &quot;JOBS&quot; bill. Organizations joining the letter represent every aspect of the American economy ranging from agriculture and manufacturing to home building and renewable technologies. The group emphasized that the bill's provisions encouraging investment in domestic energy supply and infrastructure are &quot;critical to US economic recovery.&quot;</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The letter warned that failure to act would make US energy problems worse. &quot;With every month that passes without passage of energy tax legislation, the energy industry faces continuing uncertainty and disincentives to investing in areas such as renewable energy, energy efficiency and new technologies.&quot; With regard to both the underlying legislation designed to end European Union sanctions against American exporters and the incentives to spur new investment in energy production and infrastructure that have been added to the bill, the organizations continued, &quot;we urge the leadership and members to work together cooperatively to expedite this process. Failure to pass this legislation is already having serious negative consequences for the American economy.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist has announced that S. 1637 will be the Senate's first order of business upon its return on Monday, May 3rd. Senator Daschle also has expressed his support for completing action on this legislation, and the bill's energy provisions enjoy broad bipartisan support. In recent weeks, S. 1637 has been delayed as a result of a large number of amendments that have been offered to the underlying bill. While recognizing that a number of Senators in both parties want to offer amendments, the letter urged leadership and members on both sides of the aisle to &quot;work cooperatively to expedite this process.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Over 100 organizations and companies signed the letter, including more than 20 national associations. The collection of national associations signed onto the letter represents both renewable and traditional energy sectors, as well as state and local government organizations and utility regulators.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Full text of the letter and list of signatories follows:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Dear Senators Frist and Daschle:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">We are writing to express our strong support for prompt Senate consideration and approval of S. 1637, the FSC/ETI (&quot;JOBS&quot;) Act. In general, the underlying bill and the bill's provisions to encourage investment in domestic energy supply and infrastructure are critical to the United States' economic recovery.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Both S. 1637 and the energy tax package have strong bipartisan support in the Senate, and the leadership of the Finance Committee has worked hard to ensure that all revenue provisions in the bill have been fully offset. While we understand that Senators in both parties are anxious to have the opportunity to vote on a number of amendments, we urge the leadership and members to work together cooperatively to expedite this process. Failure to pass this legislation is already having serious negative consequences for the American economy and our industry.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">We support efforts by both parties to promote investment in critically needed energy infrastructure. The overarching importance of energy issues today - at gas pumps, pipelines, power lines, power plants, and overseas - argues strongly for the Senate to complete action immediately on this bill and its energy tax incentives. With every month that passes without passage of energy tax legislation, the energy industry faces continuing uncertainty and disincentives to investing in areas such as renewable energy, energy efficiency and new technologies.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Prompt passage of this legislation is vital for supporting continued economic growth, maintaining the health of our industries, and addressing our nation's need for expanded domestic energy supplies. Thank you for your support of both S. 1637 and the bipartisan energy tax package.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Sincerely,</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Signatories (109)</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">ALLETE/Minnesota Power; Alliance for Competitive Electricity; Alliant Energy Corporation; American International Automobile Dealers Association; American Wind Energy Association; Arcadia Windpower; Atlantic Renewable Energy Corporation; Bergey Windpower, Inc.; Bob Lawrence and Associates; Boreal Energy, Inc.; CAB Inc.; Caithness Energy; California Independent Petroleum Association; Calpine Corporation; Central Ohio Clean Fuels Coalition; Cielo Windpower, LLC; Clean Cities Coachella Valley Region; Clipper Windpower, Inc.; CMS Energy; Continental Milk Producers; Coram Energy, LLC; Credit Union Solutions Group/Preferred Dealer Network; Dairy Producers of New Mexico; Denver Metro Clean Cities Coalition; Deuel County National Bank; DMI Industries; DTE Energy Company; Earth Power Resources, Inc.; Edison Electric Institute; Electric Drive Transportation Association; Empire Energy, LLC; Enbridge Energy Partners, L.P.; Energy Maintenance Service, LLC; Energy Photovoltaics, Inc; Energy Unlimited, Inc.; Enterprise Products Partners, L.P.; Exelon Corporation; Florida Power &amp; Light; Ford Motor Company; Geothermal Energy Association; GeothermEx, Inc; Global Energy Concepts, Inc.; Global Wind Harvest; GulfTerra Energy Partners, L.P.; Hampton Roads Clean Cities Coalition; Hexcel Corporation; Independent Petroleum Association of America; Integrated Waste Services Association; Inter-Island Solar Supply; Invenergy, LLC; Kaneb Pipe Line Partners, L.P.; Las Vegas Regional Clean Cities Coalition; Magellan Midstream Partners, L.P.; MHA Environmental Consulting, Inc.; MidAmerican Energy Holdings Company; Mortenson Construction; National Association of Home Builders; National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners; National Association of State Energy Officials; National Clean Cities, Inc.; National Ethanol Vehicle Association; National Hydropower Association; National Propane Gas Association; National Rural Electric Cooperative Association; Natural Gas Vehicles Coalition; Navitas Energy, Inc.; NedPower U.S., LLC; New Uses Council; Northern Alternative Energy, Inc.; NRG Systems, Inc.; Nuclear Energy Institute; OGE Energy Corporation; ORMAT Power; PacifiCorp; Padoma Windpower, LLC; Portland General Electric; PPM Energy; Progress Energy; Project Resources Corporation; Propane Vehicle Council; RAM Associates; Renewable Energy Systems, Inc; Salt Lake Clean Cities Coalition; San Gorgonio Farms, Inc.; Select Milk Producers; Sharp Solar; Solar Energy Industries Association; Solar Source; Solar Supply of Hawaii; Solarponics Energy Systems; SOLEC; Spire Solar; Sun Earth, Inc.; Technology North, Inc.; TECO Energy; Thermasource, Inc; TPI Composites; Trans-Elect, Inc.; U.S. Sugar Corporation; Valero, L.P.; Vestas American Wind Technology, Inc.; Western Renewables Group; Western United Dairymen; Whitewater Energy Corp.; Whitewater Maintenance Corp.; WindLogics, Inc.; Wisconsin Energy Corp.; Xcel Energy, Inc.; Zilkha Renewable Energy</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">National Organizations Included Above (21)</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Alliance for Competitive Electricity; American International Automobile Dealers Association; American Wind Energy Association; Edison Electric Institute; Electric Drive Transportation Association; Geothermal Energy Association; Independent Petroleum Association of America; Integrated Waste Services Association; National Association of Home Builders; National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners; National Association of State Energy Officials; National Clean Cities, Inc.; National Ethanol Vehicle Association; National Hydropower Association; National Propane Gas Association; National Rural Electric Cooperative Association; Natural Gas Vehicles Coalition; New Uses Council; Nuclear Energy Institute; Propane Vehicle Council; Solar Energy Industries Association</FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
