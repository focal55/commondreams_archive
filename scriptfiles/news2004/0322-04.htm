<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> LIVINGSTON, TX - March 22  - On Wednesday, March 24th, Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Archbishop Desmond Tutu will visit Dominique Green, an inmate on Texas's Death Row. Afterwards, Archbishop Tutu will hold a press conference at 12:30 PM at St. Luke's Episcopal Church, 836 West Jones Road at the corner of North Willis, Livingston, Texas to discuss his opposition to the death penalty and to bring attention to the deplorable injustices of Mr. Green's trial, which was marked by racism and gross incompetence on the part of the court-appointed defense attorneys.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Dominique Green first learned of Archbishop Tutu when he read his book, &quot;<A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385496907/commondreams-20/ref=nosim/" TARGET="_new">No Future Without Forgiveness</A>,&quot; which is about the archbishop's experience as president of South Africa's unique experiment, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, during whose sessions perpetrators of political violence were encouraged to tell the truth about what they'd done during the apartheid era and the victims of that violence (and their families) were encouraged to forgive those who repented their violence. Dominique was deeply impressed by the book and realized that this was the path that he and his fellow inmates must take. Dominique Green has been on Death Row for 11 years. He will soon reach the end of his appeals.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Archbishop Tutu heard of Dominique Green's plight through a mutual friend: noted historian and best-selling author Thomas Cahill. Mr. Cahill visited Dominique in late 2003. Dominique explained how his life had been changed for the better by the other inmates on Death Row and by Archbishop Tutu's book.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Also present and lending their support to Dominique Green on March 24th will be Thomas Cahill and Judge Sheila M. Murphy (retired). Judge Murphy, the former Presiding Judge of the Sixth Municipal District Circuit Court of Cook County in Illinois, believes that Dominique Green did not receive a fair trial and she is providing him with legal assistance.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Archbishop Tutu and Thomas Cahill will make brief statements at the press conference, and then they and Judge Murphy will be available to answer questions.</FONT></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
