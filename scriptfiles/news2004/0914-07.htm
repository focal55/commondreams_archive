<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - September 14 - Despite overwhelming support for a strengthened assault weapons ban from nearly 2,000 police chiefs and sheriffs and a September 6, 2004 poll by the Annenberg Public Policy Centre that found that 68 percent of Americans wanted the ban extended, the Federal Assault Weapons Ban has sunset on President George W. Bush's watch. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A letter listing Police Officers and Sheriffs who have signed on asking for a strong and effective ban was delivered to all 535 Members of Congress and the President, but even such broad support from the nation's police chiefs didn't prompt action from the White House. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Military-style semiautomatic assault weapons pose a grave risk to law enforcement officers. One in five law enforcement officers slain in the line of duty between January 1, 1998, and December 31, 2001, was killed with an assault weapon according to a study of FBI data, by the Violence Policy Center.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Number of Local Police Chiefs That Support Banning Assault Weapons by State </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Alabama - 1 Arizona - 16 Arkansas - 19 California - 51 Colorado - 10 Connecticut - 27 Delaware - 5 Florida - 143 Georgia - 98 Illinois - 154 Indiana - 49 Iowa - 107 Kansas - 22 Kentucky - 1 Maine - 42 Maryland - 70 Massachusetts - 48 Michigan - 179 Minnesota - 45 Missouri - 50 Nebraska - 24 New Hampshire - 38 New Jersey - 161 New Mexico - 5 New York - 75 North Carolina - 47 North Dakota - 10 Ohio - 174 Pennsylvania - 107 South Dakota - 7 Texas - 24 Utah - 5 Vermont - 6 Virginia - 28 Washington - 21 West Virginia - 17 Wisconsin 77 </font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
