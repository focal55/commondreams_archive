<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">NEW YORK - July 22 - MADRE, an international women's human rights organization, calls on United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan to support the request made by members of the US Congress for United Nations observers to monitor the US presidential election on November 2, 2004. </FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">MADRE recognizes that the UN must tread carefully when it comes to issues of national sovereignty of any Member State. However, the Executive Branch of the US government and national electoral agencies have minimized the seriousness of pervasive problems in the electoral process which resulted in the denial of the right to vote for countless persons, raising disturbing questions about our electoral system. MADRE, in association with the Women of Color Resource Center and the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, has therefore mobilized 34 US-based organizations to appeal to the United Nations for monitors in order to prevent the widespread voter disenfranchisement that plagued the 2000 election. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Unfortunately, members of the majority party in Congress have sought to thwart such an effort by introducing legislation that would prohibit all requests for UN monitors. The legislation was introduced at the last minute and passed with little opportunity for debate, with one opponent of the amendment being censured and her remarks stricken from the record because they were deemed too inflammatory by the majority party.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">MADRE Executive Director Vivian Stromberg commented that, &quot;The right to vote in free and fair elections is a non-partisan issue. The effect of efforts to prohibit UN monitors is to deny US citizens' access to the UN as an instrument for the protection and promotion of their human rights.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">MADRE reiterates the support for the request by members of Congress as expressed by the signatories to the attached letter. We believe it is a good-faith effort motivated by deeply felt and legitimate concerns about the dangers posed to our democratic system of governance.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">MADRE is an international women's human rights organization that works in partnership with women's community-based groups in conflict areas worldwide. Our programs address issues of sustainable development, community improvement and women's health; violence and war; discrimination and racism; self-determination and collective rights; women's leadership development; and human rights education.  </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Letter in Support for US Congress Members' Request for UN Monitors During the 2004 US Elections</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">July 22, 2004</FONT></P><P></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Honorable Kofi Annan, Secretary-General </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">United Nations</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">New York, NY</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Honorable Secretary-General Kofi Annan,</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">We the undersigned organizations are writing to express our support for the request made by members of the U.S. Congress for United Nations observers to monitor the U.S. presidential election on November 2, 2004.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The 2000 presidential election was plagued by allegations of widespread voter disenfranchisement, particularly in the state of Florida. The allegations included irregular and wrongful purging of voter registration lists and questionable practices and policies relating to balloting, counting and certification procedures. These allegations have been largely confirmed by the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, a bi-partisan federal agency. The Commission also found that the disenfranchisement &quot;fell most harshly on the shoulders of black voters.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In a race with the narrowest of margins, every single vote that was counted, or not counted, had a clear and profound impact on the election. Ultimately the U.S. Supreme Court issued a decision which halted the re-counts in Florida and which suggests that post-election relief will be very difficult to obtain.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Recently, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights issued another report which found that adequate steps have not been taken at the state and federal levels to ensure that similar concerns do not arise in the 2004 presidential election.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">We are also very concerned about both the old methods as well as the new electronic technology to be used in some states and precincts. They present different but urgent problems which are not being adequately addressed domestically and which threaten the right of every person to vote and have his or her vote counted in free and fair elections.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">We urge you to give serious consideration to the request by our Congress members and offer the necessary electoral assistance to the United States in advance of and during the presidential election.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Sincerely,</FONT></P><P></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Vivian Stromberg, Executive Director, MADRE</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> Linda Burnham, Executive Director, Women of Color Resource Center</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> Mary Day Kent, National Executive Director, Women's International League for Peace and Freedom - U.S. section</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Caribbean and Latin America Support Project</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Center for Constitutional Rights</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Center for Women's Global Leadership</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Elders for Peace, Chapel Hill, North Carolina</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Equality Now</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Farmworker Health and Safety Institute</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Food and Farming Forum, California</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Franciscan Province of the Sacred Heart </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Green-Rainbow Town Committee, Amherst, Massachusetts </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Holding the Vision</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">National Action Network, Kansas</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">National Organization for Women</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">New Jersey Peace and Justice Coalition</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Older Women's League, Overland Park, Kansas</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Pax Christi - North Carolina</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Pax Christi - USA</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Peace Center, Nevada</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Peace Fresno, California</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Fresno Center for Nonviolence, California</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Society of American Law Teachers</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Thomas Merton Center</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Tikkun Community</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">United for Peace and Justice, (National Coalition representing more than 700 organizations)</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Unitarian Universalist Church, Lancaster, Pennsylvania </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Women's Division,  General Board of Global Ministries</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">United Methodist Church</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Veterans for Peace</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WILPF-Fresno, California</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WILPF-Santa Cruz, California</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Women's Congress for Peace</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Women's Environment and Development Organization</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> YMCA of Delaware</FONT></P><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
