<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - March 18 - Two national conservation groups are asking the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to take over the water pollution control duties of the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP). The groups, NRDC (Natural Resources Defense Council) and the Sierra Club, and a Florida resident, Linda Young, said they will sue EPA to compel it to enforce the federal Clean Water Act and ensure Florida&#146;s waters are fishable, swimmable and drinkable. </FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;As Floridians, our way of life depends on clean rivers and unpolluted beaches,&#148; said Linda Young, Southeast director of the Clean Water Network. &#147;Governor Bush and the federal Bush administration are more interested in protecting corporate polluters than our state&#146;s waterways. We have no other choice but to sue to force them to take action.&#148; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The environmental groups cite numerous examples of how the federal Bush administration has turned a blind eye while the Jeb Bush administration let industries dump unsafe levels of pollution into state waterways. For example:  </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">-- Across the state, industrial-scale dairies are polluting Florida waters with manure and excess nutrients, but the state only has established voluntary protections, which a Florida judge this month flatly concluded violates the Clean Water Act.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">-- Unpermitted pollution from industrial mining pits in Charlotte, Hardee and other counties has seeped or spilled into rivers, streams and lakes, causing algal blooms and killing fish.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">-- Paper mills in the state are operating under permits that expired up to a decade ago, and their discharges contain dioxin, one of the most toxic man-made substances on Earth. DEP claims it has no authority to force the mills to meet water quality standards for this deadly chemical.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;The Jeb Bush administration has failed Florida communities time and time again, and the Bush administration in Washington has consistently ignored the state&#146;s failures,&#148; said David Bookbinder, the Sierra Club&#146;s litigation director. &#147;There is a better way. By asking that EPA take control of the situation, we are hoping to hold all parties accountable for enforcing the Clean Water Act. Both Bush administrations should be protecting the waters that Floridians use for fishing, swimming and drinking.&#148; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">When Congress passed the Clean Water Act in 1972, it gave EPA the responsibility for ensuring compliance. Over the years the agency turned over to the states the job of issuing pollution permits and taking enforcement actions. Florida assumed that role in 1995, but, according to NRDC and the Sierra Club, has done an &#147;utterly miserable job.&#148; After years of watching DEP do virtually nothing to protect Florida&#146;s waters, the two groups will now sue to force EPA to reassume control over permits and enforcement in the state. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;It&#146;s the big corporate polluters and wealthy developers who are benefiting from DEP&#146;s failure to enforce the law,&#148; said Jessica Landman, a NRDC senior attorney. &#147;And who&#146;s paying the price? Florida residents and visitors who want to go swimming or fishing without worry, or, for that matter, take a drink from the tap. It&#146;s their health &#150; and their livelihoods &#150; that are at risk.&#148; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Natural Resources Defense Council is a national, non-profit organization of scientists, lawyers and environmental specialists dedicated to protecting public health and the environment. Founded in 1970, NRDC has more than 1 million members and e-activists nationwide, served from offices in New York, Washington, Santa Monica and San Francisco. More information is available at NRDC&#146;s Web site, http://www.nrdc.org/.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Sierra Club's members are 700,000 of your friends and neighbors. Inspired by nature, we work together to protect our communities and the planet. The Club is America's oldest, largest and most influential grassroots environmental organization.
