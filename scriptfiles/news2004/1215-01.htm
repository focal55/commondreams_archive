<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- December 15 -- There are some things in the world that are universal, even unavoidable. But in the world of Public Relations there are some things that need not have been. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/074944259X/qid=1103061316/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/104-1298989-8435134?v=glance&s=books" target="_new">Talespin</a> takes you around that world &#150; the world of PR activity gone wrong. You will go from the US to the UK, from Australia to India to learn from the experiences of PR Pros in sports, politics, business media and big brands. Top celebrities who have publicly trashed their sponsor&#146;s products, PR stunts that cost sports teams a victory and turned the fans against the sponsor, medical disasters turned into a matter of personal choice. Gerry McCusker takes you behind the scenes of these compelling, sometimes shocking, stories, looks at the actual situations addressed, the Public Relations operation that followed, and the subsequent fall-out. He also discusses damage limitation, where it has helped and where it has just compounded an already bad situation.</font></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some of the PR events included:</font></p><p> </p><ul><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ford and Firestone initially tried to stone-wall media by saying there was no problem with the Ford Explorers, even though the SUVs were turning over and drivers&#146; deaths were mounting. </font></li></ul><p> </p><ul><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Starbucks pressed 9/11 rescue workers to pay $130.00 for water to help bring those injured out of shock.
