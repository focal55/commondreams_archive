<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - October 1 -  A group of women calling themselves the "Band of Sisters," whose loved ones are currently deployed or were killed in Iraq, are featured in a new advertisement airing today that sharply questions George Bush's version of reality during last night's candidate debate.



The ad may be viewed at: <a href="http://www.sistersspeakout.com" target="_new">http://www.sistersspeakout.com

</a>

</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The ad was produced by <a href="http://www.winbackrespect.org/">Win Back Respect</a>, a new campaign group formed to rapidly respond to Republican assertions on Iraq and national security in the final weeks of the campaign. The group has financial support from <a href="http://www.georgesoros.com" target="_new">George Soros</a> and <a href="http://www.moveon.org" target="_new">Moveo</a><a href="http://www.moveon.org">n.org</a>, and its advisors include foreign policy experts such as Clinton National Security Advisor Anthony Lake.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">



Last night, members of the Band of Sisters came together from around the country to view the debate, and the ad records their reactions. "He stood on TV pretending that what's happening is not happening," Michelle Harris of Arlington, Texas says in the ad. J</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ane Jenson of Fitchburg, Wis., whose son currently is deployed in Iraq, says of Bush's debate performance: "He still is not taking it seriously. He still has that silly grin." </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Responding to the president's assertion last night that he 'has a plan' for Iraq, Brook Campbell of Atlanta, Ga. ads, "If he had a plan for progress (in Iraq), my brother might still be alive."</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">



The ad will air beginning today in the Washington, D.C. area, and it will air beginning early next week in key markets in Wisconsin, Iowa and New Mexico. These states have high military family populations, who have been especially affected by George Bush's war in Iraq.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">



Win Back Respect is sponsoring a national tour headlined by the Band of Sisters and Gen. Wesley K. Clark, the former Supreme Allied Commander of NATO. The tour was launched on Sept. 14 in Green Bay, Wis., and it will intensify through election day, visiting key battleground states with military bases and high military family populations. Win Back Respect is airing television advertisements in conjunction with the tour.



General Clark said that he was proud to be joined by the Band of Sisters for these events: </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"These courageous women and all of our military families are right to feel uneasy about the direction of our foreign policy. It is time for Americans to hear how this administration's failed policies have impacted our military families. I look forward to a real discussion about the costs of this administration's policies and the alternatives."
