<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON  - September 7 - In September, 2004 a tragic milestone will be reached: 1,000 U.S. troops will have been killed in a war that should not have happened. The two primary justifications used by the Bush Administration to take this nation into war -- weapons of mass destruction and a link between Al Qaida and Saddam Hussein have proven to be false. Each, day, week and month that this reckless military misadventure continues, the death toll goes higher.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As the day of the 1,000th  troop death is reached, <a href="http://www.mfso.org" target="_new">Military Families Speak Out</a> honors all who have fallen. We remember all the U.S. service men and women who have died as a result of the U.S. invasion and occupation of Iraq; the many thousands of Iraqi men, women and children who have died as a result of this war in Iraq; and the fact that these deaths have occurred in a war that is unjust and unjustifiable.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Military Families Speak Out -- an organization of well over 1,600 families with loved ones in the military, including those who have been killed in Iraq, who are currently serving in Iraq, or who are about to deploy to Iraq -- calls on the Bush Administration and on the United States Congress to BRING OUR TROOPS HOME NOW! Our loved ones signed up to protect and defend Country and Constitution not to be put in harm's way for oil markets and dreams of empire. As we honor the fallen, we call on the Administration to stop betraying our troops, their families and this nation! Not one more death in a war based on lies.</font></p>
