<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - October 5 - A new CIA report shows that Vice President Cheney was dead wrong about repeated claims that Saddam Hussein harbored Abu Musab al Zarqawi -- a suspected associate of al-Qaeda -- and that al-Qaeda had a working relationship with Saddam Hussein.  Cheney has used these claims to justify the invasion of Iraq.  </font><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today, Knight Ridder reported that according to the intelligence agency&#146;s assessment, &quot;<a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines04/1005-01.htm">there is no conclusive evidence that the regime harbored terrorist Abu Musab al Zarqawi.</a>&quot;  Furthermore, the wire service quotes a senior U.S. intelligence official who says &#145;&#145;<a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines04/1005-01.htm">the evidence is that Saddam never gave Zarqawi anything.</a>''  </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the vice presidential debate tonight, Vice President Cheney will attempt to showcase his experience and judgment in foreign policy-making.  But Cheney and the Bush administration have repeatedly been far off the mark.  For example, on June 21, 2004 Cheney said &quot;<a href="http://cnnstudentnews.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0406/21/asb.00.html" target="_new">Mr. Zarqawi, who is in Baghdad today, is an al Qaeda associate who took refuge in Baghdad, found sanctuary and safe harbor there before we ever launched into Iraq</a>.&quot;  Similarly, President Bush said on June 15, 2004 &quot;<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/06/15/bush.alqaeda/" target="_new">Zarqawi's the best evidence of a [Hussein] connection to al Qaeda affiliates and al Qaeda.</a>&quot;</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As the new CIA report reveals, there is simply no evidence to support these claims.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ironically, it was <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines04/1005-01.htm">Cheney who requested the CIA assessment</a>.</font></p><p></p><p align="CENTER"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">###</font></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
