<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - May 4 - Organizations around the globe are marking World Asthma Day today by conducting activities and events to raise the awareness of asthma as a chronic disease and public health epidemic. Meanwhile, a growing chorus of groups in the U.S. are speaking out against the Bush administration's policies on air pollution, which increases the severity and frequency of asthma attacks.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;We know that air pollution makes life much worse for 20 million Americans who suffer from asthma,&quot; said Nat Mund, clean air expert for the Sierra Club. &quot;After 30 years of progress in the battle against air pollution, why is the Bush administration taking us backwards by weakening our clean air laws?&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Last week, the National Council of Churches became the latest group to criticize the Bush administration for turning back the clock on clean air. Other critics include Eric Schaeffer, the Environmental Protection Agency's former head of enforcement, and Bruce Buckheit, EPA's head of air quality enforcement, both of whom resigned as a result of the Bush administration's strong industry bias.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In the United States alone, 4.8 million children suffer from asthma, which accounts for one third of all pediatric emergency room visits.  In addition, asthma is the fourth most common reason for pediatric physician office visits, and is one of the leading causes of school absenteeism.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Asthma is a chronic disease characterized by the inflammation of the airways and lungs, which causes wheezing and shortness of breath.  Soot and smog from industrial facilities and automobiles can increase the frequency and severity of asthma attacks. Unfortunately, the Bush administration's efforts to weaken clean air protections will lead to more soot and smog in the air, causing asthmatics to suffer from increased air pollution.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">If power plants used the best available pollution control technology to clean up their emissions, the reduced soot levels would significantly cut the amount of attacks and hospitalizations caused by asthma.  However, if the Bush administration succeeds in dismantling clean air protections, the number of unhealthy smog days, and severity of asthma attacks, is likely to increase.  The Bush administration is weakening clean air programs proven to protect public health by letting polluters off the hook and refusing to require old power plants to install modern pollution control equipment.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;There is a better way,&quot; added Mund.  &quot;To celebrate World Asthma Day, the Bush administration should enforce the law, hold polluters accountable, and require them to use today's technology to protect our health and safety.&quot;</FONT></P><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
