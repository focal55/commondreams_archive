<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AMMAN, IRAQ -- November 4 -- U.S.-led coalition forces in Iraq failed during last year&#146;s invasion to safeguard official documents and the remains of victims in mass graves, Human Rights Watch said in a report released today. As a result, crucial evidence for the upcoming trials of Saddam Hussein and other former Iraqi officials has likely been lost or seriously tainted. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 41-page report, &#147;Iraq: The State of the Evidence,&#148; details what happened to some of the key archival and forensic evidence that the U.S.- led coalition and, more recently, the Iraqi interim government failed to secure. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In April 2003, former Iraqi officials left behind volumes of official papers documenting criminal policies and practices. In the past year and a half, more than 250 mass graves have been identified, some of which contain the remains of thousands of victims of Saddam Hussein&#146;s rule. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Given what&#146;s at stake here, the extent of this negligence is alarming,&#148; said Sarah Leah Whitson, executive director of the Middle East and North Africa Division of Human Rights Watch. &#147;U.S. and Iraqi authorities were aware that these documents and remains would be crucial to the prosecution of Saddam Hussein and other former officials, but they did little to safeguard them.&#148; </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Human Rights Watch said that in the weeks and months following the invasion of Iraq, U.S.-led coalition forces failed to prevent people from freely looting thousands of official documents, or to keep relatives of &#147;disappeared&#148; persons from digging up remains found in some mass gravesites. Coalition forces subsequently failed to put in place the professional expertise and assistance necessary to ensure proper classification and exhumation procedures. As a result, it is very likely that key evidentiary materials have been lost or tainted. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the case of mass graves, these failures have also frustrated the ability of families to know the fate of thousands of missing relatives who &#147;disappeared&#148; during Saddam Hussein&#146;s rule. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Human Rights Watch urged Iraq&#146;s interim government, with international assistance, to set up a joint Iraqi and international Commission for Missing Persons to establish effective procedures for protecting mass graves and conducting exhumations, and a similar body to oversee the handling of documents of the former government. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;This material needs urgent attention. The evidence will be critical to any upcoming trial proceedings,&#148; Whitson said. &#147;And it will also be crucial for Iraqis as they attempt to construct an accurate record of the atrocities they suffered under Ba`th Party rule.&#148; </font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
