<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- December 10 -- News Advisory: Led by an escaped slave and bolstered by statements of support from John Kerry and Barney Frank, students from across Boston are rallying to recognize victims of the Sudan genocide and demand immediate action to stop Sudan's dictatorship from killing its own people.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Slavery survivor Simon Deng will be the keynote speaker at the candlelight vigil, which begins at 5:30 p.m. on Friday at the front steps of the Massachusetts State House. A similar rally last month drew over 150 students activists, who lit candles and vowed to mobilize until world leaders act to stop the Sudan genocide.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The vigil is organized by the American Anti-Slavery Group, which has been leading the struggle to stop slave raids and genocide in Sudan since 1994, in conjunction with students from Harvard, Tufts, and Boston University. In addition, student activists from high schools across Boston will speak.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Student speakers from Harvard and BU are leading divestment campaigns on their campuses, urging endowment funds to divest from companies doing business with the Sudanese regime.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The vigil on the State House steps will kick off a new call for the pension funds of Massachusetts and the City of Boston (with an estimated $1.4 billion invested in Sudan) to divest their holdings in companies doing business in Sudan. State Senator Susan Fargo has sent a statement of support to be read at the rally: &quot;I want to make certain that our State Pension funds are not used to finance the Sudanese government's campaign of genocide, slavery and torture.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Students from across Boston and members of the community do not want their money flowing to Sudan's dictatorship,&quot; noted Jesse Sage, associate director of the American Anti-Slavery Group. &quot;Friday's vigil is part of a growing national movement demanding action to stop the Sudan genocide now. Students will not be silent and they are taking to the streets.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition to Simon Deng's personal story of slavery, vigil participants will hear from a representative from John Kerry's office, listen to the performance of a Tufts University student a cappella group, and hear from the president of the Harvard African Students Association.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On Monday, the American Anti-Slavery Group will hold a similar vigil in New York City.
