<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - April 1 - As reported in the April 1 edition of the Washington Post, Left Bank Books of St. Louis, MO is donating 10% of the proceeds from the sale of Lynne Cheney's (wife of Vice President Dick Cheney) 1981 novel about feminism in the Old West, &quot;Sisters,&quot; to the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force Creating Change conference scholarship fund. The Task Force Creating Change conference will be held in St. Louis this year.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Kris Kleindienst, co-owner of Left Bank Books told the Washington Post, &quot;What better way to foster educational opportunities for the younger generation of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people than to raise money through the sale of Lynne's lost-life chapter?&quot; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Sue Hyde, the director of the Task Force Creating Change conference said, &quot;Certainly Lynne and Dick Cheney don't need our community's money from sales of 'Sisters.' But isn't it delicious to remind Mrs. Vice President of her earlier, Saphically charged days as a rip-roaring pulpmeister while her husband and his boss do their best to shove us back into a closet? Mrs. Cheney doubtless wishes Sisters would disappear into a closet, never to be read again.&quot; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Hyde added, &quot;So, if 'Sisters' is on your summer vacation reading list, buy it from Left Bank Books in St. Louis and build the strength of the LGBT political movement by contributing to the scholarship fund for the annual Creating Change conference. Make it possible for a young person to attend our movement's largest and most unique political training conference, to be held in St. Louis, Nov. 10-14 2004.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">For more information and to order a copy of &quot;Sisters,&quot; log on to the Left Bank Books Web site at <A HREF="http://www.left-bank.com/cheney.htm" TARGET="_new">http://www.left-bank.com/cheney.htm</A> </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Publishers Weekly said &quot;Sisters&quot; contains &quot;a mix of standard and unusual pulp romance fare: lots of turgid prose, heaving bosoms, female characters who are proto-feminists and practice safe sex with multiple partners -- and a juicy lesbian subplot.&quot;</FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
