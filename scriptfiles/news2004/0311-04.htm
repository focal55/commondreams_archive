<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - March 11 - Mary Robinson, former president of Ireland and former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, will join with leaders of the Coalition of Immokalee Workers (CIW), the National Council of Churches and Oxfam America to bring attention to human rights abuses of farmworkers in America's fields. The human rights leaders call on Yum Brands, the largest fast food company in the world and a major buyer of Florida produce, to guarantee the rights of workers in their supply chain and to help end the human exploitation occurring in the fields of Florida.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Yum Brands owns Taco Bell, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Long Johns Silver's and Pizza Hut. Yum Brands buys 40 million pounds of tomatoes per year while farmworkers must pick two tons of produce in order to earn $50 per day. Over the past twenty-five years the piece rate for tomatoes has declined by 65 percent. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">As a large institutional buyer Yum has the power to ensure that workers get their fair share. Robinson, CIW, NCC and Oxfam are calling on Yum's CEO David Novak, its boards of directors and major investors in the company to exercise true corporate leadership by ensuring fairness for the rights of workers in their supply chains which includes respect for core labor standards.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Oxfam America will release a new groundbreaking study, &quot;Like Machines in the Fields&quot; which exposes the denial of rights to U.S. farmworkers through discrimination in law and by a supply chain business model which generates profits by squeezing workers in the supply chain. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><b>WHAT:</b> Press Conference </FONT></P>
