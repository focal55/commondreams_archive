<p>NEW YORK -  October 12  - At least 11 al-Qaeda suspects have 
"disappeared" in U.S. custody, Human Rights Watch said in a report released today. U.S. officials are holding the detainees in undisclosed locations, where some have reportedly been tortured.

<p>The 46-page report, "The United States' 'Disappeared': The CIA's Long- Term 'Ghost Detainees,'" describes how the Central Intelligence Agency 
is holding al-Qaeda suspects in "secret locations," reportedly outside the 
United States, with no notification to their families, no access to the 
International Committee of the Red Cross or oversight of any sort of their 
treatment, and in some cases, no acknowledgement that they are even 
being held.

<p>"'Disappearances' were a trademark abuse of Latin American military 
dictatorships in their 'dirty war' on alleged subversion," said Reed Brody, 
special counsel with Human Rights Watch. "Now they have become a United States tactic in its conflict with al-Qaeda."

<p>Under international law, enforced disappearances occur when persons are 
deprived of their liberty and the detaining authority refuses to disclose 
their fate or whereabouts or refuses to acknowledge their detention, which 
places the detainees outside the protection of the law.

<p>The report profiles 11 such "disappeared" prisoners. They include Khalid 
Shaikh Muhammed, the alleged principal architect of the September 11 
attacks; Abu Zubayda, reputedly a close aide of Osama bin Laden; Ramzi 
bin al-Shibh, who but for his failure to get a U.S. visa might have been one of the 9/11 hijackers; and Hambali, an alleged key al-Qaeda ally in Southeast Asia. Some, such as Khalid Shaikh Muhammed, are reported to have been tortured in custody.

<p>U.S. officials have said that many of those held have provided valuable 
intelligence that has foiled planned terrorist acts. There are also reports 
that some detainees have lied under duress to please their captors. For 
instance, ghost detainee Ibn al-Shaikh al-Libi apparently fabricated the 
claim, then relayed by Secretary of State Colin Powell to the United Nations, that Iraq had provided training in "poisons and deadly gases" for 
al-Qaeda.

<p>International treaties ratified by the United States prohibit incommunicado 
detention of persons in secret locations.  The Geneva Conventions require 
that the International Committee of the Red Cross have access to all detainees and that information on those detained be provided to their 
relatives. Under international human rights law, detainees must be held in 
recognized places of detention and be able to communicate with lawyers 
and family members.

<p>Human Rights Watch called on the United States to bring all detainees, 
wherever they are being held, under the protection of the law. In particular, it demanded that the government grant unrestricted access to the 
International Committee of the Red Cross to all detainees held pursuant to 
anti-terrorist operations.

<p>"Those guilty of serious crimes must be brought to justice before fair 
trials," said Brody. "If the United States embraces the torture and 
'disappearance' of its opponents, it abandons its ideals and international 
obligations and becomes a lesser nation."
