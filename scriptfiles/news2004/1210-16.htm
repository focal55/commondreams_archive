<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- December 10 -- In recent days we have been made aware of an email and related Web sites that advise recipients to shop with certain companies based on which political party those companies support with their campaign contributions. The email cites the Center for Responsive Politics and our Web site, OpenSecrets.org, for the campaign contribution figures.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Please note that the Center did not author the email and has no relationship to its author.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Center is a non-partisan research organization that does not endorse or promote any political party or candidate in any context. Nor do we take any position on the views or activities advocated in the email.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Also note that the campaign contribution figures in the email are inaccurate and and do not reflect current information from our Web site.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We invite those wanting correct figures or further information to visit OpenSecrets.org. Our Industry Profiles list total contributions to federal candidates and party committees by industry and sector. The profiles also display the top contributors within each industry and sector. Contributions are from employees and political action committees of the organizations listed. Corporations and labor unions cannot contribute directly to candidates, and since the end of 2002, they have not been able to contribute directly to political parties.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Questions about the email, our industry profiles or our work in general should be directed to info@crp.org.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
