<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - March 18 - Seven environmental and public health groups today filed a lawsuit in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals to block implementation of controversial, industry-backed rules from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that would weaken pollution monitoring standards and lead to increased emissions of mercury, sulfur dioxide and other toxic pollutants linked to childhood diseases, heart disease and premature death.</FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">    EPA's rules would allow polluters to monitor themselves and to do so as infrequently as twice every five years, according to the lawsuit filed by the Environmental Integrity Project, Sierra Club, Natural Resources Defense Council, Physicians for Social Responsibility, Clean Air Council, Our Children's Earth Foundation and the Northwest Environmental Defense Center.     Eric Schaeffer, director of the Environmental Integrity Project, said: &quot;The problem is simple:  Inadequate monitoring results in higher emissions. The Clean Air Act requires monitoring sufficient to assure compliance; EPA is replacing that with a 'don't ask, don't tell' policy for air pollution.&quot;     Hilton Kelley, a petitioner in the lawsuit and resident of Port Arthur, TX., said:  &quot;My house is a few blocks from several large refineries and chemical plants.  When something goes wrong, I see them flaring, I smell the pollution, my eyes start watering and my throat burns.  I'm sure they're emitting illegal pollution, but without regular monitoring, I can't prove it and can't get the state or EPA to do anything about it.&quot;</FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;EPA has repeatedly acknowledged that, without adequate monitoring, pollution limits aren't worth the paper they are written on,&quot; said David McIntosh, an attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council.  &quot;EPA's new rule shows dangerous disregard for whether or not the industry is complying with air pollution laws.&quot;</FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">    EPA's new rule, announced on January 22, 2004, eliminates the requirement that air permits for large air emission sources require monitoring sufficient to allow the public and regulators to determine whether or not the sources are complying with the law.  Instead, EPA will allow sources of pollution to use outdated monitoring EPA has repeatedly acknowledged is inadequate to determine compliance.</FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">    The EPA decision to allow this inadequate monitoring was made despite the fact that numerous scientific studies over the past year have confirmed the links between air pollution and deaths, asthma and other lung diseases, strokes and heart attacks.</FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">    Physicians for Social Responsibility President and CEO Robert K. Musil, Ph.D M.P.H., said:  &quot;There is no doubt that air pollution adversely affects people's health.  We're facing an epidemic of childhood asthma.  EPA's decision to hide its head in the sand and pretend that industry will just comply with the law voluntarily will only make the problem worse.&quot;     The new rule requiring less monitoring will mean there is less information on which to base health and environmental decisions and less likelihood of identifying illegal polluters.  EPA's rulemaking proceeded without the opportunity for public notice and comment, which are required by law, and reflects yet another closed door deal with industry.</FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;This rule is a complete reversal of longstanding EPA policy recognizing the importance of monitoring and requiring that air permits include adequate monitoring,&quot; said Joseph Otis Minott, executive director of the Clean Air Council.  &quot;The fact that EPA did this as a backroom deal with industry and evaded the normal public participation process is appalling.&quot;     Pat Gallagher, Sierra Club director of environmental law, said: &quot;The EPA has taken a position that is completely at odds with the longstanding advice of its own experts.  This is yet another example of the Bush Administration ignoring sound science and doing favors for its industry friends at the expense of public health.&quot;</FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">    EPA agreed to adopt its new rule weakening monitoring requirements in order to settle a lawsuit brought by power plant and auto manufacturing associations challenging EPA's monitoring rules.  An almost identical suit by many of these same industry associations was thrown out of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals last year.  Yet instead of fighting this suit, EPA simply agreed to change its interpretation of the rules as desired by industry, gutting the monitoring requirements. </FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">    Over 50 health and environmental groups and six states -- New York, Illinois, Vermont, Massachusetts, New Jersey and Pennsylvania -- went on record in opposition to the EPA &quot;settlement.&quot;  The states noted that EPA's interpretation &quot;would make oversight and enforcement by states, the EPA, and citizens extremely difficult, if not virtually impossible.&quot;     Tiffany Schauer, executive director of Our Children's Earth in San Francisco, CA., said:  &quot;We've used the citizen participation provisions of Title V to improve requirements, including monitoring, in numerous Title V permits.  EPA is now caving to industry and eliminating our ability to insist on adequate monitoring in federal air permits in order to protect our communities.&quot; </FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">    The monitoring requirements at issue in the lawsuit over the EPA rule are included in Title V of the federal Clean Air Act.  Title V requires permits that include monitoring &quot;sufficient to assure compliance with the permit terms and conditions.&quot;  Title V permits list all of the air pollution limits that apply to a particular large industrial source and add monitoring and reporting as necessary to allow the public and regulators to track the source's compliance with those requirements.  The permits are intended to supplement any preexisting monitoring so that, for each air pollution limit or standard, there is monitoring that is sufficient to assure compliance.  Traditionally, EPA has interpreted this requirement to mean monitoring must be frequent enough and reliable enough to detect any noncompliance.
