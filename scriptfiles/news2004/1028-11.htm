<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>What:</b> Press conference/rally<br><b>When:</b> 7pm, Thursday, October 28<br><b>Where: </b>Outside Supervisor of Elections office, 115 S. Andrews. Ft. Lauderdale (across from the main library in front of government court house)<br> <b>Why:</b> The press conference/rally will call for an immediate solution to the missing 60,000 absentee ballots from Broward County and will highlight the other irregularities that threaten the validity of the November 2 election. <br> <br>Four years after the most controversial presidential election in modern U.S. history, many of the problems that plagued the Florida vote still exist.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The state has no uniform voting system, despite the unanimous recommendation of a bipartisan state task force. There is no centralized voter database to discourage fraud. More than half the state's voters will cast ballots on machines that have no paper trail. Most of the state's 67 independent supervisors of elections are still elected partisans who retain the constitutional right to decide who can vote in their counties and what votes are counted. <br> <br>Florida's chief elections officer, Secretary of State Glenda Hood, a longtime Bush family political ally and Jeb Bush appointee, has made many controversial decisions from a refusal to back the call for paper ballot receipts on touch-screen voting machines to unveiling a controversial felon voter list that was only scrapped after public outcry.<br> <br><a href="http://www.michaelmoore.com/" target="_new">Michael Moore</a>, legal experts and local citizens will all join the rally calling for a clean and fair election in which every voter is able to vote, and every vote gets counted.</font></p>
