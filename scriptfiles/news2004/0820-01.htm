<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - August 20 - Prominent Republicans are featured in a full-page ad under the headline &#147;the Right response to the War on Drugs&#148;.  The ad will run in the New York Sun each day of the Republican National Convention, August 30th &#150; September 2nd.  </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Most Republicans simply don&#146;t know that many of their most prominent leaders think the drug war is a disaster,&#148; said Ethan Nadelmann, Executive Director of the Drug Policy Alliance.  &#147;This ad seemed a good way to let them know, and to plant the seeds for a more vigorous Republican drug policy debate in years to come.&#148;</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The publishers of the New York Sun plan a special distribution to make the paper available to every RNC delegate in town as well as thousands of others attending the convention.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Statements from Milton Friedman, William Buckley Jr., Gov.

Text from the ad includes:</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Eighty-five million Americans have experimented with illegal drugs. Since the object of criminal law is to detect and punish the wrongdoer, should we reason that 85 million of us should have spent time in jail?&quot; - William F. Buckley Jr., Syndicated Column, 8/10/96 </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;...I wouldn't be surprised if in 10 years or so you saw the conservative coalition come out for an end to drug prohibition.&quot; - Grover Norquist, Poz website, 6/01 </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Can any policy, however high-minded, be moral if it leads to widespread corruption, imprisons so many, has so racist an effect, destroys our inner cities, wreaks havoc on misguided and vulnerable individuals and brings death and destruction to foreign countries?&quot; - Milton Friedman, New York Times 1/11/98 </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;...if your doctor prescribes marijuana, then I think that people should smoke it if they need it for medical care.&quot; - Arnold Schwarzenegger, MSNBC Hardball, 8/28/03 </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;...We need at least to consider and examine forms of controlled legalization of drugs.&quot; - George P.
