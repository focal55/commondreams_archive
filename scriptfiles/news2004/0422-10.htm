He said today: &quot;We're calling for debt cancellation on the IMF and World Bank's 60th anniversary. Malawi receives $90 million in aid each year but pays out $162 million in debt service to the IMF, World Bank and other wealthy creditors. Africa pays out $15 billion each year in debt service to the IMF, World Bank and other wealthy creditors, which is more than it receives in aid, loans or investment.&quot; Clarke is national coordinator of Jubilee USA, the U.S. arm of the international movement for debt cancellation.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">NANCY ALEXANDER, ROBERTO BISSIO and SHALMALI GUTTAL, <A HREF="mailto:ncalexander@igc.org">ncalexander@igc.org</A>, <A HREF="http://www.servicesforall.org" TARGET="_new">www.servicesforall.org</A>, <A HREF="http://www.socwatch.org.uy/en" TARGET="_new">www.socwatch.org.uy/en</A>, <A HREF="http://www.focusweb.org" TARGET="_new">www.focusweb.org</A></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Based in India, Guttal is coordinator of Focus on the Global South. She has lived in Laos and Cambodia and will be arriving in D.C. late Thursday. Bissio is executive director of Social Watch, an organization based in Uruguay focusing on poverty eradication and gender equality. Director of the Citizens' Network on Essential Services, Alexander said today: &quot;The IMF and World Bank push countries toward economic liberalization and privatization of essential services like health, water and electricity. Often, they promote these policies in the absence of regulation. The IMF and World Bank undercut democratic processes when they enter into agreements with finance ministries behind closed doors. Parliaments and citizens are often asked to 'rubber stamp' the policies that the World Bank and the IMF are willing to finance. Many countries desperately need lines of credit to these institutions in order to service their huge debts. When the IMF and World Bank blackball a government, it is left to 'swing in the breeze,' cut off from most finance. Hence, most governments decide to stay in their good graces.&quot;</FONT></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
