The groups will ask the court to reject a Bush administration effort to usurp the right of average Americans to bring environmental cases to protect America's natural resources. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The case before the court centers on undeveloped public lands in the west. The federal government is required by law to maintain the wild character of some of these lands. When off-road vehicle drivers damaged the lands with their vehicles, the federal government refused to take protective action until citizen groups initiated this lawsuit. Although the government admitted that it was breaking the law by not adequately protecting these pristine and wild areas, it has offered a radical new legal theory in the Supreme Court under which the public would be helpless to enforce this and other legal duties. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The court will also hear arguments concerning whether the public can bring claims relating to the duty of the federal government to update environmental planning documents when there is information indicating that earlier government decisions are having significant and unanticipated environmental consequences and claims related to the failure of the federal government to follow through on the management commitments made in its land use plans, which include a commitment to designate trails on public lands for off-road vehicle use rather than continuing to allow the vehicles to ride freely across the fragile desert landscapes.</FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
