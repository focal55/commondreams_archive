<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - July 8 - &quot;The Bush administration today announced its final decision to log across vast roadless areas, old growth forest reserves and sensitive salmon watersheds in southwestern Oregon's Siskiyou mountains. The 'Biscuit Fire Recovery Project' targets over 30 square miles of public lands for destructive logging, amounting to the biggest timber sale in the modern history of the US Forest Service. Despite receiving over 20,000 public comments opposing the extreme level of logging promoted by the Bush administration, the Biscuit logging project will cut 80 percent of its volume from the most sensitive roadless areas and old growth forest reserves.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Roughly 20 percent of the logging, much of it in old growth forest reserves set aside under the Northwest Forest Plan, will move forward immediately after timber is sold next week under new Healthy Forests Initiative 'emergency situation' logging authorities.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The Bush administration has overruled mainstream Oregonians who want protection for roadless areas, old growth forests, watersheds and wild salmon. Now they've declared a fake emergency designed to cut the public out of the process for the benefit of big timber.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;There is considerable scientific evidence that 'salvage logging' increases erosion, impairs streams and other wildlife habitat, causes additional damage to forests made more fragile by fires, and can actually increase fire risk due to the buildup of hazardous fuel and slash left by logging operations. In fact, trees downed by forest fires provide habitat for wildlife and nutrients needed to help keep forests healthy.&quot;</FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
