<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- December 8 -- A seven-part investigative report that revealed the widespread violence directed at Peace Corps volunteers won the 2004 ICIJ Award for Outstanding International Investigative Reporting.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For their Dayton Daily News series, &quot;Casualties of Peace,&quot; Russell Carollo and Mei-Ling Hopgood traveled around the world, interviewing more than 500 people in 11 countries, to detail the danger of sending volunteers to some of the most dangerous corners of the world. After filing more than 75 Freedom of Information Act requests, the Dayton Daily News ultimately sued the Peace Corps in federal court to free public records that document assaults against volunteers.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A five-judge panel of international journalists awarded Carollo and Hopgood the first-place prize of $20,000 and said their entry &quot;proves that world-class investigative journalism isn't the purview of just the national dailies or magazines with deep pockets.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The judges also selected five entries to receive the $1,000 finalist award. The finalists for the seventh annual ICIJ award, in alphabetical order, are:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Steve Bradshaw of the British Broadcasting Corporation, for his documentary &quot;Sex and the Holy City.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jean-Philippe Ceppi and Michel Heiniger of Television Suisse Romande for &quot;Warriors for Hire.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bob Drogin, Jeffrey Fleishman and Greg Miller of the Los Angeles Times for &quot;The Weapons Files.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Alessandra Galloni and David Reilly of The Wall Street Journal for &quot;The Fall of Parmalat.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Barton Gellman of The Washington Post for &quot;Iraq's Arsenal was Only on Paper.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The ICIJ Award for Outstanding International Investigative Reporting was created to honor international investigative reporting. Presented by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, a project of the Center for Public Integrity, the award is made possible by a grant from The John and Florence Newman Foundation of San Antonio, Texas.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Any professional journalist of any nationality may apply for the award. Eligible investigations must involve reporting in at least two countries.
