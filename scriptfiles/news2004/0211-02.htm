<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">SACRAMENTO, CA - February 10 - State legislators, including Senator John Vasconcellos of San Jose and Assembly Member Jackie Goldberg of Los Angeles will join severely ill medical marijuana patients at a press conference on Wednesday, February 11, at 12 PM PST in Room 317 of the State Capitol. In response to national drug czar John Walters&#146; visit to Sacramento, the press event will send a powerful message that patients, elected officials and California citizens are outraged at the federal government&#146;s growing war on the sick. At 1PM The Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, Walters will address an invite-only audience in order to bolster support for the White House&#146;s drug enforcement priorities. Attorney General Bill Lockyer, who has previously written the drug czar&#146;s office requesting an end to raids in California, will attend the press conference or send a statement supporting patients and physicians. In addition to the earlier press conference, patients will picket Walters&#146; forum at 1800 I St., 1 PM. </FONT></p><P></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WHAT:          Press conference to challenge John Walters&#146; (Director, Office of National Drug Control Policy) medical marijuana raids/policy</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WHEN:          Wednesday, February 11 at 12 p.m. PST </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WHERE:       Room 317, State Capitol</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WHO:            Bill Lockyer&#151; State Attorney General (tentatively confirmed) </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">John Vasconcellos&#151; Senator, San Jose, District 13 </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Jackie Goldberg&#151;Assemblymember, Los Angeles, District 45</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Glenn Backes&#151; Director, Health Policy, Drug Policy Alliance</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Steph Sher&#151;Patient, Director, Americans for Safe Access</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Bonnie Metcalf&#151; Patient, Director, Yuba County Compassionate Care</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Angel McCary-Raich&#151;Patient, Plaintiff in Raich v.

A Field Poll conducted in California last month found that a full 74% of voters supported patient access to marijuana if recommended by a physician. Majority support was solid across all political divides, including self-described conservative Republicans.  </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">All leading candidates for governor in the recent recall, including current Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, said during their campaigns that they support a patient&#146;s right to access medical marijuana. Before leaving office, Governor Gray Davis signed SB 420 by Senator Vasconcellos into law, which protects patients from arrests for marijuana possession if they carry county authorized cards that identify them as patients.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">However, the response from the federal government since 1996 has been numerous raids and arrests of patients and growers, aggressive prosecution resulting in prison terms of up to ten years (as in the case of patient Bryan Epis), and threats to revoke licenses for physicians who discuss medical marijuana with patients. Recent Supreme Court and Appellate Court rulings have tended to support the physician&#146;s and patient&#146;s right to disregard federal drug laws when it comes to medical marijuana use.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;From our legislature to our governor to our local cops, and with the support of voters, Californians have said that patients should have access to medicines to relieve their suffering,&#148; said Glenn Backes, Health Policy director for Drug Policy Alliance. &#147;John Walters and John Ashcroft and the bully boys in Washington, D.C. need to lay off the sick and dying in California. There has to be a better use for our tax dollars than fighting invalids, cancer patients and people dying of AIDS.&#148; </FONT>   </P><P> </P><P></P><p>&nbsp; </p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
