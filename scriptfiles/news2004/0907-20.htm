<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - September 7 - Campaign Money Watch, a pro-campaign finance reform section 527 effort, will begin advertising in the presidential battleground states of Oregon and Colorado on Wednesday.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
The advertising is critical of the Bush/Cheney White House awarding a multi-billion, no-bid contract to Vice President Dick Cheney's former employer, Halliburton. The oil services corporation awarded Cheney a $20 million pay and severance package when he left to run for Vice President and continues to pay its former CEO deferred compensation. In addition, Halliburton cannot account for $1.8 billion in taxpayer money it received from government contracts in the Middle East.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;George W. Bush and Dick Cheney will be held accountable for the special deals they hand out to their financial backers,&quot; said David Donnelly, director of Campaign Money Watch, an independent watchdog group. &quot;Halliburton is the tip of the iceberg for this pay-to-play Administration, and we will tell this and many other stories to illustrate how special interest money influences the decisions of this President and his White House.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
The advertising will run on television and radio stations in Portland, Oregon, and, to begin, on radio stations in Denver, Colorado. Television advertising will be added to the Denver market next week. Campaign Money Watch will spend $150,000 to start this advertising campaign.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;President Bush has raised more campaign money than any other politician in American history, and because of that has indebted his Administration to wealthy special interests. Bush has opposed comprehensive reforms that give power back to voters and make officeholders less dependent on big money contributors,&quot; continued Donnelly. &quot;These are compelling reasons for pro-reform Campaign Money Watch to join this debate, especially as voters are examining the candidates' records.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
<i>Campaign Money Watch's mission is to hold politicians accountable for opposing comprehensive campaign finance reform and doing special favors for big money contributors.</i></font></p>
