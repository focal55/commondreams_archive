  <FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Currently in D.C., Enders edited Baghdad Bulletin and has spent much of the last year in Iraq. He will be returning there in mid-April. He said today: &quot;In Fallujah, as a mission to avenge the deaths of four 'contractors' killed there last week is underway, it is important to note: The four men killed, who have often been referred to as 'civilian contractors' in the press, worked for a private security company from North Carolina. Private soldiers in Iraq are combatants -- they kill and detain Iraqis.... There are more private soldiers (over 10,000) in Iraq at the present time than there are British soldiers.... By closing Shi'ite cleric Muqtada Al-Sadr's newspaper, it appears the U.S. army has given the young imam the necessary leverage to call for armed struggle on his behalf....&quot;</FONT><br>

  <FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Author of the book The Phoenix Program, Valentine said today: &quot;More and more the so-called 'counter-insurgency' in Iraq resembles the CIA's infamous Phoenix Program in South Vietnam, in which the CIA -- under cover of military 'cordon and search' operations -- went into villages that supported the resistance, in hopes of catching or killing guerrilla leaders. The My Lai massacre was the penultimate example of such a flawed policy. Today, in a traditional 'cordon and search' (or 'search and destroy') operation, U.S. Marines closed all roads into Fallujah....&quot;</FONT><br>

  <FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In an IPA news release dated April 10, 2003, just after the fall of Saddam Hussein, Shallal said: &quot;When I was a kid in Iraq, we had coups and I would go out and jump in the street because it was the coolest thing. It's like D.C. when the Redskins win the Super Bowl. The problem is what comes after.&quot; With the one-year anniversary of Hussein's fall approaching, Shallal, founder of Iraqi-Americans for Peaceful Alternatives, said today:  &quot;Before the incident of the Al-Hawza [newspaper] closing, most Shi'ite demonstrations were peaceful.... They are beginning to realize that the freedom they were promised is not going to simply materialize -- no jobs, no security and now no voice.... The U.S. is left with a cabal of cronies (the Governing Council) whose allegiance is far more to the corporate invaders than it is to the people of Iraq. Ahmed Chalabi is holding all the cards -- he now controls the ministry of finance (incredible considering his background), trade and oil. It's like having Kenneth Lay become the head of the Treasury Department.... One must ask oneself: Is this part of the U.S. plan -- to create more disruptions in order to further clamp down? Why is the U.S. sending relatively untrained Iraqi police to clash with the demonstrators? How can the U.S. justify closing a newspaper office -- what happened to freedom and democracy? ... Fallujah reminds one of Jenin -- the parallel with what is happening in Palestine is very stark. Sadr himself has made the connection.&quot;</FONT></li>
