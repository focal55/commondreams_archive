<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">ANCHORAGE, AK - February 17 - In an effort to restore a balance between development and wildlife protection in Alaska's western arctic, conservation groups announced today a lawsuit challenging a plan to open up the entire northwest portion of the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska (the Reserve) to oil and gas leasing. The groups challenge the January 22, 2004, decision to open 100 percent of the 8.8-million-acre northwest portion of the Reserve fails to permanently protect any of the region's most important wildlife habitat or hunting and fishing grounds.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Secretary of the Interior Gale Norton, the Bureau of Land Management and the US Fish and Wildlife Service are named in the suit, which alleges that the January 22 decision violated the National Environmental Policy Act and the Endangered Species Act among other laws, and that the agencies did not adequately assess the impacts from and alternatives to oil development in the Reserve, which is located in America's western arctic.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The administration had a chance to strike a real balance between conservation and development in the western arctic, but instead they took the most extreme option,&quot; said Deirdre McDonnell, attorney for Earthjustice in Juneau. &quot;Instead of looking for the middle ground, they said, 'Let's drill it all: permanently protect nothing, make environmental rules even weaker, and put wildlife and people at risk.'&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Reserve contains the country's largest block of unprotected land, including areas of unsurpassed beauty and essential habitat that are vital for wildlife and for the people who depend on them for subsistence. On January 22, 2004, the Bush administration announced that it would make the entire 8.8-million-acre northwest planning area of the Reserve available for oil leasing.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Conservationists challenge that the decision to open so much of the Reserve to oil and gas leasing ignores the need for permanent protection for sensitive wildlife habitat and makes misleading claims about the effects of oil and gas development.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The lawsuit highlights several violations of federal environmental law. The decision violates the National Environmental Policy Act by failing to provide adequate analysis of potential oil and gas leasing and development activities in the Reserve, the impacts of these activities, or the proposed mitigation measures.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The Department of Interior was hoping that no one would look closely at what they're doing in the western arctic,&quot; said Eleanor Huffines, the Wilderness Society's Alaska Region Director. &quot;But when you read the details of their plans, all their claims about protecting special areas turn out to be bogus The 'special areas' don't get special treatment, and the 'strict environmental rules' are weaker than what we have now.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The agency failed to consider all reasonable alternatives to the lease-it-all course adopted by Secretary Norton. Audubon Alaska &#150; the National Audubon Society's Alaska State Office &#150; published a report outlining a wildlife habitat alternative in December 2002, which was supported by tens of thousands of public comments public comments, but it was never taken seriously by the BLM.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The Interior Department has ignored the public, the science, and the law in the rush to open every possible acre of the western Arctic to oil drilling,&quot; said Stan Senner. &quot;Audubon's two-year study demonstrated that the Reserve is large enough to balance oil drilling and wildlife protection. We're asking Interior to go back and try again &#150; and, this time, to do it right.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The status of threatened bird species that could be adversely affected by oil and gas development is also ignored in the decision. The Reserve contains extremely important breeding, molting and migrating habitat for birds, including Steller's and spectacled eiders, which are listed as threatened under the federal Endangered Species Act, and the rare yellow-billed loon.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The USFWS has a clear obligation to ensure that their actions will not jeopardize the survival of these threatened birds,&quot; said Corrie Bosman, Alaska Program Director with the Center for Biological Diversity based in Sitka, Alaska. &quot;By approving this project without carefully considering the full impacts of additional oil and gas leasing on the eiders and their habitat, the USFWS has violated the law and put the survival of these species at risk,&quot; Bosman said.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The Reserve is supposed to be our oil of last resort. We didn't tap it during World War II and we don't need to destroy its most important habitat areas now. This is just another oil patch on the road to progress by an administration bent on doing anything to delay the development of clean fuel sources,&quot; said Charles Clusen, Alaska project director for the Natural Resources Defense Council.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The lawsuit was filed Monday, February 16, 2004, in federal district court in Juneau by Earthjustice on behalf of the Northern Alaska Environmental Center, Alaska Wilderness League, Center for Biological Diversity, National Audubon Society, Natural Resources Defense Council, Sierra Club and The Wilderness Society.</FONT></P><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
