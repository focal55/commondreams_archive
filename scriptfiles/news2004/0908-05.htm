<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - September 8 - Statement of Elizabeth Cavendish, Interim President of NARAL Pro-Choice America</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Washington, DC) &#150; President Bush stands zero for three &#150; his federal abortion ban has now been struck down for the third time. However we know this Administration will not be deterred &#150; they will continue plotting to change the federal courts so they can reach their ultimate goal of eliminating a woman&#146;s right to choose. Their strategy is clear &#150; they can&#146;t stop striking out, so they&#146;re going to hire umpires who share their disastrous vision. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since his first full day in office, Bush has worked to limit women&#146;s freedom. He has violated the right to keep our medical histories private. He has limited access to birth control and responsible sex education that can help reduce the need for abortion. And he has relentlessly nominated anti-choice ideologues to the federal courts who are hostile to a woman&#146;s right to privacy and right to choose, painting a clear picture of his future Supreme Court nominees. Indeed, a new book called Judging Thomas by William Morrow confirms that the White House has already approached arch-conservative Clarence Thomas about elevating him to Chief Justice if the opportunity arises.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pro-choice Americans can&#146;t rest for even a second. If Bush gets the chance to fill multiple seats on the Supreme Court, not only this decision, but the fundamental right to choose itself will be at risk.</font></p><p></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
