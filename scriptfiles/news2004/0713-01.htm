The group will report on the outcome of this meeting as well what they intend to do about it. PPERHC will also outline their plans for a Mobile &#147;Bushville&#148; tent city that will begin July 19th and  travel through New Jersey into New York City in time for the Republican National Convention.  </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Poor People&#146;s Economic Human Rights Campaign (PPEHRC), a national organization representing over fifty poor people&#146;s groups from around the country,  will stage a major protest at the Republican National Convention (RNC) in August, targeting the devastating economic polices they have experienced over the last four years. </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Campaign garnered attention at the 2000 RNC where 10,000 people participated in their protest despite the fact that they were the only group denied a permit that decided to march anyway.  PPEHRC has indicated they will march again this year, regardless of whether they are granted a permit.  </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">According to Cheri Honkala, the group&#146;s founder stated, &#147;I will march because both the Republicans and Democrats have ignored the plight of poor and I will march to highlight the war at here at home: An economic war in which the casualties are massive unemployment, increasing homelessness, and inadequate or non-existent healthcare.&#148;</FONT></P><P> </P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Speakers:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Cheri Honkala, National Spokesperson for PPEHRC, will be joined by representatives from the Immokalee Farmworkers (Florida), the Coalition to Protect Public Housing (Chicago), the United Workers Association (Baltimore), and the Kensington Welfare Rights Union (Pennsylvania).</FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
