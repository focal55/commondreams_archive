<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - July 8 - Signed and paid for with small contributions from individuals and grassroots organizations from across the United States, the Not in Our Name Project published an ad Wednesday, July 7 on the back page of the Baghdad daily newspaper al-Sabah al-Jadeed declaring &quot;No to torture and occupation.&#148; </FONT></p><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">This message sent directly to the Iraqi people was a slightly modified version of an ad that appeared last month in weekly newspapers across the United States, including the New York Village Voice, San Francisco Bay Guardian, and Muslims Weekly.  It comes alongside another faith-based campaign by the group, Faithful America, which has run ads on Al-Jazeera expressing apologies and opposition to the torture of Iraqis.  The ad reads, in part:</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;We want the Iraqi people to know that many millions here in the U.S. -- including many military family members, soldiers, and veterans -- are outraged and deeply shamed by the immoral and unjust war and occupation of your nation.&#148;</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Independent journalist Alaa Kamel has gathered responses from several Iraqis who read the ad.  They include the following:</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><I>&quot;US government misled the people by issuing wrong information about Iraq. This information could do nothing but lead the whole world in the wrong direction.&quot;</I>       Saalim, 25, courier </FONT></P><P> </P><P><I><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;We thank those people in the United States. We hope they will continue to demand that their government not commit this crime upon other countries. Their government is just making the whole world terrible.&quot;</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">        Abdulah Raheem, military veteran</FONT></P><P> </P><P> <I><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;We thank God that there are still some good people everywhere. Thanks to the people in US for their emotions for people in Iraq. I just have one request for them: if they just could pray for us to live the rest of our life peacefully.&quot;</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">        May Yassin, Ministry of Health spokeswoman</FONT></P><P> </P><P><I><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Not In Our Name Project was founded in March of 2002, vowing to resist not only the Bush administration war that it claims will last &#147;a generation,&#148; but also the detentions of immigrants and attacks on civil liberties. The Not In Our Name Pledge of Resistance states, in part:  &#147;We pledge to make common cause with the people of the world to bring about justice, freedom and peace.&#148; (full text of both ad and Pledge of Resistance viewable at <A HREF="http://www.notinourname.net" TARGET="_new">www.notinourname.net</A>)</FONT></I></P><P> </P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
