<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- November 22 -- Teachers taking part in the taxpayer-funded AmeriCorps program should not be permitted to engage in religious instruction at sectarian schools, Americans United for Separation of Church and State has advised a federal appeals court. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The AmeriCorps program, run by the Corporation for National and Community Service, provides stipends called &#147;national service education awards&#148; to individuals for work at certain locations around the country.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some of these positions are at religious schools, and some of the award recipients teach religion and lead religious activities as part of their work at these schools. A U.S. District Court ruled July 2 that the arrangement is unconstitutional. The federal government has appealed.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;This program provides teachers to parochial schools at taxpayer expense,&#148; said the Rev. Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United. &#147;It is patently unconstitutional.&#148;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a friend-of-the-court brief filed today, Americans United asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to rule against religion subsidies in the program.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Here, religious institutions actually use AmeriCorps participants and grant funds for religious instruction and activities,&#148; reads the brief. &#147;The government has failed to create an effective system for monitoring how the aid is used. The aid consists of religious instructors who have received religious training from faith-based institutions. And the instructors perform core teaching functions at parochial schools.&#148; </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Joining Americans United in the brief are the American Jewish Committee, the Anti-Defamation League, and People For the American Way Foundation. The case is Corporation for National and Community Service v. American Jewish Congress. <br></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
