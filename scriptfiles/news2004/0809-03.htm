<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - August 6 - The first mass market gas-electric SUV, the Ford Escape Hybrid, will save each of its owners an average of more than $400 in fueling costs every year, according to new analysis by the Union of Concerned Scientists. The savings are based on filling up the two-wheel drive version of the hybrid (36 mpg in the city, 31 mpg on the highway) in the first year of ownership, compared to the conventional two-wheel drive Escape (19 mpg in the city, 25 mpg on the highway).</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The new Escape hybrid is the greenest mass-market SUV ever to hit the streets,&quot; said David Friedman, Clean Vehicles Research Director at the Union of Concerned Scientists. &quot;The new Escape exemplifies the unique ability of hybrids to combine best-in-class fuel efficiency and emissions performance with the acceleration and utility consumers have come to expect.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">UCS's analysis of the Escape assumes regular gasoline prices at $1.50 per gallon and 15,600 miles driven in the first year. The superior fuel economy and lower emissions of the Escape Hybrid show it to be a good use of hybrid technology. The four-wheel drive version is not far behind, with only slightly lower fuel economy and the same low emissions. However, UCS research shows that not all hybrids are created equal and that consumers should be wary of relying exclusively on the label &quot;hybrid&quot; in making their purchase decisions.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Ford has set a high bar when it comes to hybrid SUVs,&quot; said Jason Mark, Director of UCS's Clean Vehicles program.  &quot;But to cut our dependence on oil, automakers need to sell millions of hybrids every year.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Several other hybrid models are expected in the coming months and years, including a Honda Accord hybrid, the Lexus RX 400h sport-wagon, a Toyota Highlander hybrid, and a Nissan Altima hybrid.  GM's first hybrid is expected in 2007. Today, the Toyota Prius and Honda Civic hybrids are the best choices for car owners concerned about high gas prices, oil dependence and the environment.  </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To spur development and sales of hybrids, UCS is fighting for tax credits for hybrid designs based on their energy and environmental performance. &quot;We urge Congress to adopt strong incentives tied to vehicles that deliver breakthrough improvements in fuel economy and emissions performance,&quot; said Friedman. &quot;This will put money in consumers' pockets and automakers' bank accounts.&quot;</font></p><p></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
