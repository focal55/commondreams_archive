<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON – October 6 – In order to counter the millions of dollars Big Tobacco is expected to make in political donations this election season, the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids has launched <a href="http://www.kidsbeforeprofits.org" target="_new">www.KidsBeforeProfits.org</a>. 
</font>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><P>A new online campaign, www.KidsBeforeProfits.org aims to educate political candidates about the need for common-sense tobacco-control legislation.

 

In every election, Big Tobacco and their political action committees spend millions of dollars in campaign contributions and other political donations. 
<P>Matthew L. Myers, the President of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids asserts “Is it any wonder that effective tobacco regulation is often blocked?  Our national campaigns have shown that there is overwhelming public support for anti-tobacco legislation in America, and we want to make sure these voices are heard this election.”

  

<P>By logging onto www.KidsBeforeProfits.org, activists can send a letter to elected officials and candidates in their district, asking them to make tobacco control a priority this election year.  The letter outlines a five-point plan to support tobacco policies that can help save millions of lives.  
<P>By funding tobacco prevention programs, regulating tobacco products, increasing tobacco taxes, and sponsoring Clean Indoor Air legislation, legislators make important strides in protecting our kids from Big Tobacco.

 

In addition to writing to their candidates, the Campaign encourages online activists to take action offline by participating in candidate forums, writing letters to the editor, and displaying tobacco control signs in their homes to show their support for tobacco legislation during this coming election.  The site provides talking points and important questions to ask in Town Hall meetings.
<P>  

 

According to Myers, “Candidates for public office need to know at every turn that their constituents want them to take a clear and strong stance in support of tobacco control legislation.”

 

Candidate education is the top priority for www.KidsBeforeProfits.org. 
<P>The site includes resources for candidates who support tobacco legislation or who want to learn more about how they can support tobacco policy and make it a feature of their campaign.</font>
