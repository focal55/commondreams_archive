<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">DENVER, CO - February 12 - The New Voters Project, Voter Virgin, and the Hip-Hop Summit Action Network declare Valentine&#146;s Day to be Love Your Vote day.  Celebrating the power of Love, Unity, Diversity, and Democracy; these three organizations will combine forces to excite young people and encourage them to register to vote.  Throughout the country, the New Voters Project, VoterVirgin, and the Hip-Hop Summit Action Network will host a series of events, parties, and rallies to reengage young people in the political process.  </FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Over 28 million eligible voters between the ages of 18 and 24 years old could be a powerful voting bloc in the upcoming elections.  In the Iowa caucuses, participation of young voters was almost double from 2000, and they voted in greater numbers as a percentage of their age group than older voters.  &#147;If young people register to vote, and go to the polls, we can have an impact on our Democracy and get our voices heard,&#148; said Kate Sargent, a student at the University of Colorado in Colorado Springs.  &#147;This Valentine&#146;s Day, we are helping our friends and neighbors love their vote and become more engaged.&#148;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Appropriately themed t-shirts, pens, and temporary tattoos will be given away to those who register to vote in the days prior to and on Valentine&#146;s Day.  &#147;Its time for all first time voters to make a date with Democracy&#148; said Annie Stewart of the New Voters Project, who is organizing the Valentine&#146;s Day registration event at the Portland State University campus.  &#147;This is a great way to register other young people to vote, and have some fun.&#148;  </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Voter registration events and rallies, decked out with the Love Your Vote theme, are happening in nearly 40 cities around the country.  Rock the Vote, MTV&#146;s Choose or Lose, the WWE&#146;s Smackdown Your Vote! and other organizations will be recognizing Love Your Vote at events throughout the nation.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Love Your Vote events are taking place in the following cities:      </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">California:  Los Angeles * Davis</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Connecticut:  West Hartford              </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Colorado:  Denver * Boulder * Ft.

The scope of the project, combined with strategies of peer-to-peer contact and an aggressive Get out the Vote (GOTV) campaign, will directly engage young people and change the dynamic of the upcoming presidential election.  The New Voters Project has financial support from The Pew Charitable Trusts, numerous partnerships representing the media, cultural movements and academics, and a prestigious advisory committee that includes President Gerald Ford and Vice-President Walter Mondale, former RNC Chairman Frank Fahrenkopf, Jr. and former DNC Chairman Don Fowler.  By bringing young people to the polls, the New Voters Project will reverse the downward trend in the voting habits of 18-to-24-year-olds and force politicians to focus on this normally neglected constituency. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Website: <A HREF="http://www.newvotersproject.org" TARGET="_new">www.newvotersproject.org</A></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">ABOUT VOTERVIRGIN</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">VoterVirgin is designed to stimulate dialogue and create a culture of fun around first time voting. www.votervirgin.com provides a variety of ways to register and recruit new voters with a smile. 100% non partisan and preach free, VoterVirgin opens the door to engage a broad spectrum of participation.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Website: <A HREF="http://www.votervirgin.com" TARGET="_new">www.votervirgin.com</A></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">ABOUT THE HIP-HOP SUMMIT ACTION NETWORK</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Founded in 2001, the Hip-Hop Summit Action Network (HSAN) is dedicated to harnessing the cultural relevance of Hip-Hop music to serve as a catalyst for education advocacy and other societal concerns fundamental to the well-being of at-risk youth throughout the United States.
