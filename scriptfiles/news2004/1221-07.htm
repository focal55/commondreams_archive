<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CHILE -- December 21 -- The decision by the Santiago Court of Appeals (Corte de Apelaciones de Santiago) to uphold the indictment and house arrest of Augusto Pinochet has sent a powerful message to the rest of the world: human rights violators will not go unpunished, Amnesty International said today.</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The new judicial process against Augusto Pinochet in Chile is one further step on a long journey to justice. It has opened a door that many governments have been eager to keep closed.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Augusto Pinochet will be the first person to be brought to justice on charges of human rights violations committed in the context of the &quot;Condor Operation&quot; -- a well elaborated strategy agreed between the military governments ruling in Chile, Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, Brazil and Bolivia, during the 1970&#146;s and 80&#146;s, with the aim of combining forces to persecute, arrest and torture political opponents, many of whom continue to be &quot;disappeared&quot;.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The efforts made by the judicial system in Chile must now be translated into further concrete results ending impunity on the cases of all human rights violations committed in Latin-America during that period. Governments in countries that were involved in &quot;Operation Condor&quot; must act without delay to bring those responsible to justice.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Justice for all the survivors and victims of human rights violations in Chile has been a long time coming. It must not take any longer to ensure justice for the victims of &quot;Operation Condor.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Further information : news.amnesty - The case of Augusto Pinochet: <a href="http://news.amnesty.org/pages/pinochet_timeline" target="_new">Timeline</a></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
