<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">SILVER SPRING, MD - April 5 - The Peace Action Education Fund (PAEF) today released its annual Congressional voting record.  The record rates both Senate and House members on their votes on nuclear weapons issues, international cooperation and human rights and democracy in 2003. Using ten key Senate votes and nine House votes PAEF derives a voting percentage for each member of the U.S. Congress. In 2003, 21 Senators and 91 Representatives earned 100% ratings for their votes ( <A HREF="http://www.peace-action.org/pub/votes/2003VR.pdf" TARGET="_new">http://www.peace-action.org/pub/votes/2003VR.pdf</A> ).</FONT></p>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;The votes of the 2003 Congress gave members the opportunity to make very clear distinctions as to where they stood in regard to the President&#146;s invasion and occupation of Iraq,  the administration&#146;s drive to develop more usable nuclear weapons, and cooperation with the rest of the world . We&#146;ve captured each individual member&#146;s votes and are making them available to a public that, increasingly, has questions as to why we, as a nation, have become loathed by much of the world, are saddled by an unnecessary war, and are less safe. Our voting record helps the public answer these questions and allows them to hold accountable representatives that have acted against the public interest, and also to thank those who have acted in their interests,&#148; said Kevin Martin, Executive Director of the Peace Action Education Fund.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Peace Action Education Fund has been tracking legislation and holding politicians accountable using their voting records for over 20 years.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;In 2003, those voting against the administration&#146;s idea of so-called homeland security were often persecuted by the White House with a Joe McCarthy-like maliciousness. Those congress people who received a 100% score on our voting record deserve credit for the bravery and honesty to stand against, for example, the administration&#146;s initiatives to build new nuclear weapons and the unregulated flow of tax dollars to Halliburton. These congressional representatives are leading the way in our Campaign for a New Foreign Policy,&#148; continued Martin.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;In a voting season that&#146;s expected to be sullied by negative advertising and clouded by media campaigns emphasizing style over substance, the Peace Action Education Fund&#146;s voting record offers voters the facts on how their Congressional representatives voted on important issues. Armed with the facts, voters can then act decisively in support of peace,&#148; concluded Martin.</FONT></P>
