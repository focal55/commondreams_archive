<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">BOULDER, CO - February 11 -  In conjunction with International Whale Week, which runs from February 14 to February 21, thousands of environmental activists of all ages and from 93 different countries will be sending letters, faxes and emails on behalf of the critically endangered Western Pacific Gray Whale that feed off the coast of Russia&#146;s Sakhalin Island. U.S. citizens are being urged to write to the U.S. Export-Import Bank (Ex-Im), which is considering backing one of the Sakhalin oil projects. The action is being led by Global Response, based in Boulder, Colorado; Pacific Environment, based in Oakland; and Whale Day International, based in Carlsbad, California. A coalition of over 50 other organizations has signed on with the goals of the action. </FONT></p><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Sakhalin, which is the only feeding ground of the Western Gray Whale, is the site of one of the largest oil and gas projects in the world, with an estimated 13 billion barrels of oil. Oil giants Shell and ExxonMobil have been drilling in the area, activity that has both scientists and local residents concerned. </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;The area is home to 25 marine mammal species, including 11 endangered species and one of the world&#146;s most critically endangered whales,&#148; commented Global Response program director Paula Palmer. &#147;It is also rich with crab, herring, and cod, and Sakhalin has one of the few healthy wild salmon fisheries remaining in the world. Indigenous communities have thrived on these abundant marine resources since the Neolithic Stone Age.&#148;</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Royal Dutch/Shell leads one of three multinational oil consortia that began drilling for oil off Sakhalin Island in the 1990s.  The Shell-led Sakhalin Energy Company stands to earn billions of dollars marketing oil and gas to Asian and U.S. markets, with a small fraction going to Russia. Mitsubishi and Mitsui join Shell in the consortium. According to a front-page expose published in the Wall Street Journal, Sakhalin Energy is trying to exploit Sakhalin&#146;s resources on the cheap, using outmoded technologies and inadequate environmental studies. The approach could have catastrophic consequences for the whales, vital fisheries and the livelihoods of the indigenous Nivkhi community. </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">As part of the global effort to protect the Sakhalin environment and local economy, citizens in Europe and Asia will target the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation, which along with the Ex-Im Bank are considering financial proposals for the second, expanded phase of oil drilling off Sakhalin Island.   The coalition says letter-writers will urge the international development banks to withhold funds for expansion of the Sakhalin II project until Shell and its partners make significant changes to guarantee zero impact on the whales.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Western Pacific Gray Whale has a total population of only about 100 and is already in serious trouble.  The shallow waters off Sakhalin&#146;s northeast coast are the species&#146; only known feeding ground. Scientists became alarmed recently when they noticed that many of the whales were appearing thin and undernourished. They say that expanded activity by the oil companies jeopardizes the whales&#146; chances of rebounding. </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Besides the impact on whales, letter-writers are demanding protection for nearly 1,000 salmon-spawning streams on Sakhalin Island, where Shell plans to build a pipeline. Sakhalin&#146;s history of disastrous earthquakes heightens the risk of pipeline leaks and spills that could contaminate drinking water and destroy one of the world&#146;s last healthy wild salmon fisheries.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><B><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Background</FONT></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Western Pacific Gray Whale: As bottom feeders, Western Pacific Gray whales suck in huge amounts of sediment from the ocean floor and use their baleen to filter out the benthos (animals and plants that live on the ocean floor), their only food.  In 1999, scientists reported seeing &#147;skinny whales,&#148; animals showing visible signs of malnourishment.  By 2000 more than a quarter of the Western Gray Whale population was &#147;skinny.&#148;  Scientists don&#146;t know why this is happening, but they say that unless left undisturbed in their Sakhalin feeding grounds, the whales will have little chance for recovery.  Russian ichtyological expert M.E. Vinogradov warns, &#147;Without designing special measures for Gray Whale conservation, the continuation of the Sakhalin II project can lead to extinction of this unique population.&#148;</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The proposed second phase of Shell&#146;s Sakhalin II project poses new threats to the Western Pacific Gray Whale.  Shell plans to dredge, install and operate a new offshore oil platform next to key whale habitat.  It also proposes building platform-to-shore pipelines on the sea floor, right through the vital ocean floor feeding grounds of the Western Gray Whale.  These proposals violate Russia&#146;s Law on Protection of the Animal World as well as the World Bank&#146;s Natural Habitats Policy.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Salmon: Shell proposes to build 800 kilometers of pipeline down nearly the entire length of Sakhalin Island to new port facilities at the southern end of the island.  This pipeline will cross 1,100 brooks, streams and rivers. At least half of these streams are recommended for the highest category of protection as salmon spawning streams critical to the fishery.  Instead of bridging over these streams as is done in Alaska and in most modern pipeline projects, Shell plans to gouge open ditches across the streams, then lay down the pipeline and cover it.  Massive silt and sedimentation from this can destroy downstream spawning beds and other aquatic habitat vital to the local economy.  Environmentalists argue that in a place like Alaska, Shell would be required to build elevated pipelines that bridge these water crossings.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Earthquakes: The Sakhalin II project operates in an area of very high earthquake activity.  Shell&#146;s onshore pipeline will cross at least 24 seismic faults (compared to the Alaska pipeline, which crosses three). A quake of 7.6 on the Richter Scale in northern Sakhalin just eight years ago killed 2,000 people and ruptured several oil pipelines, leading to significant oil spills.  Yet Shell plans to build an underground pipeline using technology that has not been tested in such earthquake-prone terrain.  Shell&#146;s leak-detection equipment is also far less sensitive than the system used in Alaska, risking the possibility that small leaks could go unnoticed until large amounts of oil have leached into the soil and watershed.  Environmentalists claim that Shell should be required to build elevated pipelines with earthquake-flex design similar to those used successfully in Alaska.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>More information on the web:</B></FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><A HREF="http://www.globalresponse.org/gra/current.html" TARGET="_new">http://www.globalresponse.org/gra/current.html</A></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><A HREF="http://www.pacificenvironment.org/russia/sakhalin" TARGET="_new">http://www.pacificenvironment.org/russia/sakhalin</A></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><A HREF="http://www.whaleday.com/" TARGET="_new">http://www.whaleday.com/</A></FONT></P><P> </P><P></P><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
