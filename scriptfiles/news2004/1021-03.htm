<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SAN FRANCISCO -- October 19 -- Much has been written about Sinclair Broadcast Group&#146;s plan to air the anti-Kerry documentary Stolen Honor&#151;Wounds that Never Heal in 62 television markets. Yet many of the film&#146;s critics, along with most Americans, have not actually seen the documentary behind the controversy. Now Link TV, the national satellite television network, is airing Stolen Honor&#151;Wounds that Never Heal as well as<a href="http://www.goingupriver.com/" target="_new"> Going Upriver: The Long War of John Kerry</a>, in the premiere episode of SPOTLIGHT: Forbidden Films -- Election 2004. This series, a balanced presentation of films about the presidential candidates, will debut on Friday, October 22nd at 8:00pm Pacific Time (11:00pm ET) and Sunday October 24 at 5:00pm PT (8:00pm ET). Viewers won&#146;t find this pairing of political films anywhere else on network television. </font><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Link TV takes a strong stand against censorship in these highly charged political times,&#148; says Kim Spencer, President of Link TV. &#147;We believe every voter needs to see films from both sides before they make up their mind on November 2.&#148; Adds Spencer, &#147;In addition to airing these documentaries, the media is responsible for providing viewers with a context for these controversial programs&#151;the story behind the films, the factual claims and the context in which they are presented.&#148;</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As part of its weekly investigative documentary program SPOTLIGHT, Link TV will air three episodes of Forbidden Films before the November 2nd elections. Stolen Honor&#151;Wounds that Never Heal and Going Upriver: The Long War of John Kerry will appear in episode one, Forbidden Films About John Kerry.  Subsequent episodes of will SPOTLIGHT include Forbidden Films About George W. Bush and Forbidden Films About the Media and Elections. </font></p><p></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SPOTLIGHT: Forbidden Films About John Kerry will provide context for Stolen Honor &#151;Wounds that Never Heal, a powerful yet polemical film produced by Carlton Sherwood. Link TV political correspondent and SPOTLIGHT host Mark Hertsgaard will offer analysis of the documentary&#146;s technique and central argument that John Kerry was a traitor who imperiled the lives of POWs in Vietnam by his congressional testimony in 1971.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the same episode, Hertsgaard will compare and contrast the pro-Kerry film, Going Upriver: The Long War of John Kerry, a documentary by George Butler. Going Upriver emphasizes Kerry&#146;s bravery in action and his motives for joining Vietnam Veterans Against the War. Link TV will show extended excerpts of both films. In each case, viewers will be given contact information and directed to web sites where they can find out how to acquire the videos and watch them in their entirety&#151;allowing voters to decide for themselves before the election. </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Committed to providing Americans with a platform for civic dialogue on the critical issues of our day, Link TV&#146;s new Forbidden Films series will show important political documentaries, right up through Election Day. The second program of the series, SPOTLIGHT: Forbidden Films About George Bush, features an analysis of two programs with different views of the President: Faith in the White House and There&#146;s Something About W. The final program in the series, Forbidden Films About Media Manipulation, examines the documentaries Weapons of Mass Deception, Michael Moore Hates America and other programs.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Link TV is broadcast nationwide on DIRECTV channel 375 and Dish Network channel 9410, and reaches 23 million homes throughout the U.S. Selected programs are streamed on the Internet at www.linktv.org. Link TV has been widely recognized for presenting viewpoints rarely offered by the U.S. media, such as its unique daily program Mosaic: World News from the Middle East.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Each Friday and Sunday night, Link TV&#146;s SPOTLIGHT airs hard-hitting news and documentary programs from around the world&#151;exposing Americans to information and perspectives that conventional television often ignores. Link TV was the only U.S. network, for example, to broadcast the BBC's scoop exposing the U.S. military's dramatic rescue of Army Private Jessica Lynch in Iraq as a Pentagon public relations hoax. SPOTLIGHT was also the only American TV series to broadcast the BBC film Israel&#146;s Secret Weapon, winner of a 2004 Peabody Award. </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mark Hertsgaard, the host of SPOTLIGHT, has a national reputation for probing deeper and asking provocative questions. His hard-hitting journalism has appeared in The New Yorker, Vanity Fair, The Atlantic, Time, Harper&#146;s, The Nation, The Washington Post, and many other publications around the world. He is the author of five books, including most recently &quot;The Eagle's Shadow: Why America Fascinates and Infuriates the World&quot; (Picador).</font><br></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
