<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - June 30 - Today, the Alliance for Justice launches its online initiative &quot;Spy-der-man,&quot; starring U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft as the intrusive super- villain invading people's privacy, stealing library and medical records, and accessing e-mail. Armed with the far-reaching USA Patriot Act, John &quot;Spy-der-man&quot; Ashcroft abuses his power and abuses his authority as our nation's top cop. The flash ends with the ultimate call to action for Ashcroft: resign.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Although humor is used to convey the strong message of Spy- der-man, Alliance for Justice President Nan Aron points to the seriousness of Ashcroft's actions. &quot;Under Attorney General John Ashcroft's leadership, the Justice Department has issued anti- terrorism policies that intrude on free speech, privacy, and due process,&quot; said Aron. &quot;Ashcroft's actions have enabled the government to look at private information and spy on religious and political groups.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;He has gone too far in his abuse of power and disregard for civil rights,&quot; added Aron. &quot;Ashcroft has only one thing left to do-resign.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Over 300 communities in 41 states across the country, representing nearly 52 million Americans, have passed resolutions opposing sections of the USA Patriot Act. &quot;The ground swell of opposition to the Patriot Act speaks to the fact that America believes Ashcroft has gone too far,&quot; said Aron. &quot;Americans see the need to protect the nation but not at the expense of fundamental rights.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">This initiative is the second phase of the Alliance for Justice's newly created Allies for Justice, a campaign strategically calling attention to critical issues threatening our justice system. The &quot;Ashcroft is Spy-der-man&quot; initiative is supported by humorous flash animation featuring Spy-der-man invading our privacy and stealing confidential information, a Web site featuring substantive material on the USA Patriot Act, political cartoons, a petition drive and on-the-ground organizing. To sign a petition urging Ashcroft to resign, go to <A HREF="http://www.ashcroftresign.com" TARGET="_new">http://www.ashcroftresign.com</A></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Ashcroft recently displayed his contempt for the Constitution at a rare appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee by refusing to hand over critical memos detailing our government's involvement in authorizing the torture of Iraqi prisoners.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">For more information on the Alliance for Justice's &quot;Ashcroft is Spy-der-man&quot; initiative, contact Julie Bernstein at (202) 822- 6070 x297 or Kelly Landis at x338 or go to <A HREF="http://www.ashcroftresign.com" TARGET="_new">http://www.ashcroftresign.com</A>.</FONT></P><P></P><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
