<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - July 6 - In a letter to Secretary-General Kofi Annan, 78 members of Congress urged the United Nations to &quot;ensure that the international community holds responsible those who committed crimes against humanity and war crimes in East Timor.&quot;</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;This letter demonstrates strong, ongoing congressional support for meaningful efforts to achieve justice for East Timor,&quot; said Karen Orenstein, Washington Coordinator of the East Timor Action Network (ETAN).</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The bi-partisan letter urged Annan to appoint a commission of experts to evaluate existing justice processes and &quot;to carefully consider recommending an international tribunal on East Timor if it finds that current processes have not achieved justice.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The members of the House of Representatives wrote that, &quot;Any mechanism created as a result of the expert commission's or your own findings must establish the truth of what happened, how it happened and who is responsible. In addition, this mechanism must actually hold perpetrators legally accountable. International political will must be strong and sufficient U.N. resources must be made available in order for this to occur.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The letter also urges extension of the UN-backed Serious Crimes Unit (SCU) beyond May 2005, saying &quot;ending SCU investigations at that point could leave an estimated 700 murder victims and thousands of victims of rape, torture, and other crimes against humanity in 1999 alone without justice.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The letter was initiated by Representative Nita Lowey (D-NY), ranking member on the Foreign Operations Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee and Representative Frank Wolf (R-VA), co-chair of the House Human Rights Caucus.

They wrote, &quot;To be as effective as possible, we urge that the Commission be formed immediately and that it cover the work of the ad hoc Human Rights Court in Jakarta and the UN-established Serious Crimes process in East Timor. ... We are concerned that if the Commission does not convene and report promptly, options to address core accountability issues in the region will be lost.&quot; The letter was signed by Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the International Federation for East Timor, International Center for Transitional Justice, Open Society Justice Initiative and Coalition for International Justice.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The full text of the letter can be found at <A HREF="http://www.etan.org/news/2004/06ngojust.htm" TARGET="_new">http://www.etan.org/news/2004/06ngojust.htm</A>.</FONT></P><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
