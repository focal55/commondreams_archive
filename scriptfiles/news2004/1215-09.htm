The movie was recently nominated for three Golden Globe Awards.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Kinsey is a powerful reminder of the importance of healthy sexuality and the many impediments to attaining it,&quot; said PPFA President Gloria Feldt. &quot;The film illustrates the revolutionary nature of applying scientific research to human sexuality, including the study of sexual norms. Though Kinsey himself was as complex and imperfect as any of the rest of us, his groundbreaking research has helped generations to experience pleasure without shame and moved our society toward a place where sexuality can be understood and embraced as a fundamental aspect of our humanity.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHAT: Screenings of Kinsey</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHO: Actor and Activist Lynn Redgrave, PPFA President Gloria Feldt, PPNYC President and CEO Joan Malin</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHEN: December 15, 2004</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Screenings: 6 and 8:30 p.m.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Reception: 7:30 to 9:30 p.m.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHERE: Tribeca Cinemas, 54 Varick Street at Laight Street</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RSVP Required: 212-556-8244 Media</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Contact: Page McCarley 917-301-3825</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Planned Parenthood Federation of America is the nation's largest and most trusted voluntary reproductive health organization.
