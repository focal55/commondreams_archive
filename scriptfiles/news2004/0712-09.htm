<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - July 12 - Today, the Drudge Report falsely claims that a TV ad containing images of Hitler that was submitted last year by an entrant to the &quot;Bush in 30 Seconds&quot; ad contest is still carried on MoveOn's website.</FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The ad in question has not been linked on any of our web pages since December, and even then only appeared to a small group of MoveOn members who were rating ads in the MoveOn Voter Fund ad contest.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">When the Bush campaign mounted its spot on June 25th, comparing John Kerry to Hitler using images from this ad, we restored the old contest ad from backup tapes to our web server for review in response to queries from journalists. This file was apparently dredged up by Drudge, but never appeared on a MoveOn web page viewed by the public. The file itself is now deleted from our web server.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Bush campaign's Hitler ad still appears on their campaign website, linked for public viewing: <A HREF="http://www.georgewbush.com/VideoAndAudio/" TARGET="_new">http://www.georgewbush.com/VideoAndAudio/</A></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">We have always believed that it is irresponsible to use images of Hitler in a political context. In contrast, the Bush/Cheney campaign's ad that juxtaposes images of Hitler and John Kerry is still publicly displayed on their site. We call on the Bush/Cheney campaign to remove this odious ad.&quot; </FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
