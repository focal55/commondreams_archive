<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - April 13 - The Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) will release two new analyses this week at the North American Energy Summit here, showing that increased use of renewable energy sources, and improved automobile technology, could save consumers billions of dollars on sky-rocketing utility bills and high prices at the gas pump.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Using a U.S. Department of Energy computer model and assumptions, UCS found that consumers would save $26 billion-$11 billion in lower electricity bills and $15 billion in lower natural gas bills -- by using more wind, solar, geothermal and other renewable resources. Increasing the nation's use of renewable electricity sources to 20 percent of the mix by 2020 would reduce both electricity and natural gas prices, according to the UCS analysis</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Consumers are once again being held for ransom by the energy industry,&quot; said Alan Nogee, Clean Energy program director at UCS, and a conference speaker. &quot;It is time for our elected representatives to free us from being hostage to outdated technologies and energy resources of the 19th century, and use today's advanced technologies to lower energy prices, clean up haze and unhealthy air, conserve water, and reduce the threat of global warming.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">With the price of gasoline averaging over $1.60 per gallon during the last 12 months, a new UCS Clean Vehicles analysis finds that consumers who bought new cars and trucks last year would have saved over $3 billion at the fuel pump if automakers had put existing technology to work. Improved technology, as demonstrated by the UCS better SUV blueprint, the UCS Guardian, could improve safety, raise SUV fuel economy to the level of today's cars, and increase the new vehicle fleet to 32 mpg. At today's gas prices, these are technologies that would pay for themselves in about 18 months. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Putting existing technology to work to improve fuel economy in all cars and trucks makes a lot more sense than shackling millions of consumers with poorer gas mileage than the Model T Ford,&quot; said David Friedman, research director of the UCS Clean Vehicles program who also will address the conference. &quot;This is not about the public giving up its trucks and SUVs, it is about Detroit letting go of its unwillingness to roll safer, greener vehicles off its assembly lines.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">At a time when gasoline prices are at an all-time high, and natural gas prices have more than doubled in just a few years, UCS speakers at the summit will urge the Western governors in attendance to support a switch to 21st century technology to save consumers money at the gas pump and on their utility bills, while also cleaning up the environment. UCS experts will call for requiring electric companies to increase renewable energy use, increasing fuel economy to insulate consumers from gasoline price spikes, and incentives for clean, safe, high-fuel economy hybrid cars, SUVs and trucks. Cleaner and more efficient electricity and vehicle technologies can be especially valuable to Western states, UCS said, with their bountiful renewable energy resources, long driving distances and heavy reliance on trucks. The UCS analysis found that a national standard requiring all electric companies to use 20 percent renewable energy by 2020 would create a huge export market for renewable energy from Western states, leading to more than $37 billion dollars in new capital investment and more than $3 billion in additional tax revenues in the region, along with $642 million in land lease income to Western state farmers and ranchers.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;We understand that Westerners generally dislike government requirements even more than other regions,&quot; Nogee said. &quot;But Westerners are also practical. Twelve years of voluntary targets and financial incentives have failed to get utilities to increase renewable energy use or to reduce the heat-trapping emissions causing global warming. Western states are showing the rest of the country and Washington D.C., that fair, sensible standards can succeed.&quot;</FONT></P>
