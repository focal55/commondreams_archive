<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - February 11 - Americans for Democratic Action (ADA), the nation's oldest independent  liberal organization, applauds Members of both the Senate and the  House for the introduction of &quot;FAIRNESS: The Civil Rights Act of  2004,&quot; designed to strengthen civil rights protections which recent decisions have weakened.  Civil Rights laws, enacted over the last 40  years, were intended to help level the playing field in job opportunities, education, housing, voting and other areas of human endeavor.  Recent court cases have undercut those protections in ways that Congress and the American people never expected.</FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> This proposed bill addresses:</FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> * Protection for Older Workers</FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> *	Under court decisions, many older workers have lost the right to bring suit under federal age discrimination law. This bill would ensure that older workers, who are victims of practices that have an unjustified discriminatory effect on the basis of age, can seek relief in court.</FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">  *	Fair Treatment for Workers and the Military</FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> *	A State hospital nurses and other state workers have no federal remedy if their employers violate minimum wage and overtime laws.  The bill confirms Congress' intent that millions of state employees have a remedy in court.</FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">  *	Equal Pay for Equal Work</FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> *	This bill closes loopholes in the Equal Pay Act and makes it easier for a working woman to obtain relief when there is no legitimate reason for denying her the same pay as a male co-worker.</FONT></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
