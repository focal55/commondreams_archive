<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - April 7 - In reaction to a prominent publisher's refusal to stop driving up textbook costs by publishing &quot;new&quot; editions which are not significantly &quot;new&quot;, hundreds of college mathematics professors today issued a joint call to action.  Thomson Learning, in correspondence with student advocates, has refused to take simple steps to reduce textbook costs or to even acknowledge that a problem exists.</FONT></p><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The call to action, signed by over 500 mathematics faculty at over 125 of the largest and most prestigious universities nationwide, reiterates four simple requests that student advocates made to Thomson Learning in February.  The letter, which includes department chairs and Field Medal winners, was circulated amongst faculty nationwide.  </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The call to action was prompted by a recent report by CALPIRG, Ripoff 101: How the Current Practices of the Publishing Industry Drive up the Cost of College Textbooks, which found that students are paying an average of $900 a year for textbooks, a significant increase from previous years.  The report also found that textbook publishers use gimmicks to artificially inflate the price of textbooks.  For example, the report found that textbook publishers put new editions on the market frequently &#150; often with very few content changes &#150; making the less expensive, older textbook obsolete and unavailable.  On average, the report found that publishers keep textbook edition on the shelf for an average of only 3.5 years before updating them.  Meanwhile, seventy-six percent of faculty surveyed said that the new editions they use are justified half the time or less; over half of those faculty said that the new editions they use are &#147;rarely to never&#148; justified.  The report found that once a new textbook edition is produced, the used copy is quickly made obsolete, forcing students to purchase the more expensive new editions.  For example, over fifty-nine percent of students who searched for a used book for the fall 2003 quarter/semester were unable to find even one used book for their classes, and were forced to pay an average of $102.44 for a new book, verses an average of $64.80 for a used book.  In addition, the report found that faculty are often inconvenienced by this practice because new textbook editions require many professors to revise course syllabi to reflect changes in chapters and page numbers.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Thomson Learning&#146;s widely used textbook, Calculus: Early Transcendentals, was highlighted as an example because an inspection of the book revealed only cosmetic changes between the current edition, produced in 2003, and the previous edition, produced in 1999.  However, the price difference was significant &#150; a new copy of the book sells for about $130, while a used copy of the previous edition sells for between $20 and $90, depending on where one looks.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Thomson Learning also charges American students significantly more than their foreign counterparts.  According to the publisher&#146;s website, Calculus: Early Transcendentals sells for $125 to American students, but only $97 ($125 C) to Canadian students and only $65 (35 pounds) to British students.  This practice is widespread in the industry, and has come under a great deal of recent scrutiny.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Both the report and a fact sheet on the book can be downloaded at <A HREF="http://www.calpirgstudents.org/" TARGET="_new">www.CALPIRGStudents.org</A>.  </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Textbook prices appear to be extremely high, especially when comparing prices in different countries. These students appear to have a case, and it should be investigated,&quot; said Ronald Miech, Undergraduate Vice-Chair of the UCLA Mathematics Department.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Following the report, student leaders sent Thomson Learning a letter that included four simple requests:</FONT></P><UL><LI><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Continue to publish the current edition of Calculus: Early Transcendental until there has been significantly new content in the field of calculus, applications of calculus, and/or the teaching of calculus that would justify an update. </FONT></LI><LI><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Establish a fairer pricing system so that students in America are getting charged the same amount as their counterparts in other countries. </FONT></LI><LI><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Ensure that sales materials and sales representatives disclose to faculty all products, their prices, and the length of time Thomson Learning intends to keep on the market the current editions of its textbooks and related instructional materials. </FONT></LI><LI><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In addition to the hardcover version, produce an online version of Calculus: Early Transcendentals, and pass the cost savings on to students. </FONT></LI></UL><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In the ensuing correspondence, Thomson Learning has refused to directly address these requests or even acknowledge that a problem exists, only saying in a letter dated March 15, &#147;we can only assure you that we do our best to match our business practices with our customers&#146; needs &#150; a responsibility we take quite seriously.&#148;  </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Thomson, as a top seller in this market, should take lead in establishing reasonable prices for textbooks,&quot; said Professor Miech.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The company has also not responded to students&#146; questions aimed at clarifying both Thomson Learning&#146;s disclosure practices and exactly why the company charges American students significantly more for the same book than in Europe, Africa or the Middle East.  In their March 15 letter, the company said, &#147;The &#145;proof&#146; you request is readily available in the materials designed for the appropriate audiences.&#148;</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;Even if we disagree on the nature of the problem, we think that our questions are reasonable and worthy of more direct answers,&#148; said Mark Thornton, a UCLA student.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">On the positive side, the company has announced that it will offer a new line of low-frills, reduced price textbooks.  However, the line covers only a small number of books, nor does it address other key demands such as the lack of new content in new editions and the vast price difference between American and foreign versions of the book.  </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;Thomson Learning took a commendable, but extremely small, first step that only demonstrates that there is lots of room for them to improve,&#148; said Thornton.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Following the release of the letter, the students plan to begin contacting their campus Academic Senates and college presidents to ask for their involvement.  </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;We&#146;re not asking for much.  Frankly, I&#146;m surprised at how unresponsive they have been,&#148; said Thornton.</FONT></P>
