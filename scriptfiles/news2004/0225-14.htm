<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p>  <FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">SAN FRANCISCO, CA -  February 25 - WeCount.org today announced the launch of its Coalition for America 2004 campaign uniting voters across the political spectrum to support a single candidate to defeat George W. Bush in November and set the nation on a new path. </FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Working online and on-the-ground, WeCount.org's Coalition for America 2004 campaign expects to attract Democrats, Greens, Republicans (not supporting Bush) and independents who are frustrated by the fractured vote seen in previous elections and recognize that a united front will maximize the chances of an electoral victory.   The cornerstone of the campaign is a petition found at <A HREF="http://www.wecount.org" TARGET="_new">www.wecount.org</A> calling upon political leaders to build a coalition through public negotiations resulting in the support of single candidate in November's election. </FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Coalition for America 2004 is WeCount.org's first campaign promoting coalition building as a means to support policy change and influence the outcome of an election.  The campaign draws from Franklin D. Roosevelt's success in defeating conservative Herbert Hoover in 1932 with the New Deal Coalition which united labor unions, liberals, African Americans, and moderate southerners and remained a hallmark of Democratic strength until the early 1960's. </FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Last week, the campaign began collecting signatures with its first signers passing the petition on to friends, family and associates by e-mail.  WeCount.org has set a goal to reach one million signatures by May 31. The petition and signatures will then be presented to party leaders, candidates and influential independents who will be urged to form a coalition with agreements reached through public negotiations moderated by a neutral third party. The coalition will select and endorse a single presidential candidate who will in turn be supported by their constituents. </FONT></p><P></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">About WeCount.org</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WeCount.org is a not-for-profit political action committee (Sec. 527) founded in 2003 to promote policy changes in national government by establishing a continuing forum for coalition building, research, advocacy, and voter mobilization.
