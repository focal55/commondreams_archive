<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - February 13 - Statement by Matt Foreman, Executive Director, National Gay and Lesbian Task Force:</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;This is an historic moment in our community's long struggle for equality. For the first time in this country - a country founded on the principles of liberty and justice for all - lesbian and gay couples in loving, committed relationships were able to exercise the basic right of being able to marry.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">We are thrilled that two of our greatest pioneers - Del Martin, 83, and Phyllis Lyon, 80 - were the first couple to be issued a license. They have been together for more than 50 years and San Francisco residents since 1953. Contrary to the fear-mongering of our opponents, Phyllis and Del's marriage will not result in the collapse of western civilization or cause millions of heterosexual marriages to suddenly disintegrate. No, their marriage will harm no one but will give Del and Phyllis tangible rights and benefits, and - at long last - full equality with other married couples in the eyes of the law and society.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">We applaud San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom for upholding California's Constitution, which as he told the San Francisco Chronicle, 'clearly outlaws all forms of discrimination... and denying basic rights to members of our community will not be tolerated.'</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">We also thank State Assemblymember Mark Leno (D-San Francisco) who today introduced the Marriage License Non-Discrimination Act (MLNDA), sponsored by Equality California. The bill would end discrimination in the issuance of marriage licenses statewide, allowing same-sex couples to obtain marriage licenses anywhere in California.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Task Force calls on all fair-minded Californians to enforce the sanctity of the marriages of those same-sex couples who choose to marry in San Francisco by denouncing any attempts to nullify those commitments.&quot; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">According to the 2000 U.S. Census, there are 8,902 same-sex couples living in the same household in San Francisco. (See the Task Force report on the 2000 Census at <A HREF="http://www.TheTaskForce.org/library" TARGET="_new">http://www.TheTaskForce.org/library</A>.)</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">More information on the fight for marriage equality can be found in the Task Force Marriage Information Resource Center at <A HREF="http://www.TheTaskForce.org/marriagecenter" TARGET="_new">http://www.TheTaskForce.org/marriagecenter</A>.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Task Force and the L.A. Gay and Lesbian Center will kick off their California Vote for Equality campaign in a free public event on February 15.
