<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - May 4 - In response to Major League Baseball's placement of advertising on baseball uniforms for this season's opening series and to the possibility that advertising on uniforms will become permanent, Ralph Nader and the sports reform project League of Fans sent the following letter to Commissioner Selig.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">-----</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">May 4, 2004</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Allan H. &quot;Bud&quot; Selig, Commissioner</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Major League Baseball</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">245 Park Avenue, 31st Floor</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">New York, NY 10167</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Dear Mr. Selig:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The great lengths of selfishness with which you are willing to go to desecrate baseball and alienate fans of the game should no longer surprise us. Still, your placement of advertisements on the New York Yankees and Tampa Bay Devil Rays uniforms for Major League Baseball's opener on March 30 in Tokyo ambushed fans across the country and left them shaking their heads at this obscene embarrassment.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">We urge that you immediately put this issue to rest once and for all and eliminate any current or future possibility that Major League Baseball will accept advertisements on uniforms.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">You are suffocating Baseball's fan base. It's not enough for fans who want to enjoy a game to be forced to watch this pitch sponsored by that company or that home run sponsored by this corporation. In addition, they go to a stadium paid for by the fans and taxpayers, yet almost every available space is filled with ads and named after some multinational corporation with no ties to the community.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Over the last several years, fans have been made to watch &quot;virtual advertising&quot; infiltrate television broadcasts, and T.V. commentators using the broadcast booth to hawk cell phones during the playoffs and World Series. This over-commercialization is sapping the fun out of being a fan of Major League Baseball.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Now, you have sunk to a greedy new low. Bending Baseball to the demands of advertisers and accepting more than $10 million (according to Advertising Age) for a corporation to plaster ads on the uniforms for the two-game series in Tokyo. It's supposedly a one-time deal, but conventional wisdom says otherwise -- that permanent advertising on uniforms isn't a question of &quot;if,&quot; but &quot;when.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">MLB executive vice president for business Tim Brosnan, told reporters in Japan &quot;Are there any definitive plans to put logos on uniforms? No. I don't see that happening. But on the other side of the coin, never say never.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;We're mindful of the fans, but I don't think [advertising on uniforms] is unreasonable,&quot; Brosnan later told the New York Post. &quot;We're always looking for new ways to advance our business.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">That must sound reassuring to fans. The public tolerates a certain amount of commercialism, but why do you insist on trying the patience of loyal baseball fans across the country? We already have NASCAR, with drivers doubling as walking commercial billboards. Is that really what you want for the national pastime?</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Commissioner Selig, no one is trying to get in the way of your ability to make money, but you need to look beyond the immediate bottom line to make Major League Baseball sustainable. As primary caretaker, this means your job is to respect cities and fans, ensure the integrity of the game, and eliminate self-interested and destructive tendencies. Advertising on uniforms runs counter to each of these critical principles.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">If you allow such an explicit interference of baseball with another greedy vehicle for corporate marketing -- using player uniforms as product placement surfaces -- apathy is not what you should expect from fans and sportswriters. There will be considerable resentment, and fans will drift away. A matter of taste can sour more quickly than you think.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Sincerely,</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Ralph Nader</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Shawn McCarthy</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">League of Fans</FONT></P><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
