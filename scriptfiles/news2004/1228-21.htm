<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><p>OHIO - December 28 - The Motion filed by Green Party presidential candidate 
David 
Cobb last week, asking a Federal Court to preserve a wide range of 
evidence 
to ensure the integrity of the Ohio recount, was officially supported 
by the 
Kerry-Edwards campaign today.
           <p> "Senator Kerry filed a Motion today which essentially says 
nothing more than 'me, too' to our filing from last week," said Blair 
Bobier, Media Director for the Cobb-LaMarche campaign.
         <p>   Cobb's attorneys on Thursday had filed a Motion for a 
Preservation Order and for Leave to Take Limited Expedited Discovery in 
the 
U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio where recount 
litigation is pending.  The Motion, filed on behalf of Cobb, 
Libertarian 
presidential candidate Michael Badnarik and the National Voting Rights 
Institute, requested that voting machines and election records be 
preserved.
         <p>   "We welcome Senator Kerry's belated interest in ensuring 
the 
integrity of the Ohio recount.  This effort, initiated by the Green and 
Libertarian presidential candidates, has been focusing on the integrity 
of 
the election process and not on the outcome.  In order to trust the 
election 
results, we have to trust the process.  All presidential candidates, 
including George W. Bush, who are committed to an open and accountable 
voting system should demand an investigation into an election clouded 
by 
serious allegations of fraud and suppression," said Bobier.
           <p> The Ohio recount has been plagued with almost as many 
problems 
as the underlying presidential election.  One of the more notable 
instances 
took place on December 10, in Hocking County, Ohio, when a 
representative 
from Triad Governmental Systems, Inc. reprogrammed a computer used for 
tabulating votes and instructed the county's Deputy Director of 
Elections to 
create a "cheat sheet" so "the count would come out perfect and we 
wouldn't 
have to do a full hand recount of the county."  Triad later reported 
working 
on voting machines in a number of other counties prior to the 
initiation of 
the recount.
           <p> The Hocking County incident was first revealed to the 
public by 
David Cobb during his testimony before the Congressional Forum chaired 
by 
Representative John Conyers in Columbus, Ohio on December 13.
        <p>    Legal documents filed in the Ohio recount litigation, along 
with 
detailed reports from official recount observers detailing the 
error-ridden 
recount, can be found on the Cobb-LaMarche website,
