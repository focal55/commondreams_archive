<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - June 22 - &quot;We are one giant step closer to combating workplace discrimination,&quot; said NOW Action Vice President Olga Vives. &quot;Wal-Mart will finally be held accountable for its treatment of women.&quot; </FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Today, U.S. District Court Judge Martin Jenkins certified a massive class action, ruling that six current and former Wal-Mart employees from California may represent all female employees of Wal-Mart who worked at its U.S. stores anytime since December 26, 1998. This nationwide sex discrimination class action lawsuit, Dukes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., is the largest civil rights class action ever certified against a private employer, and damages could run over a billion dollars. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">NOW's Women Friendly Workplace campaign named Wal-Mart a &quot;Merchant of Shame&quot; in 2002 in response to the company's growing list of unfair labor practices. Since that time, NOW activists have participated in a worker-friendly education campaigns at Wal-Mart stores throughout the country. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Hundreds of women reported that Wal-Mart has created a hostile working environment, one which systematically discriminates against women in pay, training, and promotion,&quot; said Vives. &quot;Women who face this problem should be encouraged to know that effective remedies exist and feel comfortable coming forward with their complaint.&quot; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Judge Jenkins described the case as &quot;historic in nature, dwarfing other employment discrimination cases that came before it.&quot; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The suit, originally filed in 2001, charges that Wal-Mart discriminates against its female retail employees in pay and promotions. The class in this case includes more than 1.6 million current and former female employees of Wal-Mart retail stores in America, including Wal-Mart discount stores, super centers, neighborhood stores, and Sam's Clubs. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Reacting to this lawsuit and a decrease in stock value, Wal-Mart recently introduced workplace diversity initiatives, intended to prevent further gender bias and unfair treatment of workers. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;We will continue monitoring Wal-Mart to make sure that they do implement safeguards for women,&quot; said Vives. &quot;Corporations must understand that a loaf of bread doesn't cost any less for a woman.&quot; </FONT></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
