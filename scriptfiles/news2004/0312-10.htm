<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - March 12 - Moving Ideas, the leading source for progressive public policy on the net, has released a new analysis of President Bush's budget. Moving Ideas has compiled research, editorials and fact sheets from progressive organizations such as the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, The Economic Policy Institute and The Century Foundation. This research companion includes links to government and progressive organizations that examine budget issues such as: domestic spending, tax cuts, education, medical care, environment, housing and military spending. </FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">After winning a major legislative victory with the passage of the 2004 Omnibus Appropriations Bill, President Bush released his FY 2005 Budget on February 2 in the face of alarming deficit estimates.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Despite the misleading claims of some conservatives, the evidence clearly shows that the Bush tax cuts along with the cost of the Iraq war-not domestic spending-accounts for the great majority of the out-of-control deficit. Of the $500+ billion shortfall estimated by the White House for FY 2005, $291.3 billion is due to the cost of the Bush tax cuts (of which $94.7 billion goes to the richest one percent). Projected over a ten-year period, the tax cuts will cost 36 times more than all other domestic initiatives recently proposed by the president (e.g. funding for community colleges, pro-abstinence programs, prisoner re-entry support, etc.) </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Read articles such as: .
