To drive this message home, women from across the country gathered last night at the Culture Project Theatre in New York City with V-Day Founder/ Playwright Eve Ensler, who channeled the unstoppable power of the arts and activism to motivate and inspire women to vote.</FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;V-Day is made up of thousands of activists and voting is one form of activism. We are here today to encourage all women to 'Value Your Vagina - Vote!' and to make ending the rampant violence against women which affects one in three women in the world a central focus of politics alongside jobs, healthcare, and security,&quot; said Eve Ensler, founder of V-Day and playwright of The Vagina Monologues, and The Good Body. &quot;More than 22 million registered female voters did not vote in the 2000 presidential election. We need to get out there and support political leaders and legislation that will end violence against women.&quot;</FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">    Event highlights included a political call to power led by Eve Ensler, a preview of a new performance piece created by Rha Goddess on young women and voting entitled &quot;We Got Issues!&quot; with special remarks from actor/activist Kathy Najimy.</FONT></p><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;This election, more than ever ... we show up at the polls with our hearts and our souls and we vote for freedom, equality, and to save women's lives,&quot;said V-Day supporter actor/activist Kathy Najimy.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">    THE ISSUE: VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN:    Why should violence against women and girls be central to the 2004 election?  A two-year study conducted by the Center for the Advancement of Women shows that women want a new movement with new priorities.  In the nationally representative study 92% of women identified that reducing domestic and sexual violence is their top policy priority, followed by pay equity, childcare and healthcare.  In addition, a nationally representative poll conducted by Penn and Schoen demonstrated that 92% of Americans believe that violence against women is an important problem that is not getting enough attention and the majority (55%) thinks that law enforcement agencies are not doing enough to prevent it.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">    Unmarried women are the LARGEST group of people not participating in our democracy, and have the greatest potential to change the outcome of this election. Sixteen million unmarried women are unregistered; more than 22 million didn't vote in 2000.  Over 75% of V-Day activists are college age and fall within this category.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">    THE CAMPAIGN - V IS FOR VOTE:     V Is For Vote is a grassroots voting campaign created with and by the thousands of local V-Day activists and organizers in the U.S. V-Day is outreaching to the political candidates urging them to make Violence Against Women a central issue of their campaign platform alongside jobs, education, msecurity and healthcare, not a sideline or women's issue. Ultimately, V-Day will mobilize its activism into political power through V Is For Vote as V-Day supporters &quot;Vote to End Violence.&quot; V Is For Vote. The message is simple, but for millions of women and children around the world, it could mean the difference of a lifetime.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">    Throughout the summer, V-Posse leaders will register, educate about the issue, and get out the vote in their communities. To date, the campaign has leader/activists signed up in over 30 states. V-Day activists will stage V Is For Vote events across the country with Ensler appearing at select events pending her performance schedule.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">    Two key events:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">    WOMEN AND POWER: OUR TIME TO LEAD - Presented by Omega and V-Day, September 11-13, 2004 at NYC's Sheraton New York Hotel, the conference is a unique gathering for women who want to redefine power and lead from core female values.
