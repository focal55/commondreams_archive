<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

In an effort to engage and mobilize and educate America's newest voters in key states, SEIU President Andy Stern joins up with PunkVoter.com's Rock Against Bush tour members tomorrow, Sept 29, to sound off about the nation's health care crisis with some of the loudest and most political in punk music, Anti-Flag and Tom Morello (Rage Against The Machine, Audioslave, The Nightwatchman).

</ul>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

President Bush's policies have led to over 2 million lost jobs, and during his presidency, 5.2 million more people have joined the ranks of the uninsured. SEIU and PunkVoter.com are spreading the message from picket line to mosh pit in an effort to put this country back on track so that every American, young and old, has a secure economic future.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Whether you join a band or join a union -- it's all about fighting for your rights," said Stern. "This country needs affordable health care that we can count on."</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

"Young Americans can't find work and are suffering from some of the worst unemployment rates in three decades," said Anti-Flag member Justin Sane.

Stern will join Anti-Flag and Tom Morello, along with other PunkVoter.com members at the Rock Against Bush concert Wednesday evening at Cleveland's Agora Theater.</font></p>
