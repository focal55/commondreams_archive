<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NEW YORK, NY - August 30 - &quot;We are marching today to raise our voices in the streets of New York City and announce to the world that the Bush Administration's war on women will not be tolerated,&quot; said NOW Action Vice President Olga Vives, at a press conference before hundreds of thousands of protesters at the United for Peace and Justice March. &quot;It is unimaginable what will happen to this country if we do not defeat George W. Bush in November. Let us end this nightmare on Election Day.&quot; 
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NOW activists are joining hundreds of anti-war and pro-choice organizations in a week-long series of protests and rallies in the streets of New York City, to bring attention to the abusive and destructive anti-woman policies of the Bush administration. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We're following the Republicans this week, to let them know we've heard them loud and clear -- that they do not support the issues important to women, issues vital to our country's well-being -- and we are joining our allies to let them know that we're not going to take this anymore,&quot; said Vives. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The president has imposed rash, militaristic policies on the U.S. and the world,&quot; said Vives. &quot;He has abused his power by misleading us into a dangerous and costly war and has done everything in his power to deny us our basic civil rights. Come November, we will hold him accountable.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On Wednesday night, National NOW and NOW New York City will host a rally in Central Park, to formally declare a state of emergency. &quot;Code Red: Stop the Bush Agenda&quot; is being organized to spotlight the war on women's rights and civil liberites. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The 22 million single women who did not vote in the last election must take part in the democratic process this year,&quot; said Vives. &quot;We must cast our vote for change! Women's votes will make the difference for all of our futures.&quot; </font></p>
