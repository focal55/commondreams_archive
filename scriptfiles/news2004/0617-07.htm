<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - June 17 - After raising a combined $1 billion in unlimited corporate, union and individual contributions in the 2000 and 2002 election cycles, the Democratic and Republican parties are now living under a soft money ban imposed by the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, also known as the McCain-Feingold law.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Where has the soft money gone? How have the donors adjusted to the soft money ban? What effects has the ban had on individual donations, PAC giving and contributions to so-called 527 groups?</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Center, in continuation of a project funded by The Pew Charitable Trusts to study campaign fundraising under the new law, will explore the answers to these questions June 25 at the National Press Club.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Center will present an analysis of campaign finance figures that break down the patterns in political giving by individuals and organizations that made up the biggest soft money donors under the old law. The analysis will include a look at fundraising by the national political parties in the 2004 election cycle so far, as well as a breakdown of giving by industry.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The event will feature a panel discussion of how various types of political contributors, including ideological donors, business donors, labor unions and others, have adjusted to the new law.
