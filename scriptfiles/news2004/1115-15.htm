Because of continuing violence and fear, crops are not being planted and cultivated, disease rates are skyrocketing and starvation is quickly becoming a reality in the region. The United Nations has described Darfur's conflict as &quot;the world's worst humanitarian crisis.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Genocide:</b></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;When the U.S. Congress unanimously declares the situation 'genocide,' by a vote of 422 to 0, there's no question it's genocide,&quot; asserted Ben Homan, president of Food for the Hungry.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Wells, latrines for immediate help:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The DRC, working through their lead agency, World Relief, has established bases of operation in Khartoum and El Geneina and is working in the villages of Um Tagouk, Sanidadi and Azirni.
