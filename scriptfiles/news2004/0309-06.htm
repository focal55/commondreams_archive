<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - March 9 - Today, Public Campaign Action Fund announced that &quot;Weapons of Mass Corruption&quot; is the winner of its contest to name the category of super-mega-fundraisers for President George W. Bush's re-election campaign.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">A panel of expert judges selected five finalists from 1,191 names submitted for Bush's $500,000 bundlers. Then the five finalists were put to a vote. Forty-seven percent of the more than 6,100 people participated in the on-line balloting cast votes for the winning entry.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;My excitement in winning the contest is tempered by my concern about the effect all this special interest money is having on our democracy,&quot; said Mary Rocco of Los Angeles, who submitted the winning entry. &quot;Americans need to know to whom our President is indebted. It is just common sense that voters should be informed of the names of those who have raised a half million dollars or more for a candidate's campaign.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The panel of 18 expert judges, which included columnist and author Arianna Huffington, MoveOn.org co-founder Joan Blades, and pro basketball player Adonal Foyle, joined Public Campaign Action Fund in saluting Ms. Rocco.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Clearly, Ms. Rocco's entry touched a nerve. Americans don't know where the Weapons of Mass Destruction are yet, but we are certain that these wealthy special interest fundraisers are 'Weapons of Mass Corruption' when it comes to the democratic process,&quot; said Nick Nyhart, Executive Director of Public Campaign Action Fund and a judge for the contest.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Also today, Public Campaign Action Fund and Public Citizen sent letters to President George W. Bush's and Senator John Kerry's campaigns to urge them to release the names of those who have raised $500,000 for their campaigns. The members of the Action Fund will be asked to participate in this campaign to expose those through a new webpage, <A HREF="http://masscorruption.pcactionfund.org" TARGET="_new">http://masscorruption.pcactionfund.org</A>, which was set up to urge candidates to comply with this request.</FONT></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
