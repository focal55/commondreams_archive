<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - February 5 - Responding to an announcement that Royal Caribbean Cruises (NYSE:RCL) will be completely overhauling its Nordic Empress cruise liner to provide more entertainment options for passengers, Oceana today called on the industry giant to also improve the ship's lackluster wastewater treatment performance.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Stating in a press release that renovations would &quot;extend to every area of the ship,&quot; Royal Caribbean notably excluded any mention of improvements being made to the ship's waste treatment apparatus. Currently, the Nordic Empress employs an antiquated Marine Sanitation Device (MSD) to treat its waste. MSDs have proven ineffective, with a recent study showing that 68 of 70 MSD- treated sewage samples from large cruise ships failed to meet federal water quality standards.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;This is the second time in three months that Royal Caribbean has invested heavily in either constructing or renovating a ship. As usual, the environment wasn't even a consideration,&quot; said Dana DuBose, Ocean's Cruise Pollution campaign director. &quot;Royal Caribbean should spend a little less time bragging about its environmental record and a little more time doing something to earn it.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Royal Caribbean has stood out in an industry of polluters, touting itself as an environmental leader despite the fact that it is currently under court-ordered probation for past environmental offenses. The company has been fined more than $30 million for illegally dumping oily bilge and other hazardous materials, as well as falsifying records to the Coast Guard. Furthermore, only three of Royal Caribbean's 27 ships are equipped with the advanced wastewater treatment equipment needed to cleanse the millions of gallons of sewage they produce and dump into the waters daily. Royal Caribbean has refused to upgrade the remainder of its fleet.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;This action speaks volumes about Royal Caribbean's priorities,&quot; said DuBose. &quot;They clearly have the money for upgrades, but rather than directing it toward preserving the oceans that many of their passengers come to see, they simply use it to dial up the glitz.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Citizens interested in joining or learning more about Oceana's campaign to stop cruise pollution are encouraged to call Oceana headquarters toll-free at 1-877-7-OCEANA, or visit the website at <A HREF="http://www.oceana.org" TARGET="_new">www.oceana.org</A>. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><I>Oceana is a non-profit international advocacy organization dedicated to restoring and protecting the world's oceans through policy advocacy, science, law and public education.
