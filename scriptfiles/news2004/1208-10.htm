<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- December 8 -- Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA) today challenged President Bush's signing of the Weldon Amendment, or so-called &quot;Abortion Non- Discrimination Act&quot; (ANDA). The legislation, originally proposed by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and added as an amendment to the final version of the omnibus appropriations bill, will allow health care organizations to refuse to comply with existing federal, state or local laws pertaining to abortion.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This amendment's Orwellian name makes it sound as if it protects women seeking abortions from discrimination. In fact, it discriminates against them,&quot; said PPFA President Gloria Feldt. &quot;It also discriminates against health care providers as well as state and local governments that want to provide comprehensive women's health care. It allows any health care provider or institution, religious or otherwise, to refuse to provide a much- needed reproductive health care service. The vast majority of Americans oppose allowing health care entities to deny services to women, even if those entities claim their refusal is based on religious or moral grounds, which ANDA does not require. This sweeping federal refusal clause will allow the whims of a corporate entity to trump the conscience and very real medical needs of women nationwide. Simply put, you ought to be able to trust your doctor or hospital to give you a full range of options and respect your health care choices. ANDA lets them discriminate against you.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ANDA was added to the appropriations bill by anti-choice Rep. Dave Weldon (R-Fla.). The bill provides a sweeping exemption from existing laws relating to safe and legal abortion services. Health care entities, as defined by the law, include hospitals, provider-sponsored organizations, health maintenance organizations, health insurance plans or any other kind of health care facilities, organizations or plans.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Feldt said, &quot;PPFA and others will be working to see the law blocked in the courts or repealed in Congress, where Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-Tenn.) has promised Senator Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) a vote to repeal the bill.We will also continue to work with our allies in Congress and across the pro-choice movement to strengthen legislative protections on reproductive rights and health through measures like the Putting Prevention First Act (PPFA), which promotes family planning programs. If ANDA's anti-choice supporters really cared about preventing abortions, they would help us do more to support family planning instead of penalizing women and service providers with vague, unfair, and dangerous legislation.&quot;</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
