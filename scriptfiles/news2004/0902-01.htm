<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - September 1 - As Vice President Dick Cheney gave his prime-time address at the Republican National Convention on Wednesday night, Gael Murphy and Tiffany Burns of CODEPINK: Women for Peace unfurled a banner that read, &#147;Cheney and Halliburton, Making a Killing in Iraq.&#148; They were dragged out of the convention.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Halliburton is the poster child for war profiteering,&#148; Murphy said. &#147;The company has made billions off the killing in Iraq, and is ripping off American taxpayers and Iraqis, but because of their close ties to Dick Cheney, they&#146;re never held accountable.&#148; </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Halliburton has been the number one beneficiary of the invasion of Iraq, raking in some $9 billion in contracts to rebuild the country&#146;s oil industry and service the U.S. troops. Dick Cheney was Halliburton&#146;s CEO from 1995 to 2000, and he still receives $178,000 annually from the company. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Halliburton&#146;s provision of services in Iraq has been shoddy at best and criminally fraudulent at worst.  Every week new stories break in the news media detailing overcharges of $60 million for fuel delivery, $27.5 million for food services never provided to American troops, KBR trucks criss-crossing Iraq for hundreds of miles carrying empty loads, and corporate executives enjoying lavish stays at 5-star Kuwaiti hotels on the American tax-payers tab.  In January, the company admitted that two employees involved in Iraq work took kickbacks worth $6.3 million from Kuwaiti contractors.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This is the second night in a row that CODEPINK activists have unfurled a banner inside the RNC during prime time speeches. Last night, Medea Benjamin of CODEPINK unfurled a pink banner that said &#147;Be Pro-Life: Stop the Killing in Iraq&#148; during Laura Bush&#146;s speech.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Gael Murphy is a 50-year-old peace activist from Washington, DC who has traveled to Iraq several times since the war started. In addition to holding the banner, she was wearing a pink slip that read, &#147;Cheney&#146;s in bed with Halliburton, and we got screwed.&#148; Tiffany Burns is a 28-year-old peace activist from Los Angeles. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CODEPINK is a women&#146;s peace group with 90 chapters throughout the United States and the world. Its members have held numerous protests against Halliburton&#146;s war profiteering and corporate cronyism, including one during the RNC on Tuesday morning, outside the hotel where the Texas delegates are staying.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For more information about Halliburton, see<a href="http://www.Halliburtonwatch.org" target="_new"> www.Halliburtonwatch.org</a>.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
