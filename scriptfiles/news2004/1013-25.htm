<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  WASHINGTON - October 13 - If anyone should be publicly thanking the AARP for their endorsement and support of the Medicare drug benefit, it should be President George W. Bush, the Alliance for Retired Americans said today. Without AARP's help, he'd have no drug benefit to tout. But the 25,000-strong AARP conventioneers meeting in Las Vegas Oct. 14 won't be hearing an in-person thank you from President Bush.</font>
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He's nixed an invite to address the seniors and opted instead to rally with partisans faithfuls just a mere 2.6 miles away at a &quot;Nevada Victory 2004&quot; event on the campus of University of Nevada -- Las Vegas, the Bush-Cheney '04 Campaign reports.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Once again President Bush has demonstrated that America's seniors are not his top priority,&quot; said Edward F. Coyle, executive director of the Alliance for Retired Americans. &quot;This president is afraid of seniors and their public reaction to the woefully inadequate drug benefit. He knows how bogus the benefit is and so do seniors.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Bush also knows the power of the senior vote and is hoping this voting bloc doesn't fully appreciate until after Election Day the ruse he pulled on them.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Coyle noted that neither Bush or those who voted for the Medicare law are getting the expected favorable ratings boost from seniors normally associated with passage of domestic bills requiring such extraordinary spending. He predicted that seniors, who in 2000 cast almost 25 percent of all votes for president, will turnout in record numbers again and vote their displeasure both at Bush and with the Medicare law.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Seniors will be heard on this issue,&quot; Coyle predicted. &quot;Bush and the lawmakers who supported the 2003 Medicare law are guilty of political malpractice.&quot;</font></p>
