<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - July 6 - Campaign for America&#146;s Future Co-director Robert Borosage today said John Edwards&#146; populist progressive message earned his spot on the Democratic presidential ticket. Edwards was the most popular choice for the ticket, according to a poll by the Associated Press conducted last month. Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry today asked Edwards to join his ticket to take back America.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">STATEMENT OF ROBERT BOROSAGE</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Edwards&#146; success is a tale of two Americas. His theme of creating one America captured the hearts and minds of Americans who believe America is on the wrong track and want to go another way. His commitment to fight for an economy that works for working people and good jobs with good benefits, affordable health care, a secure retirement, high-quality public education and energy independence challenges the failed ideas of the right wing that got us into this mess.</FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
