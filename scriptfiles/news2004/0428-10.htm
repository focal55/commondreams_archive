<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - April 28 - As President Bush today continues to shirk responsibility for the CIA&#146;s finding in the summer of 2001 that Osama bin Ladin was planning to strike inside the United States, MoveOn Voter Fund is running a full-page print ad in the New York Times which reads: <B>&#147;BIN LADIN DETERMINED TO STRIKE IN U.S. President Bush Received this Warning Weeks Before September 11, 2001.  He Did Nothing.&#148;</B></FONT></p><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The ad is based on the title of the Presidential Daily Briefing (PDB) of August 6, 2001, which the President still claims was not enough of an indication of a terrorist danger and &#147;said nothing about an attack on America.&#148; [Remarks by the President to the White House Press Travel Pool, 4/11/04]   </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;The President and Vice President speak before the 9/11 Commission today, and Americans expect the truth,&#148; said Wes Boyd, President of MoveOn Voter Fund.  &#147;The memo posed to the President in August of &#145;01 couldn&#146;t be clearer, and his failure to claim any responsibility is indefensible.&#148; </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">This is the same president who invaded Iraq without waiting for UN weapons inspectors to determine whether Saddam Hussein constituted a threat&#151;rushing into a war that so far has claimed the lives of more than 700 American soldiers, plus thousands of Iraqi civilians.  Even the Administration now admits there were neither dangerous weapons nor an imminent threat from Iraq.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;When provided very clear information that Bin Ladin had planned an attack on the United States, President Bush failed to act to protect the American people.  Instead, he rushed into war with a nation that posed no threat to the United States, had been disarmed by the United Nations and that had no connection with 9/11,&#148; continued Boyd. </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Bush was briefed at his Texas ranch on the contents of the August 6, 2001 memo, but earlier this month he claimed the PDB &#147;was no indication of a terrorist threat&#148; and &#147;said nothing about an attack on America.&#148; [Remarks by the President to the White House Press Travel Pool, 4/11/04]   </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">But the PDB specifically said there were &#147;patterns of suspicious activity in this country consistent with preparations for hijackings or other types of attacks&#148; with the FBI &#147;conducting approximately 70 full field investigations&#148; including one into allegations that &#147;a group of Bin Ladin supporters was in the U.S. planning attacks with explosives.&#148; [Presidential Daily Brief, 8/6/01]</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The President said there was no information about a &#147;time and a place [of] an attack.&#148; But the PDB specifically said that terrorists had engaged in &#147;recent surveillance of federal buildings in New York&#148; and that &#147;Bin Ladin told followers he wanted to retaliate in Washington.&#148; [Presidential Daily Brief, 8/6/01]</FONT></P><P> </P><P><B><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">To view the New York Times full page ad, visit: <A HREF="http://www.moveonvoterfund.org" TARGET="_new">www.moveonvoterfund.org</A>.</FONT></B></P><P></P><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
