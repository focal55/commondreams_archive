<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - August 4 - As the first of Ford's gasoline-electric hybrid SUVs roll off its Kansas City assembly line with great fanfare, a coalition of environmental and human rights organizations challenge the company to make a real commitment to increasing the fuel economy of its entire fleet of cars and trucks.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Ford's Escape hybrid is a rolling advertisement for better technology and less pollution,&quot; said Elisa Lynch of Bluewater Network, &quot;but it can't hide the fact that Ford will still have the worst fuel efficiency of any major U.S. producer.&quot; </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to U.S. EPA data, Ford has had the lowest average fleet fuel economy of any major U.S. automaker every year since 1999. With an annual production of only 20,000 vehicles, the introduction of the Escape hybrid is not expected to change that last place showing. Ford produces over 6,000,000 vehicles annually. The Escape SUV will account for less than one half of one percent of the 2005 model year production.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We're pleased to see that Ford is bringing a hybrid vehicle to market, but we're still waiting for its overall plan,&quot; said Jennifer Krill of Rainforest Action Network. &quot;If Ford wants to position itself as an environmental leader, it needs to do more than produce one improved vehicle in limited quantities.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Even as it was gearing up for the Escape rollout, the company was taking actions to undermine the entire federal fuel economy program. Weighing in on the recent Bush Administration request for comments on the fuel economy program structure, Ford supported maintaining an exemption for trucks between 8,500 and 10,000 pounds, as well as a loophole that permits pickup trucks, SUVs, and minivans to meet lower fuel economy standards.  </font></p><p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Ford is supporting the Bush Administration's proposal to maintain a loophole that blocks our escape from U.S. dependence on oil,&quot; said Gretchen DuBeau of U.S. PIRG.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Coalition members are dismayed that Ford is moving ahead with plans to confiscate and destroy its 350-vehicle fleet of Th!nk electric vehicles, which have been used by highly satisfied drivers under long-term lease since 2001. The current leaseholders have asked to be allowed to keep the vehicles, and a Norwegian manufacturer and the Norwegian government have asked for Ford to sell them the vehicles. Ford has not responded to any of those requests. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;If Ford were truly serious about increasing fuel economy, it would not be wantonly confiscating and crushing its pure electric vehicles,&quot; said Jason Mark of Global Exchange. &quot;The current drivers love these cars, and there are drivers in Europe who want them, but Ford is destroying them. Ford likes to call its Escape hybrid a 'no compromise vehicle.' In fact, by pulling these alternatives off the roads, Ford is compromising our children's future.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The groups challenged Ford to take immediate action to increase the fuel economy of its entire fleet using hybrid technologies as well as other conventional technologies that can greatly improve fuel efficiency.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We wish we could feel more hopeful about Ford's commitment to reducing oil dependence and carbon dioxide emissions with Ford's launch of the Escape hybrid,&quot; said Andrew Shalit of Ecopledge. &quot;Unfortunately, the paltry number of hybrids the company is building, combined with the destruction of its pure electric vehicles, leaves us wondering when that day will be.&quot; </font></p><p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">###</font></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
