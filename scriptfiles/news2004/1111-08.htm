<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- November 11 -- Alliance for Justice expresses serious concerns over the nomination of White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales to the post of United States Attorney General. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Alberto Gonzales served as a primary author of memos advocating the use of torture in defiance of the Geneva Conventions, international law and standards of human decency,&quot; said Alliance for Justice President Nan Aron. &quot;Gonzales provided the Bush administration with the legal architecture to sidestep and ignore the rule of law that, as attorney general, he will be mandated to enforce.&quot; </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Prominent members of the legal community, in a bipartisan effort, have long been demanding full disclosure of all memos related to torture-a request that White House Counsel Gonzales, among others, has failed to meet. &quot;Alliance for Justice urges the Senate Judiciary Committee to review all memos relating to torture written during Gonzales' tenure as White House counsel before voting on his nomination,&quot; said Aron. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Aron noted other areas of concern in Gonzales' record, including his direct role as White House counsel in selecting extremist judicial nominees; his cavalier treatment of clemency petitions in Texas death penalty cases while advising then- Governor George W. Bush; and his financial connections to Enron as a Texas Supreme Court justice.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Gonzales has consistently pushed the limits of executive privilege in order to shield the Bush administration from oversight by Congress or scrutiny by the American people,&quot; added Aron. &quot;The position of the country's chief law enforcement officer demands an impeccable level of integrity and commitment to the rule of law that Gonzales has not proven to possess.&quot;</font></p>
