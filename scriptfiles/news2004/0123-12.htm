The decisions made by the more than 1,000 top presidential appointees have a powerful impact on the daily lives of all Americans and the backgrounds of those individuals who may serve in a future Cabinet should be open to scrutiny by the electorate.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In an effort to make the process more transparent, the PGI has posted comprehensive information on our web site, <A HREF="http://www.progressivegovernment.org/PresidentialCampaign" TARGET="_NEW">www.progressivegovernment.org/PresidentialCampaign</A> , about the senior staff and advisors to the candidates.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;We encourage the voters of New Hampshire, and across the country, to visit our site and take a look at the qualifications of the people advising the candidates, many of them may be members of a future Administration.&quot; said LaMagna. &quot;We also want to applaud Peter Jennings for asking a question in the debate last night about who Al Sharpton would appoint to be Chairman of the Federal Reserve if he were to be elected.  We hope that the issue of Cabinet appointments will be addressed in future debates as well,&quot; added LaMagna.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">*WHDH-TV Boston, Suffolk University Tracking Poll 1-23-04 </FONT></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
