<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - March 19 - 9/11 CitizensWatch ( http://www.911citizenswatch.org ) and 9/11 victim family members will hold a press conference at the National Press Club, 529 14th St. NW, 13th Floor, Morrow Room, Washington, D.C. at 1 p.m. on Monday, March 22.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">A watchdog group, 9/11 CitizensWatch, that monitors the official 9/11 investigation, will be joined by family members of those who lost loved ones on 9/11 to formally present as yet unanswered questions regarding the attacks of September 11, 2001. They are set to present<A HREF="http://www.9-11commission.gov" TARGET="_new"> tough questions for the 9/11 Commission witnesses</A> giving testimony at upcoming hearings on March 23 and 24.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;These are questions for top officials from current and former administrations that we'd like to see answered before the 9/11 Commission, under oath and in public. Americans deserve a transparent investigation into this world-changing event and the deaths of over 3000 people. To date the concerns and key questions raised by families and citizens remain to be addressed,&quot; insisted, John Judge, a co-founder of 9/11 CitizensWatch.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The 9/11 Commission currently investigating the attacks will be holding hearings next week with members of the Clinton and Bush administrations. Notably absent is National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice who has refused to offer sworn public testimony. &quot;There is a growing chorus calling for public testimony from not only Condoleezza Rice, but also from Bush and Cheney. Ongoing stonewalling is not only an affront to the victims and their families, but conveys a sense to the American people that they have something to hide. Full disclosure and accountability is a must,&quot; said Kyle F. Hence of CitizensWatch.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Current administration resistance to a public inquiry began shortly after members of Congress called for a Commission inquiry and public hearings. 9/11 Commission chair Gov. Thomas Kean and other members have consistently spoken out about a pattern by the FAA, NORAD and the current administration of withholding or delaying access to documents and testimony. Commissioner Bob Kerry recently said that they could not do a thorough investigation under the restrictions currently imposed by the White House staff.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Organizers and 9/11 family members have consistently raised disturbing and unsettling questions for potential witnesses, based on solid independent research and analysis. Jamie Gorelick, one of the 9/11 Commissioners, referred to the questions posed by 9/11 widow Mindy Kleinberg of the 9/11 Family Steering Committee as a 'road map' for the<A HREF="http://www.911independentcommission.org" TARGET="_new"> commission</A>. &quot;We feel these questions are best answered openly in a public forum not in closed interviews or overly classified reports. We want to send a clear message to all individuals in a position to provide the country with a full accounting to do so in the open,&quot; said Kyle Hence, one of the event organizers.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">9/11 CitizensWatch will also be unveiling an ad campaign in D.C. designed to reach hundreds of thousands with their message calling for an end to stonewalling on 9/11.</FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
