<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DUBLIN, NH - August 23 - Doris Haddock, known around the country as &quot;Granny D,&quot; has officially changed her name to Doris Granny D Haddock. The name change was approved by Judge John Maher during a hearing at Cheshire Country Probate Court on Thursday, August 19. Before the name change, Doris Haddock's legal name was Ethel Doris Haddock. Her family began calling her Granny D in 1972.</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;I'm Granny D,&quot; said Haddock. &quot;I'm 94, and I want to make it official. I want the citizens of New Hampshire to be able to vote for Granny D-this is how people know me.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Haddock, who is the Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate, petitioned the New Hampshire Ballot Law Commission under RSA 665:9 to allow the use of her nickname &quot;Granny D&quot; on the Primary ballot. In a 4 to 1 vote the Commission denied the request, citing as reasons that the nickname included a term of endearment, was associated with a walk in favor of a specific political cause, and was not derived from the candidate's given name.  The nicknames of two other petitioners, candidates Randolph &quot;Rip&quot; Holden and Janet &quot;Jill&quot; Hammond, were approved.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;To deny her the use of her name-a name that she uses everywhere, and that everybody else uses-was a disservice to democracy and to the voter,&quot; said her attorney Mark Fernald.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Haddock regularly receives mail addressed to &quot;Granny D, Dublin, New Hampshire.&quot;  A Lexis-Nexis search lists over 900 citations of major newspaper and magazine articles describing her as Doris &quot;Granny D&quot; Haddock, and she has been officially honored as Granny D by dozens of major cities and several states, including New Hampshire, and by speeches on the floor of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This was clearly a political decision, not a legal one,&quot; said Dennis Burke, the campaign's political director. &quot;Granny D is not a deceptive name, nor is it electioneering,&quot; continued Burke. &quot;Her long walk across the country at the age of 90 for campaign finance reform was not partisan, nor was it in support of any candidate or elected official.&quot; He also noted that &quot;D&quot; stands for Doris, and not for a political cause.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Burke also rejected the notion that &quot;Granny&quot; is a term of endearment that will unfairly influence voters. &quot;This is silly. The law allows candidates to use the diminutive form of their names, such as &quot;Charlie&quot; for Charles. By definition, a diminutive is an affectionate form of address.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Republicans dismiss my candidacy and say I'm a long shot,&quot; said Haddock. &quot;If they're so sure that Mr. Gregg will win, then why did they try to keep the name Granny D off the ballot?&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Under RSA 655:14-b, candidates may designate their first, middle, and given names to be used on the ballot. Haddock has filed a request with the Secretary of State to place her new legal name on the November ballot. Primary ballots are currently being printed, according to the Secretary of State's office.</font></p><p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">###</font></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
