<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- December 30 -- A day after the conclusion of the flawed recount of Ohio's presidential vote, Green Party presidential candidate David Cobb called on Congress to challenge the legitimacy of Ohio's Electoral College delegation.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The recount of Ohio's presidential vote was conducted in clear violation of both the spirit and the letter of the law.  We can have no faith in the results when both the initial election and the recount were conducted in a haphazard and clearly illegitimate manner.  Ohio's presidential electors are tainted by unresolved allegations of voter suppression and the lack of a meaningful recount.  Congress must reject and challenge their votes,&quot; said Cobb.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One of the most significant problems with the recount was that few of Ohio's 88 counties randomly selected sample precincts for the recount as required by Ohio law.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The lack of random sampling calls into question the legitimacy of the recount.  A few counties did the recount properly and selected the precincts at random.  The vast majority of them, however, chose the precincts in advance without the official observers witnessing or participating in the selection.  That's like showing up at a poker game with strangers and finding that you've already been dealt your hand,&quot; said Blair Bobier, Cobb-LaMarche Media Director.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Other problems with the recount included a lack of security for the ballots and voting machines-including allegations of interference with voting machines by representatives of the Diebold and Triad corporations-and the refusal of some counties to do a full hand recount when required by law to do so.  Detailed reports from observers outlining a wide range of irregularities with the recount are available at &lt;<a href="http://www.votecobb.org/recount/ohio_reports/index.php" target="_new">http://www.votecobb.org/recount/ohio_reports/index.php</a>&gt;.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We have done our utmost to protect the integrity of our right to vote in court and through the recount process, yet a cloud of suspicion still hangs over the election results.  We cannot sit back and allow our rights to be violated.  It is time for Congress to defend the right to vote and the right to have all votes counted, and time for the people to engage in loud and peaceful protests,&quot; said Cobb.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cobb will be speaking at rallies in Columbus, Ohio and Washington, DC on January 3 and 6, respectively.  The Columbus rally is at 2 p.m. at the Capitol Theater, 77 S. High Street, and is sponsored by the Reverend Jesse Jackson, Rainbow/PUSH, the Cobb-LaMarche campaign and many other organizations.  The events in Washington<br>will be held on January 6, the day of the expected challenge to the presidential electors, and will begin with a rally at Lafayette Park, across from the White House, at 10 a.m., followed by a march to Upper Senate Park on Capitol Hill.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We urge everyone to contact their Senators and congressional representatives and ask them to reject Ohio's Electoral College votes,&quot; said Blair Bobier.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Contact information for members of Congress can  be found at &lt;<a href="http://vote-smart.org/" target="_new">http://vote-smart.org</a>&gt;.</i></font></p><p align="LEFT"><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Additional information about the recount and the Cobb-LaMarche campaign can be found at &lt;<a href="http://www.votecobb.org/" target="_new">http://www.votecobb.org</a>&gt;.
