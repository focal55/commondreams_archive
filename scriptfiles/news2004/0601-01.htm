<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">MEDFORD, OR - June 1 -  Local community activists joined Greenpeace today for the launch of its first U.S. Forest Rescue Station, at the site of the proposed Kelsey Whiskey timber sale, located in the Klamath-Siskiyou region of southern Oregon. The mobile Station, which is open to the public for workshops, hikes and other educational activities, is a hub for Greenpeace&#146;s campaign calling for greater protection and restoration of forests on U.S. public lands, and a moratorium on commercial logging.</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;Greenpeace has come to southern Oregon because this is a place of international significance,&#148; said Ginger Cassady, Greenpeace Forest Campaigner. &#147;Like the Amazon, forests like these on our public lands in the U.S. must be protected and restored.&#148;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The state of the art Forest Rescue Station runs on solar power, and features two 24-foot diameter domes and a series of smaller tents. Satellite communications systems enable visitors to create and post weblogs about their experiences at the site.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The massive Kelsey Whiskey timber sale, slated for auction this summer, is located within the Bureau of Land Management&#146;s Medford District. The area is representative of hundreds of proposed timber sales on public lands across the U.S. being advanced by federal agencies despite overwhelming public opposition. Even worse, the Bush administration has stepped up its attacks on civil liberties, limiting citizen participation in oversight of public lands. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;The Bush administration has betrayed the American people by rolling back 30 years of environmental laws and cutting the public out of decision making,&#148; Cassady said. &#147;It is time to put the &#145;public&#146; back into public lands, and hold the Bush administration accountable for failing to protect our endangered forests.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;The majority of Americans don&#146;t want our centuries-old forests put on the chopping block. With so little of our ancient forests left, why is the Bush administration spending billions of taxpayer dollars to destroy our public forest lands, instead of investing in high-skill, family-wage jobs that would benefit communities and restore the land?&#148;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Greenpeace plans to open Forest Rescue Stations in endangered forests on public lands across the country.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Below are profiles of and quotes from the speakers at the opening of Greenpeace&#146;s first Forest Rescue Station in the U.S., located in the Klamath-Siskiyou region of southern Oregon.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Ginger Cassady</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Ginger is a Forest Campaigner for Greenpeace. She has been an action coordinator, and served as a crewmember of the 2003 Greenpeace ship tour to Alaska. Ginger graduated from University of Colorado with a degree in Environmental Science, and served as the Colorado Delegate for the National Forest Protection Alliance and Director of the Wilderness Study Group in Boulder, CO. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">-- &#147;Logging in our forests is an economic failure, ripping off taxpayers to the tune of billions in lost revenue that could be gained from recreation. The Bush administration has been giving away the store, liquidating our forests so that a few big corporations can enjoy short-term profits. Greenpeace supports the local communities in calling for an end to this boom-and-bust economy, and a shift from forest destruction to forest restoration.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">-- &#147;Intact forests are essential for clean water&#151;water for drinking, for recreation and for salmon habitat. Protecting our public forests will help secure the municipal water supplies for some 80% of our towns and cities across the U.S.&#148;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Jay Lininger</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Jay is a Conservation Fellow at the University of Montana in Missoula, where he is a graduate student of forest ecology and fire science. He is a fourth-generation native of southwest Oregon. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">-- &#147;Fire is a vital process in local forests. All green forests were black sometime in their evolution. Fire influences habitat patterns and supports the incredible biological diversity of the Klamath-Siskiyou region.&#148;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">-- &#147;The Bush administration uses fire to justify logging projects that enrich its political campaign contributors, but leave forests and communities vulnerable to severe fires. Commercial logging that removes larger trees diminishes the resiliency of forests to fire, leaves behind flammable slash, and dries out the climate by increasing ground penetration of solar radiation and lateral wind movement. Fires in commercially logged forests tend to burn hotter and faster than in unlogged stands, putting firefighters and the environment at risk.&#148; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">-- &#147;I&#146;m an optimist. I envision a future where we create jobs restoring the land instead of destroying it.&#148;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Dot Fisher-Smith</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Dot is a 75-year-old community elder and activist. She moved to southern Oregon in 1970, and has lived in Ashland since 1981. She organized with War Resister's League from 1967-1970 to stop the Vietnam War, engaged in many anti-nuclear actions during the 1980s, and has been involved in environmental campaigns since the 1990&#146;s. She is an artist, counselor and group facilitator, and a long-time hiker and back-packer.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">-- &#147;I have lived, hiked, back-packed and camped in these mountains for 34 years, and watched too many forested hillsides become barren graveyards. I want there to be something left for my grandchildren and my great-grandchildren, and everyone else's too. I want them to know what an ancient forest looks like, with all the diversity of plant and animal life that such forests hold. Greenpeace's involvement makes it easier to put aside my everyday routines to join this campaign.&#148;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Ken Morrish</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Ken is a fourth-generation fly fisher who has guided throughout Alaska, Oregon, and California.

Ken is an accomplished writer and photographer whose work has appeared in Patagonia, Outside, Fly Fisherman, Fly Rod and Reel, Northwest Fly Fishing, Wild Steelhead and Salmon, and other popular publications. Ken serves as Fly Water&#146;s Chief Operating Officer, primary photographer, and catalog copywriter.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">-- &#147;Having fished in 12 states and 15 countries, I am all the more convinced that the rivers of southern Oregon are among the richest and most biologically significant systems on the planet. They are the life blood and defining feature of our region and attract anglers and nature lovers from across the nation. As home to some of healthiest wild salmon and steelhead stocks in North America, the success and future of these systems is tied directly to health of the forests that surround them. Now is a critical time for the American public to let their wishes be known. We must speak up on behalf our forests and our fisheries, as ultimately these will prove to be foundations of our future.&#148;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Bill Richardson</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Bill is Greenpeace&#146;s Campaigns Director, and a 16-year veteran of the organization.

He recently coordinated the creation of an environmentally friendly office, remodeled using green building techniques. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">-- &#147;Greenpeace has a 33-year history of protecting the environment through peaceful protest. And Americans have a tradition of standing up against injustice, from the Boston Tea Party to the civil rights movement and the antiwar movement. Greenpeace is proud to be part of a larger citizen movement to protect our public lands from the Bush administration&#146;s extreme policies and reckless mismanagement by the U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management.&#148;</FONT></P><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
