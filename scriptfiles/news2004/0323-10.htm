<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - March 23 - In an historic step for the indian rights movement, Brazil&#146;s first female, Indigenous lawyer will present her own people&#146;s case to the InterAmerican Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) in Washington, DC. </FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">On March 29 the 30-year-old Wapichana indian will petition this branch of the Organization of American States to intervene in a landmark battle for ancestral land known as Raposa Serra do Sol. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In a sign of the sophistication of the modern, indian warrior, Jo&ecirc;nia Batista de Carvalho will ask the IACHR to pressure Brazilian President Lu&iacute;z In&aacute;cio da Silva to keep a campaign promise to protect Indigenous rights.  After decades of harassment, assassinations, and endless court battles, the territory&#146;s 15 thousand Indigenous residents decided it was time to send Jo&ecirc;nia to Washington, instead of Brasilia, for results.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Jo&ecirc;nia is a recipient of this year&#146;s Reebok Human Rights Award for her ground-breaking work to advance her people&#146;s cause, which is part of a growing movement for ancestral land rights around the world. She will be available for interviews from March 26  March 31. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">BACKGROUND:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Raposa Serra do Sol territory is home to the Macuxi, Patamona, Ingaric&oacute;, Wapichana, and Taurepang peoples. It is also the heart of a landmark Indigenous struggle for land rights.  </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Since authorities in Roraima are close to the mining, ranching, and agricultural industries, the atmosphere is rabidly anti-Indigenous. As one human rights advocate testified, &#147;In Roraima, it&#146;s not a crime to kill an indian.&#148; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Between 1981 and 1999, 20 Indigenous people were killed; 54 received death threats; 21 were seriously assaulted; and 51 were physically assaulted. Eighty Indigenous homes were destroyed, and 71 people were illegally arrested. Last year, another Raposa Serra do Sol resident was found dead, shot execution-style in the back. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">As the sole lawyer for the communities&#146; association, the Indigenous Council of Roraima (CIR), Jo&ecirc;nia brings modern sophistication to the struggle for ancestral land. As a human rights hero, she is the real thing  an Indigenous lawyer and mother working at great risk and personal sacrifice. In 2002 alone, following a community workshop led by Jo&ecirc;nia, three participants were run off the road and killed.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">This January a human rights crisis erupted when vigilante mobs initiated a campaign of terror against the Indigenous residents of Raposa Serra do Sol. A well-organized rampage took three hostages, blocked all major highways, and threatened to shut down the airport in the capital of Boa Vista. The mobs were responding to a government announcement that the territory would be officially recognized  demarcated as indian land by the end of the month.     </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The demarcation never happened, but the human rights situation remains tense. After exhausting all recourse in Brazil, Jo&ecirc;nia is turning to the international community for help. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Rainforest Foundation US (RF-US) is co-filing the IACHR petition with CIR. Jo&ecirc;nia&#146;s work is fully supported by RF-US, a nonprofit organization based in NYC that has fought for Indigenous land rights in Latin America since 1989.
