<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - March 11 - The Senate is expected to vote today on an amendment to the Budget Bill that would reinstate the &quot;polluter pays&quot; fees to support the federal Superfund toxic waste cleanup program. The landmark program ran out of polluter-contributed funds last year, and the amendment cosponsored by Senators Jon Corzine (D-NJ), Barbara Boxer (D-CA) and Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ) would relieve taxpayers of the financial burden of cleaning up abandoned toxic waste sites. The Senate is also expected to consider a forest amendment to fully fund fuel reduction to levels originally promised by the Bush administration and an amendment to increase funding for clean water protections.</FONT></p>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The Bush administration has abandoned the landmark principle that corporate polluters should be held responsible for the toxic messes they leave behind. If the administration embraces this idea, we could more easily afford to protect Americans' health and safety,&quot; said Carl Pope, Sierra Club Executive Director. &quot;The Senate will have a chance to make this possible later today.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Earlier this week, the Environmental Protection Agency proposed to add 11 sites to the Superfund National Priority List (NPL), but this announcement loses its luster in light of the Bush administration's failures to support the Superfund program.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The Bush administration should demand that corporate polluters contribute to the Superfund -- something every President since Reagan has supported -- because it is a sound fiscal measure, would enhance revenues and help cut the skyrocketing deficit,&quot; said Pope. &quot;Taxpayers should be relieved of an unnecessary burden and the Bush administration should move forward to put the health and safety of families and communities ahead of corporate polluters.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Already, 1 in 4 Americans, including 10 million children, lives within 4 miles of a toxic waste site that is considered a Superfund cleanup priority.  Once a site is listed on the NPL, it takes on average 11 years before the cleanup is complete. Without the polluter-funded trust fund, sites are forced to compete with other Superfund site and the entire program competes with other federal environmental priorities. The rate of completed cleanups has fallen by 50 percent during the Bush administration compared to 1997-2000, and site listings have slowed down as well.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><b>Forests</b><BR>
  Senators Ron Wyden (D-OR) and Diane Feinstein (D-CA) are expected to offer an amendment to increase funding for fuel reduction and wildfire mitigation efforts.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">When President Bush signed wildfire legislation in December, the law authorized $760 million in funding for fuel reduction, but the administration's FY 2005 budget breaks that promise by only earmarking $475 million. This amendment would reinstate the original funding levels authorized in the flawed &quot;Healthy Forest Restoration Act.&quot; Sierra Club supports an increase in funding for real fuel reduction to protect homes and communities, but opposes the Bush administration's plan to increase commercial timber sales under the guise of fuel reduction.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The Bush administration is not prepared to back up their community protection rhetoric with resources,&quot; said Carl Pope, Sierra Club Executive Director. &quot;The budget is where the rubber meets the road, and the administration has failed to meet its obligation - and promise - to Westerners and all Americans. This money is needed for honest fuel reduction.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><b>Clean Water Protections</b><BR>
    Senators Paul Sarbanes (D-MD), James Jeffords (I-VT) and Mike Crapo (R-ID) are expected to offer an amendment to increase clean water funding. By Fiscal Year 2009, the budget would cut environmental and natural resource spending by 14 percent below current levels.  Three decades after enactment of the Clean Water Act, 40 percent of our nation's waters are still too polluted for fishing and swimming.  In addition, EPA has estimated that an additional $535 billion in water infrastructure funding will be needed over the next 20 years.  This amendment would provide a combined $5.2 billion for the Clean Water State Revolving Fund and Safe Drinking Water State Revolving Fund, enabling the federal government to help states maintain and improve water and wastewater infrastructure.</FONT></P>
