<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NEW YORK / TORONTO -  September 16  -  A coalition of American and Canadian environmental groups filed a formal complaint today with NAFTA's Commission for Environmental Cooperation (CEC) demanding an investigation into the dramatic increase in mercury contamination of U.S. and Canadian lakes and rivers. Waterkeeper Alliance and Canada's Sierra Legal Defence Fund, which represent the coalition, allege that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is failing to effectively enforce provisions of the U.S. Clean Water Act against coal-fired power plants, degrading water bodies and leading to widespread fish consumption restrictions. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;U.S. coal-fired power plants are using our waters as toxic waste dumps,&#148; said Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., President of Waterkeeper Alliance.  &#147;The Bush administration&#146;s refusal to enforce the Clean Water Act gives these companies an unfair advantage over their law-abiding competitors, our international trade partners under NAFTA.  We are asking this NAFTA Commission to take action to stop a corporate handout and to protect the health of children in the U.S. and Canada.&#148;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the past decade, the number of U.S. states issuing warnings against eating fish because of mercury poisoning jumped from 27 to 45. Over the same period, the number of mercury related &#145;Fish Consumption Advisories&#146; issued for particular waterbodies more than doubled (899 to 2,362). One third of all U.S. lakes and hundreds of thousands of river miles are affected by these advisories today. U.S. coal-fired power plants are the largest source of mercury emissions in North America, spewing 48 tons (43 tonnes) annually. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Rather than coddling polluters, the Bush administration should enforce the laws on the books and protect people from health-threatening mercury,&quot; added Carl Pope, Sierra Club's Executive Director.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Mercury, in massive amounts, goes up into the air from U.S. coal-fired power plants.  Gravity brings that mercury back down, much of it in our treasured lakes and streams,&#148; said Albert Koehl, a Staff Lawyer with Sierra Legal in Toronto. &#147;We don't expect U.S. EPA to interfere with the laws of gravity but we do expect them to enforce the laws that protect our shared water resources from contamination.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mercury released by power plants lands in lakes, rivers, and coastal waters where it is converted to methylmercury, the most toxic form. Mercury has been tied to neurological damage in children and may contribute to heart disease and autoimmune deficiencies in adults. Pregnant women and their fetuses are particularly vulnerable. The EPA has estimated that one in six women of childbearing age has mercury levels in her blood high enough to put her baby at risk. Mercury from hundreds of coal-fired plants in the U.S. has been linked to mercury contamination of U.S. and Canadian waters. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Public utilities are increasing their profits at the expense of world health,&#148; said Scott Edwards, Waterkeeper Alliance Legal Director.  &#147;The international health crisis caused by lax enforcement of mercury emissions is the very type of practice the CEC was created to address.&#148;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The CEC, an environmental watchdog agency created under NAFTA, has the responsibility of investigating and reporting on countries that fail to enforce their environmental laws. The CEC Secretariat, based in Montreal, must now determine if the U.S. will be asked to respond to the allegations and whether an international investigation is warranted.</font></p>
