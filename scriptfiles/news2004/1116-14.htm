<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NEW YORK, NY -- November 16 -- </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The international environmental group Greenpeace made an historic address to the United Nations General Assembly today and challenged the worlds governments to safeguard the future of the oceans.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On the 10th anniversary of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, Greenpeace, speaking on behalf of a coalition of environmentalists that represent tens of millions of people (1), was invited to address the General Assembly  the first time the environment group has been allowed to speak at such a session.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Environmentalists and scientists have been campaigning to ensure the anniversary was marked with one of the most significant steps to protect the rich life of the deep oceans  a moratorium on high seas bottom trawling.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">High seas bottom trawling literally ploughs up the ocean floor for relatively few fish and the fleets often target seamounts  the least explored mountains on the planet, that rise more than a 1,000 metres from the ocean floor. Seamounts are teeming with deep sea life, some of which is undiscovered by science and much is unique to individual seamounts.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, the world's governments ignored scientific advice and an international call from the Convention on Biological Diversity to the United Nations for urgent action and instead have call for a two year review of the problem.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greenpeace International policy advisor Karen Sack, who spoke at the United Nations General Assembly, condemned the resolution as falling far short of the comprehensive and immediate protection that is so sorely needed to protect deep sea biodiversity. It is time to stop calling for urgent consideration and actually take action.<br> </font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
