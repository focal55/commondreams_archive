<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - February 10 - Citing the fall in incomes, benefits, and living standards for millions of working Americans, Green Party leaders called for a drastic reordering of economic priorities.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The $2.4 trillion FY2005 budget plan released by President Bush on February 3 sacrifices domestic 'social safety net' programs and fiscal relief for states, for the sake of defense boondoggles and tax cuts for the wealthy and for corporations,&quot; said Marnie Glickman, Oregon Green and co-chair of the Green Party of the United States.  &quot;Especially affected are housing, job training, and educational programs for low-income people.  President Bush and his Democratic challengers for the White House drone on and on about their dedication to families and family values.  But in 2003, President Bush and Congress excluded low-income working families from the increased child tax credit benefits, while giving Americans who earn $1 million or more an average tax cut of $93,000.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Greens note that more than 30 million Americans, one in four workers, are stuck in low-wage jobs, especially drudge work with minimal chance for advancement, that do not provide for a decent standard of living.  Middle-income jobs are becoming like low-wage jobs, thanks to layoffs, outsourcing, unaffordable healthcare, and disappearing benefits and pensions.  Funding for jobs training has been cut, perhaps out of recognition of the lack of jobs creation resulting from Bush's economic policies.  Despite assurances of economic growth, the poverty rate continues to climb, especially for children, older Americans, African Americans and other ethnic groups, and people who dwell in urban and rural areas. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;While most people associate child poverty with inner-cities, the most extreme child poverty is in the frontier, the most isolated communities of rural America,&quot; said New Mexico Green Carol Miller.  &quot;All of the 50 counties with the greatest child poverty rates are frontier, sparsely populated rural areas.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Greens have called for several steps to reverse the nation's economic direction:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">-- Make the eradication of poverty a major national goal, equal to fighting terrorism, beginning with elimination of child poverty. &quot;There is no national policy to address child poverty in the U.S.,&quot; said Miller.  &quot;The difference in rates across the country illustrate the disparity. New Hampshire has the lowest rate of child poverty at about 4% while New Mexico and Mississippi compete for last place at 38%.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">-- Repeal President Bush's tax cuts for wealthiest Americans and tax breaks and loopholes for corporations, and establish a progressive system that ensures relief for people in lower income brackets.  Greens note that both Republicans and mainstream Democrats alike have now embraced Reagan's discredited 'trickle-down' economic theory.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">-- Guarantee living wages.  &quot;In New York State, the current minimum wage of $5.15 an hour, which falls far short of the goal of allowing full-time workers to achieve a modest standard of living,&quot; said Mark Dunlea of the Green Party of New York State.  &quot;The 700,000 New Yorkers receiving the minimum wage, three quarters of whom are adults, are often forced to make choices between rent, heat, health care and food for their families.  According to a Hunger Action Network study, 40% of the guests who use food pantries and soup kitchens in our state have a job.  If the state minimum wage had merely kept pace with inflation, it would be $8.83 an hour today.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">-- Ensure democratic workplaces and  strengthen the power of democratic unions, especially through repeal of the Taft-Hartley Act's restrictions on union organizing. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The unequaled prosperity of America in the late 20th century wasn't because of the generosity of corporations, it was because by the late 1940s about half the workforce belonged to unions that demanded good wages, benefits, vacation time, and pension plans,&quot; said Michele Tingling-Clemmons, chair of the national Black Green Caucus and former shop steward with the FRAC Employees Association, UAW Local 2320, National Organization of Legal Services Workers.  &quot;With only about 10% of working Americans claiming membership, unions today have less power, and the hierarchy of some of the larger unions seem to regard their partnerships with management more important than the needs of workers or of organizing them.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">-- Withdraw from international trade pacts and institutions that have favored corporate interests over the democratically enacted rights and protections for working people.  The Green Party has emerged as the electoral arm of the movement to globalize democracy and workers' rights.</FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
