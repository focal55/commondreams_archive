<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - March 26 - The Department of Health and Human Services announced its approval yesterday of 28 companies to provide seniors with Medicare drug discount cards. Individuals and political action committees affiliated with these &quot;private sponsors&quot; and their parent companies have contributed more than $2.5 million to candidates and committees so far in this election cycle. Roughly 71 percent of those contributions went to Republicans, with close to $275,000 going to President Bush's re-election campaign.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The new drug discount card sponsors--responsible for negotiating lower prices from drug manufacturers and setting up networks of pharmacies willing to accept the cards--could benefit substantially from the government's seal of approval. The drug discount card is only temporary; seniors will use another card in its place once the full Medicare benefit goes into effect in 2006. But being able to offer Medicare-approved discount cards now allows these companies to get a jumpstart on competitors in building brand loyalty and collecting medical information on seniors for future marketing purposes.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Some companies on the Health and Human Services list have ties to top Bush fund-raisers. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Card sponsor Blue Cross Blue Shield of Florida employs Michael Hightower--a Bush &quot;Ranger&quot; who already has raised at least $200,000 for the president's re-election campaign--as its vice president of government relations. The Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association and its related companies have given Bush $71,800 in individual and PAC contributions this cycle.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">UnitedHealth Group, whose United Health Insurance Co. subsidiary has been approved as a sponsor, is headed by William McGuire. As a Bush &quot;Pioneer,&quot; McGuire has raised at least $100,000 for Bush this election cycle. UnitedHealth Group's employees and political action committee have given Bush $77,000 this election cycle. WellPoint Health Networks alone already has given $321,400 in total contributions, $37,000 of it to Bush.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Other top contributors among the parent companies of Medicare-approved card providers include Aetna Inc., which has given a total of $263,900 in individual and PAC contributions this cycle, and First Health Group, with $175,200 in total contributions.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">This report is available online at: <A HREF="http://www.capitaleye.org/inside.asp?ID=124" TARGET="_new">www.capitaleye.org/inside.asp?ID=124</A></FONT></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
