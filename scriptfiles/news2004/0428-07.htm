<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - April 28 - The non-partisan Center for Responsive Politics is making it easier than ever to access the most up-to-date campaign finance figures for this year&#146;s presidential and congressional races.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Center is processing campaign finance data reported by presidential and congressional candidates to the Federal Election Commission earlier this month, and has been updating its award-winning Web site, OpenSecrets.org, with current money-in-politics figures and analysis.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Now you can be among the first to know when the Center has updated OpenSecrets.org with key information about this year's candidates and campaigns.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><A HREF="http://www.opensecrets.org/alerts/index.asp" TARGET="_new">Sign up now</A> to receive periodic e-mail notices after the Center has posted the following information:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Summary figures -- Total raised, total spent and cash on hand for each candidate. (These have already been updated with first quarter figures for the major presidential candidates and most congressional candidates.) </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Geographic breakdowns -- Top states, metro areas and Zip codes for contributions to a candidate. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Industry breakdowns -- Top sectors, industries and organizations giving to a candidate. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">To receive OpenSecrets Data Updates, enter your e-mail address on the <A HREF="http://www.opensecrets.org/alerts/index.asp" TARGET="_new">sign-up page</A> and check the box for data updates. If you are already on the Center&#146;s e-mail list, you do not need to enter any additional information.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Congressional candidates file quarterly reports, while presidential candidates file quarterly reports during off years and monthly reports during election years. Due to the time it takes the FEC and the Center to process the data, different sections of OpenSecrets.org are updated at different times.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Summary figures are updated within a day or two of the filing and for several days thereafter. Geographic breakdowns of contributions follow a week or two after the filing. Industry breakdowns, the most difficult figures to compute, are updated between three and five weeks after the filing.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Figures for all candidates are not necessarily updated at the same time. Although presidential and House candidates file their reports electronically, Senate candidates still file on paper, which often causes significant delays at the FEC. Candidates filing late reports can further slow the process of getting updated figures.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">OpenSecrets Data Updates will let you know that particular figures for a large number of candidates have been updated, and that updates for the remaining candidates are likely to follow soon thereafter.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">We encourage anyone who has a question about when the figures for a particular candidate or race will be updated to contact the Center at info@crp.org.</FONT></P><P></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
