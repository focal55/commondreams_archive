<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">PORTLAND, ME - May 18 -  IdealsWork Financial today announced that its financial services application, IWF Advisor, will add corporate governance data from The Corporate Library. IWF Advisor blends research on sustainability, risk, financial performance, and a wide array of corporate practices to screen and rate investments according to client guidelines or portfolio standards. In addition to The Corporate Library, IWF Advisor also uses databases from Morningstar and the Investor Responsibility Research Center. </FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Poor governance results in poor financial performance, and investors are rightly concerned with the impact of corporate malfeasance on their stock holdings,&quot; says Sam Pierce, CEO of IdealsWork Financial. &quot;We are pleased to include The Corporate Library's outstanding analysis in IWF Advisor as it will help investors avoid companies that don't match their financial or personal expectations.&quot; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Investor interest in corporate governance issues has risen significantly, in part due to high-profile news coverage of Enron and Tyco. According to a 2003 study conducted by Russell Reynolds Assoc., 71 percent of investors feel that corporate governance practices are a very important consideration when making investment decisions, a marked rise from its 2000 study's finding of 53 percent. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Corporate governance practices directly impact shareholder value, and it is crucial for all financial advisors to introduce this subject to their clients, and to inform them of the potential liabilities,&quot; says Karen Lowell, CEO, The Corporate Library. &quot;We are excited that IWF Advisor will make our data accessible to a broad and increasing base of financial advisors and their clients.&quot; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">IWF Advisor is a powerful financial services application that enables financial advisors to quickly identify the investments that best meet their clients&#146; financial performance and ethical standards. It is the first tool to evaluate both social and financial performance to help advisors create multidimensional, individualized investment portfolios for their clients. With IWF Advisor, individual advisors have access to information and analytic capability normally available only in the institutional investment realm. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><I>The Corporate Library is an independent investment research firm providing corporate governance data, analysis &amp; risk assessment tools.
