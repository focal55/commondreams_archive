<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - April 28 - Green Party leaders renewed the party's call for an independent commission, with full participation of surviving family members, to investigate the government's handling of 9/11 and information leading up to the attacks.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The members of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks in the U.S. have pervasive conflicts of interests which disqualify them from leading an investigation,&quot; said Jake Schneider, treasurer of the Green Party of the United States.  &quot;The White House did all it could to obstruct a thorough probe, and has so far succeeded.  President Bush insisted that commission members be limited to representatives of the two major parties, with each party having a veto, and that the commission could not investigate why 9/11 occurred.  The commission's focus was damage control, not discovery of the truth.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Greens noted that the 9/11 Commission established two major points: (1) the Bush Administration ignored numerous warnings from intelligence and foreign governments; (2) the Bush Administration used 9/11 as a pretext to enact existing plans for a war against Iraq and to curtail civil liberties in America. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">But Greens charge that numerous other points went uninvestigated: </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">-- The full extent of FBI and CIA surveillance and intelligence on the hijackers, some of whom (especially Mohammed Atta) had been closely monitored.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">-- Connections between the U.S., the Bush family, and Saudi Arabian officials; the Saudi ruling family's funding of terrorists (most of whom were Saudi Arabian); obstruction by the Clinton and Bush administrations of FBI investigations into Saudi ties to terrorism; connections between other U.S. allies and the hijackers, such as Pakistani Intelligence Service.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">-- The failure of FAA and NORAD to follow standard operating procedures in response to the 9/11 hijackings.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">-- The extent to which bad U.S. policy in the Middle East motivated (and continues to motivate) extremist groups like al-Qaeda, including mishandling of the Israel-Palestine crisis; attempts by the U.S. to control Middle Eastern oil resources (such as the proposed trans-Afghanistan pipeline); earlier U.S. assistance for the Mujahedeen in Afghanistan, and for tyrants such as Saddam Hussein. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Greens warn that all of these policies -- including the recent invasion and occupation of Iraq -- have fueled Middle Eastern rage against the U.S. and may motivate future attacks.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The question is whether the Bush Administration and Congress failed to prevent 9/11 out of gross incompetency or because they were looking for an excuse to go to war, seize control of Middle East oil, and implement their plan for a global American empire,&quot; said Mark Dunlea, a member of the Green Party of New York State and the author of a recent novel on 9/11.  &quot;The number of unanswered questions and the White House's secrecy and obstruction surrounding 9/11 demand a real investigation, not the current compromised inquiry.  We owe that to the family members and to all Americans.&quot;</FONT></P><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
