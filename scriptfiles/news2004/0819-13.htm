<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - August 19 - After Democrats shut him out of their convention in Boston last month, controversial presidential candidate Ralph Nader started seeking credentials to the Republican convention, which begins Aug. 30 in New York.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Should Nader be allowed access to Madison Square Garden along with other convention goers, he is likely to see some of his own campaign donors.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At least 51 donors to the Nader campaign have contributed to federal GOP candidates, their affiliated leadership political action committees and Republican party coffers, according to campaign finance filings for all of 2003 and the first half of this year. Of those donors, 29 have contributed to President Bush&#146;s re-election campaign. One has given to Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As a group, the 51 donors have given $54,300 to Nader and just over $415,000 to Republican candidates, parties and leadership PACs. They have contributed nearly $66,000 to Democrats. All but six of those donors have contributed more to Republicans than to Democrats during the current election cycle.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nader&#146;s fundraising total from donors who have contributed to Republicans represents only about 4 percent of the $1.5 million he has raised overall. Still, that&#146;s enough to infuriate Democrats who blame Nader for siphoning votes from Al Gore in 2000 and handing the election to George Bush. Nader took 2.7 percent of the popular vote four years ago.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Democrats fear that Nader could have the same effect this year, and they accuse Republicans of supporting him with campaign contributions and assistance in getting on the ballot in critical states.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Democrats&#146; ire is aimed at some of Bush&#146;s largest fundraisers. Massachusetts billionaire Richard Egan and his son, John, are each listed as &quot;Rangers&quot; on the Bush campaign Web site for having raised at least $200,000 for the president&#146;s re-election. Both gave the maximum $2,000 to Nader.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The elder Egan, who co-founded data storage giant EMC Corp. in 1979, is a former Bush ambassador to Ireland and is serving as the Massachusetts campaign finance chairman for Bush&#146;s re-election campaign.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">John Egan&#146;s wife, Pamela, also contributed $2,000 to Nader.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another of Egan&#146;s sons, Christopher, is listed as a Ranger on the Bush Web site. He produced a 28-minute documentary about Kerry&#146;s unsuccessful 1972 bid for Congress that premiered in Boston the same week as the Democratic convention.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nader campaign spokesman Kevin Zeese said the campaign is not accepting contributions from donors who are unsupportive of Nader&#146;s candidacy.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;I&#146;ve been looking to see what Egan&#146;s rationale is,&quot; Zeese said.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">None of the Egans returned phone messages.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jeno Paulucci, the Florida frozen pizza roll magnate, is another major Bush fundraiser who contributed $2,000 to Nader. Paulucci is a &quot;Pioneer&quot; who has raised more than $100,000 for the Bush campaign. Paulucci&#146;s wife, Lois, also contributed $2,000 to Nader. The couple has contributed more than $150,000 to Republicans since 2000.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Paulucci said he and Nader have been friends for many years and have worked together on several issues. He praised Nader for sticking up to Democrats and Republicans who have derided his campaign in recent months.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;I&#146;ve given to all the campaigns because I&#146;m an independent in my politics and always have been,&quot; Paulucci said. &quot;I don&#146;t like party politics. I don&#146;t believe in that.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Paulucci has contributed $2,500 to Democrats during the 2003-04 cycle, but not to the Kerry campaign.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Paulucci said he would vote for Bush in November. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Absolutely I will,&quot; Paulucci said. &quot;Why? Because I think that Bush is the better man.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RNC spokeswoman Heather Layman said she did not know why Republicans are giving to Nader.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;There is nothing that we are doing to encourage that,&quot; Layman said.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nader has said repeatedly that he will not drop out of the race, as several high-profile Democrats have encouraged him to do.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Not a chance,&quot; said Zeese, Nader&#146;s campaign spokesman. &quot;The Democrats have pissed us off so much. Democrats are wolves in sheep&#146;s clothing. The Republicans are just wolves.&quot; </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Zeese said some Republicans who have contributed to Nader are the candidate&#146;s former classmates and colleagues. Others are Muslim Americans who agree with Nader&#146;s views about ending the American occupation in Iraq but agree with Bush&#146;s conservative family values, he said.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, does not think Nader will be as big a factor as some Democrats predict. A Pew poll taken earlier this month gave Nader about 1&frac12; percent support among registered voters. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Nader&#146;s support levels have been going down,&quot; Kohut said. &quot;He&#146;s disappearing.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nader has fared better in other recent polls, with 3 to 5 percent support.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nader has through Election Day to collect private donations. He is not eligible for public funding during the general election because he failed to collect at least 5 percent of the vote in the 2000 election, said Federal Election Commission spokesman Bob Biersack.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Presidential candidates who accept general election public funding cannot raise or spend private contributions, according to campaign finance laws.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This report, with links to relevant pages on the Center's Web site, OpenSecrets.org, is available online at <a href="http://www.capitaleye.org/inside.asp?ID=136" target="_new">http://www.capitaleye.org/inside.asp?ID=136</a></font></p><p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">###</font></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
