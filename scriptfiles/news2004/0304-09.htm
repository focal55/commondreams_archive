<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - March 4 - Environmentalists called on Malaysia to ban all exports of ramin and seize all suspected stockpiles of logs, timber and products in peninsular and Borneo Malaysia following the Government of Malaysia's seizure of 1,636 metric tons of ramin in Johor port announced yesterday.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The non profit Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) and its Indonesian campaign partner Telapak, released detailed evidence collected during two years of investigations, in a new report &quot;Profiting from Plunder -- How Malaysia Smuggles Endangered Wood&quot; documenting how Malaysian citizens and companies smuggle large amounts of timber from the endangered trees illegally cut in Indonesian national parks that are home to endangered orangutans.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Last month leading US environmental groups wrote to Secretary of State Colin Powell to &quot;express serious concern at the substantial evidence that Malaysian nationals are actively engaging in trade that undermines international programs to protect endangered timber species from illegal logging and trade&quot; and stated they would seek trade sanctions against Malaysia unless significant new enforcement actions are taken to end Malaysia's trade in illegal ramin.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">EIA US President Allan Thornton said today that &quot;Cosmetic measures will not stop the vast illegal ramin trade by companies in peninsular Malaysia and Sarawak. Only a ban on ramin exports will begin to demonstrate that the Malaysia Government is serious about ending its massive illegal timber trade that undermines regional and international efforts to combat illegal logging.&quot; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Malaysia's Minister of Primary Industries has refused to end ramin exports &quot;on principle&quot; despite the admission by his most senior officials that ramin is a &quot;negligible&quot; part of Malaysia's timber exports valued at US$4.4 billion in 2003. The US is the largest consumer of Malaysian wooden furniture and with Japan is the largest importer of Malaysian plywood.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Editor's Notes</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">-- The Malaysian Timber Industry Board (MTIB) announced yesterday that it found 1,636 tons of the banned ramin sawn timber, believed to be of Indonesian origin, when it conducted checks on warehouses in the Free Trade Zone area of the Pasir Gudang Port in Johor on Feb 20. In a statement the Malaysian Timber Council said the inspection was based on evidence provided by non-government organizations, namely Washington-based Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) and Indonesia's Telapak.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">-- Malaysia could end Ramin trade by placing the Malaysian population of Ramin on Appendix III of CITES with a zero quota. This can be done by sending a letter to the CITES Secretariat, and would come into effect 90 days later.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">-- In September 2001 the Governments of the countries of East and South-East Asia met in Bali and issued a joint Ministerial Declaration on Forest Law Enforcement &amp; Governance (FLEG), which committed them to working together to stop illegal logging and trade in stolen wood. Malaysia has so far refused to join the FLEG process.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">-- Since 1999, EIA/Telapak have uncovered illegal logging of Ramin in protected areas across Indonesia, and have been campaigning for action by the Indonesian government and timber consumer countries</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">-- Ramin (Gonystylus spp.) is a tropical hardwood found in swamp areas or Borneo, Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia. Ramin is classified as a vulnerable tree species. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">-- Once processed Ramin can fetch $1,000 per cubic meter on the international market. It is used in picture frames, wood blinds, decorative moldings, pool cues and tool handles amongst other things. The main end markets are the USA, Europe and Japan.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">-- Indonesia's threatened National Parks provide a haven for a host of critically endangered species, including the orangutan, Sumatran tiger, Sumatran rhinoceros, clouded leopard and sun bear. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">-- EIA is an independent environmental non-profit group based in London and Washington DC.
