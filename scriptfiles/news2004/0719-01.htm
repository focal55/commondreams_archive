<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - July 19 - Sorrento, Italy. 19 July 2004-The future of whales appears to be more uncertain than ever as the 56th meeting of the International Whaling Commission, IWC, begins. The number of countries in favour of whaling at the IWC is steadily increasing, not because opponents of whaling world-wide have changed their minds, but because new members are being recruited with promises of financial aid. (1)</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Some of the poorest developing countries in the world are being used to vote in favour of whaling,&quot; said campaigner John Frizell, of Greenpeace International. &quot;This is a clear case of &quot;money talks&quot; and it's happening right in front of us. It is time we put a stop to this ongoing vote buying, before it is too late.&quot; (2)</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Cote d'Ivoire, Mauritania, Surinam and Tuvalu joined the IWC this year and are all expected to vote for a resumption of whaling. The reason for their interest is openly stated in the Japanese press.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Japan's IWC Commissioner explained it to the Japanese press last month by saying: &quot;We have been putting our efforts to appeal to every potential nation at all levels and at all possible venues.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The nature of these &quot;appeals&quot; is well documented: Japan's former vice minister of agriculture, forestry and fisheries, Hiraoki Kameya, said in June 1999 that it was &quot;essential to increase the number of nations supportive to Japan ... [and therefore] necessary to couple effectively the ODA (3) and the promotion of IWC membership.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Antigua's former Prime Minister Lester Bird was even more direct &quot;I make no bones about it ... if we are able to support the Japanese and the quid pro quo is that they are going to give us some assistance ... that is part of why we do so.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The balance at the IWC is so close now that issues may turn on a single vote&quot; said Frizell. &quot;It is appalling that a conservation measure supported by hundreds of millions of people around the world could be swept away by a well financed campaign of vote buying by a government representing the interests of an outdated industry.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Notes to editors:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">(1) The annual IWC meeting takes place from 19th-23rd of July in Sorrento, Italy. The IWC was established in 1946 in response to the over catching of whales and it agreed to a moratorium on commercial whaling in 1982 because of its continuing failure to manage whales without their populations declining.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">(2) The pro whaling lobby in the IWC is lead by Japan. Since the 1990s they have used a tactic of buying votes to gain a majority to overturn the ban on whaling.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">(3) ODA is Overseas Development Assistance</FONT></P><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
