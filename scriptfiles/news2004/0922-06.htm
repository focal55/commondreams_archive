<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - September 22 - Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG) stands with the gay and lesbian civil servants of the United States Government and demands that the Bush administration reinstate the policies that protect gays and lesbians from being fired or harassed on the job.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The same people who would discharge courageous American soldiers simply for being gay or lesbian are now giving themselves the authority to fire hard-working employees based on their sexual orientation,&quot; said Ron Schlittler, PFLAG's Executive Director. &quot;It is completely unfair in 2004 that the federal government, which should set the example to companies around the nation, would stoop to such disgusting tactics of discrimination. The Bush administration is endangering the careers and family livelihood of thousands of diligent workers for no other reason than pure prejudice.&quot;</font></p><p></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
