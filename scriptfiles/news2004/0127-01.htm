<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - January 27 - The Center for Public Integrity has expanded its Web-based, one-of-a-kind media ownership search to include network designations for television stations and information on the nation's largest newspapers.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The search can be accessed by going to the home page of &quot;Well Connected,&quot; the Center's telecommunications project, at <A HREF="http://www.openairwaves.org" TARGET="_new">http://www.openairwaves.org</A>. It can also be reached through the Center site, <A HREF="http://www.publicintegrity.org" TARGET="_new">http://www.publicintegrity.org</A>.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The improvements coincide with the second meeting of the Federal Communications Commission's Localism Task Force which will take place Wednesday, Jan. 28, in San Antonio, Texas.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The search was built using FCC data and supplemented by hundreds of hours of research by Center staff. Visitors to the site can simply plug in a zip code or city name and find the owner of every radio station, television station and cable television system in the area.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">As of today, each search will also identify 1,000 network affiliates. In addition to the big four networks -- CBS, ABC, NBC and FOX -- the search also identifies the two newest networks, WB and UPN. Finally, media profiles for all but the smallest markets identify the area's dominant newspaper and its owner. The Center database is limited to the largest 250 newspapers in the nation based on daily circulation.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The site is a valuable tool for average citizens who want to know who is controlling the flow of information in their area. Unlike proprietary databases directed at media owners, the Center's site is free of charge and designed to be used by everyone. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">By way of example, a search of San Antonio reveals the Hispanic market, which accounts for about 60 percent of the city according to U.S. Census data, is dominated by Univision Communications, Inc. The Los Angeles-based media giant owns six radio stations and four television stations in the San Antonio area.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Clear Channel Communications Inc., which is based in San Antonio, owns six radio stations as well as the NBC television affiliate in the city. Clear Channel also owns a small piece (about 4 percent) of Univision by virtue of Univision's controversial merger with Hispanic Broadcasting Corp. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Cox Enterprises Inc., the privately held, Atlanta-based media giant, owns seven radio stations in the city, but no television stations.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">San Antonio's cable television provider is Time Warner Inc. The largest newspaper is the San Antonio Express-News, which is owned by another major media conglomerate, the San Francisco- based Hearst Corp.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">On June 2, 2003, the FCC voted to loosen rules designed to prevent large media companies from owning too many broadcast properties in a single market. A federal court in Philadelphia has stayed that decision pending appeals.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">FCC Chairman Michael Powell announced the creation of the FCC Localism Task Force last August after a torrent of criticism by both the public and Congress regarding the June 2 decision to loosen ownership restrictions.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Localism&quot; is one of three major issues the FCC is required to consider when examining whether media ownership limits should be loosened. The other two are diversity and competition. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Univision's dominance of the Hispanic market extends well beyond San Antonio. Last September, the FCC approved Univision's $3.2 billion purchase of Hispanic Broadcasting Company. Opponents of the merger claimed it would give Univision too much control over the Hispanic broadcasting market by combining Univision's 32 full-power television stations with HBC's 62 radio stations.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The vote was 3-2 in favor of approval. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">While the Center's ownership Web site is useful, it is far from perfect. Much of the information relies on FCC data that is out of date or inaccurate. Ownership information regarding the largest broadcasters, however, has been verified by Center researchers, who continue to update and improve the site.</FONT></P><P></P><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
