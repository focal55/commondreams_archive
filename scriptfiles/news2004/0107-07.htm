- January 7 - Granite Staters for Medical Marijuana (GSMM) has issued its final report card on the presidential candidates' stands on medical marijuana. For the first time in any presidential campaign, a majority of contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination have said they would end the Drug Enforcement Administration's (DEA's) raids on medical marijuana patients and caregivers.</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">   Four candidates, though, received failing grades for refusing to end the raids: In addition to President George W. Bush, U.S. Rep. Richard Gephardt (D-MO), U.S. Sen. Joseph Lieberman (D-CT), and U.S. Sen. John Edwards (D-NC) earned failing grades.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">   The highest grade (an &quot;A+&quot;) went to U.S. Rep. Dennis Kucinich (D-OH), who said last May that he supports medical marijuana &quot;without reservation.&quot; Following close behind in the grading were former Ambassador Carol Moseley Braun (D-IL) -- receiving an &quot;A&quot; -- and U.S. Sen. John Kerry (D-MA) -- with an &quot;A-&quot; -- both of whom indicated support for federal medical marijuana legislation. On the next tier were retired Army Gen. Wesley Clark (D-AR) -- earning a &quot;B+&quot; -- and the Rev. Al Sharpton (D-NY)-- earning a &quot;B&quot; -- who also pledged to stop the raids.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">   Front-runner and former Governor Howard Dean (D-VT) received a &quot;D-.&quot; Dean, who opposed medical marijuana legislation as governor of Vermont, has said he would put a one-year moratorium on the raids while he asks the FDA to review the scientific data on medical marijuana, but he has left open the possibility that the raids would resume after a year.</FONT></P><P>   <FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;We've been educating the candidates for months, so these grades are final, but we are still hopeful that Dr. Dean will eventually see that arrest and jail is never healthy for people who are battling cancer, MS, or AIDS,&quot; said GSMM Campaign Coordinator Aaron Houston. &quot;From now until the day of the primary, we will be making an all-out effort to educate New Hampshire voters about where these candidates stand, and we've quintupled our staff for this final push.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">   The full GSMM voter guide is available at <A HREF="http://GraniteStaters.com" TARGET="_new">http://GraniteStaters.com</A></FONT></P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p></font><!-- #EndEditable -->
