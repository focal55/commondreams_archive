<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- December 13 -- In a blow to those who have urged medical marijuana advocates to seek FDA approval of marijuana as a prescription drug, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration has acted to block the only proposed research project that could lead to marijuana's FDA approval. In its letter to Lyle Craker, Ph.D., of the University of Massachusetts Amherst, the DEA appeared to slam the door completely shut on the FDA approval process.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">    Barring favorable action by the U.S. Supreme Court, the decision leaves medical marijuana patients with no hope for protection from arrest for the foreseeable future except through state and federal legislation, officials of the Washington, D.C.-based Marijuana Policy Project (MPP) said today.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">    On June 25, 2001, Dr. Craker, director of the university's Medicinal Plant Program, filed an application with the DEA for approval to establish a facility that would produce marijuana for FDA-approved research. Currently, all marijuana for research in the U.S. must come from a National Institute on Drug Abuse-contracted farm in Mississippi. NIDA's marijuana has been only inconsistently available to researchers and cannot be used for prescription sale. This makes FDA approval of marijuana effectively impossible unless an alternative source is made available, since testing would need to be done on the same product that is sold to patients.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">    The DEA's Dec. 10 letter to Dr. Craker said that approval of the application &quot;would not be consistent with the public interest.&quot; The letter then prejudged research that has not yet occurred, stating, &quot;Current marijuana research has not progressed to Phase 2 of the clinical trials because current research must use smoked marijuana, which ultimately cannot be the permitted delivery system for any potential marijuana medication due to the deleterious effects and the difficulty in monitoring the efficaciousness of smoked marijuana.&quot; The letter can be downloaded at http://www.mpp.org/pdf/DEA.pdf .</font></p><p align="LEFT">    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The DEA's statement is simply false,&quot; said Rick Doblin, Ph.D. of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS), which had planned to fund the UMass facility. &quot;Phase 2 trials of marijuana -- which look at both safety and efficacy -- are underway now at the University of California, as is a study of vaporizer technology, which allows use of inhaled marijuana without smoking. The DEA is saying that we can't ever go to the FDA with marijuana because it has to be smoked, and that is simply not true. It is appalling that the DEA claims further research on medical marijuana is not in the public interest.&quot; A MAPS study of vaporizer technology has <br>been stalled for 17 months by the federal government.</font></p><p align="LEFT">    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;I am disappointed that the DEA seems to have decided that marijuana cannot be a medicine before the research has even taken place,&quot; Dr. Craker said. &quot;We intend to appeal this decision and will keep trying to pursue vitally important research on medical uses of marijuana.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">    Dr. Craker and his colleagues plan to seek an appeal hearing as allowed by DEA procedures, but anticipate that this would be the start of a process that is likely to take years and -- based on past experience -- could conceivably take decades.</font></p><p align="LEFT">    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;In the Supreme Court two weeks ago, Justice Breyer told two California patients that they should go to the FDA to get marijuana approved as a medicine, but now the DEA has slammed the door on that process,&quot; said MPP Executive Director Rob Kampia. &quot;The DEA has proven that the system is rigged to make sure that marijuana will never be approved by the FDA, because the DEA can always block the research that the FDA needs. The DEA's decision means the only way to protect patients from arrest is through state and federal legislation, and this adds new urgency to our efforts in both Congress and the states. We expect legislators to move quickly once they understand that, for the foreseeable future, legislative action is the only way to keep cancer and AIDS patients out of jail.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">    <i>With more than 17,000 members and 150,000 e-mail subscribers nationwide, the Marijuana Policy Project is the largest marijuana policy reform organization in the United States.
