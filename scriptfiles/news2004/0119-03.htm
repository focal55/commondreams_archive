<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - Janaury 19 - &quot;The National Organization for Women is outraged by George W. Bush's installation of Charles Pickering on the federal appeals court while Congress is in recess,&quot; said NOW President Kim Gandy.  &quot;We're no longer surprised by the underhandedness of this President-Bush apparently thinks that he can act unilaterally wherever and whenever he pleases.&quot;</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;NOW has vigorously opposed Pickering's nomination to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals for more than two years, and the Senate Judiciary Committee rejected this foe of women's rights once before,&quot; said Gandy.  &quot;We will certainly work to ensure that this unmerited appointment is overturned when the next Congress takes office in January 2005.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Pickering, a district court judge from Mississippi, has a long record of opposing civil rights and civil liberties, demonstrating significant judicial activism from the bench. He was an opponent of the Equal Rights Amendment and has expressed his support for a constitutional amendment banning abortion. As a state senator, Pickering repeatedly voted against measures that would expand electoral opportunities for African Americans after passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Bush's total disregard for the Democratic members of Congress who rightfully blocked Pickering's nomination, his disregard for the women of this country and for democracy in general are appalling,&quot; said Gandy.  &quot;All the more reason for women's rights supporters to get active and to vote Bush out of office in November.&quot;</FONT></P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
