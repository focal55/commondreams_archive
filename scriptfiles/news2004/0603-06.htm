<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WASHINGTON - June 2 -On June 4, hundreds of medical marijuana patients, caregivers and supporters will protest at over 100 congressional district offices, urging support for an amendment to protect seriously ill patients obeying state medical marijuana laws from attacks by the federal Drug Enforcement Administration.</FONT></p><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">    The June 4 date was chosen because it marks the one-year anniversary of the sentencing of Ed Rosenthal -- convicted on federal marijuana cultivation charges by a jury that was barred from hearing that the marijuana was for patients and that his actions were authorized by the city of Oakland, California.  </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">    The protests, being coordinated by a coalition of organizations, will urge members of the U.S. House of Representatives to support the Hinchey-Rohrabacher amendment. This measure, to be introduced by Rep. Maurice Hinchey (D-NY) and Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA) during consideration of the Commerce-Justice-State appropriations bill, would prevent the U.S. Department of Justice from arresting, prosecuting and imprisoning medical marijuana patients and caregivers following state law. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">    The protests are aimed primarily at members who voted against the same amendment last year, when it received 152 votes on the House floor -- 66 votes short of the number needed for passage. Flyers to be handed out at the district offices will include the representative's name and explain that he or she &quot;thinks cancer, MS, and AIDS patients should be sent to federal prison&quot; for using medical marijuana.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">    With national polls showing 80 percent support for protecting medical marijuana patients, the actions will be a wake-up call to legislators. &quot;While this nationwide protest has been organized as a single day of action, it is designed to serve as a possible sign of things to come for these members of Congress,&quot; said Steve Fox, director of government relations for the Marijuana Policy Project in Washington, D.C. &quot;MPP -- which operates as a 501(c)(4) organization, but also has a well-funded 527 arm -- will decide later this year where to dedicate significant resources toward educating voters about their representatives' positions on medical marijuana.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">    A list of major local protests follows. To find out whether a protest is scheduled in your area, please call Aaron Houston at 202-462-5747, ext. 114.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">              With more than 15,000 members and 88,000 e-mail subscribers nationwide, the Marijuana Policy Project is the largest marijuana policy reform organization in the United States.
