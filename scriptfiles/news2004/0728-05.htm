<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - July 28 - Thousands of delegates and area residents today were forced out of a hotel across the bridge from the Democratic convention when about one hundred law enforcement officials couldn't contain the excitement around a progressive rally organized by the Campaign for America's Future. Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash., Los Angeles City Councilmember Antonio Villaraigosa and AFL-CIO President John Sweeney were barred from entering the building where thousands of progressives gathered to outline their alternative to right-wing policies that are not working in America.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Former Governor Howard Dean, D-Vt., filmmaker Michael Moore, former U.S. Secretary of Labor Robert Reich and Campaign for America's Future Co-director Robert Borosage were among the headliners at the event held at the Royal Sonesta Hotel in Cambridge. Event organizers created a second rally site on the hotel lawn to capture the energy of those who couldn't get in. Moore and Dean spoke on both stages.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Campaign for America's Future Communications Director Toby Chaudhuri noted that it is impossible to contain the increase in progressive activity now.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;There's a surge in progressive activity in America. The line of people to get into our event ran more than a mile long,&quot; said Chaudhuri. &quot;When the room started flowing into the halls, the marshals laid down the law and the hotel followed suit. There is more energy to take back America coming out of Boston this week than anyone ever expected.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Moveon.org's 2 million U.S. activists make it larger than the Christian Coalition at its peak. The ground forces of America Coming Together and America Votes are on the rise. There is a surge in progressive activity, seen in the massive turnout at the box office for Michael Moore's &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; and the in the number of best selling progressive titles.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Campaign for America's Future plans to hold a debate between former Senator Gary Hart, D-Colo., Amb. Joe Wilson, Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio, and The Nation editor Katrina vanden Heuvel at the same location tomorrow afternoon. Event organizers are looking into how to expand the size of the venue.</font></p><p></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
