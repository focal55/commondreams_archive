<p>BOGOTA, Colombia - A Colombian army unit blamed for a massacre denied killing the eight civilians, even as the United States called for a swift investigation Friday. The slayings raise doubts about the military's commitment to human rights and jeopardize part of Washington's huge military aid package to this embattled nation.

        <!--/endimage/-->The potentially explosive case is undergoing scrutiny days after the State Department reported human rights violations by the Colombian Armed Forces but said the situation has improved. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice will certify in the coming weeks whether Colombia's human rights record is good enough to warrant full military aid.
<P>
"I don't know how they can possibly certify right now, as long as doubts exist about this massacre," said Adam Isacson, a Colombia expert with the <a href="http://www.ciponline.org/" target="_new">Center for International Policy</a> in Washington. "Even within the Bush administration, there are people who take human rights very seriously."
<P>
If Rice decides that Colombia has fallen far short in human rights, about $35 million in U.S. military aid would be suspended. A similar amount would be at stake in a subsequent certification, but the bulk of aid does not have to go through the certification process.
<P>

The Bush administration said last month it was seeking $589.5 million in military aid in 2006 for Colombia, where a 40-year-old conflict pits government forces against the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, and a smaller leftist rebel group. Outlawed right-wing paramilitary forces have also been battling the rebels.
<P>
The United States is urging Colombia to investigate thoroughly whether its military was involved in the massacre, a State Department official said Friday.
<P>
"We have urged the government to ... swiftly bring to justice those responsible for this crime," the official said on condition of anonymity.
<P>
The Feb. 21 massacre in the Uraba district of northwest Colombia, a sweltering banana-growing region near the Panamanian border, was particularly brutal even by the standards of Colombia's long-running conflict.
<P>
The victims - residents of the "Peace Community of San Jose de Apartado," which tried to isolate itself from the war by barring armed groups - were hacked to death with machetes, chopped into pieces and buried on a farm, according to Amerigo Incalcaterra, a United Nations human rights official who visited the region. Among them were three young children and a 15-year-old girl.
<P>
A former mayor, a priest and a human rights lawyer have publicly accused army troops of committing the massacre. Prosecutors are investigating, although no charges have been filed.
<P>
Incalcaterra, in an interview late Thursday, said residents are terrified more bloodshed will occur. He also called for a full investigation by independent prosecutors from Bogota, the capital, saying the killers must be tried, "no matter who they are."
<P>
The Colombian Army's 17th Brigade denied it was responsible and said the FARC appeared to have carried out the massacre.
<P>
But a cleric who has been close with residents of the peace community said they believe soldiers, suspecting that the guerrillas have infiltrated the community, carried out the massacre in retaliation for a rebel ambush last month that killed 19 members of the 17th Brigade. The cleric did not want to be identified by name for security reasons.

<P>
Even before the massacre, the United States had doubts about the Colombian Armed Forces' respect for human rights. In its annual report released this week, the State Department cited several rights violations in 2004 but added that "respect for human rights improved in some areas."
<P>
Among the cases cited:
<P>
 <ul>
  <li>On Aug. 5, soldiers from the army's 18th Brigade - which has been trained by U.S. Special Forces in counterinsurgency tactics - killed three trade union members in eastern Colombia's Arauca state. The Colombian soldiers were ordered arrested at least until the investigation is complete.<br>
  </li>
  <li>On Aug. 28, some leftist legislators denounced an alleged plot to assassinate leftist politicians and labor leaders. The plot, known as "Operation Dragon," allegedly involved members of the military. An investigation by the attorney general's office is ongoing. </li>
