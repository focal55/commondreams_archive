<p> LONDON  - British politicians of all shades have
united since London's bomb attacks but some are beginning to
break ranks, wondering whether Tony Blair's backing for war in
Iraq may have been a factor. In the immediate aftermath of the
attacks on London's transport network, which killed at least
52, only mavericks like firebrand George Galloway dared
criticize the prime minister.</p>
<p> Galloway, thrown out of Blair's Labour party only to win a
parliamentary seat as an independent, said the invasion of Iraq
and "occupation" of Afghanistan had fed hatred and bitterness
throughout the world's Islamic communities.</p>
<p> Blair was widely regarded to have acted swiftly and struck
the right tone after the attacks, receiving plaudits from world
leaders and political friends and foes at home.</p>
<p> But now Charles Kennedy, head of Britain's Liberal
Democrats who always opposed the Iraq war, has explored the
same theme.</p>
<p> "I am not here implying some causal link between Britain's
involvement in Iraq and the terrible terrorist attacks in
London last week," he said by way of qualification in a speech.</p>
<p> But he went on: "Those like President Bush and Tony Blair,
who have sought to link Iraq with the so-called 'war on terror'
can hardly be surprised when members of the public draw the
same link when acts of terrorism occur here in the United
Kingdom."</p>
<p> Blair's office reacted sharply.</p>
<p> "This kind of terrorism was active long before the Iraq
war," Blair's spokesman said. "9/11 was in September 2001, not
2003."</p>
<p> The prime minister told parliament on Wednesday he would
issue a list of terrorist attacks around the world since 1993.</p>
<p> "People are able to see this is a process that now
stretches back many years. It encompasses many, many different
countries," he said.</p>
<p> Last year's Madrid train bombs however were almost
certainly because of Spanish troops based in Iraq.</p>
<p> "I would not be at all surprised in those young men's heads
... if part of the rationale behind what they were doing was to
inflict punishment killings for British support of U.S.
policy," said Dr Shane Brighton at the Royal United Services
Institute.

</p>
<p> NO BLAME FOR BLAIR</p>
<p> So far, opinion polls show few blame Blair's foreign policy
ventures for the attacks on home soil, now revealed to have
been carried out by British citizens.</p>
<p> His parliamentary majority was slashed in May elections
largely because of disaffection with the war in Iraq but polls
showed while the public may distrust him, they overwhelmingly
want him as their leader in times of crisis.</p>
<p> Crucially for Blair, London's high profile mayor Ken
Livingstone -- a fervent opponent of the Iraq war -- has blamed
no one but the bombers for last Thursday's attacks.</p>
<p> Nonetheless, the consensus forged by the bombs will not
last for ever.</p>
<p> A handful of Labour members have already said London was
hit because of Britain's staunch support for the United States.</p>
<p> And Blair's Conservative opponents have called for an
inquiry into the attacks, although on the broader point they
are hamstrung by their support for the invasion of Iraq.</p>
<p> "When it is symbolically and politically safe to do,
troublesome questions will surface ... about the reasons for
the increased threat posed by terrorists," said Steve Richards
of the Independent newspaper, a seasoned Blair-watcher.</p>
