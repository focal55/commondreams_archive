<p>Here comes a valiant attempt not to dumb down the message, because, in all fairness, Katrina vanden Heuvel, the sylph-like editor promoted this week to publisher of The Nation, liberalism's unglossy best friend among magazines since 1865, would not be caught dead dumbing down hers. Not even when she takes it to enemy territory: mainstream television chat shows where her debate-mate might be, as occurred recently on a Larry King free-for-all, someone as toxic to her cause as the &#252;ber-Conservative mouthpiece Ann Coulter.

"I never dumb it down," says the velvet-voiced Ms. vanden Heuvel, at 46 still very much on message and at 105 pounds still possessed of the pencil-esque proportions and ethereal gumption needed to pull off a two-toned sartorial manifesto in brown leather and black suede: second-skin jacket, micro-miniskirt, knee-high boots. Remove the boots, add pumps, and it's the same getup this sworn enemy of Rush Limbaugh (he calls the storm that desecrated New Orleans "Hurricane Katrina vanden Heuvel") wears on the cover of her new book, "<i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/156025789X/commondreams-20/ref=nosim" target="_new">Dictionary of Republicanisms</a></i>." Hint: call it an irreverent reference book.
<p>"The Nation exists to counter the degradation of political discourse," she adds, tucking herself onto a black sofa in her office east of Union Square, a space with a heavy emphasis on George W. Bush-themed knickknacks: the president rendered in wood as a nesting doll; the president as Alfred E. Neuman on a 2000 Nation cover just named to the top 50 magazine covers of the last 40 years; the president as a window ornament doll, with flames bursting from the seat of his liar-liar-pants-on-fire jeans.</p>
<p>"It's an ugly doll," she says. For partisan balance, there is a talking Bill Clinton puppet her husband and daughter gave her as a gag gift; Ms. vanden Heuvel accuses Mr. Clinton of "downsizing the ambition of the Democratic Party and trying to compete with Jimmy Carter to be best ex-president." She's for Mr. Carter.</p>

<p> "This place has a core integrity," she says of The Nation, which she joined as an intern in 1980 after graduating from Princeton and spending two years at ABC, "and a core purpose to be a dissenting voice, not relentlessly oppositional, about the democracy we feel is imperiled. But there's room for other entry points into understanding the politics and the culture we live in." </p>
<p>Hence what she calls her "double life," where after-hours commitments offer the oil-and-water juxtaposition of events like sitting next to Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., at a sober discussion of "The Future of Liberalism" at the Century House followed by her chance to tangle with the talking heads on Larry King on Tom DeLay indictment day. Besides, as a granddaughter of Jules C. Stein, founder of MCA, the entertainment conglomerate, she seems intrigued rather than repulsed by television and the mega-access it grants the message of her magazine (circulation 187,000) to the nation's living rooms.</p>
<p>Sure, some of the more retro guardians of liberalism criticize her for taking her talking points to television: "Toxicity by association," Ms. vanden Heuvel explains. Imagine how they'd react if they knew she watches "American Idol" as well as "Curb Your Enthusiasm" and is a minor authority on celebrity glossies: "Us magazine makes People read like The American Scholar," she observes. No crime being in touch with the popular culture. </p>
<p>"The politics of culture, and the intersection of politics and culture, is something I'd like to do more of at this place," says Ms. vanden Heuvel, who championed The Nation's switch from type-based to picture-based covers in 1995, the year she became editor in chief and a part-owner of the magazine after joining a group of investors, including E. L. Doctorow and Paul Newman, mobilized by Victor Navasky, her predecessor as publisher. "I think there's a politics to everything." </p>
<p>IT would be a no-brainer not to deduce that the repackaging of liberals into progressives, a less fuzzy, fusty, more evolved species, is embodied in the seamless line of succession here from the snowy-bearded Mr. Navasky to the poised prot&#233;g&#233;e he hired 25 years ago.</p>
<p>"To be at The Nation was kind of a second education for me," says Ms. vanden Heuvel, whose other magazine experience derived from a 1978 internship at the National Lampoon. "Victor has a sense of humor," she says of her mentor. "Mine is a work in progress." Her political agenda - she is an "alternativist" - is not: "We're not a movement, we're a magazine. We're not a party; we're a magazine. Liberal politics that blames other people as its starting point is dead on arrival."</p>

<p>Ms. vanden Heuvel grew up on the Upper West Side, was raised on politics, and thrived on it. Her mother, Jean Stein, an author, and her father, William J. vanden Heuvel, a deputy permanent representative to the United Nations and a special assistant to Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, divorced when she was 10. Both parents wrote books on Mr. Kennedy. Her father was "a Kennedy liberal who lived and breathed politics." Ms. vanden Heuvel and her father confer daily. In 1988 Ms. vanden Heuvel married Stephen F. Cohen, a professor of Russian at New York University 20 years her senior, and became an instant grandmother of four. Interesting. She and Mr. Cohen, who both wrote "<i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0393307352/commondreams-20/ref=nosim" target="_new">Voices of Glasnost: Interviews With Gorbachev's Reformers</a></i>" in 1989, have a teenage daughter and are spending Thanksgiving in Moscow. The Nation is mature enough to soldier through a week without her. </p>
