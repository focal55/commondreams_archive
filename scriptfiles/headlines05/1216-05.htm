strike against Iran's nuclear program for now, despite fears in
the Jewish state that Iran is getting closer to building an
atom bomb, a poll showed on Friday.</p>
<p>Israel and the United States accuse Iran of trying to
produce nuclear weapons, but Tehran denies this. Recent
comments by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad that Israel
should be removed from the Middle East have added to regional
tension.</p>
<p>A survey in the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth said 58 percent
of the 510 Israelis polled believed the dispute over Iran's
atomic program should be handled diplomatically, while 36
percent said its reactor should be destroyed in a military
strike.</p>
<p>Israel says Tehran will by March have the know-how to make
a nuclear bomb and may be able to produce one within three
years. Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has said global pressure to
halt Iran's nuclear program should continue.</p>
<p>Israel denied a report in Britain's Sunday Times last week
that it was planning a strike against Iran's nuclear reactor in
March, saying it preferred to let foreign diplomatic pressure
on Tehran run its course.</p>
<p>But a senior Israeli official said future military action
against Iran's nuclear program was not being ruled out. Israel,
which is thought to possess the Middle East's only atomic
arsenal, bombed a nuclear reactor in Iraq in 1981.</p>
<p>Asked how Iran would respond to an Israeli military attack,
Iranian Defense Minister Mohammad Najjar said: "Iran's response
will be swift, strong and devastating," the official IRNA news
agency reported on Friday.
