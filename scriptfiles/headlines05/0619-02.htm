<p>TIBURON, Calif. -- For an hour every Friday, small bands of antiwar demonstrators have been converging along this San Francisco suburb's busiest roadway, exercising their First Amendment rights of assembly and free expression.</p>
<p>But about a month ago, local police began cracking down -- not on the sidewalk protests, but on the motorists who, the authorities say, have shattered the peace by honking their horns.</p>
<p>They have cited a handful of motorists for ''unlawful use of the horn," and pulled over an untold number of others to issue warnings.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the demonstrators had something new to protest. They called the American Civil Liberties Union in San Francisco, which said it had not heard of any similar antihonking crackdowns anywhere else in the country.</p>
<p>''This is ridiculous," said Mel Fiske, a corporal in the Marines during World War II, who takes part in the weekly demonstrations. ''I think it's an atrocity. I know they have better things to do with their time."</p>
<p>Police say they were acting on complaints from neighbors, and it was not the intent of the department to quash anyone's constitutional rights.</p>
<p>State law seems to be on the side of complaining neighbors. Section 27001 of the California Vehicle Code authorizes ''The driver of a motor vehicle when reasonably necessary to insure safe operation shall give audible warning with his horn."</p>
<p>Otherwise, the law prohibits the use of horns for any other reason, except as part of antitheft alarm systems.</p>
<p>''When the department gets a complaint, we have to investigate it and that is what officers did," Captain Dave Hutton told the Marin Independent Journal, the local newspaper.</p>

<p>Of course, protesters see it differently and say it is part of a move to suppress antiwar sentiments in this enclave of relative conservatism in Marin County, which is better known for its new age ways and progressive leanings.</p>
<p>Unlike the rest of Marin County, where conservatives are outnumbered 3-to-1, the split in Tiburon between the number of Republicans and Democrats is considerably smaller. In the neighboring town of Belvedere, an outcropping of swanky bay-front homes, Republicans actually outnumber Democrats.</p>
<p>That is precisely why the protesters, mostly retirees, chose their particular spot at Tiburon Boulevard and San Rafael Avenue, a busy two-lane road along the north shore of San Francisco Bay, to hold their protests.</p>
<p>''It's a common road to both communities," said William Rothman, a retired physician well known in town for his activism.</p>
<p>''Tooting a horn is political free expression," said Rothman, whose signs tally the dead in Iraq and invite President Bush to send his daughters to the combat zone. ''None of our signs ask people to honk."</p>
<p>Instead, the signs should specifically direct people to refrain from honking, said Phyllis Ware, who lives across the street from the protesters.</p>
<p>''I don't think we need to listen to all this noise," Ware said. She has complained about the noise to authorities. She has also written letters to the local paper to voice her concerns.</p>
<p>''I hate to make a fuss about it, but it's been going on for two years," said Ware, adding that she, too, opposes the war in Iraq.</p>
<p>Fred Mantegani, a former postmaster, also lives across the street from the demonstrations.</p>

<p>''This is supposed to be a quiet community," but on Fridays it has been anything but that, he said.</p>
<p>On this most recent Friday, the demonstrators were again toting their signs out along the boulevard, but the police were nowhere to be found, perhaps embarrassed by the recent attention, Rothman said, that risks portraying Tiburon as a ''toot trap."</p>
<p>There were honks every few seconds. Hands waved. Thumbs went up, although some pointed down, and other fingers relayed clear disdain.</p>
<p>''It's their right," said Rothman.</p>
<p>One woman slowed to say she had been one of those recently ticketed. ''We can call the ACLU," Rothman yelled back, as she feigned to honk her horn and drove away.</p>
<p>Clare Schreiner, another demonstrator, does not understand the fuss neighbors and police are making. ''It's a busy street, it's not a quiet place out in the country. There are cars, there are all kinds of traffic. They hear traffic all the time. They should be able to tolerate one hour of honking."</p>
<p>Thankfully, the demonstrations now only occur once a week, said resident Debbie Poole.</p>
<p>''They used to be out every Wednesday, too. It's been two years, so at this point, I can tune it out." Still, she said, ''I wish they would just move to another place, and let other people enjoy the noise."</p>
