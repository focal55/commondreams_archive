The rift between nuclear and non-nuclear states, and between the US and Iran in particular, is so serious that a final agenda had still not been agreed on the eve of the month-long conference in New York, despite frantic shuttle diplomacy by its Brazilian chairman, Sergio de Queiroz Duarte.

<P>"If we could get out of this conference without a major blow-up we would be doing well," said Matt Martin, a deputy director of the British American Security Information Council, a transatlantic thinktank.

<P>Both sides agree the NPT is outdated, but they differ sharply on how it could be strengthened. The US, with support from Britain and France, wants stricter controls on the transfer of nuclear technology.

<P>The non-nuclear states, which met separately in Mexico City last week to agree a common position, argue more emphasis should be put on banning the development of new weapons by the existing nuclear powers.

<P>And there is disagreement on the NPT's third pillar: the clauses guaranteeing non-nuclear states access to "peaceful" nuclear power technology if they forgo nuclear arsenals.

<P>"The politics of the conference make it clear the treaty cannot continue and cannot be strengthened unless all three legs of the bargain can be preserved," said Daryl Kimball, head of the independent Arms Control Association.

<P>Iran believes the NPT's nuclear power clauses give it the right to enrich its own uranium or produce plutonium as long as it is - as Tehran insists - intended for peaceful use.

<P>The US says Iran is abusing its rights by using the NPT as a cover to go to the brink of weapons production with the intention of withdrawing abruptly from the treaty at a time of its choosing and assembling weapons within weeks. Such a strategy has already been pursued by North Korea.

<P>The US will also claim Tehran has forfeited any rights it might have as an NPT signatory by misleading the International Atomic Energy Agency over the extent of its uranium enrichment programme.

<P>Britain, France and Germany, which have been pursuing talks aimed at providing Iran with incentives to give up its uranium enrichment programme, are concerned the NPT conference will turn into a shouting match between the US and Iran and destabilise their precarious negotiations. Tehran said on Friday the talks had made so little progress, it might end its temporary uranium enrichment suspension.

<P>In an effort to find a compromise, the head of the IAEA, Mohamed ElBaradei, has proposed a deal in which states forswearing uranium enrichment and plutonium reprocessing programmes would be supplied fissile material for civilian reactors by the current members of the nuclear club.

<P>But the compromise looks dead on arrival. The one thing the US and Iran agree on is that it would disrupt their nuclear power industries, and they have the support of Japan and France.

<P>At their Mexico City meeting, delegates complained that the IAEA spent its time monitoring compliance by the non-nuclear states, while the nuclear powers had failed to live up to the commitments they made the last two NPT reviews, in 1995 and 2000.

<P>The Bush administration has been trying for two years to persuade Congress to fund research on a new generation of weapons, including small-yield "mini-nukes" and nuclear "bunker-busters". Britain too has raised the possibility of replacing its Trident missiles.

<P>The US signed a bilateral arms control treaty with Russia in 2002, aimed at sharply reducing the number of operationally deployed warheads by 2012. But the weapons do not have to be destroyed, only mothballed, and there are no verification procedures.

<P>The Bush administration has also signalled it has no intention of joining the comprehensive test ban treaty, or signing a verifiable accord ending the production of new fissile material intended for nuclear weapons. Both were pledges it made in 2000.

<P>"If one state begins to reject commitments it made at past review conferences, other states may start to reject prior commitments. The non-proliferation treaty will quickly erode," Mr Kimball said.

<P>"If the states do not take serious action on a number of key fronts in the next five years, it is likely the treaty will not be able to withstand these challenges and we will see additional states withdraw from the NPT. The crisis is not quite here but it's fast approaching."

<P><b>Objectives of the pact
</b>
<P>· The Treaty on the non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons came into force in 1970. Its objectives are to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, to promote cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and to further the goal of achieving nuclear disarmament.

<P><ul><li>A total of 187 countries, including the five declared nuclear-weapon states - the US, Russia, Britain, France and China - have joined.

<br></li><li>Israel, India and Pakistan remain outside the treaty.

<br></li><li> North Korea joined the treaty in 1985, but in January 2003 announced its intention to withdraw.

<br></li><li>The operation of the treaty is reviewed every five years.
