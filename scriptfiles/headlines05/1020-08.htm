        </table></font>Rory Carroll, 33, who was covering the trial of Saddam Hussein for The Guardian, was taken at gunpoint in the Iraqi capital yesterday.

<p>The newspaper said today he had been conducting an interview in the city with a victim of Saddam's regime when gunmen confronted him.

<p>Mr Carroll, who was accompanied by two drivers and a translator, was confronted by the gunmen as he left the house where he carried out the interview.

<p>He and one of the drivers were bundled into cars but the driver was released about 20 minutes later.

<p>Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger said: “We’re deeply concerned at Rory’s disappearance. He is in Iraq as a professional journalist – and he’s a very good, straight journalist whose only concern is to report fairly and truthfully about the country.

<p>“We urge those holding him to release him swiftly – for the sake of his family and for the sake of anyone who believes the world needs to be kept fully informed about events in Iraq today.”

<p>Dublin-born Mr Carroll is the son of former Irish Times North American correspondent Joe Carroll, 70, and has been in Baghdad since January.

<p>The Guardian said he volunteered for the job and his coverage had been critical of the coalition.

<p>It said Mr Carroll had asked the Baghdad office of the Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, to suggest a victim of the former regime for interview. The office had fixed up the interview, and Mr Carroll had stayed at the house for three hours. Several visitors had arrived while he was there.

<p>Mr Carroll’s father said his son had played down the dangers of working in Iraq, adding: “We hope and pray he will be released.”

<p>A Foreign Office spokesman said it was trying to find out more information, adding: “We would ask those involved to release him unharmed.”

<p>Militants in Iraq have so far kidnapped more than 220 foreigners and killed nearly 40.

<p>The last reported abduction of a foreigner was more than a month ago – on September 12 a video of a Lebanese contractor was posted on the internet.

<p>Mr Carroll’s disappearance came as the former Iraqi tyrant appeared in the dock with seven senior members of his regime to face charges over the 1982 massacre of about 150 Shiites in the town of Dujail, north of Baghdad.

<p>As Saddam went on trial many expressed hope that it will be a watershed leading to a stabilising of the security situation in Iraq.

<p>But as he sat behind bullet proof glass in a white metal cage the former tyrant remained defiant.

<p>Saddam was in combative mood and immediately challenged the legitimacy of the court and pleaded innocent to all charges including premeditated murder and torture.

<p>In a stormy three-hour session the 68-year-old argued with judges, refused to confirm his name and insisted he was still president of Iraq.

<p>At one stage, when a break was called, he was involved in a shoving and shouting match with guards as he left the courtroom.

<p>Kurdish presiding judge Rizgar Mohammed Amin read the charges against Saddam and his co-defendants, advising them they face possible execution if convicted.

<p>The judge later adjourned the session until November 28.
