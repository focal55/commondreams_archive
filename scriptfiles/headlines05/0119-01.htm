PARIS  - The rest of the world will be watching  with anxiety when President Bush is inaugurated Thursday for a  second time, fearing the most powerful man on the planet may do  more harm than good.<p> 
			
			Many world leaders, alienated by Bush's go-it-alone foreign  policy and the U.S.-led war in Iraq, would have preferred him  to lose the U.S. election last November. Since his victory,  they have been urging him to listen and consult more.<p>

Mistrust also runs deep among ordinary people. Some 58  percent of people surveyed in a British Broadcasting  Corporation poll in 21 countries said they believed Bush's  re-election made the world a more dangerous place.<p> 
			
			"Negative feelings about Bush are high," Steven Kull,  director of the Program on International Policy Attitudes which  carried out the study, told the BBC. "This is quite a grim  picture for the United States."<p> 
			
			People in three countries surveyed -- Poland, India and the  Philippines -- said the world was now safer, while Israel,  which was not part of the survey, also remains a big supporter  of the 58-year-old president who took office four years ago.<p> 
			
			From Asia to Europe, leaders are looking for signs that  Bush will take a more "multilateral" approach on the challenges  that lie ahead in Iraq, the Middle East, Iran and North Korea,  and on issues such as trade, the U.S. dollar and the  environment.<p> 
			
			"I think 2005 should mark a new start in our relations ...  based on listening to each other, having a more regular  dialogue and mutual respect," French Foreign Minister Michel  Barnier said last week, reflecting the view of the European  Union.<p> 
			
			There are some encouraging signs. Bush and the European  leaders who fell out with him over the Iraq war have signaled  they are ready to bury their differences.<p> 
			
			In a sign he wants to improve ties with Europe, Bush will  visit Brussels next month and will soon meet two of his war  critics separately -- German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder in  Mainz and French President Jacques Chirac in Washington.<p> 
			
			NEED TO WORK TOGETHER<p> 
			
			"It is clear that this is an administration that believes  in force and strength and is not particularly bothered by what  other countries may think," said Guillaume Parmentier of the  French Institute of International Relations in Paris.<p> 
			
			But he said Bush's team had realized that it was harder to  act without the backing of allies, and the EU understood it had  no option but to work with the world's only superpower.<p> 
			
			"There's a sober realism on both sides of the Atlantic,"  said Charles Grant of the Center for European Reform in London.<p> 
			
			Secretary of State-designate Condoleezza Rice's vow that  "the time for diplomacy is now" will go down well at the  Brussels-based, 25-nation EU.<p> 
			
			What is less certain is that words will be converted into  deeds and that a genuine reconciliation will follow.<p> 
			
			Washington and Brussels have averted a legal clash over the  world's top two plane makers, Boeing and Airbus, but other  trade disputes remain.<p> 
			
			Bush shows no sign of wishing to strengthen the dollar  despite the EU's complaints that its exports will suffer, or to  answer calls to sign the Kyoto protocol to cut greenhouse  gases.<p> 
			
			Differences may linger over Iraq and key tests lie ahead on  Iran and forging peace between Israel and the Palestinians.<p> 
			
			Washington takes a tougher line than the EU in efforts to  ensure Iran does not develop nuclear arms and any U.S. force  against Iran would strain ties. The EU wants much more  commitment to Middle East peacemaking in Bush's second term.<p> 
			
			MISTRUST RUNS DEEP<p> 
			
			There is deep resentment to Bush in the Arab world, where  he is accused of bias toward Israel, is criticized for his  actions against Arab and Muslim states in the war on terror and  faces dire warnings against any new military action in the  region.<p> 
			
			"The more Bush expands the horizon of American violence in  the region, the greater the prospect of extremism and  fanaticism," said Egyptian political analyst Mohamed al-Sayed.<p> 
			
			In Asia, Bush faces challenges over how to handle China and  its fast-growing economy, and North Korea's nuclear program --  as well as fears that Washington will be distracted by problems  in other regions.<p> 
			
			"When it looks at the chessboard called the world, its  attention is focused in the Middle East," said Kim Sung-han of  the Institute of Foreign Affairs and National Security in  Seoul.<p> 
			
			The plea from other regions is not to be neglected.<p> 
			
			"Latin America certainly wasn't on the first Bush agenda in  any appreciative way and my impression is that it won't be on  the second Bush agenda very much either," said Andres Rozental,  head of the Mexican Council of Foreign Affairs think-tank.<p> 
			
			John Stremlau, head of international relations at  Johannesburg's University of the Witwatersrand, urged Bush to  back proposals to relieve poverty in Africa. He mixed hope with  concern -- a common view as Bush's second term starts.<p> 
			
			"I see this as a year of great possibility. But is the  political will there?" Stremlau said.
