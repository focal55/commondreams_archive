<p> SOFIA, BULGARIA -- Bulgaria is now sure U.S. forces killed one of its soldiers last week in a "friendly fire" accident, mainly because of poor communication, army and Defense Ministry officials said Wednesday.

<P>Defense Minister Nikolai Svinarov said spent bullets removed from rifleman Gurdi Gurdev's body armor were of U.S. issue. Gurdev had been sprayed with automatic weapons fire after his unit shot warning rounds to halt an Iraqi vehicle in the dark.

<P>"They were 7.62x51 Winchester," he said. Results from a U.S. investigation will be revealed on March 11 in Baghdad.

<P>Gurdev's death happened the same day U.S. forces killed an Italian security agent and wounded journalist Giuliana Sgrena.

<P>The incidents have drawn sharp criticism from the two U.S.-allied states, and officials from both countries have demanded the United States punish those responsible.

<P>But Bulgaria's Army Chief of Staff Nikola Kolev took a more conciliatory tone Wednesday, saying his troops had been shown the location of U.S. units on a map, but the two sides had not established contact.

<P>"The problem of communication was not solved," he told a news conference.

<P>"A meeting has been held with an American communication unit in the area and it confirmed it had fired shots at the same spot and time when the incident occurred ... These accidents happen."

<P>Bulgaria's government, led by former King Simeon Saxe-Coburg, is a strong supporter of the U.S.-led operations in Iraq, but roughly three quarters of the population disagree with its military presence there.

<P>Gurdev's death -- Bulgaria's eighth fatal casualty suffered in Iraq -- has also ignited a storm of criticism from media and opposition parties at home, who say officials kept the details of the shooting secret for several days.

<P>"The ease with which the authorities lied reveals their guilty conscience to society, which staunchly disapproves of their policy in Iraq and their servility to the Americans," daily Sega wrote in an editorial Wednesday.

<P>Kolev and Svinarov denied they had withheld information, and said they had to wait for an investigation to discern whether the shooting was actually a case of "friendly fire."
