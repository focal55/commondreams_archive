<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->Several hundred animal rights activists - some in their underwear - marched through the streets of Pamplona Tuesday to protest bullfighting on the eve of the Spanish city's wildly popular running of the bulls.

<p>The centuries-old festival that draws thousands of daredevils from Spain and around the world kicks off in earnest on Thursday, when six bulls and six steers meant to keep them in a pack rumble along a 850-meter (930-yard) cobblestone course from a holding pen to the city's bullring, with human thrill-seekers running alongside them.

<p>The runs are held every morning, with streets often moist and slippery with dew, for eight days.

<p>The mad dashes and the raucous, non-stop street parties that accompany them were made internationally famous by Ernest Hemingway's novel "The Sun Also Rises."

<p>The festival's ceremonial opening is Wednesday, when a small rocket fired from a town hall balcony signals the start of Spain's most famous festival, named for San Fermin, the patron saint of Pamplona.

<p>Since record keeping began in 1924, 13 people have been killed during the runs. The last was a 22-year-old American, Matthew Tassio, who was gored to death in 1995. This year's edition will pay a special tribute to him to mark the 10-year anniversary.</P><p align="CENTER">&copy; 2005 AP<p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable --></font></td></tr>
