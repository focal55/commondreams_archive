<p>BAGHDAD  - Leading Sunni clerics declared on  Wednesday that any government emerging from Iraq's historic  election would lack legitimacy because many people had  boycotted a poll they said was tainted by a U.S.-led  occupation.
<p> 
			
			Iraqis defied militants' threats and flocked to the polls  on Sunday in the Shi'ite south and Kurdish north, but many in  the central Sunni Arab heartland -- where the 22-month-old  anti-American insurgency is strongest -- stayed home.<p>

While the Bush administration insisted the election was  conducted fairly and world leaders heaped praise on Iraqi  voters, Iraq's Muslim Clerics' Association railed against the  country's first multi-party ballot in half a century.<p> 
			
			"These elections lack legitimacy because a large segment of  different sects, parties and currents ... boycotted," the Sunni  religious group said in a statement as the vote count  proceeded.<p> 
			
			"This means the coming national assembly and government  that will emerge will not possess the legitimacy to enable them  to draft the constitution or sign security or economic  agreements."<p> 
			
			A sense of alienation among minority Sunni Arabs, who  formed the backbone of Saddam Hussein's ruling class, poses a  major challenge to Iraq's new leadership, which is certain to  be dominated by members of the long-oppressed Shi'ite majority.<p> 
			
			Many Iraqis fear the election results, which are expected  to be finalized early next week, could fuel the Sunni-led  insurgency and foment sectarian strife. Al Qaeda's wing in Iraq  has vowed to pursue "holy war."<p> 
			
			"We warn the United Nations and the international community  of the danger of granting these elections legitimacy because  this will open a door of evil and they will be the first to  bear responsibility," the clerics' group said.<p> 
			
			In fresh violence on Wednesday, four Iraqis -- two soldiers  and two civilians -- were killed in separate roadside bombings  in Samarra, and saboteurs blew up part of an oil pipeline  running from northern oil fields to a refinery near Baghdad.<p> 
			
			A Shi'ite leader claiming victory in the elections said on  Tuesday he wanted all groups, including Sunni Arabs, to help  shape Iraq's future.<p> 
			
			Abdul Aziz al-Hakim, who tops the candidate list of the  United Iraqi Alliance drawn up with the blessing of revered  Shi'ite cleric Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, said he was reaching  out to all ethnic and religious groups.<p> 
			
			SUNNI CLERICS STAND FIRM<p> 
			
			But the Sunni clerics stood firm. They had urged an  election boycott in protest at U.S.-led assaults on Sunni  cities and said the poll could not be fair with foreign troops  on Iraqi soil.<p> 
			
			"All Iraqi people are waiting for the opportunity to hold  comprehensive, free and just elections that have legitimacy ...  after the withdrawal of the occupation," the Sunni group said.<p> 
			
			Iraqis voted for a 275-member transitional national  assembly that will appoint a government and draft a  constitution to be approved by referendum in October.<p> 
			
			Despite its rejection of the polls, the clerics said they  would respect the decision of Iraqis who voted but would regard  the new government as having only limited powers.<p> 
			
			The group met a senior U.S. embassy official before the  elections and offered to drop its boycott if Washington set a  timetable for troop withdrawal. The official refused.<p> 
			
			Interim leaders say it is too early to ask foreign troops  to leave until the country's security forces are built up.<p> 
			
			Emboldened by their role in thwarting attacks on election  day, the chief of police in Iraq's main northern Sunni city of  Mosul has given insurgents two weeks to hand over all arms.<p> 
			
			"Hand over your weapons or we will come and get you,"  Brigadier Mohammed Ahmed al-Jabouri said on a TV station to  guerrillas in and around Iraq's third largest city.<p> 
			
			It marked a turnaround in Mosul. Two months ago, virtually  the entire police force deserted after rebels overran police  stations. The police chief was sacked and Jabouri was  appointed.<p> 
			
			Across the country, police and soldiers backed by U.S.-led  forces were credited with preventing a bloodbath at the polls.<p> 
			
			But no one is claiming the insurgency is over, or even  seriously weakened. Guerrillas still managed to kill 35 people  on Sunday.<p>
