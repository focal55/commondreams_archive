<p> At the same time one of Florida's most visible television reporters brought news to viewers around the state, he earned nearly a million dollars from the government agencies he covered.

<P>The reporter, Mike Vasilinda, a 30-year veteran of the Tallahassee press corps, does public relations work and provides film editing services to more than a dozen state agencies.

<P>His Tallahassee company, Mike Vasilinda Productions Inc., has earned more than $100,000 over the last four years through contracts with Gov. Jeb Bush's office, the secretary of state, the Department of Education and other government entities that are routinely part of Mr. Vasilinda's news reports. Mr. Vasilinda, a freelance journalist, was also paid to work on campaign advertisements for at least one politician and to create a promotional movie for Leon County. One of his biggest state contracts was a 1996 deal that paid nearly $900,000 to film the weekly drawing for the Florida Lottery.

<P>Meanwhile, Mr. Vasilinda's reports continued to be shown on CNN and most Florida NBC stations.

<P>On Friday, Mr. Vasilinda told The Sarasota Herald-Tribune that his business dealings with state government did not influence his reporting.

<P>"I have processes in place to make sure the products we put out for our news clients are free from bias from any source," he said. "We absolutely keep arm's length between the two divisions of our company."

<P>But Bob Steele, a journalism ethics professor at the Poynter Institute in St. Petersburg, said Mr. Vasilinda's state government work "certainly raises some red flags."

<P>"Journalists should be guided by a principle of independence," Professor Steele said, "and their primary loyalty should be to the public. When journalists have loyalties to a government office or government agencies, those competing loyalties can undermine journalistic independence."

<P>Mr. Vasilinda sells his reports through Capitol News Service, the television news company he founded and runs in Tallahassee. NBC and other stations subscribe to Capitol News Service and can then download and broadcast any segments done by Mr. Vasilinda's company.

<P>Mr. Steele said Mr. Vasilinda's government contracts were the latest blow to the credibility of news organizations following disclosures this year that three journalists were accepting government contracts to promote programs.

<P>In January, USA Today reported that the federal Education Department had paid a conservative columnist, Armstrong Williams, $240,000 to promote the No Child Left Behind education law. Two more conservative columnists were later found to have accepted money to promote President Bush's beliefs on marriage.

<P>Mr. Vasilinda said his situation was nothing like Mr. Williams's because he had not personally promoted any government programs or appeared in any of the videos his business produced.

<P>"No one has ever suggested that our coverage, in any way, is soft on anybody," Mr. Vasilinda said.

<P>Many of the agencies that have contracted with Mr. Vasilinda were unable to provide details of the contracts.

<P>In January, a Herald-Tribune reporter left repeated messages with Governor Bush's spokeswoman, Alia Faraj, requesting information about whether any journalists had received money from state agencies.

<P>Ms. Faraj, who worked for Mr. Vasilinda at Capitol News Service before she was hired by the Bush administration, never responded. She also did not return calls Friday seeking comment for this article.

<P>Denver Stutler, Governor Bush's chief of staff, did not return a phone call Monday. State officials from several agencies said Vasilinda Productions had created promotional videos, filmed public service announcements featuring government officials and made copies of videos and compact discs for agencies.

<P>Vasilinda Productions produced a back-to-school video several years ago featuring Education Commissioner Charlie Crist, who later became attorney general and is considered a contender for governor in 2006.

<P>The fact that Mr. Vasilinda works for government agencies is widely known among reporters and government officials in Tallahassee. But viewers around the state have never been told of Mr. Vasilinda's broad financial ties to state government.

<P>In fact, several television executives at Florida's NBC affiliates - stations associated with but not owned by NBC - said they were unaware of those contracts and would not comment on them until they had more information.

<P>CNN, which broadcast a Vasilinda report on Terri Schiavo on Thursday, did not respond on Monday to questions from The Herald-Tribune.
