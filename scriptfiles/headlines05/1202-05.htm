<p>ROME  - Human Rights Watch has released a list of 26 "ghost detainees"  it says are being held incommunicado by the United States at secret foreign prisons. </p>

<p> Marc Garlasco, senior military analyst for the rights group, said the list was the most complete possible, based on news media reports and government documents, of the number of people arrested and held without due process outside the United States since the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. </p>
<p>The list, released late Wednesday, includes many of the top  suspects arrested  in connection with the Sept. 11 attacks, the bombing of the destroyer Cole in 2000 and the nightclubs in Bali in 2002. </p>
<p>"One thing I want to make clear is we are talking about some really bad guys," Mr. Garlasco said. "These are criminals who need to be brought to justice. One of our main problems with the U.S. is that justice is not being served by having these people held incognito."</p>
<p>The list was released amid heightened debate in the United States over possible torture of American-held detainees overseas and rising anger in Europe about possible secret American jails on the Continent, kidnappings of  suspects and transfers of ghost prisoners on European soil. </p>
<p>The Bush administration has said it will  respond to inquiries from European nations about the transfer and detention of terror suspects, insisting that American actions have complied with   international law.</p>
<p>Mr. Garlasco said,  "Our concern is that if illegal methods such as torture are being used against them,"   trials may   "either be impossible or questionable under international standards of jurisprudence."</p>
<p>About 100 people are being held without charges in prisons outside  the United States, experts estimate. </p>
<p>The Human Rights Watch list  includes Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, arrested in Pakistan in 2003  and suspected of being a top operative in Al Qaeda behind the Sept. 11 attacks; and Hassan Ghul, alleged to have been a courier for <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/osama_bin_laden/index.html?inline=nyt-per" title="More articles about Osama bin Laden.">Osama bin Laden</a> and Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the Jordanian militant in Iraq. </p>
