</p><p>Mr Kissinger also called former Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi a "bitch" during the conversation.

</p><p>At the time, the US saw India as too close to the Soviet Union.

</p><p>The conversation was revealed in documents the US State Department declassified this month on US foreign policy of the time.
</p><p>
According to the documents, President Nixon called Indira Gandhi an "old witch" in a conversation with Mr Kissinger.

</p><p>'High regard'

</p><p>Mr Kissinger, 82, has now told a the private Indian television channel NDTV that his comments did not reflect American policy during the 1970s.

</p><p>"I regret that these words were used. I have extremely high regard for Mrs Gandhi as a statesman," he said.

	
</p><p>"The fact that we were at cross purposes at that time was inherent in the situation but she was a great leader who did great things for her country."</p><p>

One key conversation transcript comes from the meeting between President Nixon and Mr Kissinger in the White House on 5 November 1971, shortly after a meeting with the visiting Indira Gandhi.

</p><p>"We really slobbered over the old witch," says President Nixon.

</p><p>"The Indians are bastards anyway," says Mr Kissinger. "They are starting a war there."

</p><p>He adds: "While she was a bitch, we got what we wanted too. She will not be able to go home and say that the United States didn't give her a warm reception and therefore in despair she's got to go to war.

</p><p>Mr Kissinger told NDTV that this was not a "formal conversation".

</p><p>"This was somebody letting off steam at the end of a meeting in which both President Nixon and I were emphasising that we had gone out of our way to treat Mrs Gandhi very cordially," he said.

</p><p>"There was disappointment at the results of the meeting. The language was Nixon language."

Relations between India and US have strengthened since Mr Kissinger's days.

</p><p>"The US recognises that India is a global power, that is a strategic partner of the US on the big issues," Mr Kissinger said.

</p><p>However, President Nixon and Mr Kissinger's remarks have angered India's ruling Congress party.

</p><p>"It is shocking that the head of state of a country and his principal adviser chose to use such intemperate language against a popularly elected prime minister of another country," party spokesman Anand Sharma said.

</p><p>"These words have no relevance today... we hope the present US leader also rejects these remarks which were definitely in very poor taste." </p><p align="CENTER">&copy; 2005 BBC News</p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable --></font></td></tr>
