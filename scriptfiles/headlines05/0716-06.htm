<p>Mark Harris, a 20-year veteran of the Air Force, was not pleased to see a sign-carrying Iraq war protester in Thursday night's Mexico Volunteer Fire Department Field Days parade.
</P>
<P>	What he saw happen to the man, though, raised some questions for him and, he said, his children.
</P>
<P>	An Oswego County sheriff's deputy pulled Joshua A. Davies, 23, of 25B North St. in Mexico, out of the parade and charged him with disorderly conduct. Davies had been walking in the parade carrying, Harris said, an "Impeach Bush" sign and another sign calling for an end to the war in Iraq.

</P>

<P>	Harris said he saw Davies get searched, handcuffed and put in a sheriff's patrol car. Harris said Davies was kept in the car until the parade ended about 45 minutes later.
</P>
<P>	"My kids watched it," said Harris. "Some asked, 'Can they do that?' "
</P>
<P>	They were talking about what the deputy did, not the protester. And it wasn't just children asking the question, Harris said. "There were older people, senior citizens, saying it too."
</P>
<P>	Oswego County Sheriff Reuel Todd said Davies was arrested because he was a spectator who jumped into the middle of the parade. "He was not entered in the parade," Todd said.

</P>
<P>	"We had a complaint that he disrupted the parade," Todd added. "He was arrested and released on an appearance ticket."
</P>
<P>	A man who answered the phone at the Mexico fire station, who declined to give his name, said Friday that all anyone had to do to be in the parade was ask permission.
</P>
<P>	"I felt bad that he was there," Harris said of Davies, "but I thought he had the right to his opinion."
</P>
<P>	"This was a signal to the kids that you can't do that here," Harris said. "Dissent, I mean. I thought that's what being an American means - the right to protest, to speak your mind."
</P>
<P>	Davies could not be reached for comment. </P>
