<p> WASHINGTON -- President Bush is jeopardizing national security by not disciplining Karl Rove for his role in leaking the name of a CIA officer, and has hampered efforts to recruit informants in the war on terror, former U.S. intelligence officers say.</p>

Former CIA analyst Larry Johnson used the Democratic Party's weekly radio address Saturday to reiterate comments he made Friday to a panel of House and Senate Democrats.
<p>At that event, Johnson and others expressed great frustration that CIA operative Valerie Plame's name was made public. Plame is married to former ambassador Joseph Wilson, a critic of Bush's Iraq policy.</p>
<p>"Instead of a president concerned first and foremost with protecting this country and the intelligence officers who serve it, we are confronted with a president who is willing to sit by while political operatives savage the reputations of good Americans like Valerie Plame and Joe Wilson," Johnson said in the radio address.</p>
<p>Johnson, who said he was a registered Republican, said Bush has gone back on his promise to fire anyone at the White House implicated in a leak.</p>
<p>Federal law forbids government officials from revealing the identity of an undercover intelligence officer.</p>
<p>Rove, Bush's deputy chief of staff, told Time magazine reporter Matthew Cooper in a 2003 phone call that Wilson's wife worked for the CIA on weapons of mass destruction issues, according to an account by Cooper in the magazine.</p>
<p>Rove has not disputed that he told Cooper that Wilson's wife worked for the agency, but has said through his lawyer that he did not mention her by name.</p>
<p>In July 2003, Robert Novak, citing unnamed administration officials, identified Plame by name in his syndicated column and wrote that she worked for the CIA. The column has led to a federal criminal investigation into who leaked Plame's undercover identity. New York Times reporter Judith Miller &#151; who never wrote a story about Plame &#151; has been jailed for refusing to testify.</p>

<p>Bush said last week, "I think it's best that people wait until the investigation is complete before you jump to conclusions. And I will do so, as well."</p>
<p>Dana Perino, a White House spokesman, said Friday that the administration would have no comment on the investigation while it was continuing.</p>
<p>Johnson said he wished a Republican lawmaker would have the courage to stand up and "call the ugly dog the ugly dog."</p>
<p>"Where are these men and women with any integrity to speak out against this?" he asked. "I expect better behavior out of Republicans."</p>
