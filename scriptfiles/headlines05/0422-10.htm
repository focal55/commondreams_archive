<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p>  Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi has reiterated his country's "deep remorse" over its colonial aggression in Asia.

<P>The speech at the Asia-Africa summit comes amid tensions over the approval by Tokyo of school textbooks which China says gloss over Japan's record.

<P>Mr Koizumi later said he hoped to meet Chinese President Hu Jintao on Saturday - although Beijing has yet to agree.

<P>Leaders from 80 nations are attending the two-day summit in Indonesia.

<P>The annual Asia-Africa summit has increasingly been dominated by global trade issues.

<P>But the escalating row between China and Japan threatens to overshadow all other considerations.

<P><b>'Facing facts'

</b><P>Addressing delegates, Mr Koizumi said: "In the past Japan through its colonial rule and aggression caused tremendous damage and suffering for the people of many countries, particularly those of Asian nations.

<P>"Japan squarely faces these facts of history in a spirit of humility."

<P>The wording repeats previous Japanese apologies - but analysts say the international setting gives the statement added weight.

<P>Asked by reporters if he would hold talks with President Hu, Mr Koizumi said he was hoping for a meeting on Saturday.

<P>The BBC's Tim Johnston in Jakarta says the apology should go some way to placating Chinese anger, which was recently reignited by a history textbook that the Chinese felt paid insufficient attention to atrocities.

<P>In response to the apology, China's ambassador to Britain, Zha Peixin, said Japan's actions would be more important than words.

<P>Separately, China did protest over Friday's visit by Japanese lawmakers to the Yasukuni shrine in Tokyo. The shrine honours the Japanese who died during World War II, including a number of war criminals.

<P>"As Sino-Japanese relations are facing a serious situation, we express our strong dissatisfaction over the negative actions of some Japanese politicians who ignore the larger interests," the Chinese foreign ministry said in a statement quoted by AFP news agency.

<P>In his speech, Mr Koizumi also repeated Japan's call for an overhaul of the UN Security Council and underscored Tokyo's qualifications as a potential permanent member.

<P>"The United Nations, particularly the Security Council, needs to be reformed, so that the organisation reflects the realities of the today's world."

<P>The Japanese leader emphasised Tokyo's past contributions to development aid and repeated its commitment to increase them.

<P>Japan's campaign for a permanent seat on the Security Council has been one of the factors fuelling the recent anti-Japanese protests in Chinese cities.

<P><b>Historic summit</b>

<P>This Asia-Africa summit has special significance since it marks the 50th anniversary of the Bandung Conference - the first summit of Third World nations, in the shadow of the Cold War.

<P>The summit intends to make a declaration of a strategic partnership to increase trade and investment as well as emphasise the importance of multilateral efforts in solving conflicts.

<P>Developments so far have included:

   <P>  <ul><li>The highest level meeting between North and South Korean leaders for five years on the summit's sidelines. North Korean deputy Kim Yong-nam and South Korean Prime Minister Lee Hae-chan met for 10 minutes, Yonhap news agency reported.
    <br></li><li>A pledge by Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi to double Japan's aid to Africa to $1.6bn over the next three years.
    <br></li><li>A statement by Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono that corruption threatened the development of Asia and Africa as much as war, HIV/AIDS, and poverty. 

</li></ul><P>Mr Yudhoyono said those taking part in the summit would make up for five decades of lost opportunities by establishing a new strategic partnership between Africa and Asia.

<P>"Asia Africa is the missing link in the worldwide structure of interregional relations," he said in his opening remarks.

<P>The meeting is being attended by a number of African presidents and prime ministers, including President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa, as well as the UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan.
