<p>UNITED NATIONS  - Thousands of people are  detained in Iraq without due process in apparent violation of  international law, the United Nations said on Wednesday, adding  that 6,000 of the country's 10,000 prisoners were in the hands  of the U.S. military.

   A painting from a series by Colombian artist Fernando Botero inspired by the prison abuse scandal in Abu Ghraib in Iraq is seen in this undated handout photo. The abuse of prisoners at Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison so enraged Botero, it drove Latin America's best-known living artist to create what he hopes will be a 'permanent witness to a great crime'. Some of the works will be on public display for the first time at a retrospective of Botero's work opening in Rome on June 16, 2005. Photo by Reuters (Handout)<br>

        <!--/endimage/-->In Iraq, &quot;one of the major human rights challenges remains  the detention of thousands of persons without due process,&quot;  Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in a report to the 15-nation  U.N. Security Council.
<p> According to the Iraqi Justice Ministry, there were about  10,000 detainees in all of Iraq as of April, &quot;6,000 of whom  were in the custody of the Multinational Force&quot; commanded by  the United States, Annan said.
<p> &quot;Despite the release of some detainees, their number  continues to grow. Prolonged detention without access to  lawyers and courts is prohibited under international law  including during states of emergency,&quot; his report said.
<p> A Security Council resolution adopted a year ago ending the  U.S.-led occupation of Iraq let the U.S. military keep taking  and holding prisoners even after the June 2004 handover of  power to Iraqis, in apparent contradiction of the Geneva  conventions.
<p> The United States at the time of the handover held more  than 8,000 &quot;security and criminal detainees&quot; in U.S.-controlled  centers including the now-infamous Abu Ghraib detention center,  where photographs of prisoners taken by U.S. soldiers  documented a variety of gruesome human rights abuses.
<p> Amnesty International last month cited Abu Ghraib and a  second U.S. detention center in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, as  evidence that Washington &quot;thumbs its nose at the rule of law  and human rights,&quot; a charge dismissed as &quot;absurd&quot; by President  George W. Bush.
<p> While the 2004 U.N. resolution was silent on the issue of  U.S. military prisons, a side letter from then-Secretary of  State Colin Powell authorized the U.S.-led forces in Iraq to  undertake a variety of tasks linked to &quot;the maintenance of  security&quot; including &quot;internment where this is necessary for  imperative reasons of security.&quot;
<p> The Fourth Geneva Convention, while allowing occupying  forces to detain individuals, has no provision for internment  by outside forces after an occupation has ended.</p>
