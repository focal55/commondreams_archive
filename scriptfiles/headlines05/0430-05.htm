<p>WASHINGTON  - A fourth senior member of Colin L. Powell's team at the State Department expressed strong reservations on Friday about the nomination of John R. Bolton as ambassador to the United Nations.</p>
<p> The official, A. Elizabeth Jones, is a veteran diplomat who stepped down in February as assistant secretary of state for Europe and Eurasia. Among those who have now voiced public concerns about Mr. Bolton, Ms. Jones joins Lawrence Wilkerson, Mr. Powell's chief of staff; Carl W. Ford, Jr., who headed the department's intelligence bureau; and John R. Wolf, who was assistant secretary of state for nonproliferation. Associates of Mr. Powell have said he has expressed concerns of his own in private conversations with at least two Republican senators.</p>

<p>"I don't know if he's incapable of negotiation, but he's unwilling," Ms. Jones said in an interview. She said she believed that "the fundamental problem," if Mr. Bolton were to become United Nations ambassador, would be a reluctance on his part to make the kinds of minor, symbolic concessions necessary to build consensus among other governments and maintain the American position.</p>
<p> Ms. Jones spoke as the staff of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which is reviewing Mr. Bolton's nomination, was holding closed-door interviews with former senior intelligence officials who clashed with Mr. Bolton during his tenure as under secretary of state for arms control. Congressional officials who heard the testimony said John E. McLaughlin, a former deputy director of central intelligence, used strong language on Friday in telling the group that he regarded as totally inappropriate an attempt by Mr. Bolton in 2002 to seek the ouster of Fulton Armstrong, the national intelligence officer for Latin America, in a dispute over reports on Cuba.</p>
<p> Among others interviewed on Friday was Stuart Cohen, who at the time was Mr. Armstrong's supervisor as the acting chairman of the National Intelligence Council. The clash over Cuba between Mr. Bolton and his staff on one hand and intelligence officials on the other is a central focus of the committee as it weighs allegations that Mr. Bolton inappropriately sought to put pressure on intelligence officials to make judgments that reflected his policy views.</p>
<p>Among new disclosures under committee review are some included in previously undisclosed testimony by Mr. Armstrong, now a senior C.I.A. official. Within days of Mr. Bolton's delivering a speech in May 2002 that warned of attempts by Cuba to develop biological weapons, Mr. Armstrong has told the committee, the Central Intelligence Agency took the rare step of circulating within the Bush administration a classified assessment that was more cautious than Mr. Bolton's approach. </p>
<p>By July 2002, Mr. Bolton had requested the transfer of both Mr. Armstrong and a second intelligence officer, Christian Westermann of the State Department, with whom he had clashed on the matter. Mr. Cohen and Alan Foley, a C.I.A. official who headed the agency's weapons proliferation intelligence unit and was interviewed on Thursday, have both told the committee that Mr. Bolton informed them that he wanted to see Mr. Armstrong removed from his portfolio. Mr. Bolton has testified that he had sought the two analysts' removal because he had lost confidence in them. </p>
<p>Mr. Armstrong told the Congressional panel this month that the C.I.A.'s decision to republish its judgments on Cuba was intended to clear up what the C.I.A. regarded as confusion caused by Mr. Bolton's speech in 2002, and particularly his assertions related to Cuba's biological weapons, according to notes taken on the testimony. Mr. Armstrong said the C.I.A. had been concerned that the testimony by Mr. Bolton did not include cautionary caveats contained in a 1999 National Intelligence Estimate on Cuba. </p>
<p>But Mr. Armstrong told the panel that he believed the publication of the assessment, in the Senior Executive Intelligence Brief, had been "seen by Bolton and his staff as a direct insult to Bolton." Mr. Bolton's top aide, Frederick Fleitz, later sent to Mr. Armstrong what the intelligence officer described in his testimony as an abusive e-mail message. </p>
<p>The account of Mr. Armstrong's testimony, provided in a video conference on April 8, is spelled out in a memorandum for the record written by the committee's Democratic staff. A copy of the April 10 memorandum was provided to The New York Times by a Democratic Congressional official. A Republican official said that a companion memorandum prepared by the panel's Republican staff had not been declassified and for that reason could not be made public.</p>

<p> The C.I.A. republished its judgments on Cuba in a Senior Executive Intelligence Brief within days of Mr. Bolton delivering a May 6, 2002, speech to the Heritage Foundation. In it, he complained, among other things, that the American intelligence assessments on Cuba had been "unbalanced" and might have been tainted by the role played by a Defense Intelligence Agency analyst, Ana Montes, who had been arrested the previous year as a Cuban spy. In early June that year, Mr. Armstrong briefed members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee staff and questioned whether Mr. Bolton's speech had been adequately cleared by intelligence agencies.</p>
<p>Ms. Jones, who holds the rank of career ambassador and who was interviewed on Friday, had not previously spoken in public about her opposition to Mr. Bolton's nomination. Her retirement from the State Department takes effect Saturday. She backed up accounts provided by other State Department officials who said that Mr. Bolton refused to coordinate his overseas trips, including those to Russia, Britain and France, with the appropriate regional bureau at the department. </p>
<p>Ultimately, Ms. Jones said, Mr. Bolton's meetings with foreign officials in Moscow and other capitals had been coordinated by the American embassies there, in keeping with State Department procedures. But she described Mr. Bolton's approach as having been "just a measure of how difficult he was to deal with."</p>
<p>"For whatever reason, he would not coordinate with us, before doing any kind of trips," Ms. Jones said. "We always had to play catch up with him, which was not standard with anyone else in the department."</p>


ilities, but what will go up is torture at the Afghan facilities. It's the usual shell game. The U.S. feels the heat, it tries to discontinue the practice itself, but it finds special forces in the Afghan Army to do its bidding."
