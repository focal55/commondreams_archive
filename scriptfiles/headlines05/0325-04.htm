<p> WASHINGTON -- As President Bush and his allies travel the country to promote his Social Security plan, they say individual investment accounts are a no-brainer, bound to result in more money at retirement than workers could expect from Social Security.

<P>But someone at the Social Security Administration did not get the word.

<P>In a Q. and A. on the agency's Web site meant to explain the retirement program, there is this exchange, which has apparently been there for years:

<P>"Question: I think I could do better if you let me invest the Social Security I pay into an individual retirement plan (I.R.A.) or some other investment plan. What do you think?"

<P>"Answer: Maybe you could, but then again, maybe your investments wouldn't work out. Remember these facts:

<P><ul><li>Your Social Security taxes pay for potential disability and survivors benefits as well as for retirement benefits.

<br></li><li>Social Security incorporates social goals - such as giving more protection to families and to low-income workers - that are not part of private pension plans; and<br></li><li>

Social Security benefits are adjusted yearly for increases in the cost of living - a feature not present in many private plans."
<br>
</li></ul><P>In the middle of the page at <a href="http://www.ssa.gov" target="_new">www.ssa.gov</a>., toward the top, are "Questions about." From the drop-down menu, viewers can choose "Taxes and Social Security" and go to Question 18.

<P>After he was shown the passage on Thursday, a White House spokesman, Trent Duffy, said: "The president is not talking about this approach. The president's approach is a voluntary account financed by a portion of a person's payroll taxes, and that account would have appropriate safeguards to guard against risks in the market."

<P>Does he expect the Web site to be changed? "That's up to the Social Security Administration," Mr. Duffy said.

<P>In the agency's press office, Mark Hinkle, said, "By and large, we have an informational Web site, not a political Web site."
