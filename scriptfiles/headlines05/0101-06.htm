A police officer at the scene in western Amman told reporters the protest was banned because the activists failed to get a permit from the authorities three days ago in line with the law and urged everyone to leave the area.
<p>"The police banned us and asked us to leave for security reasons," said Medea Benjamin, the founding director of human rights group Global Exchange which is opposed to the US-led war in Iraq.
<p>"We are all very upset because we had done similar protests all over the world. We're very shocked," she said.
<p>As the protesters walked away they sang a refrain from one of John Lennon's classic songs" "All we are saying, is give peace a chance."
<p>Benjamin was among a group of 15 people, most of them US citizens, who carried candles and banners with the word "peace" who wanted to stage a peaceful protest outside UN headquarters in Amman.
<p>She said the group, including members of Families for Peace and women's anti-war group Code Pink, will go ahead with plans to hold a candlelit vigil Saturday on the Jordan-Iraq border to protest US involvement in Iraq.
<p>The group recently sent 600,000 dollars worth of humanitarian aid to residents of the Iraqi town of Fallujah who were displaced by a massive US-led assault in November.
