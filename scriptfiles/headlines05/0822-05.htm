<p>CRAWFORD, Texas  - President Bush, trying to  counter the message of anti-war vigils outside his ranch and  growing public discontent with Iraq, leaves Texas on Monday for  the first of two speeches on the war and the September 11  attacks, but more protesters await him.</p>
<p> Bush, appearing at a Veterans of Foreign Wars convention in  Salt Lake City, will weigh in on attempts by Iraqis to meet a  deadline for a draft constitution and may reiterate his  stay-the-course message to Americans who are increasingly  uneasy about his handling of Iraq.</p><p> At a park near the VFW venue, Celeste Zappala, 58, the  Philadelphia mother of a National Guardsman killed in Iraq,  plans to lead a protest. Her son Sherwood Baker was killed in  Iraq last year and she is part of anti-war mother Cindy  Sheehan's group, Gold Star Families for Peace.</p><p> Baker was killed while assigned to the Iraq Survey Group,  which was on the hunt for stockpiles of illicit weapons but  concluded they were never there.</p><p> "We all know that noble cause for war that Bush talks about  has changed several times," Zappala said.</p><p> Her theme will be similar to that of Sheehan, the  Vacaville, California, mother whose son Casey was killed in  combat in Iraq. Sheehan has become a magnet for anti-war  sentiment by camping out near Bush's ranch and demanding to  talk face-to-face with the president.</p><p> "We want to meet with him. We have questions to ask him,"  Zappala said.</p><p> Sheehan's group is also airing television ads in Salt Lake  City accusing Bush of having lied about Iraq. One station, an  ABC affiliate, is refusing to air the ads.</p><p> Bush, who has ruled out a near-term pullout from Iraq, on  Saturday cited the upcoming fourth anniversary of the September  11, 2001, attacks on the United States and said Iraq was a  cause worth fighting for.</p><p> "Our troops know that ... if we do not confront these evil  men abroad, we will have to face them one day in our own cities  and streets, and they know that the safety and security of  every American is at stake in this war," he said in his weekly  radio address.</p><p> Bush went to war in Iraq in 2003 warning of a threat from  stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction. None were found.</p><p> Critics say Iraq had nothing to do with the September 11  attacks and that the administration has tried to tie Iraq to  terrorism since the war to justify its actions.</p><p> After Salt Lake City, Bush will go to Idaho for two days.  He will speak on the war on terror there on Wednesday before  resuming his vacation at his Crawford, Texas, ranch.</p>
