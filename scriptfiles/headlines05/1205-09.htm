government minister was told about the mistaken U.S. detention
of a German man in Afghanistan but kept quiet about it at the
request of the U.S. ambassador.</p>
<p>The Washington Post reported at the weekend that Daniel
Coats, then U.S. ambassador to Germany, told previous Interior
Minister Otto Schily in May 2004 that Khaled el-Masri had been
wrongfully held but would soon be released.</p>
<p>"We are looking inside the Interior Ministry itself to find
out what information we can get," spokesman Bruno Kahl told a
news conference in which officials were bombarded with
questions on the issue. "We want to find out what, if anything,
was said."</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who as head of
Chancellery under the previous government was one of former
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's top aides, declined to comment.</p>
<p>"I know the demand from the German press and we'll deal
with it in the coming week," he told reporters in Vienna.</p>
<p>Opposition politicians have said Steinmeier must have known
of the affair and a report in the Sueddeutsche Zeitung
newspaper said Germany's BND intelligence service examined the
case in 2004 after Masri's lawyer asked for help from the
government.</p>
<p>The investigation confirmed Masri had been abducted but the
information was not sent to justice authorities investigating
the case as the government wanted the abduction hushed up, the
paper said in an advance report from Tuesday's edition.</p>
<p>A German government spokesman declined to comment but
referred to earlier comments from chief spokesman Ulrich
Wilhelm who said the current government had no knowledge of
contacts between U.S. authorities and the previous government.</p>
<p>Schily has been unreachable for comment. Opposition leaders
have demanded a thorough investigation of the allegation.</p>

<p>EMBARRASSMENT</p>
<p>The suggestion that a German minister and other members of
Schroeder's government may have been involved in a cover-up to
protect Washington from embarrassment comes at a sensitive time
for the new chancellor, Angela Merkel.</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice arrives in Berlin
late on Monday for talks with German and other European leaders
where the topic of the CIA's treatment of prisoners is one of
the main items to be discussed.</p>
<p>Merkel has been in office for less than two weeks at the
head of a power-sharing "grand coalition" with her former
rivals. She is trying hard to repair ties with Washington,
which never forgave Schroeder for his vocal opposition to the
U.S. invasion of Iraq.</p>
<p>Masri, a German national who was arrested in Macedonia on
December 31, 2003, has said he was handed to U.S. officials and
flown to a secret prison in Afghanistan, where he was held in
appalling conditions and interrogated as a terrorism suspect.</p>
<p>He has said he was returned to Europe five months later
when the CIA realized they had the wrong man. Details of his
case began to emerge through the media in January this year,
eight months after the reported conversation between Coats and
Schily.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Masri plans to file suit against the CIA -- the
same day Rice meets in Berlin with Merkel.</p>
<p>Last month, the Washington Post reported that the CIA used
German airports to help fly terrorism suspects across the
continent to secret detention centers. This has sparked demands
by German politicians for an explanation, although the
government has said Washington is not under any time pressure.</p>
