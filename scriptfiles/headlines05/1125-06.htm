<p>There is more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere today than at any point during the past 650,000 years, says a major new study that let scientists peer back in time at "greenhouse gases" that can help fuel global warming.

<p>By analyzing tiny air bubbles preserved in Antarctic ice for millennia, a team of European researchers highlights how people are dramatically influencing the buildup of these gases.

<p>The remarkable research promises to spur "dramatically improved understanding" of climate change, said geosciences specialist Edward Brook of Oregon State University.

<p>The study, by the European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica, is published today in the journal Science.

<p>Today, scientists directly measure levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, which accumulate in the atmosphere as a result of fuel-burning and other processes. Those gases help trap solar heat, like the greenhouses for which they are named, resulting in a gradual warming of the planet.

<p>Those measurements are disturbing: Levels of carbon dioxide have climbed from 280 parts per million two centuries ago to 380 ppm today. Earth's average temperature, meanwhile, increased about 1 degree Fahrenheit in recent decades, a relatively rapid rise. Many climate specialists warn that continued warming could have severe impacts, such as rising sea levels and changing rainfall patterns.

<p>Skeptics sometimes dismiss the rise in greenhouse gases as part of a naturally fluctuating cycle.

<p>The new study provides ever-more definitive evidence countering that view, however.

<p>Deep Antarctic ice encases tiny air bubbles formed when snowflakes fell over hundreds of thousands of years. Extracting the air allows a direct measurement of the atmosphere at past points in time, to determine the naturally fluctuating range.

<p>A previous ice-core sample had traced greenhouse gases back about 440,000 years. This new sample, from East Antarctica, goes 210,000 years further back in time.

<p>Today's still-rising level of carbon dioxide already is 27 percent higher than its peak during all those millennia, said lead researcher Thomas Stocker of the University of Bern, Switzerland.

<p>"We are out of that natural range today," he said.

<p>Moreover, that rise is occurring at a speed that "is over a factor of a hundred faster than anything we are seeing in the natural cycles," Stocker added. "It puts the present changes in context."

<p>The team, which included scientists from France and Germany, found similar results for methane, another greenhouse gas.

<p>Researchers also compared the gas levels to the Antarctic temperature over that time, covering eight cycles of alternating glacial or ice ages and warm periods. They found a stable pattern: Lower levels of gases during cold periods and higher levels during warm periods.

<p>The bottom line: "There's no natural condition that we know about in a really long time where the greenhouse-gas levels were anywhere near what they are now. And these studies tell us that there's a strong relationship between temperature and greenhouse gases," explained Oregon State's Brook.

<p>"Which logically leads you to the conclusion that maybe we should worry about temperature change in the future."

<p>A lengthening history of greenhouse-gas concentrations should help climate specialists build better models about what the future might bring, Stocker said.

<p>It also may help answer additional questions such as how long ago humans started influencing greenhouse-gas accumulations, and what impact other factors such as ocean currents play in the complexities of climate change.
