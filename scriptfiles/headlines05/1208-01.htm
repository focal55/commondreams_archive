<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->SAN FRANCISCO - Two of Greenland's largest glaciers are retreating at an alarming pace, most likely because of climate warming, scientists said Wednesday.
The other glacier, Helheim, is retreating at about 7 miles a year &#151; up from 4 miles a year during the same period.</p>
<p>"It's quite a staggering rate of increase," Hamilton said at the American Geophysical Union annual meeting.</p>

Glaciers play a major role in discharging water into oceans. Sea levels have swelled globally an estimated 4 inches to 8 inches during the past century due to melting glaciers and polar ice &#151; enough to cause some places to be awash at high tide or during severe storms.</p>

<p>Melting of Greenland ice and calving of icebergs from glaciers is responsible for about 7 percent of the annual rise in global sea level.</p>
<p>Global warming is frequently blamed for retreating glaciers around the world. The rapid retreat of Greenland glaciers suggest that climate change is a factor, Hamilton said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, one of the fastest melting glaciers in North America has reached the halfway point of disintegration and will continue retreat for another two decades.</p>
<p>Alaska's Columbia Glacier &#151; about the size of Los Angeles &#151; has shrunk 9 miles since the 1980s. It is expected to lose an additional 9 miles in the next 15 to 20 years before the bed of the glacier rises above sea level.</p>
<p>The glacier, which moves about 80 feet a day, currently releases about 2 cubic miles of ice every year into the Prince William Sound on the south coast of Alaska.</p>
<p>Understanding what happens during Alaskan glacier retreat could help explain the phenomenon in Greenland, said Tad Pfeffer, associate director of the University of Colorado's Institute of Arctic and Alpine.</p>
<p>Pfeffer said climate change warming trends do not directly explain the shrinking Columbia Glacier and other tidewater glaciers. Instead, scientists think the retreat is triggered by a slow warming trend that began five centuries ago.</p>

<p>Significant thinning of the Columbia Glacier is thought to be caused by huge chunks of iceberg that break off into the sound as a result of seawater pressure rather than climate change, Pfeffer said.</p>
<p>The glacier, which is up to 3,000 feet thick, has thinned up to 1,300 feet in some places in the last two decades.</p>
