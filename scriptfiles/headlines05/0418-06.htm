<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->Just a few hundred people picketed the latest IMF-World Bank spring meetings - a far cry from a few years ago when it seemed no summit of world financial institutions was complete without thousands of protestors on the streets.

    	  
  	
    
      <p>

    	  
  	
    
      
The peaceful demonstrations urging cancellation of poorer nations' debt  came on the fifth anniversary of one of the anti-globalisation movement's most seminal rallies in Washington DC.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
Back in 2000, hundreds were arrested as police fired tear gas at demonstrators, 10,000 of whom turned out to disrupt the talks.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
That came hot on the heels of violence at the World Trade Organization talks in Seattle where more than 100,000 people marched.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
Over the next couple of years, protests and policing dominated the headlines at a string of major summits - in Prague, Davos, London and Quebec City.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
The complaints of myriad groups - loosely arraigned against unaccountable, corporate-led aspects of globalisation - came to the fore.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
But what has happened - where did all the protests go?

    	  
  	
    
      <p />

    	  
  	
    
      <b>Local action
</b>    	  
  	
    
      <p>
    	  
  	
    
      
Outside the World Bank building in DC, activist Sue Frankel-Streit, 41, prepared to take part in a street theatre show with the Cardboard Chaos group.

"What happened in the wake of Seattle was that many people went into the community and organised from home," she said.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />

    	  
  	
    
      
"It isn't that the movement has got smaller, people are just taking action in their communities - which is where they are making the most difference."

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
Another reason protests have gone off the boil is that some believe that while the problem have not been fixed, the international community is moving towards addressing the big issues.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
And corporate leaders increasingly see major world problems - like poverty, inequitable globalisation or climate change - as bad for business.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
In January, protests planned for the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, were called off.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
Many who may have attended were at a rival event: the World Social Forum in Brazil's Porto Alegre.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      

Since it began in 2001, the WSF has provided a platform for the views of thousands of anti-globalisation and poverty campaigners - undistorted by the negative publicity of violent clashes at protests.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      <b>Terror attacks
</b>    	  
  	
    
      <p>
    	  
  	
    
      
Also marching in Washington on Saturday was Preston Duncan, 21, part of the DC poetry insurgency collective.

"It's a creative protest - I think it's much more effective than rioting in the street," he said.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
"Some people break windows, we use the emotional appeal of what we are doing - I think that's more likely to make people want to rally round."

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
Inevitably, the post-9/11 war on terror has also shifted the focus. Some say it has led to more oppressive policing of protests.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
When leaders from the G8 group of industrialised nations met for their annual summit in 2004, they did so on a secure island off Georgia.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
The first protest took place more than 100km (62 miles) away.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />

    	  
  	
    
      
Activist Theresa Reuter, 64, a veteran of scores of protests since the 1960s, told the BBC: "It has been scary this weekend - there are a lot of police officers around, they have closed off the streets.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
"You, know, a lot of my friends are not here because they do not want to end up on some list as a suspected terrorist."

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
Traditionally the autumn meetings of the World Bank and IMF attract a greater number of protestors. 

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
September's meetings will be the first under the new World Bank presidency of Paul Wolfowitz - one of the most hawkish members of the Bush administration.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
It remains to be seen whether his controversial tenure will reinvigorate opponents of the institution's policies.
