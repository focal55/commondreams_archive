<p>WASHINGTON - Bruce Springsteen famously was "born in the USA," but he's getting scorned in the U.S. Senate.

An effort by New Jersey's two Democratic senators to honor the veteran rocker was shot down Friday by Republicans who are apparently still miffed a year after the Boss lent his voice to the campaign of Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry.

<p>The chamber's GOP leaders refused to bring up for consideration a resolution, introduced by Sens. Frank Lautenberg and Jon Corzine, that honored Springsteen's long career and the 1975 release of his iconic album, "Born to Run."

<p>No reason was given, said Lautenberg spokesman Alex Formuzis. "Resolutions like this pass all the time in the U.S. Senate, usually by unanimous consent," he said.

<p>Telephone calls to Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist's office seeking comment were not immediately returned.

<p>Lautenberg said he couldn't understand why anyone would object to the resolution.

<p>"Even if the Republicans don't like (Springsteen's) tunes, I would hope they appreciated his contributions to American culture," Lautenberg said.

<p>Corzine said he, Lautenberg and other Americans appreciated Springsteen's contributions to American culture.

<p>"We'll never surrender looking for ways to honor our local hero who made it big in this land of hopes and dreams," Corzine said.

<p>Springsteen endorsed Kerry last year, and made campaign appearances that drew huge crowds who came to hear music described in the resolution as "a cultural milestone that has touched the lives of millions of people."
