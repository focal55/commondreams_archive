<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->In Dakar's docks, where the smell of half-rotten fish is as intense as the glare of the sun, you can see world trade in action. The sprawling port of Senegal's capital is the import-export hub for west Africa. Cheap, subsidised US rice, EU poultry and Italian tomatoes are unloaded from gantries for the local market, with sub-Saharan cotton and tropical fish are destined for Europe.<P>But the activity masks a crisis. In 2001 Senegal's economy was shrinking so fast it entered the WTO category of "least-developed country". Fishing brings in 25% of foreign earnings and represents one of Senegal's best hopes of export-led growth through trade. But Africans want the terms of that trade changed.<P><!--/beginimage/-->

        <!--/endimage/--> When trade talks started in Doha in 2001 it was promised that developed countries would cut farm subsidies and end the dumping of cheap foodstuffs, which undermines African agriculture, before expecting greater access to markets in poor countries. But Africans have low expectations for Hong Kong.<P>Like many trade experts Moussa Faye, a Senegalese delegate and ActionAid's regional director, fears Africa will lose its few advantages from previous deals without winning beneficial new terms and without the EU and the US making concessions on agriculture. "We have agreements for fishing between the EU and the west African economic zone," he says. "Now these will have to conform to WTO rules, so we have to grant more access to our markets. At the same time, with further liberalisation proposed, the preferences we have accessing the EU markets will be eroded."<P>Many least-developed countries can export to the EU freely, while Asian countries have to pay tariffs: 10% on fish, for example. As those tariffs are cut, Africa will be at a disadvantage. Asian energy costs are often cheaper, as are their labour costs - strong unions are a legacy of French colonialism. Mr Faye adds: "The EU wants us to liberalise access to our services in return for greater access to their markets but there will be other obstacles. They will impose non-tariff barriers such as hygiene on what we might want to export."<P>On the outer edge of Dakar's port, the Spanish multinational Vieirasa has its processing factory. Pass through security and you enter the world of such non-tariff barriers. Inside the chilled warehouse, workers in surgical whites and face masks prepare the most valuable species of fish for export to the EU. Sole, bream, monkfish, shrimp and tuna are sorted, washed gently in a machine and filleted, before being dipped in a chlorine solution and hermetically sealed for freighting to Europe.<P>However, about 60% of Senegal's fish exports remain unprocessed. They would command a much higher price if they could be exported after processing but the stainless steel plant and air-conditioning systems needed to meet EU standards are capital intensive, and it is foreign firms that can afford the investment. Aid agencies such as Oxfam and ActionAid argue that lack of infrastructure and capital will prevent African countries from exploiting liberalisation. Instead they will lose the ability to protect their fledgling industries.<P>The Senegalese government's director of industrial fishing, Dr Papa Namsa Keita, says: "Under WTO, there will still be barriers to trade, some of them based on prejudice. The EU imposes very draconian safety rules. Senegal invested millions to upgrade its own fish processing facilities to meet them. Two local tuna canning factories went out of business because of them. But even with all that investment, the price we got for fish was no higher."<P>African delegates to Hong Kong can see little ground being given by the EU and US on subsidies. Aid agencies have accused developed economies of cheating. Instead of cutting subsidies, they have shifted them from categories that the WTO says must be cut to those that may be retained because they help "development".<P>Senegal, like many African coastal countries, has already opened up its markets, cut tariffs, and sold fishing licences to the EU. It receives &pound;10.7m a year in return. Spanish and French trawlers now fish its waters, competing with locals for ever diminishing stocks. But the EU subsidises its fishing boats.<P>Papa Gora Ndiaye, a director at the Dakar-based international environmental and development organisation (Enda), says: "The EU fishing accords have a 'development' element that claims to help the development of poor countries while at the same time putting their own subsidised trawlers in unfair competition with our traditional artisan boats. It's a good way of escaping WTO restrictions."<P>Another priority for developing countries at the Doha talks was to end the developed world's dumping of subsidised goods at less than the cost of production. In 2003 the US paid $1.3bn (&pound;740m) to its producers for rice that cost $1.4bn to grow, enabling them to sell the crop at low prices. Senegalese farmers cannot compete.<P>Progress on subsidised dumping has been slow but even if it were stopped, it would be a double-edged sword. The subsidised imports have changed consumption patterns so that rice has now become the staple in Senegal. The same pattern of subsidies has undermined the country's tomato and poultry sectors. About 70% of the Senegal poultry industry has been lost in recent years as cheap EU chicken, fed subsidised grain, has undercut its prices. Ending subsidies would be good for Africa's agriculture in the long term, but in the short term it would raise food prices. Most of the poorest African countries are net food importers, says Mr Faye.<P>Pushing for export-led growth also risks compromising food security. Many in Senegal believe that the level of fishing by both local and foreign boats cannot be sustained. Yet the WTO talks take no account of environmental issues.<P>"The need for exports has led to an intense focus on certain types of fish and there has been a dramatic decline in numbers and weight of those species," says Papa Gora Ndiaye of Enda. "The factories set the sizes for what is acceptable. Lots are thrown away, sometimes as much as 75% of a catch. Both the EU boats and Senegalese boats are engaged in pirate fishing. It's become harder for poor people to buy the cheap small fish on which they depend."<P>Mar Mbaye's family have pushed their boats out from Kayar beach, just north of Dakar, for five generations. But the local fishermen now ration the number of trips each boat can make from the long strip of white sand.<P>"In the past, there were lots more fish and far fewer fishermen. Local fishermen are conscious of conservation. They don't take too much because it's their children's future, but others aren't. Industrial trawlers are excluded from certain zones, but they come anyway. EU boats have destroyed the seabed further up the coast. The pirogues &#91;boats&#93; cross the lines too when it's too crowded. We don't like these EU accords," he says.<P><b>FAQ Global trade talks</b><P><b>What are the talks all about?</b><P>Since 1948, countries have met for talks to remove barriers that inhibit free trade. Issues include tariffs which push up import costs, quotas on imports from a particular country and tough health standards that prevent goods entering. This round includes talks on agriculture, industrial tariffs, services, intellectual property rights and help for the poorest countries.<P><b>Why are they so important? </b><P>The consensus is that trade is good for growth, adding several hundred billions of dollars a year to the global economy, by some estimates. Countries which open up are richer than those that shut themselves away. But some say that since the industrial age dawned 250 years ago, countries have developed behind protective barriers until strong enough to liberalise. Recognition of this historical trend is included in the current talks, with the focus on the struggle between the rich and leading developing countries.<P><b>What difference can they make to the poorest countries?</b><P>Not much. The poorest states in Africa, for example, account for around 1% of world trade, down from 2% at the start of the 1960s. Many poor countries already have preferential access to the west for their commodities and a deal on agriculture may leave them worse off.<P><b>Who is running the show? </b><P>WTO decisions are based on two principles: unanimity and one member, one vote. In theory, it is possible for the smallest member to veto a deal. In practice, influence is proportional to power - the US and the EU are pivotal. But leading developing countries - the G20, led by Brazil, India and China - have become increasingly vociferous in defending the have-nots.<P><b>What happens if the talks fail?</b><P>There are three possibilities. Failure may act as a wake-up call, forcing WTO members to thrash out a better deal. Second, the deadline imposed by the end of the US fast-trade legislation, which means that after July 2007, Congress could unpick a deal rather than accepting or rejecting it outright, might lead to an acceptance of the lowest common denominator. The third possibility is that a breakdown would lead to a new era of protectionism.
