      <p>The head of CNN's news division, Eason Jordan, ignited an Internet firestorm 
        last week when he told a panel at a World Economic Forum gathering in 
        Davos, Switzerland, that the American military had targeted journalists 
        during operations in Iraq.</P>
      <P>Mr. Jordan, speaking in a panel discussion titled "Will Democracy Survive 
        the Media?" said "he knew of about 12 journalists who had not only been 
        killed by American troops, but had been targeted as a matter of policy," 
        said Rep. Barney Frank, a Democrat of Massachusetts who was on the panel 
        with Mr. Jordan.</P>
      <P>In an interview with The New York Sun, Mr. Frank said Mr. Jordan discussed 
        in detail the plight of an Al-Jazeera reporter who had been detained by 
        American forces, was made to eat his shoes while incarcerated in the Abu 
        Ghraib prison, and was repeatedly mocked by his interrogators as "Al-Jazeera 
        boy."</P>
      <P>A man who said he was a producer with Al-Jazeera at the network's headquarters 
        in Doha, Qatar, said he was unaware of any such incident, "although we 
        have had problems with American troops in and out of Iraq." The Al-Jazeera 
        producer refused to give his name.</P>
      <P>Mr. Jordan's comments - prompted by a broader discussion of the dangers 
        of covering the war in Iraq, in which some 63 journalists have been killed 
        - left Mr. Frank, usually an outspoken war opponent, speechless.</P>
      <P>"I was agog," he said. "I took a few seconds and asked him to basically 
        clarify the remarks. Did he have proof and if so, why hadn't CNN run with 
        the story?"</P>
      <P>A CNN spokeswoman did not return a phone call or e-mail seeking comment. 
        Last week, CNN put out a statement that said Mr. Jordan's remarks had 
        been taken out of context by several Web logs and that he was merely responding 
        to an assertion by Mr. Frank that the dead journalists were "collateral 
        damage."</P>
      <P>Mr. Frank denied that he used the phrase. The panel's moderator, Harvard 
        University professor and columnist David Gergen, did not return a call 
        seeking comment, but he told online columnist Michelle Malkin yesterday 
        that the remarks left him "startled."</P>
      <P>"It's contrary to history, which is so far the other way. Our troops 
        have gone out of their way to protect and rescue journalists," Mr. Gergen 
        said. He told Ms. Malkin that the remarks could have been due to Mr. Jordan's 
        recent return from Iraq, where he was likely "caught up in the tension 
        of what was happening there."</P>
      <P>The office of Senator Dodd, a Democrat of Connecticut who attended the 
        panel, released a statement that said he "was not on the panel but was 
        in the audience when Mr. Jordan spoke. He - like panelists Mr. Gergen 
        and Mr. Frank - was outraged by the comments. Senator Dodd is tremendously 
        proud of the sacrifice and service of our American military personnel."</P>
      <P>Within minutes of making the comments, Mr. Frank said, CNN's Mr. Jordan 
        began to immediately "pull back" on the assertion that 12 journalists 
        had been killed by American forces. He instead focused on the deaths of 
        two reporters killed when a missile fired from an American jet struck 
        the 15th floor of Baghdad's Palestine hotel, where many reporters and 
        film crews stay when in Baghdad.</P>
      <P>Mr. Frank said he tried to get information out of Mr. Jordan so that 
        he could forward it to the appropriate congressional investigative authorities. 
        " I think Congress has demonstrated with Abu Ghraib that we will aggressively 
        pursue reasonable allegations," he said. Mr. Frank said he has tried repeatedly 
        over the past few days to get Mr. Jordan to provide evidence of crimes 
        against journalists. He said Mr. Jordan promised to get back to him, "but 
        I haven't heard anything yet," Mr. Frank said.</P>
      <P>This is not the first time that Mr. Jordan has spoken critically of the 
        American military's conduct toward journalists. In November, he reportedly 
        told a gathering of global news executives in Portugal called News Xchange 
        that he believed journalists had been arrested and tortured by American 
        forces.</P>
      <P>And in October 2002, at a News Xchange conference, he accused the Israeli 
        military of deliberately targeting CNN personnel "on numerous occasions."</P>
      <P>Mr. Jordan's remarks might have shocked the American attendees, but they 
        certainly played well among some in the audience. The Wall Street Journal's 
        Bret Stephens, who covered the panel for his paper, told the Sun that 
        after the panel concluded, Mr. Jordan was surrounded by European and Middle 
        Eastern attendees who warmly congratulated him for his alleged "bravery 
        and candor" in discussing the matter.</P>
      <P>Mr. Stephens broke the news of Mr. Jordan's statements for his paper's 
        "political diary" blog.</P>
      <P>Since then, some blogs have made Mr. Jordan's remarks a rallying cry 
        for conservatives who have long harbored an animus against CNN for an 
        alleged anti-American bias.</P>
      <P>Radio host and blogger Hugh Hewitt has turned his well-trafficked blog 
        into a clearinghouse of information on what he called "Easongate."</P>
      <P>It would be a "pretty grave mistake on the part of CNN" if they failed 
        to take into account the power of blogs to refocus popular opinion, said 
        Mr. Hewitt, citing the popular outcry against CBS News's report on purported 
        gaps in President Bush's 1970s Texas Air National Guard service. "You 
        would think that they would learn their lesson."</P>
