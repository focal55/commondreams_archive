<p>Gap clothes chain, best-known for selling cargo pants and T-shirts to the nation's youth, has been accused of encouraging children to slaughter Britain's butterflies. </p>
<p>The company has put up posters and window displays in Gap Kids stores, telling children how to make nets used to catch butterflies for a "summer adventure".</p>
<p>Conservationists fear that the campaign will lead to a revival of the long-discouraged practice of killing butterflies to display in collectors' boxes.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Butterfly Conservation, a Dorset-based charity, was appalled by the prospect of thousands of net-wielding children charging across the British countryside with murder in mind.</p>
<p>He said: "Butterflies are in danger across the British Isles - even the most common species are now under threat. We condemn anyone encouraging the killing and collecting of butterflies.</p>
<p>"Even if you do not kill them, catching butterflies with a net can harm them if you do not know how to use a net properly. Butterflies are very delicate and if we were to encourage people to catch them we would ensure they were properly trained."</p>
<p>He said that a safer option "and one we encourage" was to take photographs of butterflies with digital cameras.</p>
<p>Nick Greatorex-Davies, a lepidopterist with the Butterfly Monitoring Scheme - which records British butterfly populations - agreed. </p>
<p>He said: "Thousands of kids running around with nets could cause some harm. It is inappropriate to encourage children to kill butterflies.</p>
<p>''It would be much more sensible for them to take pictures. The main problem is environmental destruction but once people become collectors they can put endangered species under threat which can often be the last straw."</p>
<p>Displays in the windows of Gap Kids feature child-sized mannequins waving butterfly nets, with colorful fabric butterflies caught in them. A poster behind each display reads: "Summer adventure. How to make your own butterfly net."</p>
<p>A spokesman for Gap said that the campaign, which includes lists of the materials needed to craft a net, was not intended to encourage children to catch butterflies, only to make the nets. </p>
<p>He said: "It is part of a summer campaign aimed at encouraging children to use their imaginations." </p>
<p>Other elements included urging children to send messages in bottles, he added.</p>
<p>Gap has worked hard to cultivate its politically correct, environmentally friendly image around the globe by joining the US Environmental Protection Agency's Climate Leaders program.</p>
<p>The San Francisco-based company brags on its website that it saves energy and reduces greenhouse gas emissions by recycling and using low-mercury fluorescent lamps in its stores.</p>
<p>The website reads: "We understand the importance of protecting the environment and preserving it for future generations, and we're committed to continually improving and expanding our environmental practices." </p>
<p>Butterfly numbers have declined seriously since the early 1900s. Five of Britain's 59 butterfly species have become extinct and at least half the remaining ones are under threat, according to Butterfly Conservation.</p>
<p>The most endangered species is the High Brown Fritillary - which has declined by </p>
<p>94 per cent since the 1950s. Even common species are far less abundant, because their breeding areas have been severely reduced.</p>
<p>Intensive farming and forestry have led to the destruction of meadows, hedgerows and ancient woodland - crucial habitats for butterflies and other wildlife.</p>
<p>As butterfly populations have declined, naturalists have adopted a voluntary code of conduct that limits collectors to catching a maximum of four of each species of butterflies - two male and two female.</p>
<p>It also requires lepidopterists to keep records of all insects captured and killed, and restricts the number and locations from which they can be taken. </p>
<p>Gap has 3,010 stores in the United States, Britain, Canada, France and Japan, and also owns Banana Republic and Old Navy stores.</p>
<p>Last year it had global sales of &pound;8.9 billion.</p>
