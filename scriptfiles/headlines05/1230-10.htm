strike at the U.S. naval base at Cuba&#39;s Guantanamo Bay has more
than doubled in the past week, the U.S. military said.          </p>
       <p> Forty-six detainees joined existing hunger strikers on Dec.
25, to bring the total number of prisoners refusing food to 84,
the military said yesterday on the Southern Command&#39;s Web site.
That&#39;s about a sixth of the internment center&#39;s inmates.          </p>

       <p> The military said the detainees are trying to put pressure
on the U.S. to release them. Detainees&#39; lawyers have said the
hunger strikers are protesting their continued detention without
trial and conditions at the base.          </p>
       <p> Some former detainees have said they were abused at the
prison. Human rights groups have criticized interrogation
procedures there, and the U.S. Supreme Court is due to hear
arguments on whether detainees can be tried by military
tribunals.          </p>
       <p> ``The number of detainees engaged in the current fast,
which began on August 8, 2005, routinely fluctuates,&#39;&#39; the
military said in the statement. ``Since then, increases in the
number of fasters have coincided with the anniversary of the
September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and the scheduled arrival
of defense attorneys representing certain detainees.&#39;&#39;          </p>

       <p> The statement did not explain why the new batch of
detainees chose Dec. 25 to join the protest, nor did it give
information on the physical condition of those refusing food
since August.          </p>
       <p> <b>Taliban </b> </p>
       <p> The U.S. holds 505 detainees at Guantanamo, some of them
captured after the U.S. ousted Afghanistan&#39;s Taliban regime
following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Many have been held for
more than three years without charge. While detainees&#39; lawyers
have sought their trial or release, the U.S. says they are
``enemy combatants&#39;&#39; and that their detention is necessary as
part of the campaign against terrorism.          </p>

       <p> Detainees are considered to be on a hunger strike after
they miss nine consecutive meals, according to the U.S.
military. Medical staff then monitor the weight loss and
physical condition of the strikers.          </p>
       <p> ``This technique (hunger striking) is consistent with al-
Qaeda training and reflects detainee attempts to elicit media
attention and bring pressure on the United States Government to
release them,&#39;&#39; the U.S. military said. ``Enemy combatants on
voluntary fast are closely monitored by medical professionals,
receive excellent medical care, and when required, the
appropriate amount of daily nutrition and hydration through
enteral feeding,&#39;&#39; or tubes inserted through the nose and into
the stomach.          </p>
       <p> <b>Military Tribunals </b> </p>
       <p> The Supreme Court on Nov. 7 said it will hear arguments on
whether President George W. Bush&#39;s administration is permitted
to use military tribunals to try terrorism suspects held at
Guantanamo. A date for the hearing hasn&#39;t been set.          </p>

       <p> Military tribunals don&#39;t offer all the rights afforded to
other U.S. criminal defendants. They permit exclusion of the
accused from parts of the proceeding, allow witness statements
in place of sworn testimony, and direct appeals to either the
defense secretary or president, according to lawyers for Yemeni
national Salim Ahmed Hamdan, who brought the case to the high
court.          </p>
       <p> The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in July
ruled 3-0 that Congress authorized the president to set up
military tribunals when lawmakers approved the use of force to
fight terrorism following the Sept. 11 attacks.          </p>
       <p> The court also said the Geneva Convention on the treatment
of prisoners of war isn&#39;t enforceable in federal court and
doesn&#39;t apply to al-Qaeda members.</p>
