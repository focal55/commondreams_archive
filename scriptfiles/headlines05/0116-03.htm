<p> To show their disgust with George W. Bush's re-election, on 
Inauguration Day, his opponents will turn their back on his motorcade, "refuse 
to spend one dime," black out their Web sites, stage mock jazz funerals, wear 
black armbands and stage demonstrations from Palo Alto to Atlanta. 
<P>But four years of such Bush-bashing theatrics didn't produce a change in 
November. And with Republicans controlling Congress and the White House, some 
of the president's most vocal critics have spent the past two post-election 
months making plans on how to begin preaching beyond the choir box, starting 
Thursday.
<P>Bottom line: less emphasis on mass demonstrations  --  which Bush 
famously dismissed as "focus groups"  --  and more on reaching out to 
Americans who oppose the war but haven't publicly shown it.
<P>"We've got to start reaching out to people who don't agree with us," said 
Leslie Cagan, United for Peace's national coordinator. In its recent short-
term plan, the 850-organization umbrella behind many of the nation's larger 
protests over the past few years conceded that "the anti-war movement must 
reshape its work."
<P>While the Inauguration Day protest coverage will undoubtedly focus on 
made-for-TV flourishes and mad-as-hell gestures, some of the larger anti-war 
and progressive organizations say they have realized that just being against 
Bush isn't enough anymore. 
<P>"The resistance has to be issue-based," said Aimara Lin, national 
coordinator of Not in Our Name, another major anti-war organization that has 
done a lot of soul-searching since the election. "The movement needs to reach 
outside the normal groups of people we usually touch and bring in people who 
feel the same way, but are too fearful to say so."
<P>That includes corralling the energy of the people behind the Inauguration 
Day protests.
<P>"If they're going to go beyond the personal satisfaction of, 'I dissed 
the president and it made me feel good,' they're going to have to talk to many 
more people and give them something  different to think about," said Shaun 
Bowler, professor of political science at UC Riverside and an expert on direct 
democracy.
<P>"You can listen to Pacifica Radio, check out the Bay Area papers or the 
(British) Guardian, and watch 'Fahrenheit 9/11' and 'The Daily Show,' and 
that's great," Bowler said. "But after everyone whips themselves up into an 
outrage, all they have talked to is their fellow travelers."
<P>In the most detailed way in its three-year history, United for Peace is 
committing to paper its organizing plans, using neighbor-to-neighbor 
connections reminiscent of how Republicans turned out their base in the 
presidential election. Its "Winter/Spring Organizing Drive" plan encourages 
its smaller member groups to "make three new relationships" with organizations 
and communities not previously involved in anti-war work. Big-city 
organizations should connect with a dozen.
<P>The group just hired the Rev. Osagyefo Sekou, a Pentecostal minister in 
New York, to lead its outreach effort to places United for Peace believes will 
be critical to reaching a wider audience: the nation's churches, synagogues 
and mosques. 
<P>In the next few weeks, Sekou will release what he calls a kit to help 
religious leaders craft Sunday sermons against the war, form anti-war groups 
among their followers and preach to children.
<P>"We need to break the monopoly on 'God talk' the religious right has in 
this country," Sekou said.
<P>After the election, national organizers from Not in Our Name, an anti-war 
group with offices in Oakland, convened for a postmortem. Afterward, they 
acknowledged to members that "surely, the goal expressed by all was the need 
of resistance  to break outside the anti-war 'movement.' " 
<P>The challenge: Of Not in Our Name's 10 chapters, only two are located in 
states that went for Bush in November.
<P>"We've talked about getting into more of the red states, but right now, 
we don't have a lot of people on the ground there," said Lin of Not in Our 
Name. "But we've been hearing a lot more from them since the election. And 
when people from the red states call, they get special attention."

<P>Two other constituencies will be actively courted, said United for 
Peace's Cagan and other anti-war leaders: returning Iraq war veterans and 
military families. Activists will help returning vets speak to military 
support groups, as well as to the media. 
<P>"They are key," University of San Francisco political science Professor 
Stephen Zunes, an expert on social movements, said of veterans and their 
families. "They can go into a lot of places where many activists can't go."
<P>To expand the number of anti-war supporters, Zunes and other progressive 
writers suggest that activists make inroads to sympathetic politicians, 
particularly conservatives.
<P>Writing in the progressive Web site Alternet, Erik Leaver, policy 
director at the Institute for Policy Studies in Washington, urged activists to 
"work with (anti-war) folks across the political spectrum, including Rep. 
Howard Coble." The conservative North Carolina Republican recently said it was 
time to start pondering a phased U.S. withdrawal from Iraq.
<P>But Coble might not be a totally sympathetic ear. 
<P>"The congressman never said he was against the war or that it was a bad 
idea to invade," said Coble's chief of staff Ed McDonald. "Sure, he'd be 
willing to sit down and talk with anybody, but he's not interested in working 
with any of the groups who are coming to Washington to say things against the 
president."
<P>Some anti-war activists, however, such as San Francisco resident Marvin 
Feldman, have little time for politicians  --  even liberal ones. 
<P>"We're not going to be working with the Democrats anymore," said Feldman, 
a coordinator with United for Peace and Justice Bay Area. "We feel let down 
that the Democrats ran such a wimpy campaign" and didn't more forcefully 
oppose the war, he said. 
<P>Instead, the organization will concentrate on reaching out to unions, 
religious congregations and organizations in communities of color. 
<P>Such disagreement among left-leaning organizations and interest groups 
isn't new. 
<P>Richard Becker, an organizer with International ANSWER, which is 
organizing an Inauguration Day rally in San Francisco's Civic Center, said, 
"The question is, can we find a way to look at each other and see that each of 
our particular issues is really deeply connected?''
<P>As some progressives ponder how to unify their message during Bush's 
second term, others will begin the sniping on Inauguration Day.
<P>Progressive leaders acknowledge that to some on the left, there is a 
cathartic benefit from such gestures as Turn Your Back on Bush, in which 
protesters will turn away from the president along the motorcade route.
<P>One of the organizers of Not One Damn Dime Day, which urges people not to 
spend any money Thursday, acknowledged that there's no way to measure its 
effect. 
<P>Jesse Gordon, an activist in Cambridge, Mass., who has assumed the role 
of spokesman for the Internet-spread campaign even though he doesn't know who 
started it, said seeing a one-day dip on the country's economic output isn't 
necessarily the campaign's primary goal.
<P>"People want a way to make their voices heard," Gordon said. He plans to 
use the thousands of e-mails he's received to begin a mailing list of like-
minded souls that he can tap into for future political mobilizations. 
<P>Similar plans have been laid by the Detroit-based organizer of Black-
Thursday.com, which is touting a no-work-on-Inauguration Day campaign, and 
Citizens Take Charge, which is organizing a one-day gasoline boycott out of 
Orlando, Fla..

<P>"When people go out and do something like this, it feels good," said 
Elizabeth Morgan, co-founder of Citizens Take Charge. However, of the 10 
boycott captains lined up for Thursday's inaugural boycott, only two are in 
red states.
<P>"But after this, look," Morgan said, "we've got to reach out beyond where 
we're at."
