<p>WASHINGTON  --
To hear Tom DeLay tell it, his indictment last week by a Texas grand jury 
resulted from a vast left-wing conspiracy  --  the culmination of years of 
relentless pursuit by Democrats who, in DeLay's words, "drug my name through 
the mud."

Democrats, of course, brushed aside the accusation, saying Delay, a Texas 
Republican, had only himself to blame for the conspiracy charge that forced him 
to step aside as the House majority leader. 
<P>But in fact an extensive network of forces has been aligned against DeLay  
--  a kaleidoscope of activists and liberals, clean-government advocates and 
legal experts, even a smattering of resentful conservatives and Republican 
moderates, all bound by their desire to see him stopped. 
<P>Some have launched daily blogs devoted to the House leader, rented 
billboard ads denouncing him and mobilized phone banks to spread the word. 
Others have staged protests and written opinion pieces. A few have invoked his 
name to recruit Democratic candidates  --  one, predictably, in his Texas 
district, but many more in other parts of the country, where the DeLay name has 
slowly become Democratic code for Republican corruption after many months of a 
public relations campaign with that very goal in mind. 
<P>Whether the roaring anti-DeLay machine deserves even partial credit  --  
or blame  --  for his tumble last week is up for debate. DeLay has painted the 
veteran Democratic prosecutor in the case, Ronnie Earle, as a partisan fanatic, 
while Earle's defenders say he is an evenhanded seeker of justice. The grand 
jury Earle convened brought a count of conspiracy against DeLay alleging that 
he funneled illegal corporate contributions to Republican candidates for the 
Texas Legislature in 2002. 
<P>Regardless of how the criminal case unfolds, it is clear that Delay's 
persona has produced a cottage industry of forces that trace his every step and 
draw negative public attention to it. 
<P>"I think it's entirely his own undoing, but the good-government groups 
definitely decided to focus on him," said Tom Matzzie, the Washington director 
of the liberal organization MoveOn, which spent hundreds of thousands of 
dollars running advertisements against DeLay and for his current Democratic 
opponent. 
<P>Or from a different perspective: "The anti-DeLay groups are sore losers  
--  or 'Soros losers' as we call them," said Barbara Comstock, a former 
spokeswoman at the Justice Department under President Bush who has been active 
in Delay's defense, referring to the billionaire George Soros, who contributes 
heavily to Democratic causes, including MoveOn. 

<P>Exactly how much money has been spent by partisan donors to drive DeLay 
from power is difficult to determine. Even the Republican National Committee 
and prominent Republican opposition researchers do not put a precise figure on 
it, although House Republicans did launch a drive earlier this year to link 
anti-DeLay groups to prominent Democratic donors. 
<P>According to the Washington newspaper the Hill, the Republican National 
Committee issued talking points in March that accused four independent watchdog 
groups, including Democracy 21 and Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in 
Washington, known as CREW, of having "close ties to left-wing leaders like 
George Soros." 
<P>Perhaps the most famously zealous Ahab in pursuit of DeLay's resignation 
is David Donnelly, the national campaign director for the Public Campaign 
Action Fund, a nonprofit organization with an adjoining political committee 
that has devoted its efforts to tracking the House leader. Its heavily 
trafficked Web log, the "<a href="http://dailydelay.blogspot.com/" target="_new">Daily DeLay</a>," compiles negative articles about DeLay's 
activities. It spent some $200,000 in his district in the 2004 campaign, 
according to Donnelly, and has circulated an online petition demanding that 
DeLay quit. 
<P>Although the often-attacked Soros has not donated money directly to the 
Public Campaign Action Fund (his financing went to an affiliated but separate 
organization, the Public Campaign), other reliably Democratic entities have 
made such donations, including the MoveOn.org Voter Fund, which gave $150,000 
in 2004, according to the Web site of the Center for Responsive Politics. 
<P>Over all, Soros' Open Society Institute has given at least $12,274,388 
toward campaign-finance reform efforts in the last eight years, according to 
the same site. That money has contributed to his status as a favored culprit 
for Republicans seeking to identify the source of the anti-DeLay effort. 
<P>Another popular Republican target is CREW, which has doggedly monitored 
the ethics allegations against DeLay. Although CREW says it is nonpartisan, its 
director, Melanie Sloan, was once a lawyer for House Democrats. 
<P>The alignment of clean-campaign organizations and Democratic partisans "is 
something that's been very consistently done over the years, and these are 
groups that certainly cross-pollinate," said Comstock, now a principal at the 
Blank Rome government relations firm. "There's certainly a very strong 
over-arching theme here  --  to go after Tom." 
<P>On the contrary, the watchdog groups say. When the Democrats were in 
power, they faced similar scrutiny. "It just happens to be that the Republicans 
are in power in Washington now," Donnelly said. "We find ourselves being 
critical of those who are in power because money flows to them." 
<P>DeLay's claim of a witch hunt is also muddied by his conservative critics. 
The editorial board of the Wall Street Journal has not been a fan, nor has the 
editor of National Review, Rich Lowry, who said DeLay had become "too 
comfortable with the perks of power." 
<P>Yet, neither the Journal nor Lowry seem to enjoy themselves as much as the 
anti-DeLay groups, which have launched lively campaigns that ridicule DeLay in 
his own district, in Washington and nationally. Democracy for America, a New 
England group run by Howard Dean's brother Jim, posted billboards in Texas 
mocking DeLay's golf trip with Jack Abramoff, the Republican lobbyist. 
<P>Campaign for America's Future, a progressive group best known for its work 
on the mustier subject of Social Security, ran a $75,000 advertising campaign 
after DeLay's controversial involvement in the case of Terri Schiavo, the 
Florida woman taken off life support earlier this year. 
<P>Last week, the group posted a picture of DeLay on its Web site under the 
red-lettered headline, "Indicted."
