On Monday, Paul and Colette Divine were in a car that blocked the path of trucks hauling the cars to Arizona to be destroyed, police said. Both women were booked on suspicion of failing to obey an officer, police Lt. William Berry said. They were released on their own recognizance and were scheduled to be arraigned Tuesday.

<P>A call to Paul, who played Stephanie Holden on the TV series, wasn't immediately returned Monday night.

<P>Paul and Divine were among dozens of electric car supporters holding an around-the-clock vigil outside a General Motors Corp. training center in Burbank, where more than 70 EV1s had been stored en route to a recycling plant near Mesa, Ariz.

<P>"The one thing they (Paul and Divine) asked to relay to media was that it was a very peaceful act and they are very committed to saving these cars," said organizer Chelsea Sexton, a former GM employee responsible for promoting the EV1. Sexton now advises environmental groups and automakers on alternate-fuel vehicles.

<P>GM, which says the cars never became popular enough to turn a profit, has declined the group's offer to pay $1.9 million for the vehicles. The company said the cars must be destroyed because there isn't enough supply of the car's 2,000 parts. That could make the vehicles unsafe and lead to lawsuits, GM contends.

<P>The group, which includes environmentalists, technology enthusiasts and entertainment industry workers, said the monthlong vigil would continue.

<P>Police said Paul and Divine were in a car that blocked the center's driveway for two hours as trucks loaded with EV1s were attempting to leave.

<P>Four trucks hauled away 28 EV1s after the driveway was cleared, said GM spokesman Dave Barthmuss.
