<p>Doctors at the asylum are not sure at what point in the past decade their patient was subjected to severe torture by electric shock, but they are certain that it destroyed his mental health for ever.

<P>Dressed in a woman's skiing jacket and tattered longjohns, Hasan Jawad, a former fighter pilot, is the self-appointed spokesman for the 60 patients in the Herat institution.

<P>He speaks English, French and German - sometimes simultaneously - and harbors the illusion that he is a member of staff rather than a patient.

<P>"They never pay me my salary," he complains often. His moods are unpredictable and his thoughts hopelessly scrambled. "My father is dead, my brothers are dead," he says, becoming anxious.

<P>Sometimes he sings and dances, other times he is angry. "I killed almost a thousand Taliban," he shouts. "I am a Talib killer."

<P>Patients at the Marestoon mental asylum, which lies in a quiet residential suburb of the north-western Afghan city of Herat, occupy the central courtyard, some staring vacantly, others shouting or rocking incessantly back and forth. Some are chained to walls or each other, or have hands or feet manacled. Some eat the grass or their clothing.

<P>Herat suffered heavy fighting during two decades of war and is one of the most mined areas of Afghanistan; 20,000 of its citizens were killed in a single Soviet bombing raid in 1979, shortly after the Red Army invaded.

<P>Since the restoration of a fragile peace with the eviction of the Taliban by a US-led coalition in 2001, the scale of the psychological damage to the country's people has become evident. Afghanistan is facing a mental health crisis on a massive scale and is hopelessly ill-equipped.

<P>There is only one 50-bed psychiatric hospital and one native psychiatrist working in the entire country, which has five asylums offering only basic care.

<P>According to a United Nations study, the Afghanistan National Human Development Report, an estimated 30 per cent of the population is suffering symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

<P>Doctors say some people have had their mental balance disturbed by the shockwaves from explosions, others have seen the death of family members or are overcome with guilt at crimes they committed and expected divine punishment.

<P>"Around 80 per cent of the people we see are women," said Dr Zalmay Jhan, one of four doctors with any mental health training in Herat. He has 200 patients registered.

<P>"Men tend to suppress their problems in our society and they get support from networks of old comrades. Women can be isolated.

<P>"We see indirect effects from the war in high levels of domestic violence, particularly against children."

<P>Dr Sayed Azimi, of the World Health Organisation, said: "My conclusion is that 20 to 30 per cent of the population is suffering a psychiatric disorder. Add those who have some psycho-social problems that interfere with their daily lives and it is 30 to 40 per cent."

<P>The UN report quotes a survey among women in Kabul, the capital which saw devastating street fighting during the civil war of the 1990s. It reported that 98 per cent met the diagnostic criteria for PTSD, major depression or severe anxiety.

<P>In a country with life expectancy of 44.5 years and rates of mortality to preventable diseases among the highest in the world, mental health competes with many pressing needs.

<P>"This is an immense problem we face," said Dr Shokoh Mand, of the public health ministry.

<P>"All the ministry of health's effort has been focused on curative medicine, mental health has been forgotten until now. No one is trained in this field.

<P>"We would like to improve this situation, but how?"
