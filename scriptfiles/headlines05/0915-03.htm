<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --> <p>WASHINGTON - 	The Environmental Protection Agency's new rules on human testing, which 
the agency said last week would categorically protect children and pregnant 
women from pesticide testing, include numerous exemptions,  such as one that 
specifically allows testing of children who have been "abused and neglected." 
<P>The rules were revised under intense criticism from environmental groups, 
scientists and members of Congress after the disclosure that subjects in some 
earlier pesticide studies were unaware of what they were being exposed to and, 
in many cases, did not know why the testing was being done. 
<P>One study would have used $2 million from the chemical industry to measure 
the pesticide consumption of infants in low-income households in Florida. 
<P>In unveiling the new rules last week, the EPA promised full protection for 
those most at risk of unethical testing. 
<P>"We regard as unethical and would never conduct, support, require or 
approve any study involving intentional exposure of pregnant women, infants or 
children to a pesticide," the rule states. 
<P>But within the 30 pages of rules are clear-cut exceptions that permit:
<P>
<ul>
<li>Testing of "abused or neglected" children without permission from 
parents or guardians.<br>
</li>
<li>"Ethically deficient" human research if it is considered crucial to 
"protect public health."<br>
</li>
<li>More than minimal health risk to a subject if there is a "direct 
benefit" to the child being tested, and the parents or guardians agree.<br>
</li>
<li>EPA acceptance of overseas industry studies, which often are performed 
in countries that have minimal or no ethical standards for testing, as long as 
the tests are not done directly for the EPA.</li>
</ul>
<P>The EPA provided little clarification this week in response to questions 
about the exemptions. In a written response, officials said that abused and 
neglected children were specifically singled out to create "additional 
protection" for them, although they did not elaborate. 
<P>They also denied there were any exceptions to the prohibitions on testing 
women and children. They added that the new rules met all the requirements set 
by Congress last spring and summer in a series of often heated hearings.
