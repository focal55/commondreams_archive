<p>WASHINGTON -- Roughly two years ago, <a href="http://jones.house.gov/" target="_new">Rep. Walter Jones</a> led the campaign to rename french fries, turning "freedom fries" into a symbol of protest over France's opposition to the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq.
<p>
On Thursday, the North Carolina congressman introduced legislation calling on President Bush to begin withdrawing U.S. forces from Iraq by the autumn of 2006.<p>

<!--/endimage/-->The evolution of Jones' position on the war has drawn international attention. It also has stirred hard feelings in Jones' sprawling Eastern North Carolina district, which is home to thousands of troops.<p>

In Onslow County, home to the Camp Lejeune Marine Corps base, a county commissioner initially called on Jones to resign but later said he just wanted Jones to drop requests for a timetable for withdrawal.
<p>John R. McLaughlin, a Republican commissioner from Jacksonville, said Thursday that he was astounded when he heard that Jones had called for a timetable.<p>
"Such a statement would provide encouragement to our enemy and be harmful to our troops," said McLaughlin, a former Army Ranger.<p>
The five-member Board Of Commissioners, all Republicans, will consider a resolution Monday that calls on Jones to drop his efforts.<p>
The Carteret County News-Times in Morehead City said in an editorial Wednesday that it had supported Jones in the past but called his stance on the war a "gift to terrorists."<p>
On Thursday, Jones joined two Democratic congressmen and another Republican House member to introduce a resolution calling on President Bush to announce by year's end a plan for withdrawal.<p>
The four co-sponsors acknowledged that the Republicans who control the House, Senate and White House do not support their idea. But they predicted their resolution would spur a public dialogue that could force Bush to outline an exit strategy.<p>
"The American people are going to contact their member of Congress and say, 'Please, look at this resolution,' " Jones said.<p>

Bush has said a timetable would do more harm than good, and White House spokesman Scott McClellan echoed that position at a briefing Thursday with reporters. "This message would say to the terrorists, 'All you have to do is wait until that day when our troops leave, and then you can start carrying out those attacks,' and, 'Just hold out,' " McClellan said.<p>
At the same time, the administration seemed to be acknowledging that public sentiment is at a tipping point. McClellan said the president planned to focus more of his public remarks on the situation in Iraq in the coming weeks and would meet next week in Washington with Iraqi Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari.<p>
A recent Gallup poll shows nearly six in 10 Americans want at least a partial withdrawal to begin.<p>
The resolution by Jones and three of his colleagues calls on Bush to begin executing the withdrawal by Oct. 1, 2006. It does not set an end date. Even if the resolution were adopted, it would be only a recommendation to the president.<p>
The other co-sponsors are Rep. Neil Abercrombie, D-Hawaii; Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, a retired Air Force flight surgeon; and Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio, who ran unsuccessfully for his party's nomination for president last year.<p>
The congressmen spoke Thursday of what has been accomplished to date: the ouster of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, the holding of elections and the training of Iraqi security forces.<p>
They also spoke of the costs of the war and the insurgency that has followed -- more than 1,700 U.S. soldiers dead and $200 billion spent. And they highlighted what they see as other pressing concerns: a nuclear threat from North Korea, jobs lost to China, security on the border with Mexico.<p>
Rep. Howard Coble, a Republican from Greensboro, floated the idea of a timetable in January but chose not to immediately sign on to the resolution.<p>
Coble said Thursday that he needs more time to decide whether it is the right way to proceed. "I don't like to jump into the fire before I see how hot it is," he said.<p>

Jones is feeling the heat from his constituents.<p>
He went public with his intentions Sunday on ABC's "This Week." Since then, he said, about as many of his constituents have accused him of being disloyal to the president or the troops as have applauded his efforts.<p>
Austin M. "Gus" Wilgus, a member of the executive committee of the Carteret County Republican Party, said calling for a timetable could hurt the war effort.<p>
"I truly believe the insurgency in Iraq will use Congressman Jones' position," said Wilgus, a retired Army lieutenant colonel who served in Vietnam.<p>
Marine Cpl. David Grubb, 23, a veteran of combat tours in Afghanistan and Iraq, said the military, not politicians, should determine when forces should leave.<p>
He said the United States is trying to do something good in a country that is not stable, and that takes time. Setting a timetable "sounds like the Vietnam-era conflict coming back all over again," Grubb said.<p>
State GOP Chairman Ferrell Blount of Pitt County said he thought the news media had misinterpreted Jones' remarks, when all he was calling for was "a public discussion of where we are going in Iraq."<p>
"I think there have been a lot of people who didn't exactly understand what Walter meant," Blount said. "There is no one in Congress more supportive of our troops and our military families than Walter Jones."<p>
Jones said he is not concerned about the political implications of his position.<p>

"If doing what's right means I don't return to Congress," he said, "then it's God's will."
