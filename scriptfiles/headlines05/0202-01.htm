<p>After a year of near-constant revelations and allegations, the 
controversy over the use of torture in the war on terror is reaching its 
crucial moment in the Senate debate over whether to confirm Alberto Gonzales 
as attorney general. If Gonzales is confirmed, which appears likely, the Bush 
administration is likely to claim that Congress has given a firm mandate for 
its interrogation policies, just as President Bush said his re-election 
victory in November was a new mandate for his policies on Iraq.

<!--/endimage/-->"People who wanted a public discussion of this issue of interrogation 
methods have had it, for almost a year now," said John Yoo, a UC Berkeley law 
professor who played a key role in helping craft the administration's policies 
on torture when he was a Justice Department official from 2001 to 2003.
<P>"There has been debate, press leaks, hearings. Sen. (John) Kerry could 
have attacked President Bush on torture during the election campaign, but in 
fact, he tried to outflank the president on the right on terrorism. Congress 
could have expanded the statute on terrorism to tighten interrogation rules, 
but it hasn't. The election and the confirmation of Gonzales are a sign of 
general support of the administration's anti-terrorism policies, which include 
interrogation and the Patriot Act."
<P>Many human rights advocates, however, say the confirmation would 
encourage further abuse by U.S. forces. 
<P>"It would send the wrong signal, it would say that Abu Ghraib-style 
abuses are to be winked at," said Avidan Cover, a lawyer for Human Rights 
First, a New York legal group, referring to the Iraqi prison that sparked 
worldwide outrage when abuses there were revealed last May.
<P>The debate hinges on three questions: When does interrogation cross the 
line into torture? How much pain and suffering is acceptable? And are the 
international treaties that bar harsh tactics not applicable to U.S. forces 
abroad? Although the subject of torture may seem simple, the public debate 
over Gonzales has been obscured by a thick tangle of legal briefs, 
international treaties and Bush administration secrecy. The exact 
interrogation methods used by U.S. forces abroad  --  and especially the CIA, 
which is reputed to use the harshest tactics  --  are unclear. Administration 
officials have refused to say exactly what methods are being used, and in his 
Senate testimony in recent weeks, Gonzales repeatedly declined to answer 
senators' questions about these methods.
<P>Amid the silence and confusion, the issue has mostly been played out in 
the media. A string of Abu Ghraib exposes by investigative reporter Seymour 
Hersh has prompted a belated flurry of investigations and prosecutions of low-
level U.S. military prison guards.
<P>A similar controversy is now brewing for Michael Chertoff, the nominee 
for homeland security secretary. On Tuesday, White House officials confirmed a 
recent New York Times report that Chertoff, as a Justice Department official, 
had advised the CIA on how far its interrogators could go without violating 
the federal anti-torture statute.
<P>Tom Malinowski, advocacy director of Human Rights Watch in Washington, 
notes that the administration responded to the scandals by issuing new 
interrogation rules in December that are much more restrictive than previous 
standards espoused by Gonzales and the Pentagon. But these new standards apply 
only to the U.S. military, not the CIA, he adds.
<P>"The CIA is still a black hole, and we don't know exactly what standards 
it is using," said Malinowski. However, he noted that several media reports  -- not denied by the administration  --  have indicated the CIA is using the 
following tactics, many of which were used in Abu Ghraib:
<P>
 <ul>
  <li>Forced nudity and sexual situations (intended to violate Muslims' 
 moral codes).</li>
  <li>Use of unmuzzled dogs to threaten prisoners.</li>
  <li>Exposure to extremes of hot and cold.</li>
 <li>Sleep deprivation (keeping prisoners awake for many days at a time).</li>
  <li>Use of stress positions (binding in contorted or painful stances for 
 long periods, or forced standing in one place).</li>
  <li>Water-boarding (tying the prisoner to a board and either dunking him 
 in water or suffocating him with a soaking wet cloth, repeatedly to the point 
 of near-drowning).</li>
</ul>
<P>"These practices are designed to seem innocuous, to not leave physical 
scars on the prisoner, even though in fact they induce tremendous amounts of 
pain," said Malinowski. "They have been adopted from notorious dictatorships 
elsewhere." 
<P>The key document in the case against Gonzales is a memo he wrote Bush on 
Jan. 25, 2002, advising that the Geneva Conventions were inapplicable to 
captured members of al Qaeda or other suspected terrorists detained abroad. 
<P>Gonzales' legal finding reversed long-standing U.S. policy and military 
code, and it came to govern U.S. military interrogations in the ensuing two 
years  --  the same period as abuses at Abu Ghraib and by U.S. forces in 
Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. A Pentagon-appointed committee headed by 
former Defense Secretary James Schlesinger blamed Gonzales' finding for 
helping to create a permissive atmosphere that led to these abuses.
<P>In the Senate hearings, lawmakers grilled Gonzales on whether it is 
legally permissible for U.S. personnel to engage in "cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment" of noncitizens detained outside of the United States. 
Gonzales replied that "aliens interrogated by the United States outside the 
United States enjoy no substantive rights" under the U.S. Constitution or the 
Convention Against Torture, a treaty ratified by the Senate in 1994 that bans 
all interrogation methods that cause severe pain or discomfort. In a written 
response to California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who requested further 
clarification, Gonzales said, "there is no legal obligation under the 
Convention Against Torture on cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment with 
respect to aliens overseas." 
<P>However, some legal scholars accuse Gonzales of distorting the convention.
<P>Abraham Sofaer, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford 
University who was the State Department's chief legal adviser under the Reagan 
and George H.W. Bush administrations, said Gonzales' assertion that 
international treaties do not apply to interrogations carried out by U.S. 
forces outside U.S. territory is wrong.
<P>The administration's position "is completely inconsistent with the spirit,
the legislative history, and in some respects with the language" of the 
convention, said Sofaer, who was the Bush administration's point man when the 
convention was presented to the Senate for ratification in 1990. In the 
hearings, Gonzales was also asked whether he agreed with a 2002 memo he 
commissioned from the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel  --  where 
Yoo was a lawyer  --  that concluded that all harsh tactics were acceptable up 
to the point of "intentionally causing permanent damage to vital organs or 
permanent emotional trauma."
<P>Gonzales answered: "I don't recall today whether or not I was in 
agreement with all of the analysis, but I don't have a disagreement with the 
conclusions then reached by the department." 
<P>In his written responses submitted after testifying, Gonzales still could 
not recall his prior views on the 2002 memo and refused to disclose any 
documents related to it.
