<p>Petty Officer 3rd Class Pablo Paredes faces charges of unauthorized absence and missing movement at his special court-martial Wednesday. He has pleaded not guilty.

During a recent interview, the 23-year-old from the New York City borough of the Bronx seemed unfazed by the prospect of a conviction following the military equivalent of a civilian misdemeanor trial. He could receive a year in jail, a forfeiture of pay, reduction in rank and a bad-conduct discharge if he's convicted. 
<p>"The president of the United States has a DUI under his belt," Paredes said, referring to the president's 1976 drunken driving arrest in Maine. "I think I'll make it with a misdemeanor." 
<p>Paredes, a weapons control technician, refused to board the USS Bonhomme Richard on Dec. 6 as it left for a six-month deployment in the Pacific and Indian oceans. The Bonhomme Richard and two other ships were transporting about 3,000 Marines to Iraq. 
<p>While his shipmates bid farewell to loved ones, Paredes told reporters he did not want to be part of a war he views as both illegal and immoral. He says his military training has taught him to avoid what he views as a war crime. 
<p>"The war is the real crime here, and that's what I want to get across," Paredes said. Navy prosecutors, however, have blocked Paredes' plans to put the war on trial during the court-martial, he said. 
<p>Defense attorney Jeremy Warren said Paredes has passed up deals that would have minimized his punishment in exchange for a guilty plea. 
<p>"He's not backing down from what he did or why he did it," Warren said. 
<p>A Navy officer reviewing Paredes' request for conscientious objector status has recommended that it be denied. 
<p>Paredes says he was a different person when he joined the Navy in 2000, looking for a job and a way to get a college education. The Navy sent him to Yokosuka, Japan and once there, he says he had something of an awakening. 
<p>He began devouring works by writers like Noam Chomsky, the MIT linguistics professor and political activist. He joined political discussions with like-minded friends who criticized the Bush administration. Japan's strong moral code impressed him as well, and when he left the country last year, Paredes says he had a huge internal conflict. 
<p>"I was ashamed to wear the uniform," he said. 
<p>Paredes' case has attracted attention from all political stripes. Retired Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North, a Fox News commentator who served in the Reagan White House, has labeled Paredes a coward. Chomsky and Ron Kovic, the disabled Vietnam and author of "<i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1888451785/commondreams-20/ref=nosim" target="_new">Born on the Fourth of July</a></i>," say they admire Paredes for his courage.
