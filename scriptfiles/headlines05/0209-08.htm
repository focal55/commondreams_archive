<p>Supporters of Ward Churchill lashed out at the media Tuesday, saying reporters oversimplified the University of Colorado professor's controversial essay and defamed his character.

<P>Introducing Churchill at a speech subtitled "Real Academic Discourse Outside the Filter of the Media," American Indian Movement leader Russell Means criticized reporters for questioning the professor's American Indian roots.

	
<P>"You have these corporate minions from Clear Channel and the corporate media telling us who our Indian leaders are, telling me that my leader is not an Indian because he hasn't been adequately registered," Means said.

<P>Churchill has described himself as a member of the Keetoowah Cherokee tribe in Oklahoma, although the United Keetoowah Band Cherokee say Churchill is not a member of their tribe and is not in their database.

<P>The Glenn Miller Ballroom on CU's campus was filled to its capacity of 1,100 for the evening's talk. About 250 more people gathered outside of the University Memorial Center, listening to the speech though amplified speakers.

<P>Churchill was escorted in and out of the auditorium surrounded by security. CU Police Lt. Tim McGraw said no arrests were made at the talk and described the event as "peaceful." Metal detectors were used to screen audience members before they were allowed to enter the ballroom.

<P>About 20 news cameras filmed the event, and more than a dozen photographers moved about the auditorium.

<P>Trevor Uberuagal, 22, said he came to the evening's discussion to support Churchill.

<P>"Bringing up his ancestry is nothing more than defamation of character," Uberuagal said. "It's making this argument into something it isn't."

<P>Zoe Williams, a junior at Metropolitan State College of Denver, criticized the media for oversimplifying Churchill's Sept. 11, 2001, essay.

<P>"They have taken one sentence out of everything this man has written and completely blown it out of proportion without giving him an adequate way to explain himself," she said. "They don't put anything in context. They use two words: 'little Eichmanns.' That's it."

<P>Churchill used the phrase in his essay, comparing some victims of the 9/11 terrorist attacks to Adolf Eichmann, a "technician" who organized Nazi plans to exterminate European Jews.

<P>Churchill himself slammed the media Tuesday but said he will not back down.

<P>"What doesn't kill you, they say, gives you strength," he said.

<P>Tracy Stientjes, a student journalist who was covering Churchill's talk for CU's student newspaper, the Campus Press, said the media criticism is "definitely disheartening."

<P>"For a lot of us, this has been our chosen profession, and we're just getting started," said Stientjes, a sophomore broadcast news major. "To hear such anger toward journalists is depressing." <p align="center">Copyright 2005, The Daily Camera and the E.W.
