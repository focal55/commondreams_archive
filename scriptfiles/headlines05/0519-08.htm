        <!--/endimage/--></font>"We blew them away," an emotional Galloway told a rally in London after giving evidence to the panel examining how former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein used oil to reward politicians.

<P>"From the emails and feedback we've had from all over the world it is true undoubtedly that there was a worldwide audience out there waiting for someone to speak the truth to power," he added.

<P>The U.S. Senate committee had released documents it said showed Saddam gave Galloway the rights to export 20 million barrels of oil under the defunct humanitarian program.

<P>Galloway defiantly rejected the evidence and condemned the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in an unusually robust performance before a Senate committee.

<P>He returned to a hero's welcome from supporters at a rally in central London and appeared close to tears as he made his way through a scrum of photographers.

<P>Galloway, who won a parliamentary seat in east London in May with his anti-Iraq war Respect party after being ejected from Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labour Party in 2003, later cracked jokes about his appearance in Washington.

<P>"I did a bit of sanction busting," he said, brandishing a cigar. "I smoked a Havana cigar just like this one. I smoked it inside the Capitol building, I even blew the smoke at the White House."

<P>Looking relaxed in a black suit and shirt, Galloway's performance was in stark contrast to his highly-charged evidence session in Washington on Tuesday.

<P>In a series of sharp exchanges, he confronted the Republican chairman of the committee, Senator Norm Coleman, and challenged him to back up claims he profited from the now defunct program.

<P>Galloway went on to attack Coleman's support for the invasion of Iraq to oust Saddam. Coleman later said he did not think Galloway was "a credible witness." The U.N. oil-for-food program, which began in late 1996 and ended in 2003, was aimed at easing the impact of sanctions imposed after Saddam's troops invaded Kuwait in 1990.
