<p>Bagram air base offers as much Americana as is possible on a dusty plain, 30 miles north of Kabul. Just off its smooth central avenue lies a host of home comforts - a Burger King, a handsomely stocked supermarket, a beauty parlor, even a car dealership.

Everything has been imported from the US - food, catering staff and even the operations HQ.  
<p>Only the jagged spine of the Hindu Kush mountains in the distance suggests you are in Asia. As I walked out of the front gate one afternoon a civilian contractor asked why I was not wearing my flak jacket.  
<p>"Anything could happen out there," he warned, pointing towards a line of approaching beggars and, beyond, the messy realities of Afghanistan.   
<p>But for Afghans, the greater danger lies inside. Sandbags and razor wire mark the one area strictly off limits to journalists. This is the detention center where, in December 2002, the 22-year-old taxi driver at the heart of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/20/international/asia/20abuse.html" target="_new">yesterday's New York Times report</a> was tortured and died.  
<p>Once a transit center for terror suspects bound for Guant&#225;namo Bay, the detention pens now hold those who are accused of much but convicted of nothing. Afghans know virtually nothing about what happens inside.  
<p>The Afghan Human Rights Commission has received more than 130 reports of torture and other abuses in the past 18 months, said its deputy chairman, Ahmad Fahim Hakim. Despite numerous requests, its officials have never been allowed in.   
<p>"We wrote to Barno &#91;the former US commander&#93; many times. His response was that they already provide access to the Red Cross. But the Red Cross doesn't publish any public reports," he said.  
<p>It is not just Afghans. According to other reports, the CIA has secretly flown detainees to Bagram from western countries to circumvent human rights laws.  
<p>Although torture may appall Americans, it will shock few Afghans, after 23 years of conflict. "Torture is seen as a usual practice here," said Mr Hakim.  
<p>But America desperately needs to avoid being judged by the standard of the Soviet Union or the ruthless mujahideen. In the remotest corners its soldiers are digging wells, roofing schools, vaccinating animals and evacuating the sick. But for many Afghans the quid pro quo - the freedom to hunt militants with disregard for cultural sensitivities - comes at too high a price. In the volatile south-eastern crescent, locals complain of intrusive house searches and arbitrary detention.  
<p>There have been improvements. One tribal leader in Khost, near the Pakistan border, told me that US soldiers had switched to a softer approach that was already winning local hearts and minds. But last week's Newsweek riots, which left 17 dead and 100 injured, are an indication of how fragile that goodwill can be. Yesterday's report, with its implied hypocrisy, will strain it further.  
<p>"On the one hand American troops want to inculcate us with democratic values; on the other, they are violating them," said Mr Hakim.
