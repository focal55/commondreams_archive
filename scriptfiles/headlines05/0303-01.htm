<p> BUDAPEST -- Frustrated by travel restrictions and uneasy about the war in Iraq, Central European citizens who once pledged unstinting allegiance to the United States are now recalling their European roots and looking to a united Europe for their economic and political futures.

<P>Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic -- what Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld called ''new Europe" in an apparent slap at Western European nations which opposed the war in Iraq -- still profess affection and appreciation for the United States because of its role in bringing down the Soviet empire that long dominated them. The governments of the three Central European nations all supported the war in Iraq and provided troops and assistance there.

<P>But some of their citizens are more skeptical, worrying that their role as new NATO members might draw the region into further armed conflicts just as the nations are emerging from decades of communist rule. And the ease of traveling and working in fellow European Union nations -- compared with the difficulty of securing visas to travel to the United States -- is making ''old Europe" a more attractive ally, analysts and local residents say.

<P>''It's changing. Central Europeans are waking up to the reality that from here on out, their bread is going to be buttered more in Brussels than in Washington," said Charles Kupchan, director of European studies at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington.

<P>A decade ago, Central Europe was heavily focused on getting into the US-dominated North Atlantic Treaty Organization and assuring their security in the region. Hungarians, Poles, and Czechs spoke worriedly then of the possibility that Russia might one day menace its neighbors again. But now, Central Europeans are paying attention to building their economies and making their mark in a united Europe, Kupchan said.

<P>That trend is apparent in the Hungarian capital.

<P>Prices in Hungary, which were once listed in Hungarian forints and US dollars, are now displayed in forints and Euros, the pan-European currency that has been steadily strengthening against the dollar. Western Europeans are buying real estate here, and the local newspapers are owned largely by Swiss and German interests.

<P>And while Central Europeans -- especially the Poles -- have a historical fondness for the United States, the cultural and political differences between Europe and the United States are present here as well, European analysts note. Europeans in general are at odds with the United States on matters such as the death penalty, the role of international institutions, religiosity, and the environment, said James Goldgeier, a Europe expert at George Washington University.

<P>The war in Iraq, Budapesters say, underscored the disenchantment some have here with their longtime friend.

<P>Andras Rado, a 25-year-old student at Central European University in Budapest, said the image of the United States has suffered among members of his generation, who are looking instead to places like Germany, Scandinavia, and Great Britain for higher-paying jobs and international experience.

<P>''I think at that time [in the early and mid-1990's], anything that was Western and American was considered to be good. Now, people have realized that not everything that comes from America is good," Rado said. ''People have realized they can get the same [opportunities] in Europe."

<P>Hungarians and Czechs overwhelmingly opposed the war in Iraq, despite the support from their governments. Polish popular opposition to the war, muted at first, has grown, Kupchan said.

<P>Now, some Hungarians are concerned that the activities of the United States, a country they once looked to for security, might end up putting them in more danger.

<P>''I'm worried [President] Bush will go to Iran and take Hungary with him," said Sandor Bartos, a 55-year-old mechanical engineer.

<P>Sebestyen Gorka, a Hungarian defense and security specialist, said Hungarians have an ''unrealistic" concern about terrorism that makes them nervous about being so closely allied with the United States.

<P>''For no good reason, as a kind of consequence of the awful experience in the Cold War, there are still high levels of fear, and if there's something they can latch onto, terrorism is the new thing," said Gorka, executive director of the Budapest-based Institute for Transitional Democracy and International Security.

<P>''It's not the secret police at your door; it's the unrealistic expectation that Hungary would be the next target of extremist terrorism. There is an undercurrent of, 'Let's not ally ourselves too closely because the price may be too costly.' "

<P>Central Europeans are also finding that it's difficult to get visas to visit American since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, a situation that both angers them and shifts their interests toward more accessible Western Europe. The new EU nations have been pressuring the Bush administration to ease visa rules, and President Bush, speaking to Slovak citizens in Bratislava last week, won his biggest round of applause when he said that ''we're working with your government to make it easier for Slovaks to travel to the United States of America."

<P>But in the meantime, young Central Europeans say they are ready to give up trying to travel to a country which they said appears to deny them visas for no apparent reason.

<P>''At this point, it's easier to just stay in Europe. It's just easier," said Laura Nagy, a 24-year-old jewelry saleswoman, adding that several of her friends were denied the right to travel to the United States.

<P>Central Europe's dual roles belonging to NATO and the European Union make the region a battleground between the United States, which dominates NATO, and the expanding European Union, Goldgeier said.

<P>''One of the things that has been of concern . . . is that as the countries of Central and Eastern Europe focus on being good Europeans, they would lose their focus on relations with the United States, would lose their gratitude with the United States, their pro-America stance," Goldgeier said.

<P>Instead, US leaders are hoping Central Europe would bring a ''pro-America bias" to the European Union to temper the prickly relationship EU powers such as Germany and France have had with the United States, he said.

<P>Andras Simonyi, the Hungarian ambassador to the United States, said that while Hungarians might be paying more attention to their closer neighbors, they would ultimately understand that it is in their best interests to keep close ties with the United States as well.

<P>''For the average Hungarian, the real issue is, 'how do we get closer to the Western part of the continent?' " Simonyi said in an interview.

<P>But the nation will also benefit from highlighting its importance to the United States, he said. ''It's good when we're needed," Simonyi said. ''The best deal for a small country is when a country like the US needs us."
