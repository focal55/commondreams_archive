<p>The World Bank is to play a frontline role in the fight against global warming under a plan expected to be agreed at the G8 Summit. </p>
        
        
          
          
            <p>
  The bank would offer financial incentives to developing countries to cut 
  their greenhouse gas emissions and adopt "clean" technologies. But 
  the move could provoke controversy since US companies, which are in the lead 
in this new industry, will benefit most from the bank's grants.</p>
<p>

  The proposal is designed partly to persuade the US President George Bush to 
  sign up to a firmer than expected declaration on climate change. Yesterday, 
  he accepted that "an increase in greenhouse gases caused by humans is 
  contributing to the problem".
</p>
<p>
  Gordon Brown, the Chancellor, disclosed the proposal last night, saying the 
  bank would "bring together" the US, Europe and other nations for 
  talks on tackling the problem. "I think the World Bank will put up the 
  money for this," he said.
</p>
<p>
   "We have got to look at alternative sources of energy, we have got to 
  look at better and more efficient use of energy. We have got to take on 
  board the scientific research and I think there has got to be money behind 
  this so that we can actually persuade people to do things, particularly in 
  the developing countries."
</p>
<p>
  After arriving at Gleneagles, Tony Blair rejected calls by environmental 
  groups for him to isolate President Bush over climate change rather than 
  sign a watered-down deal.
</p>
<p>
  He said: "If you don't get an agreement that includes America, you 
  won't get an agreement that works. That is the blunt truth. I hope to be 
  able to do this and bring people together. What we have got to have is a 
  dialogue post-G8."

</p>
<p>
  When the summit gets under way today, France and Germany will press for the 
  communiqu&eacute; to include a reference to urgency, that global warming is 
  human-induced, that the Kyoto protocols are important and that carbon 
  trading should be supported.
</p>
<p>
  Mr Brown revealed that the draft communiqu&eacute; to be issued tomorrow would 
  double aid to Africa by 2010 - and put Britain at odds with other G8 members 
  by saying that was not quick enough. He told the ITV program, Making 
  Poverty History: "I hope it will be by 2008... I want it to happen 
  earlier."
</p>
<p>
  He said that his proposal to harness the capital markets, using the 
  International Finance Facility, which is opposed by the US, would have 
  enabled the aid to be paid "a lot quicker".
</p>
<p>
  Mr Brown's hopes of securing an agreement to eliminate unfair farm subsidies 
  by 2010 was dealt a blow yesterday when Peter Mandelson, the EU trade 
  commissioner, dismissed the target as "not credible". Mr Mandelson 
  doubted whetherG8 would set a timetable for cutting agricultural subsidies.

</p>
<p>
   "Such a date may not be credible given that the more rapidly we remove 
  subsidies on agriculture, the more it costs us to do so."
</p>
<p>
  But he criticized French demands that the abolition of export subsidies 
  within the Common Agricultural Policy be phased out over 10 years, which 
  would mean that even if a global trade deal were signed in 2006, farm 
  subsidies would not go until 2016.
