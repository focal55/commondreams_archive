<p>A campaigner who has dedicated his life to fighting the destruction of the Brazilian environment is in a critical condition after setting fire to himself in protest at the construction of alcohol factories in the Pantanal marsh region.

<p>Francisco Anselmo de Barros, 65, suffered 100% burns after wrapping himself in a burning duvet during a demonstration on Saturday in the centre of Campo Grande, the capital of Mato Grosso do Sul.

<p>"Fifteen minutes earlier I took photographs of him talking, smiling, [he was] fine," Aclides Faria, a friend and president of the environmental NGO Ecology and Action (Ecoa) told a local newspaper.
	
<p>"Then suddenly someone saw the fire. It was a man covered in high flames. There was no way of getting close. He was calling out for help, but couldn't even speak. We couldn't tell who it was, not even when someone arrived with a fire extinguisher and put out the flames."

<p>Around 500 people, among them numerous environmental groups, had gathered for the protest at 9am to denounce new attempts to refine sugar cane in the region and to collect signatures for a petition to present to the state government.

<p>As a leading environmentalist and the president of the Foundation for the Conservation of Nature in Mato Grosso do Sul, Mr Barros has fought the prospect of factories since the early 1980s, when two were constructed in the Pantanal basin.

<p>He argued that the burning of sugar cane would have a catastrophic effect on the area, leading to the destruction of parts of the Pantanal, a sprawling wetlands almost half the size of France, which is home to around 700 species of bird and 240 of fish.

<p>The dispute over the factories reignited in 2003 when the state's governor Jose Orcirio Miranda dos Santos, known as Zeca do PT, took steps towards permitting the construction of new alcohol factories in the region.

<p>Supporters say the refineries would bring employment and revenue to the state. Mr Barros remained adamant they would not. "We need to be aware of the new dangers," he told an audience in Campo Grande in September.

<p>"The environmental predators of today are ... the fake businessmen who commission lie-filled PhD papers and pass them off as research, who falsely justify to society investments and unnecessary construction projects, saying that they will create employment ... and bring development to the region and the country."

<p>Yesterday colleagues expressed shock at Mr Barros's actions. "I never imagined he would do something like this," Asturio Ferreira dos Santos, the president of the state's Association of Amateur Fishing and one of Barros's oldest friends, told the local press.

<p>"Our movement is pacific and 'Anselmo' was always very calm and controlled."

<p>Mr Faria added: "I can't understand it ... We were winning the question about the factories."

<p>But privately Mr Barros seems to have been less confident. "Who knows if this isn't the only way to stop this?" he reportedly wrote in a series of notes left behind. "The boat is sinking."

<p>Mr Barros was admitted to intensive care yesterday afternoon; his condition remains critical. Doctors are said to be pessimistic about his chances of survival.
