<p>  LONDON -- A British judge ordered foreign suspects held under discredited terrorism legislation freed on Friday while parliament was locked in round-the-clock debate to replace the laws before they expire.

<P>Cars were seen driving out of London's maximum security Belmarsh jail carrying some of the detainees. Others were being held at a mental hospital.

<P>They include the man accused of being the spiritual inspiration for the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States.

<P>The judge overseeing the tribunal holding them under the expiring measures sent one detainee home under severe bail restrictions and signed orders freeing seven more under similar terms. A further two will stay jailed for reasons unrelated to the terrorism powers.

<P>The judge's orders effectively ended a three-year policy of holding the men without charge or trial under emergency laws, which were passed after the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001 and ruled unlawful by judges last year and expire on Sunday.

<P>But the terms of their bail -- that they wear electronic tags, stay home for 12 hours a day and refrain from pre-arranged meetings -- depend on the old powers due to expire. Prime Minister Tony Blair wants new powers to replace them.

<P>Both of Britain's houses of parliament, the Commons and the Lords, debated through the night and well into the afternoon. Parliament was due to shut on Thursday, but official timekeepers stopped the clock at one minute before midnight.

<P>The unelected Lords repeatedly voted to block the bill, weighing centuries-old rights against the need to protect Britain. Never before in modern times have the Lords defied the Commons with such tenacity.

<P>If they continue to do so, they could force parliament to sit at the weekend for the first time since 1982, when members met over the Falklands War.

<P>BLAIR SAYS NO CAMPAIGN ISSUE

<P>Blair, who faces an election expected in May, insisted he was not using the debate as a campaign issue and summoned reporters to Downing Street for a statement on Friday afternoon.

<P>"I am not interested in either the parliamentary skirmishing or in trying to create some great political issue out of this," he said earlier. "I don't want terrorism to be an issue at all. I thought we could get this measure through by consent."

<P>The old law allowed foreigners to be detained indefinitely without charge if suspected of terrorism. The new measures would apply to Britons as well, allowing the government to impose a range of restrictions, up to house arrest without trial.

<P>Both require Britain to suspend the right to a fair trial guaranteed under European law, the only country to do so.

<P>The elected Commons backed Blair after he made concessions.

<P>But the unelected Lords, who by convention are expected to yield to the elected chamber, refused to back down, saying the new measures revoke fundamental rights.

<P>Bleary-eyed Lords, many elderly, returned to reject the bill at 0500 GMT after a few hours sleep in offices or nearby hotels. By early afternoon, they showed no signs of a quick climbdown, with the bill set to ping pong between the two chambers through the rest of Friday at least.

<P>A black-clad official in a wig carried the bill back and forth through the ornate corridors of Westminster between the two chambers as each voted to reject the other's version.

<P>Politicians noted the debate had dragged into the first anniversary of train bombings that killed 191 people in Madrid.

<P>The prisoners being released include Abu Qatada, a Syrian cleric the government says was a spiritual mentor to Mohammed Atta, leader of the Sept. 11 hijackers. He will be banned from preaching under the bail order.

<P>Opponents to the government's bill -- many from within Blair's Labour Party -- say it is badly drafted or draconian.

<P>They say Blair has exaggerated threats in the past, pointing to the failure to find banned weapons in Iraq which Blair used to justify joining the U.S.-led invasion.

<P>"We are back to where we were after the war in Iraq when Mr Blair misrepresented the advice of the security services," Conservative Party leader Michael Howard told BBC radio.
