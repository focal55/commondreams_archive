<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --> Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez tightened his grip on power late Sunday after his party swept legislative elections marked by anemic voter turnout and mostly boycotted by the opposition.
<p>The election hands Chavez's allies in the ruling party more than the two-thirds majority they need in the 167-seat one-chamber National Assembly to enable Chavez to end presidential term limits and seek reelection next year.</p>
<p>William Lara, who heads Chavez's Fifth Republic Movement, told reporters the ruling coalition has won all 167 seats. He said his party will control 114 seats as a result of the vote, with the rest also going to parties that support the leftist-populist president.</p>
<p>Lara insisted that after January 5, when the new legislature is inaugurated, Venezuela will still have a "multi-party National Assembly, which will include various civic groups and independent deputies."</p>
<p>But only 25 percent of about 12 million registered voters showed up as most of Venezuela's opposition parties, including Democratic Action and COPEI -- which for decades alternated in high office -- stayed away from the polls, charging lack of transparency, according to election officials.</p>

<p>Official election results were to be released by electoral councils across Venezuela's 24 states, but no time was immediately given.</p>
<p>Jorge Rodriguez, president of the National Electoral Council, explained the low turnout as due to "torrential rains that have prevented voters from getting to polling places."</p>
<p>But members of opposition parties charged that the low turnout undercut the vote's legitimacy.</p>
<p>Henry Ramos Allup, who leads the Democratic Action party, said that while the new legislature was legal, "it is not legitimate because it is a body in which the whole Venezuelan population is not represented."</p>
<p>Opposition forces complained this week that electronic voting machines in the vote can record fingerprints, allowing authorities to know how a person voted, though election officials agreed to switch the feature off. They also charged that the electoral council is stacked with Chavez supporters.</p>
<p>But Rodriguez assured that "the voting went ahead with absolute normality."</p>
<p>"We can say that Venezuelans have expressed their opinion today as established by the Constitution," he added.</p>
<p>Hundreds of foreign election monitors from the European Union and the Organization of American States declared the vote legitimate.</p>
<p>But the opposition group Sumate alleged widespread irregularities.</p>

<p>"We have received complaints from all parts of the country," said Alejandro Plaz, a spokesman for the organization.</p>
<p>Voting has not been mandatory in the country since 1999.</p>
<p>"Venezuela is speaking with its silence," said Julio Borges, a prominent opposition member.</p>
<p>Venezuela's opposition for years has failed in repeated attempts to oust Chavez, an elected former paratroop colonel and close ally of Cuba's communist leader Fidel Castro.</p>
<p>"The old parties are already dead but are refusing to die," Chavez said Sunday after casting his ballot in a poor Caracas neighborhood.</p>
<p>Chavez earlier charged the opposition with seeking to lead Venezuela "down a violent path," and called its boycott part of a "subversive" US-inspired plot aimed at denying him a new six-year term in the December 2006 presidential election.</p>
<p>The election was marked by some reports of violence. Early Sunday, a top military official said that an oil pipeline was set ablaze at two points. "Apparently it is sabotage," said Wilfredo Silva, head of the armed forces unified command.</p>
<p>Energy Minister Rafael Ramirez told state television that the fires were under control, and dismissed suggestions that it would result in a fuel shortage. The pipeline moves crude oil to a massive refining complex on Lake Maracaibo, Ramirez said.</p>
<p>Chavez, who heads Latin America's only OPEC member, has courted nations across the Caribbean with cut-rate oil and offered cash-strapped Argentina financial assistance.</p>

<p>He led a coup attempt in 1992, was elected president in 1998, reelected in 2000, survived a coup in 2002 and fought a recall referendum in 2004. Huge spending on welfare and health, paid for with Venezuela's oil wealth, have sustained his strong support among many Venezuelans.</p>
