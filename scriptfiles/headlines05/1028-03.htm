</font>New California Media, a San Francisco coalition of ethnic media, 
commissioned a poll released Thursday of whites, blacks, Asians and Hispanics 
about how Hurricane Katrina influenced the way people view poverty, race 
relations, climate change and government response.  
<P>No other poll has sought the opinions of such a diverse pool of 
respondents on these subjects. Other surveys have treated race as an issue only 
between whites and blacks  --  if they asked about race at all.  
<P>Bendixen & Associates, which conducted the poll, interviewed 1,035 
randomly selected people in English, Spanish, Korean, Vietnamese, Cantonese and 
Mandarin from Oct. 14 to Oct. 21.  
<P>Most respondents  --  77 percent of blacks, 69 percent of Hispanics, 60 
percent of Asians and 46 percent of whites  --  said the government should 
finance the hurricane relief effort by pulling troops out of Iraq as soon as 
possible. 
<P>"I see this as a historic moment, a sea change in public opinion on these 
issues," said pollster Sergio Bendixen.  
<P>In contrast to polls over the past decade indicating that Americans were 
not optimistic about ending poverty, Bendixen said his shows that the hurricane 
has put the issue back on the national agenda.  
<P>There are historic parallels to this shift, said Michel Gelobeter, 
executive director of Redefining Progress, an Oakland think tank. Public outcry 
over the 1900 Galveston, Texas, hurricane and flood that killed thousands of 
people and over the 1927 flood of the Mississippi Valley that displaced 
hundreds of thousands helped bring about social and government change, he said. 
<P>"This country needs a U-turn," said Gelobeter, who was not involved in the 
poll. "We need to be a nation building a great society at home, not overseas." 

<P>Other polls this fall, which tended to include only registered voters but 
also drew on pools of 800 to 1,500 people, produced more mixed answers to 
similar questions.  
<P>Less than a third of respondents to a Pew Research Center poll preferred 
that the government pay for hurricane area reconstruction by cutting spending 
in Iraq, while the rest chose higher taxes, domestic spending cuts or deficit 
spending. In a Newsweek poll, 57 percent of respondents said that after dealing 
with the hurricanes and replacing the FEMA chief, the federal government would 
be better able to respond to future natural disasters 
<P>Some 35 percent of respondents to an ABC poll said the slow government 
response to Hurricane Katrina will hurt race relations in the long term; 21 
percent said it would improve them, and 39 percent felt it would have no 
effect. And in a CBS-New York Times poll, 59 percent of respondents said race 
was not a factor in the government's slow response in New Orleans. 
<P>Poll respondents were selected at random and interviewed over the phone. 
For some, pollsters randomly dialed phone numbers from census tracts where 
certain ethnicities account for more than 10 percent of the population and from 
lists of people whose names indicate they are likely from a particular ethnic 
group. They then verified the respondents' race and ethnicity. 
<P>The margin of error for the full sample is three percentage points, but 
once results are broken down by ethnic and racial subgroups, the margin is six 
percentage points. 
<P>Many respondents to the New California Media poll said they could not rely 
on local and state governments, the Federal Emergency Management Agency or the 
U.S. armed forces to protect their families in a natural disaster.  
<P>"Government needs to take back its significant role and protect the 
public," said Sandra Hernandez, San Francisco's former director of public 
health and now the chief executive officer of the San Francisco Foundation, the 
philanthropic organization that hosted Thursday's news conference where the 
poll results were presented. 
<P>In the Bay Area, Vietnamese Americans sent truckloads of fish sauce, 
noodles, soy sauce and other staples to Mississippi and Alabama, and they are 
helping displaced residents rebuild. Local black churches also gathered 
donations of cash and goods and sent volunteers to provide relief. 
<P>Respondents agreed on the need to reduce poverty  --  58 percent of 
blacks, 43 percent of Hispanics, 40 percent of Asians and 36 percent of whites  
--  but they disagreed over the influence of race on this issue. 
<P>More than two-thirds of poll respondents agreed that "life is a lot more 
difficult for poor people in the United States than I ever imagined"  --  84 
percent of blacks, 77 percent of Asians, 74 percent of Hispanics and 67 percent 
of whites. 
<P>But when the same question was asked about blacks, agreement dropped 
across all ethnic groups. Just 47 percent of Asians and 34 percent of whites 
agreed that "life is a lot more difficult for blacks in the United States than 
I ever imagined." 
<P>Respondents were sharply divided by race on the issue of looting during 
the hurricane's aftermath, a gap reflected in other hurricane polls and in the 
national debate. 
<P>Fifty-seven percent of African American respondents said that the people 
who took food and television sets from stores were trying to take care of their 
families, while 46 percent of whites, 40 percent of Asians and 44 percent of 
Hispanics said such people were looters.
