<p> OTTAWA -- A senior foreign affairs official has told the Maher Arar inquiry he was troubled by the way the United States handled the Ottawa engineer's deportation case, though he defended Canada's role in the affair. Dan Livermore, the director general of the department's security and intelligence bureau, said the Syrian-born man was deported to Syria while returning to Canada through the U.S. in 2002 because of a controversial American process called extraordinary rendition.

<P>That's a secret system that was allegedly set up to send terrorist suspects to another country for questioning in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks against the United States.

<P>"I find troubling the entire course of activity the American government has embarked upon since about 2001 with respect to what they call extraordinary rendition, a practice which we knew absolutely nothing about," said Livermore.

<P>Livermore added that he was also disturbed by the way the U.S. suddenly decided to deport Arar one early October morning in 2002.

<P>"I find it extremely troubling that the Americans would hold an administrative tribunal in the middle of the night and deport someone back to his native country, where they must have known it was difficult, to say the least, for him."

<P>Arar claims Syrian officials tortured him before he was released more than a year later and returned to Canada.

<P>Yet Livermore defended how Canadian officials acted in the case, saying the practice of sharing consular information with the RCMP and the Canadian Security Intelligence Service was necessary, given the heightened global terrorist threat.

<P>Arar's lawyer, Marlys Edwardh, said much of that information was provided to Canadian security forces by the same Syrian authorities that Arar says later tortured him.

<P>She pointed to information the RCMP leaked to Canadian media, alleging Arar had links to Muslim extremists.

<P>"This is a very destructive thing to have done in respect of Mr. Arar in circumstances where information is neither confirmed or proven, given its alleged source," she said.

<P>Livermore agreed that the media leak was devastating to Arar, and said he found it "personally distasteful."

<P>The public inquiry looking into the Canadian government's role in Arar's deportation continues in Ottawa.
