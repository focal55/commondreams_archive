<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->Iraq's environmental problems - among world's worst - range from a looted nuclear site which needs cleaning up to sabotaged oil pipelines, a U.N. official said on Thursday.<p>"An improvement is almost impossible in these security
conditions. Chemicals are seeping into groundwater and the
situation is becoming worse and creating additional health
problems," said Pekka Haavisto, Iraq task force chairman at the
United Nations Environmental Programme.</p><p>"Iraq is the worst case we have assessed and is difficult
to compare. After the Balkan War we could immediately intervene
for protection, such as the river Danube, but not in Iraq,"
Haavisto, a former Finnish environment minister, said on a
visit to Jordan to meet with Iraqi officials.</p><p>Lack of spare parts and Iraq's inability to maintain
pollution standards during two previous wars and more than a
decade of crushing sanctions have damaged the environment,
including the Tigris and Euphrates rivers where most of Iraq's
sewage flows untreated.</p><p>The situation became worse after the 2003 U.S.-led
invasion, in which depleted uranium munitions were used against
Iraq for the second time and postwar looting and burning of the
once formidable infrastructure caused massive spills and toxic
plumes, Haavisto said.</p><p>"The bombing and war carried a cost but the looting cost
the environment more, such as in the Dora refinery or Tuwaitha
nuclear storage," Haavisto said.</p><p>"There has not been proper cleanup and only assessment work
at some of these sites. Very little has changed and Iraqi teams
are in the process of getting in some of these locations."</p><p>The U.N. official was referring to the 56 square km (22 sq
mile) Tuwaitha complex south of Baghdad where 3,000 barrels
that stored nuclear compounds were looted.</p><p>In the Dora depot on the edge of Baghdad, 5,000 barrels of
chemicals, including tetra ethylene lead, were spilled burned
or stolen, a U.N. survey showed.</p><p>Contaminated sites near the water supply also include a 200
square km (77 sq mile) military industrial complex, torched or
looted cement factories and fertilizer plants, of which Iraq
was one of the world's largest producers, and oil spills.</p><p>"Iraq was a modern industrial society in many ways. The
chemicals are very risky on its future. The more time passes
the more consequences on health," Haavisto said.</p><p>He said postwar assessment of the environmental damage was
proceeding despite threats to the 1,000 staff of an Iraqi
environment ministry, set up as an independent unit after the
American invasion.</p><p>The field studies will eventually include depleted uranium,
a toxic, heavy metal used to make bombs more lethal, of which
the United States used an estimated 300 tonnes in 1991 Gulf War
and an unknown quantity during the last invasion.
