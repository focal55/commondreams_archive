<p> ATLANTA  - Two years ago, Patricia Roberts' world was in order. Her son, Spc. Jamaal Addison, had just gotten married and she became a grandmother. Four days into the Iraq war, however, the 22-year-old soldier was killed by a rocket-propelled grenade, the first Georgian to die in the war.</p>
<p>Addison's wife moved on. Roberts was left to care for Addison's son, Jamaal II, who was born prior to his marriage. The 44-year-old grandmother moved from Conyers, Ga., to Lithonia, Ga., in order to be near her son's cemetery.</p>
<p>&quot;Once you die for this country, they forget who you are,&quot; Roberts said of the government. &quot;Now I have a grandson they're not even helping raise. What about the rest of my life, the rest of his life? He'll never be able to see his dad.&quot;</p>
<p>Roberts is one of several parents of U.S. soldiers killed who are participating in a series of anti-war marches in Atlanta and Fayetteville, N.C., commemorating two years of war in Iraq.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't need to be out there,&quot; she said. &quot;There's too many people like me, their lives have changed forever.&quot;</p>
<p>In Friday's Atlanta rally, timed to coincide with the city's infamous rush-hour traffic, about 300 marchers gathered at Centennial Olympic Park carrying black coffins with U.S. and Iraq symbols and black balloons saying &quot;Bring the Troops Home Now.&quot; The demonstrators planned to march to a park in the city's Midtown neighborhood, a few miles away.</p>
<p>&quot;The vast majority of people in the peace movement in America and Europe were aware there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, no nuclear program and no al-Qaeda link,&quot; said organizer Gloria Tatum, 61, of Decatur, Ga., who is with the activist groups International Action Center and Georgia Peace and Justice.</p>
<p>Activists say more than 1,500 U.S. soldiers and more than 100,000 Iraqis have died, that Iraq's infrastructure has been crippled and its environment polluted because of U.S. depleted-uranium tank rounds.</p>
<p>March speaker Gary Pelphrey, who served in the Navy during the Vietnam War, said he is not against all war but opposes the current U.S. involvement in Iraq. Pelphrey, a member of the group Military Families Speak Out, said he finds parallels to the Vietnam War.</p>
<p>&quot;We've gotten ourselves into a mess and we have leadership unwilling to admit it,&quot; said Pelphrey, 69, of Marietta. &quot;It seems to me we wound up getting out of Vietnam at least partially from the pressure the public came to bear&quot; and that similar public pressure can force U.S. officials to withdraw American troops from Iraq.</p>
<p>Another rally was expected Saturday in Fayetteville, N.C., the town next to Fort Bragg, the home of the 82nd Airborne Division. The rally there is one of the largest being organized by the United for Peace &amp; Justice group. On its Web site, the group says war opponents in 726 cities and towns across the country plan rallies this weekend.</p>
<p>Last year, a similar protest there involved about 1,200 activists and drew hundreds of observers and a group of people protesting the protesters. An organization called Free Republic has prepared for this year's rally by asking supporters of the war in Iraq to attend a counter-demonstration.</p>
<p>In Lithonia, Roberts said she's been working hard to raise her grandson and to steer others away from her son's career path in the military. She started the Jamaal Addison Motivational Foundation, which will raise money to provide scholarships to young people, so they do not have to depend on the military for an education.</p>
<p>&quot;My son joined (the Army) to go to school. He wanted to come out and start his own business with computers,&quot; Roberts said.</p>
<p>Roberts and her foundation are planning fundraisers in Atlanta for Wednesday - the two-year anniversary of Addison's death - and on Oct. 7, which would be his 24th birthday.</p>
<p>&quot;People should find out what they can do to protest against this war to bring these troops home,&quot; she said.</p>
