<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->	<P>Stanley Tookie Williams, a gangster who became an anti-gang crusader in 
prison and the focus of a furious clash between advocates of punishment and 
redemption, was executed by lethal injection early today for four 1979 Los 
Angeles-area murders that he denied committing. 
<P>Williams, 51, was pronounced dead at 12:35 a.m. at San Quentin State 
Prison, where he had spent nearly half his life. His execution had been all but 
assured Monday when Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger denied clemency, saying, "The 
facts do not justify overturning the jury's verdict or the decisions of the 
courts in this case." 
<P>Williams offered no resistance as he was strapped to the gurney in the 
death chamber but appeared exasperated as prison officials hooked him up to the 
intravenous tubes that injected the poison, according to reporters who 
witnessed the execution. One reporter said it took 36 minutes from when 
Williams was brought into the chamber for him to be pronounced dead. 
<P>At one point, Williams looked around and appeared to ask, "You doing that 
right?" said Kim Curtis of the Associated Press. 
<P>A total of 39 people watched Williams die, including a few he invited to 
be witnesses. Three of them raised their fists in salute as Williams looked at 
them and afterward yelled, "The state of California just killed an innocent 
man," said Chronicle reporter Kevin Fagan. 
<P>Lora Owens, stepmother of one of Williams' murder victims, burst into 
tears at the outburst. 

<P>Williams spent his last hours in a 45-square-foot "death watch" cell, 
where he was given a new set of clothes  --  jeans and a blue work shirt  --  
to change into before being escorted to the death chamber. While in the cell, 
Williams spoke by phone with his attorneys as the governor and courts rejected 
last-minute requests for a stay. 
<P>He also had access to a television set, but wasn't watching, said Terry 
Thornton, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Corrections and 
Rehabilitation.  
<P>Outside the prison gates, about 2,000 death-penalty protesters prayed for 
a last-minute reprieve, while a few motorists shouted from their car windows, 
"Kill him." 
<P>Inside, Williams remained composed, forgoing his final meal and opting 
only for a couple of small cartons of milk. 
<P>"He has been very calm, very quiet and very respectful of the staff," said 
Todd Slosek, another spokesman for the prison. 
<P>Williams' morning started with a bowl of oatmeal, and during the day he 
met with his lawyers and six visitors, including the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who 
had publicly spoken out for him. 
<P>The condemned man had his visitors brought into his cell one at a time and 
gave them "his formal goodbyes," Thornton said. "And after that, he gathered 
them all as a group and addressed them all. 
<P>"Some of them looked close to tears and some of them looked angry," 
Thornton said, relaying what guards had said of the witnesses. 
<P>A prison chaplain was available to Williams if he had requested spiritual 
counsel, but he did not, Thornton said. He also did not request a sedative 
before the execution, though one was available, she said. 
<P>Williams did, however, ask that five witnesses be present at his 
execution. Earlier he had said he didn't want anyone he knew to see him die, 
but apparently he had a change of heart.  
<P>Williams is the 12th person put to death in California since the state 
resumed executions in 1992 after a 25-year suspension because of court rulings. 
No capital case in the state had stirred such national and international 
attention since Caryl Chessman  --  like Williams, an author of books from 
Death Row  --  was executed in the gas chamber in 1960 for rape and kidnapping. 
<P>To his supporters, Williams was a man who had turned his life around in 
prison, writing eight children's books denouncing gang life. Last week Williams 
was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for the sixth straight year, by a 
philosophy professor at Notre Dame de Namur University in Belmont who opposes 
the death penalty. Williams' books for children and young people have also been 
nominated four times for the Nobel Prize for literature. 
<P>But to others Williams was an archvillain who co-founded the violent Crips 
street gang and unleashed a crime wave that changed Southern California. 
<P>His lawyers tried frantically until the end to find a way to save him. 
Just two hours before Tuesday's execution, they pleaded with Schwarzenegger for 
a 60-day stay, arguing that in the 11th hour a witness had surfaced who could 
shed new light on the case. Earlier in the day, they said three jailhouse 
witnesses had come forward this week with evidence that could show Williams had 
been framed for the four shotgun murders that put him on Death Row. 
<P>But the governor, the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco 
and the U.S. Supreme Court rejected all the defense efforts to spare Williams' 
life. 
<P>"Clemency cases are always difficult, and this one is no exception," 
Schwarzenegger wrote in a six-page statement rejecting Williams' bid to have 
his sentence commuted to life without the possibility of parole. "After 
studying the evidence, searching the history, listening to the arguments and 
wrestling with the profound consequences, I could find no justification for 
granting clemency. The facts do not justify overturning the jury's verdict or 
the decisions of the courts in this case." 
<P>Williams said he was a changed man and of value to society because of his 
anti-gang writings from behind bars. Schwarzenegger noted, however, that 
Williams had never apologized for the murders. Williams maintained he did not 
commit them. 

<P>"Without an apology and atonement for these senseless and brutal killings, 
there can be no redemption," Schwarzenegger said. "In this case, the one thing 
that would be the clearest indication of complete remorse and full redemption 
is the one thing Williams will not do.'' 
<P>A native of New Orleans who grew up in South Central Los Angeles, Williams 
started the Crips gang with a friend in 1971, when he was 16. According to 
state prison files, he had juvenile convictions for drugs and auto theft in 
1970, was sent to a youth detention camp, quit high school in 1971 and later 
spent two years in junior college. At the time of the murders in 1979, he had 
no adult felony convictions. 
<P>The first victim, Albert Owens, 26, a clerk at a 7-Eleven store in 
Whittier, was ordered to lie on the floor and then was shot in the back during 
a $120 robbery on Feb. 28, 1979. One of the robbers, Alfred Coward, granted 
immunity from prosecution, testified that Williams had fired the fatal shots 
and laughed about it afterward. 
<P>Williams reportedly told friends, "You should have heard the way he 
sounded when I shot him." 
<P>On March 11, 1979, Yen-I Yang, 76, and Tsai-Shai Yang, 63, owners of the 
Brookhaven Motel in Los Angeles, and their daughter, Yee-Chen Lin, 43, were 
shot to death during a $100 robbery. A sheriff's expert testified that a shell 
casing found at the scene matched Williams' shotgun. Other prosecution 
witnesses said Williams had admitted committing both crimes, and that he had 
referred to the motel victims as "Buddha-heads." 
<P>Williams, convicted and sentenced to death in 1981, maintained that he was 
railroaded by witnesses who lied in exchange for leniency in their own criminal 
cases, by a faulty ballistics test, and by a prosecutor who removed three 
African Americans from the jury and told jurors that seeing Williams in court 
was like observing a Bengal tiger in a zoo. 
<P>State and federal courts rejected each of his appeals, although federal 
judges described the evidence as less than airtight, and a three-judge federal 
panel said he might be a worthy candidate for clemency. 
<P>Williams, who was seen mouthing a threat to the jury after the guilty 
verdict, remained a violent man during his early years in prison, assaulting 
inmates and guards and spending six years in solitary confinement, from 1988 to 
1994. But as he later described it, during that period he began reading widely 
and reflecting on his life, and resolved to prevent gang violence. 
<P>Williams taped a message from prison in April 1993 that was broadcast to 
Los Angeles gang members at a "peace summit.'' With the help of Barbara Becnel, 
a writer he met in prison who became his champion, he started work on eight 
books for children that were published in 1996 as a series called, "Tookie 
Speaks Out Against Gang Violence.'' 
<P>He followed with "Life in Prison'' in 1998 and a memoir, "Blue Rage, Black 
Redemption,'' in 2004 and was working on two more books before his execution. 
He spoke regularly from prison to youths and educators, and posted a model 
"peace protocol'' for gangs, which supporters say was widely used, on his Web 
site in 2000. "Redemption,'' a television movie starting Jamie Foxx in a 
sympathetic portrayal of Williams, aired in 2004. 
<P>Assertions by Williams' supporters of success for his peacemaking efforts 
drew skepticism from some researchers, who found no decline in killings after 
gang peace summits. But individual testimonials abounded from youths who said 
Williams changed their lives.

<b>What they said</b>:  
<P><i>"The only people who would have been 
happy with clemency were people who likely  wouldn't support him anyway.''<br>
</i>-- Dan Schnur, a political consultant
<P><i>Stanley Tookie Williams "feels any acts of violence would undermine his 
legacy of anti-violence. He wants to be remembered with dignity, as a social 
transformer."<br>
</i>-- The Rev. Jesse Jackson
<P><i>"This is less about Tookie and more about the criminal justice system. We 
spend so much energy on young men of color, while corporate criminals who ruin 
millions of lives go unchallenged."<br>
</i>-- The Rev. Christopher Craethnenn, marching with anti-death penalty 
demonstrators 
<P>
<P><i>"Who's going to stop the killings now? Is (the governor) going to write 
some books? Is  he going to go down to L.A. and get some help and hope to the 
kids in the Crips?"<br>
</i>-- James Richards, San Francisco, a member of a group that works with 
young men in the Bayview neighborhood
<P><i>"The ones who went from predators to peacemakers, they are the only guys 
who can talk to these kids and make them listen."<br>
</i>-- Constance Rice, a civil rights lawyer and death penalty opponent
<P><i>The governor "clearly focused on the main issue: Is this person guilty? 
Beyond that, the other issues seemed to be academic.''<br>
</i>-- Michael Rushford of the pro-death penalty Criminal Justice Legal 
Foundation, on Schwarzenegger's refusal of clemency
