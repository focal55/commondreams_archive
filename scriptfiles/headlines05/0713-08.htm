<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->SAN DIEGO -- Two environmental activists who refused to testify to a federal grand jury investigating an arson fire in University City were ordered jailed by a judge who found them in contempt of court, it was reported Wednesday.

<p>David Agranoff, 31, and Danae Kelley, 21, were told by U.S. District Court Judge Irma Gonzalez that they will be released when they agree to testify, The San Diego Union-Tribune reported.

<p>They could be held until the grand jury term expires on Dec. 27, or longer if the term is extended, the newspaper reported.

<p>The grand jury is looking into the Aug. 1, 2003, fire at a condominium construction project that burned to the ground, causing $50 million in damage.

<p>Neighboring condominiums -- that were occupied -- were damaged by the extreme heat caused by the blaze.

<p>The Earth Liberation Front took responsibility for the blaze.

<p>Agranoff organized a speech later on the day of the fire by an activist who was also a convicted arsonist and Kelley was among several who attended, the newspaper said.

<p>Kelley and Agranoff told the Union-Tribune that they didn't know who started the condominium fire and believed it would violate their free speech rights to be forced to testify about the speech.

<p>Agranoff said he would testify in open court.

<p>A third person who had refused to testify, Michael Cardenas, changed his mind and said he left before the part of the speech investigators are interested in came up.

<p>Attorneys for the jailed activists said they would appeal.<p align="center">&copy; 2005 10-News.com</p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable --></font></td></tr>
