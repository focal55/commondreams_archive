<p>With increasing frequency, Christians are condemning U.S. military    
involvement in Iraq.
<p>     
   And the growing unrest among Christians threatens to erode President    
Bush's most loyal base.<p>     
   "We had no plan for making the peace. We continue as a superpower to    
be arrogant.  . . . And we have acted as though all is well, when, in    
fact, daily we have reports of suicide bombings and more disruptions in    
Iraq," said the Rev. Bob Edgar, general secretary of the National    
Council of Churches, a coalition of mainline    
Protestant and Orthodox denominations.<p>     
   "Just like with Hurricane Katrina, (Bush) doesn't want to hear    
people say `it didn't go well,' " said Edgar, a Democrat who was    
president of Claremont School of Theology from 1990 to 2000.<p>     
   In the buildup to war, Bush told Americans that Saddam Hussein    
had weapons of mass destruction. The despot has been deposed, but WMDs    
have not been found. U.S. troops remain in Iraq while the fledging    
government adopts a constitution and trains its own security force.<p>     
   "The president has said we will be in Iraq no longer than we are    
needed there," said White House spokesman Ken Lisaius. <p>     
   Two months after Bush declared major combat in Iraq completed in May    
2003, most Christians thought the United States had acted prudently,    
according to a poll by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life. <p>     
   Those agreeing with the military effort were 68 percent of white    
mainline Protestants, 74 percent of white Catholics and 79 percent of    
white evangelicals. Mainline denominations are those that originated in    
Europe and include Lutherans, Episcopalians and Methodists.<p>     
   The survey numbers fell during the following two years.<p>     
   A  poll last July by the Pew Forum showed 56    
percent o   
f white mainline Protestants and 54 percent o   
f white Catholics    
supported military involvement. Even among evangelicals, who helped Bush    
win re-election, support had fallen by 11 percentage points.<p>     
   Richard Cizik, vice president of governmental affairs for the    
National Association of Evangelicals, which did not publicly    
endorse the war but has been a Bush backer, seemed surprised Friday when    
he was told 68 percent of evangelicals still thought invading Iraq was    
the right thing to do.<p>     
   "It's probably attributable to general support of the president,"    
Cizik said.<p>     
   Many, though, are growing tired of reports of U.S. casualties.<p>     
   At the invitation of local anti-war activists, including Progressive    
Christians Uniting, Medea Benjamin is scheduled to speak    
this morning at Pilgrim Place, the Christian retirement community in    
Claremont. The 11 a.m. speech will be held in Decker Hall, 665 Avery    
Road.<p>     
   The anti-war crusader, who is not religious, has worked for years    
with interfaith groups promoting peace.<p>     
   "The teachings of all the major religions teach peace and tolerance,    
universal love. Unfortunately, we humans have strayed too much from    
those basic teachings, often in the name of those religions," said    
Benjamin, founding director of the human-rights group Global Exchange.<p>     
   In San Bernardino, up to 20 people  Jewish, Catholic, Quaker and    
Protestant  have held a vigil each Wednesday for the past month on E    
Street, behind City Hall.<p>     
   "From a religious perspective, this is not a just war," said the    
Rev. David Kalke of Central City Lutheran Mission in San    
Bernardino, a vigil organizer. "We haven't been attacked. The reason    
for going to war hasn't been substantiated. The lost of life has been    
tremendous on both sides."<p>     
   Nearly 1,900 U.S. troops have died in Iraq since March 2003.    
Thousands of insurgents and Iraqi civilians have, too.<p>     
   To be sure, many Christians opposed military action long before the    
conflict began. So changing attitudes shouldn't be attributed to new    
moral understandings, said John C. Green, a religion and politics    
expert at the University of Akron in Ohio.<p>     
   But Green said the practical argument against war has become more    
persuasive: No sign of WMDs, the Abu Ghraib prison scandal was an    
international embarrassment, states like Ohio and California are facing    
heavy casualties, and the Iraqi government is struggling to get off the    
ground.<p>     
   Christians still favor how Bush is handling Iraq more than the    
general public, where only two of five agree with the president, recent    
surveys show. Last month, before Hurricane Katrina made landfall, the    
president's job approval rating was 42 percent, according to an    
Associated Press/Ipsos poll.<p>     
   "Regardless of polls, he is going to continue to do what is right    
for the American people," said Lisaius, the White House spokesman.    
"This is something that transcends politics. This is about the safety    
or our country and the safety of people around the world."<p>     
   But Iraq also is another wedge issue for liberal and conservative    
Christians.<p>     
   "Evangelicals want to support this president and want to believe    
this war, in the long run, is going to make a big difference on behalf    
of democracy and freedom of religion and civil rights in the whole    
region," said Cizik.<p>     
   He does not believe Iraq is dividing Christians but said it    
eventually may.<p>     
   "But if the (Iraqi) constitution doesn't guarantee those rights, it    
might shed whole new light on what we are fighting for and dying for    
there."
