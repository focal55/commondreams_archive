        </table>Indeed, media outlets seem to be treading lightly in their coverage of such sensitive wartime topics for fear of being branded "anti-war" or angering the Pentagon, which has forbidden the publication of photos showing caskets of the war dead arriving in the United States.</p>
<p>

While more than 2,000 soldiers have been killed in Iraq since the conflict began, US military officials have tallied nearly 16,000 wounded, including 7,837 who were seriously injured.</p>
<p>

As for the wounded, US media outlets occasionally produce a feature story showing these soldiers adapting to their new lives. And a select few have highlighted the difficulties faced by returning soldiers who were wounded or maimed, including personal problems, professional struggles and difficulty in obtaining disability benefits.</p>
<p>

Among those calling attention to these struggles is Garry Trudeau, whose comic strip "Doonesbury" -- which appears in 140 US newspapers every day -- chronicles the recovery efforts of a wounded soldier who is battling depression.</p>
<p>

"When you've got a nation fighting a war and ... the one place in the mainstream media that seems to be doing the most about the wounded of that war is a comic strip, I think that speaks volumes," said Robert Thompson, director of the Center for the Study of Popular Television at Syracuse University.</p>
<p>

Leo Braudy, a professor at the University of Southern California and the author of a book on the military, said that soldiers with psychological problems are rarely spoken of.</p>
<p>

"The government generally wants to keep it under wraps," he said.</p>
<p>

"No 'Born on the 4th of July' stories anywhere in sight," Thompson said, referring to the 1989 film in which Tom Cruise plays a Vietnam War veteran and amputee who becomes a fierce anti-war protester.</p>

<p>

"Most stories have generally been uplifting celebrations of their bravery," he said, noting that with such a staggering number of wounded, "most stories are probably not nicely packageable in those kinds of terms."</p>
<p>

But Thompson said that media outlets' selectivity in determining coverage has little to do with their audience's comfort level or sensitivity.</p>
<p>

"There's no reason to believe if you had a whole bunch of really grisly stories -- and I'm sure there are grisly stories out there -- people wouldn't watch them," Thompson said.</p>
<p>

But "seeing the wounded might give people second thoughts, which is certainly not in the interest of a government pushing the war," Braudy pointed out.</p>
<p>

Several times, newspapers and television networks have even been taken to task for merely naming dead soldiers, with some slamming the move as a political ploy.</p>
