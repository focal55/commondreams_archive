<p> An American peace activist locked up in solitary confinement today instructed lawyers to appeal against the withdrawal of his visa.

<p>The Government has refused to explain why it now considers Scott Parkin - who is being held in solitary confinement in Melbourne Custudy Centre - to be a security threat.

<p>But Julian Burnside, QC, who is working with Greenpeace and Mr Parkin's lawyers on the case, said: "If all Mr Parkin has done to be assessed a security risk is to peacefully protest his opinions, then we are in serious trouble.

<p>"The Govenrment must answer, why is peaceful protesting in Australia enough to justify deporting Mr Parkin?

<p>"No Australian government should deport a person merely for their political beliefs.''

<p>In a statement this afternoon, Greenpeace - which is providing legal help to  Mr Parkin - said he had instructed his lawyers to appeal to the Migration Review Tribunal to review the basis on which his visa was withdrawn.

<p>Greenpeace campaigns director Danny Kennedy said: "The burden of proof in the Scott Parkin expulsion case lies morally with the Commonwealth, to prove that he is a danger.
<p>"When the Government brought in anti-terror legislation, they promised the public that these laws would only be used to confront a real and present risk of a terrorist attack, not a sweep-all approach against citizens.

<p>"Peace is not terrorism. Peace is not a threat to national security. No democratic government should expel a foreign citizen because [it] opposes his political opinions."

<p>Mr Burnside said he wanted to know why it took Australian authorities so long to act if Mr Parkin was indeed a security threat.

<p>He told smh.com.au Mr Parkin had been in Australia for six weeks and had only participated in peaceful protest against the war in Iraq.

<p>"The question then is, has he got an adverse security assessment because he's advocating peace, or something he did before he came to Australia?'' the barrister said.

<p>"If it is because of something he did before he came to Australia, why did they give him a visa in the first place? And if it is because of something he's done in Australia, why won't they tell him what it is?"

<p>Mr Burnside said national security legislation could render any legal challenge useless.

<p>"We have the position where the Government won't tell him what he's done and in litigation can refuse to allow evidence to show what he's done.

<p>"So he's in the position where he can be held indefinitely while he challenges this but may find out nothing about why he's being held," he said.

<p>Mr Parkin was detained as he left a Melbourne cafe on Saturday morning, just hours before he was to deliver a workshop on non-violent protesting which was sponsored by the Pt'chang Non-violence Community Safety Group. (Pt'chang is supposedly the sound that having a good idea makes.)

<p>The group's organiser, Iain Murray, said he had been the only non-legal representative to see Mr Parkin in custody.

<p>"He's perplexed and baffled as to why he is considered a national security threat, considering that all he has done has been to hold workshops on non-violent activism and participate in street theatre," Mr Murray said.

<p>"I feel confident that nothing that Scott has done in Australia could possibly constitute a threat to national security in Australia," he said.

<p>The Pt'chang group asked Mr Parkin to run a workshop because the organisation Mr Parkin works for, the Houston Global Awareness Collective, was committed to non-violence, Mr Murray said.

<p>An advertisement for the planned workshop said the Houston Global Awareness Collective advocated "people power" as a means to "exact social, political and economic cost on Halliburton for their operations in Iraq".

<p>Mr Murray said ASIO had contacted Mr Parkin last Wednesday by phone and requested an interview with him.

<p>"[Mr Parkin] asked if it would affect his stay in Australia and [ASIO] wouldn't tell him. He also asked if he was required to attend an interview and they said no, he wasn't. So he decided not to [be interviewed]."

<p>Mr Parkin had been arrested in the United States at a protest against Exxon Mobile while he was "dressed as a fluffy tiger", Mr Murray said.
However, he did not know what he had been charged with.
