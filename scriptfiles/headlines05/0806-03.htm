<p>At night, Akiko Takakura has the same dreams, ones in which she sees bodies floating in her local swimming pool, or hanging from trees, the images that confronted her when she regained consciousness and saw what she calls "the city of death". Nobody who survived Hiroshima 60 years ago today was closer to the explosion than Mrs Takakura, and she holds a special place in a group of "hibakusha" - the atomic people. 
<p>The nightmares that have stayed with her are understandable, but probably the mildest manifestation of the physical and mental scars that remain with many of those who survived. Some hibakusha have only started to talk publicly about their experiences in the last decade. Although they now receive special state welfare provision and much public attention, for many years after the war they were stigmatized. Women, in particular, found it hard to marry. 
<p>"They used to call women like me a 'pikadon girl' or an 'atomic girl'," said Kinuko Laskey, who was 16 when she was caught in the blast. "They would say, you don't know what sort of a baby she will give birth to. Others said that the radiation could be genetically transmitted or was even contagious." 
<p>Mrs Laskey attempted suicide several times before marrying a Canadian serviceman and emigrating to Vancouver. The explosion split open one of her eyes and drove hundreds of shards of glass into her body. For a whole year her mother covered up reflective surfaces, including pans, to prevent her daughter from seeing her disfigurement. By the time of her death last year, she had had numerous operations that had eventually made the visible damage almost indiscernible. 
<p>Flashbacks, hyper-vigilance and poor sleep have been reported among hibakusha. Many survivors become very anxious when talking about their experiences, as if they are stepping back into the horrors they are describing. 
<p>In Japan, where discussing mental illness is taboo, both doctors and survivors play down the possibility that some victims of Hiroshima might still be suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, emphasizing instead the desolation caused by losing loved ones and the anticipatory fear of radiation-related illness. 
<p>One former soldier described without irony how he had avoided being traumatized by drinking heavily. "Hearing people shouting 'help' is something I dreamt about for a long time. But now it has been over 60 years and I seem to dream less," he says. Others still have to cope with physical effects associated with radiation. Leukemia clusters first began to appear in 1953, lung cancer in 1960. Teruko Fujii was a 16-year-old girl in charge of driving a tram when the bomb struck. Afterwards, she suffered from long spells of debilitating lethargy. 
<p>Then a striking young woman, she watched her skin age prematurely from the effect of a thyroid disorder. Both her children have thyroid-related poor health; and although a proud mother, she sometimes wonders whether it was selfish to have had them. 
<p>Beyond the mental and physical effects, the survivors still express macabre wonderment at the explosion itself, and incredulity that they managed to live through it. "The light was startling," says Shuntaro Hida. "Even if you had your back turned to it, you felt the shock go through, right to the center of your brain. Such intense heat." 
<p>A military doctor at the time, he was in a village four miles from the hypocenter - the point directly below the explosion - and saw the blast washing towards him over the intervening hills "like an avalanche". Even at that distance out, he was struck with enough force to throw him back through the building.  
<p>Mrs Takakura was working in the Bank of Hiroshima, just 260 meters away from the hypocenter, and was knocked unconscious by the blast the instant she saw the flash. It is possible that the configuration of the concrete pillars in the building deflected the full monstrous effect of that initial burst of gamma and heat radiation.  
<p>Outside it vaporized bodies, etching their shadows on to metal and stone surfaces. About 40,000 people are thought to have died instantly. "People ask me how I survived. I find it strange too," she says. "People that had been walking the streets were doubled up dead over each other for as far as we could see. They had died immediately. Naked. Burnt. I just asked myself, why?" Like many survivors she believed that successfully educating the young about the horrors of war could be a way of extracting something positive from the experience. Her first attempts to teach nursery school children ended in failure, though. "I had parents coming up to me and saying, 'My child won't sleep at night. He is terrified of nuclear bombs'," she says. "And so I learned to explain it more gently." 
<p>The Hiroshima that has risen from the ashes is now a vibrant city of 1.1 million people. Far more than Nagasaki, it has kept the bomb at the center of its identity. At some stage every Japanese schoolchild will visit the eerily effective Peace Museum, and absorb the slogan: No more Hiroshimas. In Japan as a whole, the focus on the bomb as an almost divine power descending in final judgment on the futility of war has obscured Japan's own agency in it.  
<p>The survivors were more circumspect; they knew that Japanese soldiers had committed horrific atrocities in China and the Pacific. Many in Hiroshima, even doctors, were being trained as suicide bombers to mount a last ditch defense against American invasion. 
<p>Though more people - 100,000 - died in the first mass firebombing of Tokyo in March 1945 than the estimated 80,000 on the first day of the atomic attack, there will always be something distinctive about what happened in Hiroshima. It is summed up in a recurring dream that Mrs Takakura has.  
<p>"I dream that the bomb has been dropped again," she says. "And I think this time I will get away from it. I decide that I shall escape, and then I wake up. It is impossible to escape from a nuclear bomb, but I suppose that is a desire making itself apparent in my dream."
