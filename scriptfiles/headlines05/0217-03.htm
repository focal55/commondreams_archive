<p> TEHRAN -- Iran said on Thursday a brief worldwide scare over a blast near its only nuclear reactor was engineered by Washington as part of "psychological warfare" against Tehran and its nuclear program.

<P>Iranian television sent waves through world markets on Wednesday when it reported an explosion and cited witnesses saying it may have been caused by a plane firing a missile. The report raised fears of a strike by Israel or the United States, which accuses Tehran of secretly developing nuclear arms.

<P>Washington denied any knowledge of the blast. The Al-Alam station, broadcasting in Arabic, later dropped the reference to the missile and said a fuel tank might have fallen from a plane.

<P>After oil markets ticked up and the U.S. stock market briefly dropped, Iranian officials quelled concern by announcing the blast was linked to construction of a dam.

<P>Iran's Chief nuclear negotiator, Hassan Rohani, saw a calculated campaign by the United States and the Western media which acted on the Al-Alam report.

<P>"This fuss over an explosion shows that they use any excuse to attract attention toward Iran's nuclear program," Rohani told state television.

<P>"Reports of a strike were false and are psychological warfare."

<P>The explosion was reported near the town of Dailam 100 miles from the Russian-built Bushehr nuclear plant.

<P>Washington accuses Tehran of pursuing atomic weapons. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has said that a U.S. attack on Iran is not imminent but that the option remains available.

<P>Israel, which like its U.S. ally accuses Iran of trying to build nuclear arms, said on Wednesday Iran was six months away from having the knowledge to build a bomb.

<P>Iran says its nuclear facilities would only be used for peaceful purposes.

<P>In the past, Israel has warned Iran of possible pre-emptive military attacks on its nuclear facilities similar to Iraq's Osiraq reactor in 1981 that caused a blow to Saddam Hussein's nuclear program.

<P>CONSEQUENCES OF STRIKE

<P>Economic Analyst Saeed Leylaz said Tehran and Washington may be examining global consequences of a possible U.S. military strike on Iran's nuclear facilities.

<P>"Iran wanted to warn America of economic outcomes of any attack on the country's nuclear facilities," Leylaz told Reuters.

<P>As the blast occurred at a time of heightened tension between Washington and Tehran, the report jolted both the oil market and stock market.

<P>"The result showed that a real strike can shake the world."

<P>Intelligence Minister Ali Yunesi said on Wednesday Washington was using satellites to gather evidence of Iran's nuclear program.

<P>The Washington Post, citing information from unnamed U.S. officials, reported this week that the United States had been flying into Iran looking for evidence of nuclear weapons programs.

<P>The pilotless planes flew into Iran from U.S. military bases in Iraq using radar, photography and air filters to detect traces of nuclear activity, the newspaper said.

<P>Iran's Defense Minister Ali Shamkhani said Iran would strongly counter any attack.
