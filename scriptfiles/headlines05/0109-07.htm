<p>COLUMBUS, Ohio - The state's chief elections officer, already accused of mishandling the presidential vote in Ohio and criticized for backing President Bush, sent <a href="http://rawstory.rawprint.com/105/blackwell_campaign_letter_105.php" target="_new">a fund-raising letter </a>for his 2006 gubernatorial campaign in which he asks for illegal corporate contributions.</p>

Secretary of State Kenneth Blackwell, a Republican who co-chaired the Bush-Cheney campaign in Ohio, said the request for corporate checks was an oversight. His spokesman, Carlo LoParo, said Saturday that any corporate donations would be returned.
<p>In <a href="http://rawstory.rawprint.com/105/blackwell_campaign_letter_105.php" target="_new">the five-page letter</a> to GOP donors and activists, Blackwell said, "And with your help, I intend to provide fresh, new leadership and bold reforms to Ohio as our next Republican Governor."</p>
<p>A pledge card that accompanied the letter said "corporate & personal checks are welcome." Corporate donations are illegal in Ohio.</p>
<p>Jeff Ledbetter, fund-raising coordinator for Blackwell's gubernatorial campaign, blamed a printer for using a template for an issue committee, which is allowed to accept corporate donations.</p>
<p>He told The Columbus Dispatch for a story Saturday that no corporate donations have been received in response to the letter.</p>
<p>Blackwell's letter also praises Republicans for helping deliver Ohio to Bush.</p>
<p>U.S. Rep. John Conyers, a Democrat from Michigan who prepared a report on election problems in Ohio, said the letter supports suspicions that Blackwell's actions as secretary of state during the election "stemmed from partisan political motivations" to help Bush.</p>
<p>Conyers said in a statement that the letter "evidences Secretary Blackwell's poor judgment at best, and the manipulation of election administration for partisan purposes, at worst."</p>
<p>A group of voters who claim election fraud have challenged Bush's 118,500-vote victory in Ohio with the Ohio Supreme Court. The voters, who are supported by the Rev. Jesse Jackson, have cited irregularities including long lines for voters, a shortage of voting machines in minority precincts and problems with computer equipment.</p>
<p>Blackwell has rejected the criticism. As a Republican election official, he said he is permitted to campaign for Bush and that Ohio's election system has checks and balances to ensure fair elections.</p>
