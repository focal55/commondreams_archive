<p> WASHINGTON -- A classified report by nuclear experts assembled by the National Academy of Sciences has challenged the decision by federal regulators to allow commercial nuclear facilities to store large quantities of radioactive spent fuel in pools of water.

<P>The report concluded that the government does not fully understand the risks that a terrorist attack could pose to the pools and ought to expedite the removal of the fuel to dry storage casks that are more resilient to attack.

<P>The Bush administration has defended the safety of the pools, and the nuclear industry has warned that moving fuel to dry storage would be unnecessary and expensive.

<P>The report was requested by Congress after the terrorist attacks of Sept 11, 2001.

<P>Because it is classified, the contents of the report were not made public when it was delivered to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission last summer. Even a stripped-down, declassified version has remained under wraps because the NRC says it contains sensitive information.

<P>However, the commission made excerpts of the report public when Chairman Nils Diaz sent a letter to Congress on March 14 rebutting some of the academy's concerns.

<P>William Colglazier, executive officer for the academy, said the letter was misleading and warned that the public needs to learn about the report's findings.

<P>"There are substantive disagreements between our committee's views and the NRC," he said in an interview. "If someone only reads the NRC report, they would not get a full picture of what we had to say."

<P>Officials who have seen the document suggest the NRC is merely suppressing embarrassing criticism.

<P>"At the same time that the NRC is saying that the National Academy's study is classified and not releasable to the public, it has somehow managed to send a detailed rebuttal of the report's conclusions to Congress in unclassified form," said Rep. Ed Markey, D-Mass., who has seen the report.

<P>Commission spokesman Eliot Brenner said the commission is working with the academy to make the report public. "Our core concern is making sure that information that could reasonably be expected to be available to a terrorist is not publicly available," he said.

<P>The report was solicited by Congress to study how best to store spent nuclear fuel -- tons of rods containing radioactive byproducts of nuclear fission reactions are produced each year by the nation's 103 electricity- generating nuclear reactors. Spent fuel rods generate intense heat and dangerous long-term radiation that must be contained.

<P>Most of the spent rods are now stored in large structures called spent fuel pools, said Dave Lochbaum, a nuclear safety engineer with the advocacy group, Union of Concerned Scientists. The pools are filled with about 100,000 gallons of water to remove heat and shield radiation, he said.

<P>After cooling for about five years, the rods can be moved to dry storage -- heavy casks of lead and steel. But the casks are expensive, and commercial reactors have elected to leave the rods in the pools until the pools fill up. Lochbaum said some pools now hold 800 to 1,000 tons of rods. In the event of a terrorist strike, Lochbaum said, the dry casks would be much safer, because explosions could drain the pools and set off fire and radiation hazards.

<P>The nuclear industry wants the fuel moved to a storage site in Nevada, but that project has long been plagued by delays and opposition. Steven Kraft, director of waste management at the Nuclear Energy Institute, an industry group, said studies had shown the pools are as safe as the dry casks -- the same position adopted by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

<P>Kraft said the risk of catastrophic attacks is minuscule and modeling analyses have shown that even plane crashes are unlikely to affect the integrity of the pools.
