Heritage Day celebrates the reading in Easton. </P><P> Lawton was one of about seven anti-war protesters who were told by police they could not pass out leaflets at Sunday's event. </P><P> The leaflets say leaders from the National Council of Churches have sent a statement to President Bush opposing the war. </P><P> "The statement sent to President Bush, charged, 'It has become clear that the rationale for invasion was at best a tragic mistake, at worst a clever deception,'" the leaflet says. </P><P> After conferring with police, the group was told it could distribute the leaflets at Heritage Day's two entrances, said Peter Crownfield, of Bethlehem. </P><P> Laurie Spalholz, of Bethlehem, said the group would consult its lawyer on the matter. </P><P> She said it was ironic that Heritage Day organizers allowed a booth labeled "Water Wars" and yet the protesters wearing T-shirts promoting peace were barred from the event. </P><P> Last week, the Heritage Day organizing committee told the group it could not have a booth at the festival. </P><P> "Now they're denying us the right to stand around with this T-shirt on," said Richard Forbes, a Pohatcong Township councilman. </P><P> Lawton said police were instructed by Heritage Day officials to keep the protesters from handing out the leaflets. Police declined to comment Sunday on the matter and Heritage Day officials could not be reached Sunday night. </P><P> Heritage Day's new location on Larry Holmes Drive drew mixed reactions from the event's attendees. </P><P> Joseph Sergei, of Easton, said moving the event by the Delaware River cut down on traffic and provided a better area for the event. </P><P> Easton resident Julisa Santiago said Heritage Day was bigger and better this year. </P><P> "I like it because it's closer to the fireworks and you can walk to the fireworks," said Anne Marie Santiago, 10. </P><P> But William Bilts said this year's Heritage Day was too small. </P><P> "This ain't nothing," he said. </P><P> The Easton man said he has come to Heritage Day for years, and the event seems like it gets smaller each year. </P><P> Jeanne Walsh said Heritage Day did not have enough events for children this year, such as face painting. </P><P> Carol Brown, of Easton, said she would rather the city "put our tax money to better use." </P><P> Walsh concurred, saying the city needs to pave her street and invest in community policing projects. <p align="CENTER">&copy; 2005 The Express Times</p><p align="CENTER">###</p><!-- #EndEditable --></font></td></tr>
