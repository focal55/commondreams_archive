<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --> LONDON - Families of British soldiers killed in Iraq staged a vigil Wednesday outside Prime Minister Tony Blair's office, demanding a public inquiry into why Britain joined the U.S.-led war.

<p>Several protesters had spent the night in several tents erected on the sidewalk opposite Downing Street, some clutching photographs of their sons killed on duty in Iraq. The protest came as a British soldier was killed Wednesday by a roadside bomb in the Basra region of southern Iraq - bringing the British death toll to 97 since the war started in 2003.

<p>"Every time you turn on the telly and see that another soldier has died it just reminds you of our own boys being killed," said Rose Gentle, whose 19-year-old son Gordon was killed in June last year.

<p>The families are also supporting a campaign by former Cabinet minister Clare Short to force the government to gain the approval of parliament before committing British troops to military action. Currently the executive can authorize war without parliamentary approval.

<p>Short resigned from her post as international development secretary following the U.S.-led invasion.
