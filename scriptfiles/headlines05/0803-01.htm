<p>WASHINGTON - The U.S. military, struggling to fill its voluntary ranks, is 
offering to allow recruits to meet part of their military obligations by 
serving in the Peace Corps, which has resisted any ties to the Defense 
Department or U.S. intelligence agencies since its founding in 1961.

        <!--/endimage/--> The recruitment program has sparked debate and rising opposition among 
current and former Peace Corps officials. Some welcome it as a way to expand 
the cadre of idealistic volunteers created by former President John Kennedy. 
But many say it could lead to suspicions abroad that the Peace Corps, which 
has 7,733 workers in 73 countries, is working together with the U.S. armed 
forces.
<P>"Does this raise red flags for the Peace Corps community? I'd say yes  -- 
emphatically so," said Kevin Quigley, president of the National Peace Corps 
Association, an organization of returned volunteers, staff and supporters. "We 
think a real or perceived linkage between the Peace Corps and military service 
could damage the Peace Corps and potentially put the safety of Peace Corps 
volunteers at risk."
<P>Congress authorized the recruitment program three years ago in 
legislation that drew little attention at the time but is stirring controversy 
now, for two reasons: The military has begun to promote it, and the day is 
drawing closer when the first batch of about 4,300 recruits will be eligible 
to apply to the Peace Corps, after having spent 3 1/2 years in the armed 
forces. That could happen as early as 2007.
<P>Two longtime proponents of national service programs, Sens. John McCain, 
R-Ariz., and Evan Bayh, D-Ind., devised the legislation "to provide Americans 
with more opportunities to serve their country," said Bayh spokeswoman Meghan 
Keck. 
<P>Several former Peace Corps leaders said they hope Congress and the Bush 
administration will scuttle the program.
<P>"Democratic and Republican administrations alike have kept a bright line 
separating the Peace Corps from short-term foreign and security policies," 
said Mark Schneider, head of the Peace Corps during the last two years of the 
Clinton administration. "Blurring that sharp line is a bad idea, particularly 
now, given the unfortunate rise in anti-American sentiment following the Iraq 
war."
<P>After the law went into effect in 2003, the Defense Department was slow 
to promote the option but is now energetically flogging the "National Call to 
Service" program, recruiters said.
<P>Recruits in all the services are eligible for a $5,000 cash bonus or 
repayment of $18,000 in student loans if they agree to spend three months in 
boot camp, 15 months on active duty and two years in the Reserves or National 
Guard. After that, they can fulfill the remainder of their eight-year military 
obligation in the Individual Ready Reserves  --  available for call-up, but 
without regular drilling duties  --  or by serving in the Peace Corps or 
Americorps, the domestic national service program.

<P>Peace Corps Director Gaddi Vasquez emphasized that recruits have no 
guarantee of being accepted into the Peace Corps. They can apply upon 
completion of their active duty and Reserve or National Guard service, he said,
but will receive no preferential treatment.
<P>In 2004 and the first five months of this year, 4,301 people entered the 
armed services under the National Call to Service program. Pentagon and Peace 
Corps officials said they have no way of knowing how many will apply to the 
Peace Corps when they become eligible to do so in 2007 or 2008. The Peace 
Corps already receives about 12,000 applications to fill about 4,000 openings 
each year.</p>
