<p> A diplomat looking at the Middle East today might observe that democracy's glass is partly full or, perhaps, partly empty. The level does seem to have moved. The debate is: by how much and who is responsible? Regardless, talk of an Arabian spring is premature.

<P>More than seven weeks after 8 million Iraqis courageously stared down the bombers and gunmen to vote in their first free elections in half a century, they still didn't have a proper government as their new National Assembly was scheduled to convene in Baghdad yesterday.

<P>In the Lebanese capital the latest in a series of powerful tit-for-tat street demonstrations on Monday drew an estimated "million" protesters against Syrian occupation of their country and their lives.

<P>It was a response to the "hundreds of thousands" of pro-Damascus demonstrators who took to the same streets last week to counter the "tens of thousands" who earlier had forced the resignation of the Syrian-dominated Lebanese cabinet and pushed the rattled Syrians to talk of withdrawing troops and spies from Lebanon.

<P>Baghdad and Beirut, then, are two sides of the same coin.

<P>The Baghdad impasse is a troubling reminder that elections don't necessarily guarantee democracy in communities in which religion and tribes have dominated for centuries. But at the same time, the Beirut marches are proof, just as potent as the Iraq and Afghanistan election turnouts, of a desire for change in the masses.

<P>Writing in the Jerusalem Post, the Arab scholar Amir Taheri focused on this hunger: "... we are witnessing a new kind of citizens' movement, an Arab version of people power ... concerned ... with the real deficiencies of contemporary Arab societies. In almost every case the key demand is for a greater say for the people in deciding the affairs of the nation."

<P>The difficulty now is sensing what any change today might deliver in the future. Some have likened what is happening in the Middle East to the sudden collapse of the Arab equivalent of the Berlin Wall. But as Thomas Friedman put it in The New York Times: "[It'll] fall one bloody brick at a time and, unfortunately, Vaclav Havel, Lech Walesa and Solidarity are not waiting to jump into our arms on the other side."

<P>Friedman dealt with the absence of agents of change, but looking into the future, Taheri addressed the more daunting presence of obstacles to change: "It is not at all certain that the ruling elites will have the intelligence to manage the difficult transition from autocracy to pluralism.

<P>"Nor is it certain that the budding democratic movement would produce a leadership capable of mixing resolve with moderation. The deep-rooted Arab tradition of political extremism may prove harder to dissipate than one imagines."

<P>President George Bush advisedly goes no further than claiming "a thaw has begun". But others are making triumphant claims of "victory", "vindication" and even "validation" on his behalf ... from his invasion of Iraq to his "freedom's march" rhetoric.

<P>But this series of events in the Middle East, which is being packaged as an Arabian spring, is more a fluke of timing than what some would have us believe is Washington's excellent management of events. The Lebanese crowds took to the streets because of a murder that no one suggests was orchestrated by the US; and Palestinians had the opportunity to vote in January because of the death of Yasser Arafat.

<P>Iraqis were able to go to the polls after their country was invaded on false pretences and on the insistence of the aged and bearded Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani who refused to see elections delayed. If it had been left to Washington, Iraqis now would have appointed (i.e. unelected) delegates writing up a new national constitution under US guidance and they would not have been to the polls yet.

<P>Developments being hailed as democratic breakthroughs in Saudi Arabia and Egypt are more likely to be sops to Western demands for reform by two countries that are staunch US allies in what remains one of the most autocratic corners of the world.

<P>The Saudi dictatorship claimed a brave new world in February when it allowed men only to vote for about half the membership of new municipal councils - the other half would be appointed by the regime. Despite the vast resources and authority in the hands of this immensely rich regime, Saudi officials insisted it just wasn't possible for women to vote as they had done in communities traumatised by decades of war and/or poverty in Iraq, Palestine and Afghanistan.

<P>Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak presented himself as a model of reform when he announced that instead of the rubber-stamp referendum that has endorsed him as the sole candidate for the presidency for more than 20 years, he would allow others to stand against him in a proper election in September - even as one of his likely opponents languished in prison (he was freed this week) amid speculation that Mubarak had other means at his disposal to block or weaken challengers.

<P>And in a classic dog-eat-dog play, Riyadh and Cairo then tried to direct attention away from their own unsavoury pits by chorusing Washington's demand that Syria get out of Lebanon.

<P>It might sound churlish, but ruthless head-choppers operate on both sides of the Arab fence - the Iraqi insurgents release videos; but walk into Riyadh's Chop Chop Square on the right day and you'll see hooded agents of a medieval regime doing it to wrongdoers before the public.

<P>Elections alone, or the pale imitations offered by the Saudis or the Egyptians, are not enough. Arabs will not have the fruits of democracy unless they win the other freedoms that we take for granted - human rights, education, press, commerce and the rest.

<P>It is instructive that while they are the Arab nations closest to the US, both the Saudis and the Egyptians languish on the bottom half of a regional Freedom Index published this week by the Economist Intelligence Unit.

<P>The trouble in the region is, on the one hand nothing is as it seems; and on the other it all is exactly as it seems.

<P>Bahrain is held up as an Arab democratic trend-setter, but despite allowing women to vote in parliamentary elections three years ago, three bloggers were jailed last month for insulting Bahrain's Sunni royal family and the 70 per cent Shiite majority complains that an upper house whose entire membership is by royal appointment leaves it without a voice.

<P>But be careful of what you wish for, too. Violence in Iraq is back to pre-election levels. Also, US officials are reportedly anxious that a post-poll momentum in Iraq is eroding.

<P>The religious Shiites did best in the Iraqi election just as they did in the phoney polls in neighbouring Saudi Arabia; and, if they get the chance, they have the numbers and the backing to do well in Lebanon and Syria.

<P>On US National Public Radio last week, Professor Fouad Ajami, of Johns Hopkins University, defended Bush by referring listeners to a November 2003 speech: "The President himself, in a startling mea culpa, said that for 60 years we had preferred stability, but we tried to buy stability at the expense of freedom, and it did not work."

<P>Fast-forward 16 months and it's no surprise that Washington is waving a fist at Tehran and Damascus. But the autocratic Saudis, who keep order in the global oil market, still get reverential treatment; and the Egyptians, who broke ranks and signed a peace treaty with Israel, still collect $US2 billion ($2.53 billion) a year in US aid and play host to terrorism suspects whisked to their dubious care by the CIA.

<P>Chris Toensing, the editor of Middle East Report, couldn't help noticing how Bush addressed the different people of the Middle East in his State of the Union address in February.

<P>In Beirut's Daily Star he wrote: "Bush predicted that 'the victory of freedom in Iraq' would 'inspire democratic reformers from Damascus to Tehran' - the capitals of Syria and Iran. In those states that are 'against us', he expects that democratic change will come from the long-suffering populations.

<P>"Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, 'can demonstrate its leadership in the region by expanding the role of its people in determining their future. And the great and proud nation of Egypt, which showed the way towards peace in the Middle East, can now show the way towards democracy in the Middle East'."

<P>"In these allied, undemocratic states, Bush trusts the regimes to lead their benighted subjects on the road to redemption, just as previous presidents have always done, and always in vain."

<P>The Bush rhetoric undoubtedly is a comfort to some in the streets of Beirut.

<P>But the President didn't send an army to Baghdad for the sake of ordinary Iraqis' freedom, and the real test of his mettle will come if someone snaps in Riyadh or Cairo and mounts a savage crackdown on those who dare to go too far in their quest for freedom.

<P>All Bush's talk of freedom and the veneer of human-rights pleading that now cloaks the failed case for war against Saddam Hussein put a heavy new responsibility on Washington. In 1991 George Bush snr did nothing as Saddam killed thousands who heeded American urging to revolt against Baghdad. And the Arab democracy advocates who emerged in the wake of the collapse of the Soviet Union were squashed by the regimes they sought to change as the world looked elsewhere in the 1990s. Neither can be allowed to happen again.

<P>Now, thanks to September 11 and the much-maligned Al-Jazeera and the other new Arab TV channels, the region is transfixed by the fact that there was an election in Iraq. Others want some of what the Iraqis are having, but only time will tell if it is a step towards their future or their past.

<P>Iraq without Saddam has yet to show that it might avoid ethnic and religious strife and descent into full-blown civil war.

<P>Will Lebanon without the Syrians be any different to the terrible years of Lebanon without the French? Can life after Arafat really translate to life after Israeli occupation for the Palestinians?

<P>Too often today's news cycles demand a 10-day assessment of the historical implication of events. But in the Middle East there is good reason, especially when the US is involved, to opt for a 10-year assessment.

<P>This is because apart from West Germany and Japan, only two of the 16 US-led efforts in nation-rebuilding in the last century - tiny Panama and Grenada without a barrel of oil between them - continued to function as democracies 10 years later.
