<p>Even after tobacco companies had pledged to become more responsible about the public health effects of cigarettes, industry executives were attempting to undermine a landmark 1996 scientific study showing a direct genetic link between smoking and lung cancer, a new report concludes.

<P>The report by UCSF researchers found that tobacco companies funded research designed to cast doubt on the study -- and then used their ties with the editor of a peer-reviewed scientific journal to have the articles published, without disclosing the authors' or editor's connections to the tobacco industry.

<P>Both studies were published in the journal Mutagenesis, owned by Oxford University Press. Its then-editor in chief, James Parry, received tobacco industry funding from 1986 until at least 2001, including 600 British pounds in 1993 for consulting work from British American Tobacco, the UCSF report says.

<P>The report illustrates just how inconsistently science and medical journals were requiring conflict-of-interest disclosures as recently as four years ago.

<P>The UCSF report is based on once-secret tobacco industry documents that were preserved as a result of a 1998 federal court tobacco lawsuit settlement and archived by anti-smoking activist Stanton Glantz, a UCSF professor of medicine. Glantz is the lead author of the report being published today in The Lancet, a British medical journal.

<P>"The tobacco companies have been running corporate responsibility campaigns. They claim they have repudiated their past,'' Glantz said in an interview. "This shows that's just a lie. It's exactly the same kind of thing they did in the past, and it's happening now."

<P>A spokeswoman for Philip Morris USA, one of the companies implicated in the report, said the company "agrees with the overwhelming scientific consensus that smoking causes lung cancer and heart disease." But she declined to comment on the specific charges in the UCSF report.

<P>The UCSF researchers looked at the tobacco industry's response to a landmark 1996 study that demonstrated a direct genetic link between smoking and lung cancer.

<P>Scientists at the Beckman Research Institute in Duarte (Los Angeles County) found in lab experiments that a component of tobacco smoke, called benzoapyrene, causes mutations in a gene known as p53. The damage to the p53 gene precisely mirrored the damage seen in the genetic tissue of smokers who had died from lung cancer.

<P>P53 is a so-called tumor suppressor gene that helps prevent cancerous growths. When the p53 gene is damaged, it can lead to uncontrolled cell growth. Mutations in the p53 gene are implicated in more than 50 percent of all human cancers and 60 percent of lung cancers.

<P>Even before the study was published, tobacco company executives had taken a keen interest in p53. For years, the companies had argued in product liability lawsuits and elsewhere that the link between smoking and lung cancer was just a statistical association that had never been proven directly.

<P>The 1996 study was the first to prove the actual molecular mechanism by which cigarette smoke caused cells to grow into tumors. The finding offered a powerful tool that could be used in litigation and regulation of tobacco use, to connect a patient's disease to its specific cause. The industry would be left with little defense.

<P>In the late 1990s, the major tobacco companies negotiated a $206 billion master settlement of lawsuits brought by 46 states to pay for the costs of smoking-related health care. As part of that process, tobacco companies pledged to become better corporate citizens.

<P>Most began acknowledging the link between smoking and lung and heart disease. In the words of Phillip Morris USA, they pledged to "support a single, consistent public health message on the role played by cigarette smoking in the development of disease in smokers.''

<P>Nonetheless, tobacco industry executives tried to downplay the significance of the 1996 study on smoking and p53, the UCSF report found, and also launched studies designed to contradict its findings. The UCSF report focuses on two studies whose results were published and their author's ties to industry not disclosed.

<P>In one, David Cooper, a geneticist at the University of Wales medical school, published a critique of the 1996 paper arguing that the California researchers lacked sufficient comparisons to nonsmokers with lung cancer. He charged that their conclusions were nothing more than unsubstantiated conjecture.

<P>Cooper had received research funding from the British American Tobacco company as early as 1993, the UCSF researchers found. His industry ties were not disclosed as part of his critique, published in the July 1998 issue of Mutagenesis.

<P>Another study was conducted by Thilo Paschke, an employee of a private institute managed by the German Association of Cigarette Manufacturers. He argued that among smokers and nonsmokers who had died of lung cancer, there was no statistically significant difference in the types of p53 mutations.

<P>His article was published in the November 2000 issue of Mutagenesis, which did not disclose his employment by the German tobacco industry.

<P>Perhaps the most serious finding in the UCSF report was the tobacco industry ties of James Parry, Mutagenesis' founding editor, the journal's principal gatekeeper. In addition to hiding his industry ties from the journal's readers, the UCSF researchers found that Parry had suggested strategies to the tobacco industry for discrediting the p53 study.

<P>Parry's relationship with the tobacco industry was brought to the attention of the Oxford University Press in April 2001. The company began requiring authors to disclose potential conflicts of interest and asked its editors to sign a conflict of interest statement. Parry stepped down as editor in chief in 2001 but remains on the journal's editorial board.

<P>Officials of the Oxford University Press could not be reached for further comment.

<P>The UCSF report comes as the University of California is grappling with whether to ban its researchers from accepting tobacco industry funding. Some UC officials say the issue is one of academic freedom, and that faculty should be free to accept tobacco industry grants as long as the funding is disclosed.

<P>But Glantz favors a university-wide ban. His latest findings, he said, demonstrate how the tobacco industry is using its funding of medical research "to promote confusion rather than enlightenment ... and that goes against the basic mission of the university." <p align="center">Copyright &copy; 2005 San Francisco Chronicle</p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable --></font></td></tr>
