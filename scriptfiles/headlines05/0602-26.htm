<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><P>WASHINGTON, D.C. - Doctors and insurance companies are wrong to blame the U.S. medical malpractice crisis on a supposed explosion of lawsuits and skyrocketing jury awards, say new studies.</p><p>"Doctors' malpractice premiums have been rising, but the contention that increased patient claims and higher jury verdicts have anything to do with the rate hikes is false," said Douglas Heller, Executive Director of the advocacy group Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights (FTCR).</p><p>Rather, said Heller, "it is time to shift the focus away from limits on patients' legal rights and onto insurance industry reform."</p><p>The Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF), a private charity specializing in healthcare issues, says in a report issued Tuesday that claims payments have increased only 1.7 percent per year after adjusting for inflation over the past 12 years and actually have fallen an average of 2.4 percent per year since 2001.</p><p>The findings contradict insurance industry lobbyists and the American Medical Association (AMA), the U.S. doctors' trade group, who for years have urged federal and state lawmakers to limit medical malpractice liability in an effort to rein in runaway insurance premiums.</p><p>''The KFF study illustrates that the key arguments made in the name of justifying legal limits do not fit the facts,'' the foundation said in a statement.</p><p>According to the study, in 1991-2003, the number of malpractice claims fell from 25.2 per thousand physicians to 18.8 claims. The total inflation-adjusted annual payout for medical malpractice claims increased from &#36;2.12 billion in 1991 to &#36;2.58 billion in 2003.</p><p>Other studies have found that claims payouts have increased at a rate equal to the rate of medical inflation, according to KFF.</p><p>"The fact that doctors have felt the sting of high malpractice premiums is no justification for worsening the pain felt by injured patients. Because insurance claims were not the problem, limiting them will not provide a solution. In order to address insurance prices, lawmakers need to address insurance industry practices," said Heller, whose group produced a separate report focusing on California.</p><p>Consumer advocates point to California's 1988 voter-approved initiative Proposition 103, which bars insurance companies from charging excessive rates and forces insurers to make their rate increase proposals public and subject to review before a rate hike can take effect.</p><p>FTCR's study compares the impact of legal restrictions on injured patients with the effect of regulatory scrutiny of insurance companies in California. It finds that Proposition 103's insurance regulations severely curtailed insurance premium hikes but that legal limitations--including the types of caps on damages frequently proposed by insurance companies and some doctors--did not lower doctors' premiums.</p><p>Even so, the AMA maintained in a statement that the existing medical liability system amounts to a ''lawsuit lottery, where a few patients and lawyers receive astronomical awards, and put access to care at risk for all others.''</p><p>The doctors' association said two reports coincidentally also released Tuesday bolster its position that damages in malpractice suits need to be capped.</p><p>"Two peer-reviewed studies released today confirm what the AMA has long held: medical liability reforms work,'' the AMA said.</p><p>''Both show what we have long known--medical liability reforms increase physician supply,'' the trade group said in a statement referring to a study by economists at the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality published in Health Affairs and another by university researchers published in The Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA).</p><p>"Skyrocketing medical liability premiums are forcing physicians in states without reforms to limit services, retire early or move to states with reforms,'' the AMA added.</p><p>The reasons for moving are clear, according to the AMA. ''An obstetrician in Los Angeles, where reforms are in place, pays about &#36;63,000 a year for insurance. That same obstetrician in Miami, with no reforms, pays &#36;277,000 or more,'' it said.</p><p>However, the AMA's interpretation in turn has been contradicted by the Pew Charitable Trusts, a private foundation that financed the JAMA study through its Project on Medical Liability in Pennsylvania.
<p>
''Contrary to popular belief, the difference in supply came mostly from older doctors putting off retirement in reform states and new physicians entering practice there, not from physicians moving between states to reduce their insurance premiums,'' the foundation said in a statement citing the study's findings.
<p>
The JAMA study, written by experts in business, economics, and law, concludes that while tort changes have in some way increased physician supply, further research is needed to determine whether these increases in physician supply actually benefited patients.</p><p align="CENTER">&copy; 2005 OneWorld.net</p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable --></font></td></tr>
