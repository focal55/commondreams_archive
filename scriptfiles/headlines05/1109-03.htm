Voters on Tuesday ousted a
Pennsylvania local school board that promoted an
"intelligent-design" alternative to teaching evolution, and
elected a new slate of candidates who promised to remove the
concept from science classes.</p>

        </table>The board of Dover Area School District in south-central
Pennsylvania lost eight of its nine incumbents in an upset
election that surprised even the challengers, who had been
hoping for a bare majority to take control of the board.</p>
<p>The new board, which includes teachers, opposed the
incumbents' policy of including intelligent design in science
classes.</p>
<p>The ousted board was the first school board in the country
to implement such a policy. The challengers also criticized
what they called arrogance and secrecy by the incumbent board.</p>
<p>For the last six weeks, the teaching of intelligent design
has been challenged in federal court by a group of Dover
parents. They said the concept is a religious belief and
therefore may not be taught in public schools, because the U.S.
Constitution forbids it. They also argue that the theory is
unscientific and so has no place in science classes.</p>
<p>Bryan Rehm, one of the winning board members and a former
teacher at Dover High School, said the new board will hold a
public meeting to decide the precise future of the policy. He
said intelligent design will no longer be a part of the science
curriculum, regardless of how the court rules.</p>
<p>Defeated board members were not immediately available for
comment.</p>
<p>Dover residents have been split on the issue of intelligent
design since the board adopted the policy in October 2004.</p>
<p>The policy requires that students be read a four-paragraph
statement that says there are "gaps" in Charles Darwin's theory
of evolution and that students should consider other
explanations of the origins of life, including intelligent
design.</p>

<p>Intelligent design holds that some aspects of nature are so
complex they must be the work of an unnamed designer, rather
than the result of random natural selection, as argued by
Darwin's theory.</p>
<p>The trial, which attracted national and international media
attention, was watched in at least 30 states where policies are
being considered that would promote teaching alternatives to
evolution theory.</p>
<p>U.S. President George W. Bush, whose re-election was
boosted by many Christian-conservative votes, has said he
believes intelligent design should be taught alongside
evolution.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge John Jones is expected to rule on the
case in December or January.
