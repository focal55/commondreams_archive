<p>President Bush delivers a prime-time address Tuesday to a public that is increasingly doubtful of his justifications for going to war in Iraq and wants a timetable set for U.S. troops to come home - a step Bush has ruled out.

<p>Just one in three Americans now say the United States and its allies are winning the war, according to a USA TODAY/CNN/Gallup Poll taken Friday through Sunday. That is a new low, down 9 percentage points since February. Half say neither side is winning.

<p>Bush will try to reassure Americans and rally support in a televised speech at 8 p.m. ET from Fort Bragg in North Carolina, home of the Army's 82nd Airborne Division. He is marking the first anniversary of the transfer of power from the U.S.-led coalition to an Iraqi government.

<p>Since then, Iraqis have held elections and begun the process of writing a constitution. But establishing security has proved elusive, and nearly 140,000 U.S. troops remain on dangerous duty there.

<p>"The continuing violence and American casualties underline the fact that the president has not accomplished what he set out to accomplish, and it's taking a lot longer and many more lives and more money than any American expected," says Richard Eichenberg, a political scientist at Tufts University in Massachusetts who has studied public opinion on Iraq. "That is a recipe for losing political support."

<p>By a record 61%-37%, those surveyed say the president doesn't have a clear plan for handling the situation in Iraq.

<p>Bush's job-approval rating has suffered, too. His approval rating is 45%, equaling the lowest of his presidency. At 53%, his disapproval rating has reached a new high.

<p>The survey of 1,009 adults was taken in the days after high-profile Senate hearings in which Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld was grilled. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham (news, bio, voting record) of South Carolina warned Rumsfeld that "in the most patriotic state I can imagine, people are beginning to question" the war.

<p>Rumsfeld's favorable-unfavorable rating slipped to 46%-44%, the first time during his tenure that he hasn't been seen positively by a majority outside the poll's margin of error of +/-3 percentage points.

<p>Bush has succeeded in persuading Americans that a stable government in Iraq is important for the United States. Ninety-three percent say it's important; two of three call it extremely or very important.

<p>Even so, 51% want a timetable set and followed for removing troops from Iraq regardless of the situation there. There is also growing skepticism about the president's core argument that the Iraq war is a crucial part of protecting Americans from terrorists:

<p>• For the first time, a plurality of Americans, by 50%-47%, sees the war in Iraq as a separate action from the war on terrorism.

<p>• By 46%-43%, a plurality says the war in Iraq has made the U.S. less safe from terrorism.

<p>By 53%-46%, Americans say the United States made a mistake in sending troops to Iraq. That's the highest level of discontent since the aftermath of the Abu Ghraib prison scandals last summer.<p align="center">&copy; 2005 USA Today</p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable --></font></td></tr>
