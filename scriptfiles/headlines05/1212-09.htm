<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p> Police in New Orleans are investigating the bus accident on Saturday that killed a hurricane relief volunteer from Portland.

<p>Meg Perry, 26, was among 13 Mainers who had traveled last month to the Gulf Coast to help victims of Hurricane Katrina. She was well-known in Portland as an activist at <a href="http://www.peoplesfreespace.org" target="_new">People's Free Space</a>, a community organization that focuses on social justice causes.

Perry died Saturday afternoon around 1:30, when the group's bus crashed on Interstate 10 near downtown New Orleans. The driver, 20-year-old Alyssa Wisehart of Connecticut, lost control and hit both guardrails on the interstate before the bus flipped on its side, according to a report on Sunday by the New Orleans Times-Picayune.

<p>Wisehart, who was not injured, might have made a last-minute decision to turn for an exit, police told the newspaper. Perry was thrown from the bus.

<p>Three passengers were taken to a nearby hospital with minor injuries, and five others refused medical treatment. Investigators were not available for comment on Sunday.

<p>Perry owned and had helped convert the 35-foot school bus, which was fueled with biodiesel and used vegetable oil. Called the <a href="http://www.peoplesfreespace.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=14&Itemid=18" target="_new">Frida Bus</a>, it has been used by People's Free Space since the summer of 2003.

<p>Perry coordinated the trip south that began on Nov. 13. She and her colleagues cleaned up dozens of homes and delivered supplies to families throughout the region. Most recently they had been working with <a href="http://www.commongroundrelief.org/" target="_new">Common Ground Collective</a>, a relief organization based in one of New Orleans' poorest neighborhoods.

<p>The bus spent Thursday and Friday in Jackson, Miss., said Julian St. Laurent, who traveled to the Gulf Coast with Perry but was not on the bus Saturday. Before the crash, the group had been driving back to New Orleans to attend an anti-eviction protest. The bus passengers included several Mainers, along with people from Boston, Canada and Connecticut.

<p>"She was really the leader for this trip down here," St. Laurent said. "We all have incredible stories about what kind of person Meg was."

<p>Perry's parents live in Brunswick and were in Florida at the time of the accident, St. Laurent said. They attended a memorial service on Sunday with the other Maine volunteers and friends Perry had made. The service was held at a community garden Perry helped create on St. Denis Street in New Orleans.

<p>Perry generally drove the bus, but others took turns behind the wheel, St. Laurent said. He was not sure if Wisehart, a college student from Connecticut, had ever driven the bus before this trip.

</font>The rest of the group from Maine plans on returning home within the next few days, with financial help from the Common Ground Collective.

<p>Perry first traveled to the Gulf Coast region in September, with seven other Portland area residents, determined to make a difference to hurricane survivors. They packed three cars full of supplies and made a home base at a Veterans For Peace encampment in Covington, La.

<p>Their delivery of necessities like diapers, rice, beans and juice made a big impact. A reporter and photographer from the Portland Press Herald documented the work.

<p>"Get enough people," Perry told the newspaper in September, "and you can move a mountain."

<p>Perry and the others returned to Maine to raise money for a greater relief effort, always planning a return. They used the Frida Bus, a highly visible symbol of People's Free Space. It is decorated with flowers and the words, "powered by vegetable oil." Perry spent hours designing and finishing the interior, which includes a kitchen and library, friends said.

<p>After the Nov. 13 departure, the group stopped in Biloxi, Miss., where they ripped contaminated drywall out of houses. From a warehouse in Mobile, Ala., they assisted with house cleanups, packaging and delivering supplies to survivors. Then the Frida Bus made its way to New Orleans.

<p>More than a dozen friends and acquaintances of Perry gathered Sunday night at the People's Free Space location on Cumberland Avenue in Portland.

<p>Kate Boverman, her eyes red from crying, said Perry and other volunteers were deeply moved by their experiences.

<p>"They went to the Gulf Coast in the spirit of volunteerism and mutual aid that characterized their work here in Portland," Boverman said. "Meg Perry was an energetic, passionate, kind and dedicated person. She filled her days working for justice, building community and bringing love and joy into people's lives."
