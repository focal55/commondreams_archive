<p> WASHINGTON -- Civil rights figures are using the 40th anniversary of a protest that opened voting booths to blacks across the southern United States to highlight the ongoing need to secure all Americans' access to the ballot box.

<P>Civil rights figures and a bipartisan congressional delegation observed on Sunday the 40th anniversary of ''Bloody Sunday,'' as the 1965 protest in Selma, Alabama came to be known, with church services and ceremonies.

<P>The demonstration 40 years ago got its name when local and state police attacked and turned back 500 marchers at Selma's Edmund Pettus Bridge. Dozens of marchers were hurt and at least 17 blacks were taken to hospital. News images of the ambush and clampdown galvanized national support for voting rights for all Americans.

<P>A second march two weeks later--25,000 strong by the time it ended, held under the protection of a federal court order, and led by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.--completed the 50-mile trek from the bridge over the Alabama River to the steps of the Alabama state Capitol in Montgomery.

<P>A re-enactment of the five-day march is planned this week, culminating with a rally at the Capitol on Saturday.

<P>The attack and march inspired passage within six months of the Voting Rights Act (VRA), which outlawed literacy tests and other obstacles used by segregationists to keep blacks from registering to vote. Among other things, it mandates a federal review of any changes in election laws in jurisdictions with a history of voting discrimination, requires some communities to provide bilingual election assistance, and ensures that federal examiners can be sent to monitor elections.

<P>Although its greatest impact was in the South, the Act covers the whole nation and specific sections have triggered enforcement in numerous states because of shifting population and discrimination patterns.

<P>Some of the law's protections are due to lapse in August 2007 unless Congress reauthorizes them. Civil rights figures said the Bloody Sunday anniversary should highlight the importance of renewing them.

<P>''Our country has made a lot of progress in 40 years but we are far from finished,'' said Wade Henderson, executive director of the Washington, D.C.-based Leadership Conference on Civil Rights.

<P>''All we need to do is look at the elections of 2000 and 2004 to see that VRA violations are still a persistent feature of our political landscape. Many Americans are still disenfranchised by discriminatory redistricting plans, voter intimidation tactics, and purposely inaccessible polling stations,'' he added.

<P>Just last year, a federal court ruled that South Dakota discriminated against Native American voters by illegally ''packing'' their population in a single, re-drawn district to dilute their strength at the polls, said Anthony Romero, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union. Recent redistricting schemes in other states also have been challenged under the VRA.

<P>''The Voting Rights Act is still needed,'' Romero said. ''The Act's mission--ensuring fairness in our political process and equal opportunity for minorities in American politics--is enduring.''

<P>The law's portions up for renewal include Section 5, which requires a federal OK for proposed changes in voting or election procedures in areas with a history of discrimination, and Section 203, which requires some jurisdictions to provide assistance in other languages to voters who are not literate or fluent in English.

<P>tates covered by Section 5 include Alabama, Georgia, New Hampshire, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia.

<P>States affected by Section 203 include Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Utah, and Washington.

<P>States affected by both sections include Alaska, Arizona, California, Florida, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, New York, South Dakota, and Texas.

<P>Lawsuits against voting discrimination can be brought under permanent provisions of the VRA, but civil rights workers said Section 5 has been the only speedy, cost efficient, and effective mechanism. Before the VRA, litigation was costly and protracted and while it was under way the discriminatory practices at issue usually continued. Section 5, they said, provides a simple alternative in which jurisdictions simply must show that a proposed change is not discriminatory.

<P>Civil rights workers also said that, counter to some commonly held views, bilingual elections promote integration, not cultural separatism, by enabling political participation by citizens previously barred by their inability to vote in English. Where bilingual voting is implemented well, they added, it accounts for only a small fraction of the cost of the total election.

<P>Blacks were granted the right to vote with ratification of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1868 but efforts to register in large numbers in the South were thwarted by the Ku Klux Klan and other white supremacist groups.

<P>Local governments enacted poll taxes and literacy tests to disqualify black voters. Alabama and Mississippi drew particular national attention because of the high toll in deaths and injuries among civil rights volunteers who worked to register black voters between 1963 and 1965.

<P>Currently, 74 percent of voting-age blacks in Alabama are listed as active voters, compared with 77 percent of voting-age whites, based on figures from the secretary of state and the Census Bureau's estimates of voting-age residents.

<P>In March 1965, only 19.3 percent of eligible blacks were registered in Alabama, compared with 69.2 percent of whites.

<P>Participants in Sunday's commemorations included singer Harry Belafonte, who took part in the demonstration 40 years ago; the Rev. Jesse Jackson; Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist; Rep. John Lewis, a Georgia Democrat who was clubbed on the head at the original demonstration; and Lynda Johnson Robb, whose father, President Lyndon Johnson, pushed for and signed the VRA into law.
