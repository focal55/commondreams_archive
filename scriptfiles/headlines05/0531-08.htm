Police and firemen recovered the bodies of six Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) employees after an angry mob set the restaurant on fire late Monday following a suicide attack on a Shiite Muslim mosque here that left five people dead.

<p>"Their bodies were found during the search of KFC," city police chief Tariq Jamil told AFP.
<p>Three attackers stormed the minority Shiite Madinat-ul-Ilm mosque in the middle-class Gulshan neighborhood during evening prayers late Monday.

<p>One of the assailants died in a gunbattle with police while the other blew himself up and the third sustained a serious head injury in a fall, Jamil said.
<p>Hospital officials said the man was unconscious but in stable condition.

<p>Police believe his survival could be the key to the investigation into suicide bombings.
<p>Two worshippers and one policeman also died in the attack, while 21 people, four of whom were in a critical condition, were hospitalized.
<p>Angry protesters went on the rampage after the attack, setting fire to two gas stations and a number of vehicles in addition to the KFC outlet.

<p>The attack on the mosque came just three days after 19 people, most of them Shiites, died in a suicide bomb blast at a Muslim shrine near the capital Islamabad.
<p>Thousands of Shiite and majority Sunni Muslims have been killed in sectarian bloodshed in Pakistan in recent years, with attacks including bomb blasts, suicide bombings and targeted killings. Last year 160 people were killed.
