Hans von Sponeck, who quit as U.N. humanitarian coordinator  in 2000 after sharply criticising the effects of the then  economic sanctions on civilians, said Iraq's government should  negotiate its reparations debt directly with claimants.</p>
<p> The U.N. Compensation Commission, set up by the Security  Council to compensate losses using a share of Iraqi oil sales,  has approved $52.1 billion in payment to individuals, companies  and governments so far. </p>
<p> Its Governing Council is due to approve a final batch of  claims at a meeting later this month.</p>
<p> &quot;The UNCC has no legitimacy for one day longer, it is not a  colonial master,&quot; Von Sponeck told Reuters. &quot;Whatever happens  must be bilateral; it is an issue between the government of Iraq  and claimants.&quot;</p>
<p> Von Sponeck, who is German, was speaking outside the U.N.  European headquarters in Geneva to support a handful of American  protesters who began a fast to demand cancellation of all debt  incurred by the regime of ousted President Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p> &quot;Taking Iraqi oil revenues and paying companies in Kuwait is  an injustice which can only fuel more violence,&quot; said Kathy  Kelly of the U.S.-based group Voices in the Wilderness.</p>
<p> &quot;The people of Iraq have suffered and endured so much, from  sanctions to bombardment to occupation ... They are innocent  people who haven't done anything wrong,&quot; added Kelly.</p>
<p> The protesters plan to take only liquids until June 30 when  the UNCC's Governing Councils ends a three-day meeting. </p>
<p> The 15-member state body is to rule on billions of dollars  of claims from Iraq's neighbours for environmental damage.
