<p>WASHINGTON&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp; 
Anonymous sources have been condemned by the Bush White House as a 
threat to the credibility of the media and called an "evil of journalism" by 
USA Today founder Al Neuharth.
<P>But even as news organizations scramble to write new policies to limit 
their reliance on unnamed sources, the unveiling Tuesday of the world's most 
famous anonymous source, Deep Throat, reminds the media and the public why 
their use is sometimes necessary, journalism experts say.
<P>The Washington Post confirmed Tuesday that 91-year-old W. Mark Felt, the 
FBI's No. 2 official during the early 1970s who now lives in Santa Rosa, was 
the secret source for stories by reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein 
that helped bring down Richard Nixon's presidency in the Watergate scandal.
<P>"It is deeply ironic that the mother of all anonymous sources  --  which 
precipitated some really tectonic changes in the American political scene, 
including the resignation of a president  --  should be coming forward at a 
time when anonymous sources are being so impugned," said Orville Schell, dean 
of the Graduate School of Journalism at UC Berkeley. "I think it would be an 
incalculable loss to this country if all anonymous sources became forbidden, 
particularly in this era of governmental and corporate secrecy  --  and I 
might add, ecclesiastical secrecy. The price has been raised very high for 
whistle-blowers."
<P>The use of unnamed sources has been under fire recently after Newsweek 
retracted a story last month that cited anonymous sources claiming that 
investigators at Guantanamo Bay prison in Cuba believed U.S. guards flushed a 
Quran down the toilet to unnerve Muslim prisoners.
<P>Newsweek apologized for the story, which some cite as the reason for 
deadly riots that followed in Afghanistan, saying the unnamed source of the 
report had backed away from his initial claims after the story was published. 
An Amnesty International report last week found that a prisoner at Guantanamo 
Bay had complained that a Quran was flushed in a toilet, but a Pentagon 
inquiry found no evidence to back up the claim.
<P>The Newsweek controversy led White House spokesman Scott McClellan to 
complain about "a credibility problem in the media regarding the use of 
anonymous sources." 
<P>But media experts said that while news organizations take a risk in 
relying on unnamed sources, it is often the only way to uncover some 
information.
<P>"There are certain kinds of reporting that cannot be done without sources 
who are unnamed, in particular reporting on national security or defense ... 
because people jeopardize their careers and in some cases their legal status 
by disclosing things," said James Bettinger, a longtime reporter and editor at 
the Riverside Press-Enterprise and the San Jose Mercury News who directs the 
John S. Knight journalism fellowship program at Stanford University.
<P>"That said, there is too great a reliance on anonymous sources," 
Bettinger said. "That's why every news organization I know of is trying to 
reduce their use or their reliance on anonymous sources."
<P>Woodward and Bernstein issued a statement Tuesday saying Felt "helped us 
immeasurably in our Watergate coverage," although they said many other sources 
were also involved. Former Washington Post Editor Ben Bradlee told the paper: 
"The No. 2 guy at the FBI  --  that was a pretty good source."
<P>"Deep Throat represents the kind of source that a lot of reporters would 
like to have," Bettinger said. "He served as someone that Woodward could go to 
on a regular basis and say, 'Are we on the right track?' ... That is a huge 
fear of every good reporter, 'Do we have this right?' "
<P>Many papers began re-examining their policies on the use of unnamed 
sources in 2003 after the New York Times acknowledged it had failed to 
adequately check sources quoted by reporter Jayson Blair, who was fired for 
fabricating stories.
<P>The Blair scandal and the forced resignation of USA Today reporter Jack 
Kelley for similar charges prompted Neuharth to write a Jan. 15, 2004, column 
calling for a media wide ban on anonymous sources. "Until or unless we do, the 
public won't trust us, and we put the First Amendment in jeopardy," he wrote.
<P>But some journalists have recently spoken out about the need for 
anonymous sources. Daniel Schorr, senior news analyst for NPR radio, wrote in 
a syndicated column last week that unnamed sources provided the first photos 
and accounts of abuse at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq, as well as a 2,000-page 
secret file of an Army investigation about the torture and killing of two 
prisoners in Afghanistan, recently reported by the New York Times.
<P>"On many vital matters, we would be left in the dark were it not for 
leaks," Schorr wrote.
<P>Brooks Jackson, a longtime reporter for the Associated Press, the Wall 
Street Journal and CNN, said the mistake often made  --  as seen in the 
Newsweek case  --  is to rely on an unnamed source who is a step removed from 
the news.
<P>"Often it's second-hand information, and if that's not made clear, then 
the reader is not being served very well," said Jackson, who now directs <A href="http://www.factcheck.org" target="_new">www.factcheck.org</A>, a nonpartisan group.hatever obstacles, legal and moral, were in our way," he said. "I feel that we deserve an amount of accountability by our officials for the decisions they make."</P>
