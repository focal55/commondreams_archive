<p>Japan's Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi has said his party would unveil ideas later this year on amending the US-imposed constitution amid calls to end the country's official pacifism.

<P>"Since the Liberal Democratic Party marks the 50th anniversary of its establishment this year, we want to make strenuous efforts to issue a draft or concrete ideas on revising the constitution by fall," Koizumi said.

<P>But he said he did not expect any revisions to take place in 2005 or next year as the ruling party needed time to hammer out differences with other parties.

<P>Koizumi has championed a more prominent international role for Japan, sending troops to Iraq in Japan's first deployment since 1945 to a country where combat operations are ongoing.

<P>Press reports have said the ruling party wanted to overhaul the constitution to allow the military to use force in international missions.

<P>The troops in Iraq are barred from firing their weapons except in the strictest definition of self-defense.

<P>Such a change would mark the first revision to the pacifist 1947 constitution imposed by the United States at the end of World War II, in which Japan renounced war and the right to maintain a military.

<P>Analysts have warned that constitutional changes could enrage neighboring Asian nations that suffered under Japan's wartime aggression.

<P>A constitutional revision would require a two-thirds majority vote in both houses of parliament and a majority in a public referendum.

<P>The biggest sticking point in revising the constitution is Article 9, which renounces even the threat of force in settling international disputes and says "land, sea and air forces, as well as other war potential, will never be maintained."

<P>Japan has skirted Article 9 by referring to its de facto military as the Self-Defense Forces.<p align="center">Copyright &copy; 2005 AFP</p>
