<p>WASHINGTON  -- His former secretary of state, most of his closest aides and a 
parade of other senior officials have testified to a grand jury. His political 
strategist has emerged as a central figure in the case, as has his vice 
president's chief of staff. His spokesman has taken a pounding for making 
statements about the matter that now appear not to be accurate.

        <!--/endimage/-->        For all that, it is still not clear what the investigation into the leak 
of a CIA operative's identity will mean for President Bush. So far the 
disclosures about the involvement of Karl Rove, among others, have not exacted 
any substantial political price from the administration. And nobody has 
suggested that the investigation directly implicates the president. Yet Bush 
has yet to address some uncomfortable questions that he may not be able to 
evade indefinitely.
<P>For starters, did Bush know in the fall of 2003, when he was telling the 
public that no one wanted to get to the bottom of the case more than he did, 
that Rove, his longtime strategist, senior adviser and alter ego; and Lewis 
Libby Jr., Vice President Dick Cheney's chief of staff, had touched on the CIA 
officer's identity in conversations with journalists before the officer's name 
became public? If not, when did they tell him, and what would the delay say in 
particular about his relationship with Rove, whose career and Bush's have been 
intertwined for decades?
<P>Then there is the broader issue of whether Bush was aware of any effort 
by his aides to use the CIA officer's identity to undermine the standing of 
her husband, a former diplomat who had publicly accused the administration of 
twisting its prewar intelligence about Iraq's nuclear program.
<P>For the last several weeks, Bush and his spokesman, Scott McClellan, have 
declined to address the leak in any substantive way, citing the continuing 
federal criminal investigation.
<P>But Democrats increasingly see an opportunity to raise questions about 
Bush's credibility, and to reopen a debate about whether the White House 
leveled with the nation about the urgency of going to war with Iraq. And even 
some Republicans say Bush cannot assume that he will escape from the 
investigation politically unscathed.
<P>"Until all the facts come out, no one is really going to know who the 
fickle finger of fate points at," said Tony Fabrizio, a Republican pollster.

<P>The case centers on how the name of a CIA operative came to appear two 
years ago in a syndicated column by Robert Novak, who identified her by her 
maiden name, Valerie Plame. The operative, who is more usually known as 
Valerie Wilson, is married to Joseph C. Wilson IV, a former diplomat who had 
publicly accused the administration eight days before Novak's column of 
twisting some of the intelligence used to justify going to war with Iraq. 
Under some conditions, the disclosure of a covert intelligence agent's name 
can be a federal crime.
<P>The special prosecutor in the case, Patrick Fitzgerald, has kept a tight 
curtain of secrecy around his investigation. But he spent more than an hour in 
the Oval Office on June 24, 2004, interviewing Bush about the case. Bush was 
not under oath, but he had his lawyer for the case, James Sharp, with him.
<P>Neither the White House nor the Justice Department has said what Bush was 
asked about, but prosecutors do not lightly seek to put questions directly to 
any president, suggesting that there was some information that Fitzgerald felt 
he could get only from Bush.
<P>Allan Lichtman, a presidential historian at American University in 
Washington, said the lesson of recent history, for example in the Iran-Contra 
case under President Ronald Reagan, is that presidents tend to know more than 
it might first appear about what is going on within the White House.
<P>"My presumption in presidential politics is that the president always 
knows," Lichtman said. "But there are degrees of knowing. Reagan said, keep 
the contras together body and soul. Did he know exactly what Oliver North was 
doing? No, it doesn't mean he knew what every subordinate is doing."
<P>Although it is possible that other officials will turn out to have played 
leading roles in the leak case, the subordinates whose actions would appear to 
be of most interest to Bush right now are Rove and Libby, who as Cheney's 
chief of staff had a particular interest in protecting the vice president's 
interests.
<P>According to accounts by people involved in the case, Rove spoke in the 
days after Wilson went public with his criticism in July 2003 to both Novak 
and Matthew Cooper of Time, the first two reporters to disclose that Wilson's 
wife worked for the CIA. Cooper has said he also spoke about the case with 
Libby.
<P>By September 2003, as a criminal investigation was getting under way, 
McClellan was telling reporters that Rove had nothing to do with the leak, 
saying he had checked with Rove about the topic.
<P>Around the same time, the president was saying he had no idea who might 
have been responsible. Asked by a reporter on Oct. 6, 2003, whether the leak 
was retaliation for Wilson's criticism, Bush replied: "I don't know who leaked 
the information, for starters. So it's hard for me to answer that question 
until I find out the truth."
<P>Asked the next day if he was confident that the leakers would be found, 
Bush, alluding to the "two senior administration officials" cited by Novak as 
his sources, replied: "I don't know if we're going to find out the senior 
administration official. Now, this is a large administration, and there's a 
lot of senior officials. I don't have any idea. I'd like to. I want to know 
the truth."
<P>Republicans said the relationship between Bush and Rove was so deep and 
complex that it was hard to imagine the president cutting ties with him 
barring an indictment.
<P>"Can you survive being involved in something you probably shouldn't have 
been involved in where you didn't break any laws?" Fabrizio said. "Well, you 
probably can, especially if you are Karl."
<P>Fabrizio said that even if Rove left the White House, he would continue 
to consult with Bush "unless they put him in a tunnel."
<P>McClellan and other White House officials have repeatedly declined to 
answer when asked if Rove or Libby had told the president by October 2003 that 
they had alluded to Wilson's identity months earlier in their conversations 
with the journalists.
<P>But Bush's political opponents say the president is in a box. In their 
view, either Rove and Libby kept the president in the dark about their actions,
making them appear evasive at a time when Bush was demanding that his staff 
cooperate fully with the investigation, or Rove and Libby had told the 
president and he was not forthcoming in his public statements about his 
knowledge of their roles.
<P>"We know that Karl Rove, through Scott McClellan, did not tell Americans 
the truth," said Rep. Rahm Emanuel, D-Ill., and a former top aide in the 
Clinton White House. "What's important now is what Karl Rove told the 
president. Was it the truth, or was it what he told Scott McClellan?"
<P>Bush has also yet to answer any questions publicly about what he learned 
from aides about Joseph and Valerie Wilson in the days after the former 
ambassador leveled his criticism of the administration in an op-ed article in 
the New York Times on July 6, 2003.
