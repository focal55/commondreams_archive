<p>The victory lap is long over for President Bush, tripped up by a series of gaffes since Election Day that were either self-inflicted or made by his own allies, both aides and critics said.

<P>"It's been sloppy. ...People are off message," conceded a senior administration official, who said Team Bush's trademark discipline had crumbled since winning a second term.

<P>"It's the worst I've ever seen it," the official conceded.

<P>In the view of former GOP strategist Marshall Wittman, now a senior fellow at the Democratic Leadership Council, "The honeymoon blew over quicker than a Texas thunderstorm on a hot July day."

<P>Bush will need some goodwill starting tomorrow, when Congress returns.

<P>On the top of the White House to-do list will be finding someone to head the Homeland Security Department and an intelligence czar to take control of the many spy agencies.

<P>The President must prep for two major speeches, one for his inauguration on Jan. 20 and his State of the Union address on Feb. 2.

<P>The White House has also indicated it will press for conservative judges and a partial privatization of Social Security - issues that are guaranteed to be viewed by Democrats as a challenge.

<P>The administration knows that it will face a hostile Democratic minority in Congress, but it can't be certain how staunchly allied the GOP majority will be. It took major arm-twisting for Bush to persuade Republicans to pass the intelligence reform bill late last year.

<P>Bush's problems began almost immediately after he declared two days after the election that, "I earned capital in the campaign, political capital, and now I intend to spend it."

<P>Some critics contend that proclamation was as much a jinx as the "Mission Accomplished" banner hanging behind Bush in May 2003 when he declared that major combat in Iraq had ended.

<P>Among Bush's biggest headaches were the aborted nomination of Bernard Kerik as homeland security secretary, a ferocious battle within his own party to get recommendations of the Sept. 11 commission through Congress and loose-tongued Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld's answer to G.I.s in Iraq concerned about the lack of protective armor.

<P>Bush was even blindsided by John Danforth's resignation as UN ambassador, a snap move that came as Kerik withdrew his nomination in shame.

<P>"The Kerik appointment was the worst of all," said the senior administration official, who complained that since the election too many White House staffers have been more concerned with trying to move up the career ladder than their day-to-day work.

<P>Bush's closest allies argue that, with the holidays behind him, he'll come back refreshed and ready for new battles.

<P>"The upside is his track record from the last four years. He's constantly counted out, and he constantly ends up winning," said Rep. Pete King (R-L.I.). "He's a guy who has basically set his own course and writes his own rules." <p align="center">All contents &copy; 2005 Daily News, L.P</p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable --></font></td></tr>
