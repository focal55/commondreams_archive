For years, Ford has courted the gay car buyer with ads such as a 2003 Jaguar magazine spread featuring a man with an inviting smile and text reading, "Life is full of twists and turns. Care for a partner?"

</table>That courtship ended on Monday when Ford announced it was cutting advertising in gay publications for its Jaguar and Land Rover brands.<P>
The move outraged gay advocates, who contend Ford struck a confidential deal with the conservative Christian group, the American Family Association, which recently ended a boycott over Ford's "track record on promoting the homosexual agenda."<P>
A spokesman for Ford vigorously denies that the end of the boycott was linked to the removal of advertising in gay publications. <P>
"Absolutely not -- the two things have been put together unfairly," said Ford's Mike Moran, noting that Volvo, another Ford brand, will continue its gay-themed ads. "The decisions on where Ford brands advertise are made for business reasons and not as a social statement one way or the other."<P>

But gay advocacy groups aren't buying Ford's explanation. <P>
"All indications point to a confidential agreement," said Jay Brown, spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign.<P>
Mr. Brown said that Ford has agreed to meet with representatives from his group and other gay advocacy groups to discuss their concerns. <P>
He said he hoped the meeting would take place "in a matter of days."<P>
The American Family Association referred all questions on Ford to a statement on its Web site from its chairman, Donald E. Wildmon. "We are ending the boycott of Ford," he wrote. "While we still have a few differences with Ford, we feel that our concerns are being addressed in good faith and will continue to be addressed in the future."<P>
AFA began the boycott at the end of May, citing concerns about Ford's same-sex benefits program, donations to gay rights groups and diversity training requirements. The boycott only lasted about a week before it was suspended for six months in early June after pleas from individual dealers.<P>
The boycott was set to resume Dec. 1 before the AFA canceled it on Nov. 30 after Ford executives met with the group at their Tupelo, Miss., headquarters.<P>
Mr. Moran said the boycott of Ford was touched off in part by gay-themed advertising, but that the AFA primarily objected to ads running in Europe -- ads that he said are no longer running. One Ford ad in Germany featured two men holding hands, while another showed two women in their bras.<P>
He said that the decision to pull the Jaguar and Land Rover ads from gay publications "has been evolving for months and months" and that the change in marketing strategy reflects a general malaise in the American car industry.<P>

"Our company and GM, we're all being challenged," he said. "Everything is on the table."<P>
Mr. Moran said the company is pulling ads from other markets as well, but would not identify those markets for competitive reasons.<P>
Ford entered the gay-themed advertising market in 2002, shortly after the company extended domestic partner benefits to its employees, said Michael Wilke, executive director of the Commercial Closet Association, which tracks gay-themed advertising.<P>
Mr. Wilke said that given Ford's careful study before entering the market, he was surprised by the announcement of the advertising pullback. "If it was a business decision, it was a rash one," he said.<P>
But Spencer Moore, manager of corporate communications for PlanetOut Inc., which owns many gay-themed Web sites and magazines, said he is inclined to believe Ford's business rationale.<P>
"Based on what Ford has said, it's a business decision and some of their brands are still advertising," he said.<P>
Mr. Moore said that Ford had not yet notified PlanetOut of any ad cancellations, and that Ford's ads make up a very small percentage of PlanetOut's automobile advertising.<P>
Regardless of Ford's motivation, outside analysts said the company has entered a public relations nightmare by trying to appease diametrically opposed interest groups.<P>
"If it's true that the gay publications were cut back only as a broader cut, then Ford has done a very poor job of communicating that," said Kelly O'Keefe, who runs a Richmond, Va.-based brand strategy consulting group. "They're caught tongue-tied about an issue that's very important to stakeholders on both sides."
