<p> 
			
			By 2030, more than 60 percent of the world's population  will live in cities, up from almost half now and just a third  in 1950, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said. Growth poses  huge problems ranging from clean water supplies to trash  collection.<p>

"Already, one of every three urban dwellers lives in a  slum," Annan said in a statement. "Let us create green cities,"  he said, adding the U.N. goal of halving poverty by 2015 would  not be met unless city planning was less haphazard.<p> 
			
			Activists mark June 5, the date of the first environmental  summit in Stockholm in 1972, as the U.N.'s World Environment  Day. The 2005 theme is "greener" planning for cities, many of  them hit by air pollution, fouled rivers and poor sanitation.<p> 
			
			In San Francisco, the main host of the 2005 event, mayors  from more than 50 cities including Shanghai, Kabul, Buenos  Aires, Sydney, Phnom Penh, Jakarta, Rome and Istanbul planned  to sign up for a scheme setting new green standards for cities.<p> 
			
			Cities would be ranked from zero to four stars according to  compliance with a set of 21 targets. And around the world, from  Australia to Zimbabwe, activists staged rallies, cleaned up  litter, organized poetry competitions or planted trees.<p> 
			
			In China, home to a fifth of humanity, the 2005 focus was  to curb noise and clean up fouled water, air and rubbish in  urban areas, Pan Yue, vice minister of the State Environmental  Protection Administration, told Chinese Central Television.<p> 
			
			In Australia, green groups and local councils organized  festivals to promote awareness of environmental issues from  recycling to tree planting to cleaning up waterways.<p> 
			
			COOL FASHION<p> 
			
			In Greece, the port of Zakynthos banned cars for the day  and allowed free public transport, while tree planting took  place along the Sri Lankan coast -- devastated by the Dec 26.  tsunami -- in Kenya and at Ocho Rios on the Caribbean island of  Jamaica.<p> 
			
			Among events in Japan, a fashion show encouraged workers to  dress less formally in summer to help cut air conditioning  bills and save energy under a government-sponsored "Cool Biz"  drive.<p> 
			
			"By trying on these clothes, it helps ... raise awareness  of environmental issues and help realize how we need to  revolutionise our ways," said Sanyo Electric Chairman Satoshi  Iue after walking down a catwalk in a gray suit and a white  stiff-collar shirt -- but minus a tie.<p> 
			
			In Norway, a youth group staged protests against plans to  build new gas-fired power plants, saying they would mean too  much pollution and add to greenhouse gas emissions.<p> 
			
			GLOBAL WARMING<p> 
			
			The San Francisco meeting would set goals including a cut  in emissions by cities of heat-trapping carbon dioxide (CO2)  gas from cars, factories and power plants by 25 percent by  2030.<p> 
			
			That is more ambitious than under the U.N.'s Kyoto  protocol, which seeks to cut emissions from developed nations  by 5.2 percent below 1990 levels by 2008-12.<p> 
			
			"Cities are prolific users of natural resources and  generators of waste. They produce most of the greenhouse gases  that are causing global climate change," Annan said.<p> 
			
			Other targets for the cities will include ensuring  residents would not have to walk more than 500 meters (550  yards) in 2015 to reach public transport or an open space.<p> 
			
			And in London, the environment ministry admitted that  Britain's year-long presidency of the club of the world's top  eight industrial nations -- focused on slowing global warming  and helping Africa -- would emit a lot of hot air.<p> 
			
			"The total carbon dioxide emissions associated with the G8  presidency will amount to 4,000 tonnes ... roughly equivalent  to the emissions generated by the electricity and gas used in  800 average homes over a year," it said in a statement.
