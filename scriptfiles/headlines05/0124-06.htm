<P>The celebration of Eid al-Adha sparks a palpable excitement in the Arab world, but at the weekend all the joy and celebration came to a jarring halt at the borders of benighted Iraq.

<P>Here, war and the weather threw a leaden blanket on festivities that traditionally bring big families together for the ritual slaughter of a sheep that is shared among friends and the poor to recall Abraham's preparedness to sacrifice his son.

<P>Millions of towel-draped pilgrims crowded the holy city of Mecca in Saudi Arabia for the annual Haj pilgrimage, but a sense of empty desolation hung over Baghdad as 25 million Iraqis braced for what many fear could be the most violent week since Saddam Hussein was ousted from power in April 2003.

<P>In the face of the wave of bombings insurgents have sworn to carry out in the run-up to  Sunday's elections, Iraqi and US authorities are imposing a security clampdown that will snap-freeze the country  borders will be sealed and curfews ordered; Baghdad International Airport will close and all private transport will be halted for three days.

<P>Those brave enough to vote for the candidates, most of whom remain anonymous, will have to walk to one of more than 5000 polling stations, the locations of which are still a guarded secret.

<P>As grey surveillance helicopters hung above them in grey skies, Iraqis, already bristling at the closed environment in which they now live, have been forced to account for themselves at checkpoints and to stepped-up street patrols. But grieving Shiite processions still found their way to the cemeteries as Sunni-backed bombers kept up their assault.

<P>On Saturday an  ambulance full of   explosives killed seven and injured 16 when it crashed into a wedding party in a village near Youssufiya, south of Baghdad. Another 22 people were killed when a bomb exploded at the Taf Mosque south-west of the capital as worshippers poured out from Eid al-Adha prayers.

<P>In their drive to intimidate the Iraqi security forces, the insurgent group Ansar al-Sunnah, which claims responsibility for the suicide bomb that killed 22 people last month at a US mess tent in Mosul, said it had executed the 15 Iraqi National Guardsmen abducted north-west of Baghdad last week.

<P>To the extent that there is a ledger of good and bad news in war, there were lean pickings for the ``good'' side of the book  insurgents released eight Chinese construction workers taken last week following China's efforts to discourage its citizens from seeking work in Iraq.

<P>A climate of utter fear has reduced the campaign to wall posters and banners, and even the wind was shredding these on Saturday. Most candidates have retreated to the relative safety of television studios.

<P>The interim Defence Minister, Hazem al-Shaalan, was left with nowhere to go after he threatened on television to have Ahmed Chalabi, the maverick exile once favoured by the US as Iraqi prime minister, arrested on an Interpol warrant over the murky collapse of a Jordanian bank in the 1990s.

<P>The threat was intended to counter Chalabi's questioning of a mysterious charter flight that lifted $US300 million [$390 million] in cash to Lebanon earlier this month, apparently in an arms deal for the Iraqi military that sidesteps conditions imposed on the interim Government by the US.
But the interim Interior Minister, Falah al-Naquib, hung Mr Shaalan out to dry when he announced there was no warrant.

<P>And in what was seen as a not-so-subtle attempt to show victory over the imprisoned Saddam, the interim Prime Minister, Iyad Allawi, told a TV phone-in that an unnamed neighbouring country had arrested and handed over a man for an  axe attack on himself and his wife 27 years ago. Dr Allawi claims the attack was ordered by Saddam.

<P>This all leaves Basim Lutfei, 32, and his wife, Wafa, 30, angry and confused. Theirs is not an ordinary Sunni home. Despite the insurgents' demand for Sunnis to boycott the poll, they say they will vote and that it will probably be for Dr Allawi, a secular Shiite who was appointed by the US.

<P>They are glad to see the back of the old regime  Mr Lutfei says his garment-import business makes four times as much as it used to, now that he is free of Saddam's repressive taxes  and as much as they want to see the back of the American forces, they say the soldiers can't leave just yet.

<P>During another of Baghdad's routine power blackouts, they sat as shadows on a couch, their faces lit by the glow of a kerosene heater, the only light in the room.


<P>"The politicians just fight for positions in the government," Mr Lutfei says over tea and a small plate of biscuits that are the extent of their acknowledgement of the religious festival.

<P>His wife cuts him off: "Who should we vote for? Who's the man who had done anything for Iraq in the last two years? We are being asked to vote for people who have done nothing."

<P>They list the hardships. They live in the suburb of Al Huria, which they mockingly say translates as "freedom"; there has not been a day without blackouts since the fall of Saddam; gas and kerosene are available only at extravagant black market prices; they have to queue for up to two days to refuel their car; and they can't let their children outside for fear of a bombing.

<P>But for them Dr Allawi is the best of a bad bunch.

<P>In the tradition of Iraqi leadership, they see him as a "strongman" who does not distinguish between Shiites and Sunnis. And "he doesn't come from Iran"  their way of expressing their distrust of the predominant Shiite population, many of whose leadership were exiled to Iran during the Saddam years.

<P>Cuddling her curly-headed daughter, Wafa reveals her desperation: "Of course the Shiites will win  they are the majority. But I don't care who wins, it's more important just to have a government that can give us security and safety and make something good of this country. I'm very scared for my children."

<P>They could not say if life was better now than it was before the US invasion. They said there were political subtleties at work that did not necessarily mean there would be bloc voting on ethnic and religious lines; and they did not have a clue how many would have the courage to go to the polling stations on Sunday.

<P>There is no guide to the reliability of opinion polls in such a crisis, some of which say that as many as 80 per cent of eligible voters will risk their first appointment with democracy.<p align="center">Copyright &copy; 2005 The Sydney Morning Herald</p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable --></font></td></tr>
