<p> WASHINGTON  - A U.S. consumer group on Wednesday
called for cigarette-style warnings on soft drinks to alert
consumers that too much of the sugary beverages can make them
fat and cause other health problems.</p>
<p> People who overindulge in soft drinks are also more likely
to develop diabetes and have decaying teeth, the <a href="http://www.cspinet.org/" target="_new">Center for
Science in the Public Interest</a> (CSPI) said in a petition to the
Food and Drug Administration.</p>
<p> The warnings are especially necessary to help counter the
growing number of youth who drink soda, said the center, which
has previously put out reports publicizing the
health-threatening qualities of other popular foods such as ice
cream and movie popcorn.</p>
<p> "Parents and health officials need to recognize soft drinks
for what they are -- liquid candy -- and do everything they can
to return those beverages to their former role as an occasional
treat," CSPI officials wrote in a related report.</p>
<p> Studies show teenage boys drink about 1.5 cans of soda a
day on average compared to 1 can for teenage girls, according
to the group.</p>
<p> Some suggested warnings included: "To help protect your
waistline and your teeth, consider switching to diet sodas or
water" and "Drinking too many (non-diet) soft drinks
contributes to weight gain."</p>
<p> Soft drinks with more than 10 milligrams of caffeine per
12-ounce serving should also carry warnings that say it is "a
mildly addictive stimulant drug" that is "not appropriate for
children," CSPI added.</p>
<p> The group, which has also been fighting the prevalence of
soda-vending machines in U.S. schools, said new labels are
needed to help counter aggressive marketing by the soda
industry.</p>
<p> The American Beverage Association says soft drinks can be
part of a healthy diet and help keep people hydrated, citing
data from the American Dietetic Association.</p>
<p> "The beverage industry recognizes the need for children and
adults to consume a wide variety of beverages, including milk,
water, juices and sport drinks. And yes, there is room in that
mix for soft drinks," the industry group says on its Web site.</p>
<p> Some soft drink makers have also recently introduced
smaller-sized bottles and cans.</p>
<p> The three top beverage companies, Coca-Cola Co.,
PepsiCo Inc.  and Cadbury Schweppes Plc, own the 10 most popular carbonated drinks and account
for about 90 percent of the industry, according to market
report Beverage Digest.</p>
