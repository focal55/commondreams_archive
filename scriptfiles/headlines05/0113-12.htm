<p>Helen Johnston is an 80-year-old retired pediatrician who hardly considers herself much of a risk for being sued. 
<p>That's not how her insurance company sees it, however.
<p>Johnston is losing extra coverage she bought years ago while she still practiced medicine - not because she's a retired doctor, but because she is active in Francestown politics.
      <p>The <a href="http://www.providencemutual.com/" target="_new">Providence 
        Mutual Fire Insurance Co</a>. sent her a letter last month notifying her 
        it is not renewing her $1 million umbrella policy next month because of 
        "the political positions the insured holds." 
      <p>"If she was just a retired doctor, it wouldn't be an issue," said Dale Groves, vice president for underwriting for the Providence, R.I., company.
<p>Johnston is vice chairwoman of her town's Democratic committee and a member of the Hillsborough County Democratic Committee. She helps campaigns by distributing posters and making calls, and she held a get-out-the-vote session for Howard Dean at her house.
<p>Groves said that's enough.
<p>"It's a common practice within the industry not to cover that because of libel and slander (risks)," he said.
<p>The nonrenewal letter prompted state Sen. Lou D'Allesandro, Rep. Claudia Chase and Rep. John DeJoie, all Democrats, to file legislation to require insurers to cover politicians.
<p>"It's a matter of First Amendment rights," said DeJoie, of Concord.
<p>DeJoie is reviewing existing law to see what, if any, protections there are for lawmakers.
<p>"I, as a state legislator, could conceivably lose my insurance," he said.
<p>Most likely, DeJoie and other lawmakers don't have coverage now against libel and slander, Groves said. Such coverage isn't standard under the home and auto policies most people have.
<p>Groves said companies including his sell separate coverage for personal injury claims to people who have less exposure to being sued. But politicians must find coverage elsewhere, he said.
<p>Providence renewed Johnston's policies covering her home and car because they don't cover libel or slander from her political activities, Groves said. But it would not renew her $1 million umbrella policy, which, as its name suggests, kicks in for claims not covered by the narrower policies.
<p>Johnston likely could get coverage, but probably through a company that specializes in high-risk clients, said David Withers, the property and casualty actuary for the state Insurance Department.
<p>Coverage decisions in New Hampshire are left up to insurance companies, with one exception: automobiles. Insurers must take all comers, though some drivers are put into a high-risk pool with higher rates, Withers said.
<p>Johnston said she had nothing particular in mind when she bought her umbrella policy years ago.

<p>"People thought doctors had a lot of money, and I wanted coverage if my dog bit someone," she said.
<p>She said she got the nonrenewal letter after she filled out a questionnaire describing her activities.
<p>"I don't think it ever came up before," she said.
<p>"My main concern is - other than it seems terribly unjust - that they would use such a reason to not renew a policy after so many years," she said. "People shouldn't be penalized for their political activity."
