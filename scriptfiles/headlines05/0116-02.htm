<p> BAGHDAD   - Many Iraqis reacted angrily on Sunday  to news that U.S. soldier Charles Graner had been sentenced to  10 years in jail for his role in prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib  jail, saying he should have faced harsher punishment.
<p> 
			
			But struggling to cope with daily violence, crime, and fuel  and food shortages, and fearing more bloodshed ahead of Jan. 30  elections, most said they had paid little attention to Graner's  court martial.<p> 
			
			Some said members of Saddam Hussein's regime responsible  for torture and killing at the notorious prison west of Baghdad  before the U.S.-led invasion should also be brought to justice.<p> 
			
			"It's too little. This isn't justice," trader Ali Ahmed,  23, said of Graner's sentence.<p> 
			
			"Even capital punishment isn't enough. But since it's  forbidden to torture him the way he tortured the prisoners, I  would have settled for the death penalty."<p> 
			
			A military jury in Fort Hood, Texas, sentenced Graner on  Saturday to 10 years' imprisonment for his leading role in the  torture of Iraqi prisoners at Abu Ghraib, five years less than  the maximum sentence possible.<p> 
			
			The sentencing came a day after a jury convicted Graner on  10 counts related to the abuses, many of which were documented  in photographs that included naked prisoners stacked into a  pyramid and being forced to masturbate.<p> 
			
			But Iraqi newspapers had only limited coverage of the court  martial and many Iraqis said they had not been following it.<p> 
			
			OUTRAGE OVER ABUSE<p> 
			
			"As an ex-soldier, I admit that no army is perfect," said  38-year-old meteorologist Ali Mahawi.<p> 
			
			"It isn't just the American army that has these things. We  had abuse that happened in our army," he said. But he added  that he did not think the sentence was sufficient:<p> 
			
			"I think 10 years isn't much and a stronger sentence would  have produced a more effective deterrent."<p> 
			
			Even before the scandal of U.S. abuse at Abu Ghraib  erupted, the prison had a grim reputation because many of  Saddam's enemies were jailed, tortured and killed there.<p> 
			
			Some Iraqis said that should not be forgotten.<p> 
			
			"The abuse in Abu Ghraib prison was far worse under Saddam.  I don't blame a foreign army ending up abusing Iraqis because  they don't care about us, but it hurts me to know that Iraqis  were abusing Iraqis with the most horrific torture and it's  those I want to see brought to justice," said Salih al-Jubouri,  a 33-year-old unemployed man.<p> 
			
			He said two of his brothers were tortured during Saddam's  rule.<p> 
			
			The U.S. prison abuse scandal helped turn many Iraqis who  initially welcomed the overthrow of Saddam against the foreign  troops who removed him from power.<p> 
			
			Some Iraqis said the best punishment was for Graner to  suffer the same treatment he subjected others to.<p> 
			
			"The torture in Saddam's time was worse than this, but this  was also quite bad," said Ahmed Ali, 20, a van driver from  Baghdad's Shi'ite Sadr City district.<p> 
			
			"What use is 10 years when he humiliated other humans? They  should use on him the same torture methods he used on others."<p>
