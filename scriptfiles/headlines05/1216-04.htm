<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p>Amnesty International said on Thursday
Britain had allowed the CIA to operate flights on its territory
to transport terrorism detainees illegally and demanded that
the government launch an investigation.</p>
<p>"The UK has allowed these aircraft to land, refuel and take
off from their territory," the human rights group's regional
director Claudio Cordone said in a statement.</p>
<p>"The UK government must launch an immediate, thorough and
independent investigation into mounting evidence that its
territory has been used to assist in unlawfully transporting
detainees to countries where they may face "disappearance,"
torture or other ill-treatment," he added.</p>
<p>The British government said on Monday it had no evidence
that the current U.S. administration has been transporting
terrorism suspects through British airports.</p>
<p>Cordone said: "Whether the U.S. is sending people to other
countries to be tortured, or snatching them in other countries
to be abused in Guantanamo, international law prohibits the UK,
or any other state, from aiding or abetting them."</p>
<p>Human rights groups accuse the CIA of running secret
prisons in eastern Europe and covertly transporting detainees
-- a practice known as "extraordinary rendition." They say
incommunicado detention often leads to torture.</p>
<p>The Amnesty statement named several men it said had been
abducted by the CIA and flown to Jordan and Egypt as part of
the U.S. campaign of "extraordinary rendition."</p>
<p>In each case a Gulfstream V, registration N379P, had
stopped to refuel at Prestwick airport in Scotland on its way
back to the United States after dropping off its passengers, it
said.</p>
<p>It cited the case of Jamil Qasim Saeed Mohammed who it said
was seen being bundled aboard the CIA plane by masked men in
Karachi on Oct 23, 2001. The plane then flew to Jordan and the
following day, now without its passenger, it flew to Prestwick
and then on to Dulles International airport near Washington.</p>

<p>It demanded that the United States reveal Mohammed's
whereabouts.</p>
<p>Amnesty said that on January 12, 2002, Indonesian security
officials saw Muhammad Saad Iqbal Madni being put on the plane
in Jakarta and flown to Cairo. Once again the plane stopped in
Prestwick to refuel after depositing its passenger.</p>
<p>It said Iqbal Madni had since been returned to U.S.
jurisdiction and was now a detainee in Guantanamo Bay where
fellow detainees had said he was on the verge of a breakdown.</p>
<p>Amnesty cited a third case where a Swedish investigation
has already revealed that U.S. security officials took Ahmed
Agiza and Mohammed al-Zari from Sweden to Cairo for torture.</p>
<p>In total, Gulfstream N379P had been logged between 2001 and
2005 making at least 78 stopovers at British airports while en
route to or from destinations such as Baku, Dubai, Cyprus,
Karachi, Qatar, Riyadh, Tashkent, and Warsaw, Amnesty said.
