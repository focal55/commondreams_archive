<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p>Italy's diplomatic spat with the United States amid sharply differing accounts of the killing of an Italian intelligence agent by US troops has revived a debate over the withdrawal of Rome's 3,000 troops from Iraq.

<P>Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi is to go before parliament on Thursday to explain the Italian version of events and address the current state of relations with Rome's US allies, amid renewed opposition calls for the withdrawal of Italian troops.

<P>Italy late Monday blamed a hastily prepared roadblock manned by jumpy, inexperienced US soldiers for the death of the agent, Nicola Calipari, in a report released by the government which sharply differs from the official US version of events.

<P>Berlusconi intervened directly to ensure the report would not damage relations with Washington, press reports said here Tuesday.

<P>Newspapers said Berlusconi, a key European ally of US President George W. Bush, had personally demanded changes to the document to soften criticism of the Americans and ensure it would not sour relations.

<P>The report released late Monday blamed the killing of Calipari, while he was escorting a freed Italian hostage to Baghdad airport, on the "inexperience" of US troops acting under stress and without proper rules of engagement.

<P>Rome's report differed significantly from the US account issued on Saturday, which exonerated the American troops who fired on Calipari, a major general in the Italian secret service, near Baghdad airport on March 4.

<P>Berlusconi faced down massive street protests in Italy to send 3,000 Italian troops to southern Iraq in June 2003 in a gesture to his ally, two months after the formal overthrow of Saddam Hussein's regime.

<P>But outrage over the killing, fueled by a feeling that the US military has dismissed legitimate Italian concerns and acted arrogantly to protect its own men, has led to renewed calls for Rome to withdraw its troops from Bush's "coalition of the willing."

<P>"The dramatic situation in Iraq makes the return of the Italian troops even more relevant. Yesterday's report confirms that Iraq is a country in chaos," said Green Party leader Alfonso Percoraro Scanio.

<P>"One cannot accept that stressed, ill-prepared and inexpert soldiers like those who killed the brave Calipari, are shooting at passers-by. Enough talking, it's time to begin withdrawing," he said.

<P>Parliament voted in March to prolong the mission in Iraq for another six months, and Berlusconi has already said Italy could begin withdrawing its troops in September, if Italy's allies agreed.

<P>Raffaele Costa, a member of the prime minister's Forza Italia party, said Tuesday that while no link should be made between the Calipari incident and the withdrawal of the troops, the government would have to grasp the nettle.

<P>"Prime Minister Berlusconi will go to parliament on Thursday and provide all the necessary information on the Calipari case and the steps which have been taken with respect to the US government, but it is necessary to address the growing unease in the country and confront the thorniest subject, whether or not to prolong the mission."

<P>"The only sure thing is that the Americans killed one of our men," said another opposition figure, Nicola Mancino of the Margherita coalition.

<P>"If it comes out that the Americans made a mistake, they must admit it, just as the Italian government must admit if there were errors on its part," he said.

<P>However, Ignazio La Russa, deputy leader of government party the National Alliance, described Calipari's death as a "tragedy, an accident due to inexperience."

<P>"Calling for the withdrawal of the troops does no honor to those who says these things, and to the Italian government's balanced but firm position," said La Russa.

<P>Rome's Il Messaggero daily said Berlusconi "read, reread, corrected and tweaked" the report before handing it back to military intelligence. According to the press, this was why the report was released only at 10:00 pm (2000 GMT) -- four hours later than originally announced.
