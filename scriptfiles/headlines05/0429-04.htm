<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p>The mother of a British soldier killed in Iraq said today she will fight “tooth and nail” to take Tony Blair to court over the death of her son and what she described as “war crimes”.

<P>Rose Gentle, whose 19-year-old son Gordon was killed in a roadside blast in Basra in June last year, said that the action would also involve Reg Keys who is standing against Mr Blair in the Sedgefield constituency, as well as <a href="http://www.mfaw.org.uk/" target="_new">Military Families Against The War</a> and the <a href="http://www.stopwar.org.uk/" target="_new">Stop The War Coalition</a>.

<P>Mrs Gentle, of Pollok in Glasgow, revealed her intentions after it emerged that the Attorney General warned the Prime Minister that British ministers and troops could end up in court over the war.

<P>Today, at a press conference in East Kilbride, where Mrs Gentle is standing against Armed Forces Minister Adam Ingram, she said: “We want justice not just for Gordon but for all the boys killed in Iraq and for all the Iraqis that have been killed.

<P>“I am now seeking legal advice to take Tony Blair to court for war crimes because I believe he is responsible for my son’s death, responsible for the rest of the boys’ deaths.

<P>“It is time we all stood up to the Government and told them that we are not going to take any more of their lies.”

<P>Human Rights lawyer Aamer Anwar is acting for Mrs Gentle. He said: “We will fight tooth and nail to get Tony Blair into court.

<P>“Mr Blair owes the life of many sons and daughters, a debt he can never repay.

<P>“Tony Blair sent Gordon Gentle to die for oil. He claimed this war was to stop weapons of mass destruction, but we now know it was for the illegal aim of regime change.

<P>“This is now the time for accountability – over 88 British servicemen killed, over 100,000 innocent Iraqi victims, men, women and children dead.

<P>“Tony Blair and his ministers for war such as Adam Ingram are not fit to hold office and we intend to use this election and the courts to make them pay the price because they are nothing more than accomplices to murder.”

<P>He added: “The first action is to seek a judicial review under Article 2 of the European Convention On Human Rights.

<P>“The Government have a positive duty to protect life and that responsibility was undermined by the decision to proceed to war on an illegal basis.”
