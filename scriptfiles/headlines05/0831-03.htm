BAGHDAD  - Nearly 650 Iraqi Shi'ites died in a 
stampede on a Tigris River bridge in Baghdad on Wednesday, 
panicked by rumors a suicide bomber was about to blow himself 
up, an Interior Ministry official told Reuters.

Most victims were women and children who "died by drowning 
or being trampled" after panic swept a throng of thousands of 
people heading to a religious ceremony, the official said.</p><p> By 2:15 p.m. the death toll had risen to 647, with 301 
injured, the official said.</p><p> Television images showed people clambering down from the 
bridge to escape the surging crowd and piles of slippers left 
behind by the crush of people.</p><p> One hospital said it had received at least 100 bodies by 
12:30. A hospital source said bodies were also being sent to 
two nearby hospitals.</p><p> A police source said swarming crowds had been heading to 
the Kadhimiya mosque in the old district of north Baghdad for a 
religious ceremony when someone shouted there was a suicide 
bomber among them.</p><p> "Hundreds of people started running and some threw 
themselves off the bridge into the river," the source said.</p><p> "Many elderly died immediately as a result of the stampede 
but dozens drowned, many bodies are still in the river and 
boats are working on picking them up."

</p><p> MORTAR ATTACKS</p><p> Earlier at least seven people were killed in three separate 
mortar attacks on the crowd as thousands of people marched to 
the mosque.</p><p> Tensions have been running high between the main religious 
and ethnic communities ahead of a referendum on a divisive new 
constitution for the post-Saddam Hussein era.</p><p> Parliament completed work on a draft constitution on Sunday 
and it must be approved by a popular mandate before October 15 
to come into force.</p><p> The crowd was celebrating the martyrdom of Musa Al-Kadhim, 
a revered religious figure among Shi'ites.</p><p> Reuters Television showed a woman weeping over the body of 
her dead child in al-Nu'man hospital. Dozens of bodies were 
strewn across the floor.</p><p> The hospital was filled with the sounds of screaming and 
wailing as disconsolate men and women searched for, and found, 
loved ones.</p><p> Doctors and orderlies were treating many of the injured on 
the floor or on trolleys in corridors. A child lay unconscious 
on a stretcher, with an intravenous drip dangling from her arm.

</p><p> OFFICIAL MOURNING</p><p> Prime Minister Ibrahim Jaafari declared three days of 
mourning, state television reported.</p><p> "This is a great tragedy which will leave a scar on our 
souls ... We pray to God that he will save the souls of our 
martyrs and help heal the wounded," President Jalal Talabani 
said in a statement.</p><p> Explosions were heard across Baghdad on Wednesday morning.</p><p> A Reuters correspondent reported hearing six mortar rounds 
exploding near the main airport, although the U.S. military had 
no information of any attacks there.</p><p> Despite the draft constitution, there has been no easing in 
an insurgency waged by Sunni Muslims, dominant under Saddam, 
and international guerrillas inspired by Osama bin Laden.</p><p> The U.S.-led coalition invaded Iraq in March 2003 and has 
been battling insurgents while Iraqis have tried to form a new 
post-Saddam constitution and government.</p><p> The persistent fighting has helped to push down President 
George W. Bush's approval rating to a career low of 45 percent 
on concerns over the war and soaring fuel prices, according to 
an ABC News/Washington Post poll published on Tuesday.</p><p> The U.S. war in Iraq now costs more per month than the 
average monthly cost of military operations in Vietnam in the 
1960s and 1970s, according to a report issued on Wednesday.</p><p> The report, entitled "The Iraq Quagmire" from the Institute 
for Policy Studies and Foreign Policy in Focus, both liberal, 
anti-war organizations, put the cost of operations in Iraq at 
$5.6 billion per month.</p><p> This breaks down to almost $186 million a day.</p><p> "By comparison, the average cost of U.S. operations in 
Vietnam over the eight-year war was $5.1 billion per month, 
adjusting for inflation," it said.</p><p> <i>(Additional reporting by Mariam Karouny, Fares Mehdawi,
