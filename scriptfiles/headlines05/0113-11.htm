      <p>WASHINGTON - The impunity surrounding the ethnic cleansing in Darfur, 
        Sudan and the Abu Ghraib prison scandal in U.S.-occupied Iraq has dealt 
        a serious blow to global efforts to strengthen respect for human rights, 
        according to a major U.S. human rights group. 
      <p> ”No one would equate the two,” according to a lengthy introduction to 
        the 527-page survey of 60 countries by Kenneth Roth, executive director 
        of Human Rights Watch (HRW), ”yet each, in its own way, has had an insidious 
        effect.” 
      <p> ”One involves indifference in the face of the worst imaginable atrocities, 
        the other is emblematic of a powerful government flouting a most basic 
        prohibition,” he wrote. ”One presents a crisis that threatens many lives, 
        the other a case of exceptionalism that threatens the most fundamental 
        rules.” 
      <p> ”The vitality of the global defense of human rights depends on a firm 
        response to each,” he went on, urging serious efforts by the U.N. or any 
        competent group of nations to stop the Sudanese government's slaughter 
        in Darfur and to condemn the policy decisions by the Bush administration 
        that resulted in torture and mistreatment of Iraqi and other detainees 
        and to punish those responsible. 
      <p> This year's survey, the fifteenth since 1990, covers human rights developments 
        in 63 countries worldwide last year, among them the most problematic and 
        controversial. Next to the annual State Department ”Country Reports”, 
        which are ordinarily released in February, the annual HRW ”<a href="http://www.hrw.org/wr2k5/" target="_new">World 
        Report</a>” is one of the most comprehensive surveys published each year. 
      <p> In addition to reporting on each of the covered countries, this year's 
        edition also includes essays on the relationship between religion and 
        human rights; sexuality and the cultural attack on human rights; and an 
        in-depth analysis of the Darfur crisis. 
      <p> Between 70,000 and 300,000 African Darfurese are believed to have died 
        or been killed over the past two years as a direct result of a ”scorched-earth” 
        counter-insurgency campaign by the government and government-backed Arab 
        militias that has also forced some 1.6 million to flee their homes. 
      <p> That the campaign has been carried out on the tenth anniversary of the 
        genocide in Rwanda makes the situation particularly compelling. 
      <p> Last summer, the U.S. Congress passed a resolution characterizing the 
        onslaught as ”genocide.” The term was explicitly endorsed by Secretary 
        of State Colin Powell in September and later by President George W. Bush, 
        although Powell stated that labeling the killing ”genocide” did not imply 
        that any ”new action” was required. 
      <p> While a number of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have also endorsed 
        the label, neither HRW nor Amnesty International has gone so far, maintaining 
        that too little yet was known about the government's specific intent. 
        Both have nonetheless called for strong international action to stop the 
        killing. 
      <p> The United States has gone to the U.N. Security Council to press its 
        concerns. But worries that China, which has substantial oil investments 
        in Sudan, and Russia, which profits from arms sales to Khartoum, oppose 
        strong action have led Washington settle for a series of resolutions. 
      <p> They have called on Sudan to stop the violence, authorized the deployment 
        of up to 3,500 African Union (AU) troops to observe a ”cease-fire” in 
        Darfur (of which only about 1,000 have been able to deploy to date), and 
        mandated a U.N. Commission of Inquiry to assess the situation and report 
        back to the Council at the end of January. 
      <p> For several months, human rights groups, including Amnesty and HRW, 
        have been calling for the Council to approve a new U.N. resolution that 
        would at least authorize the AU mission to protect civilians and threaten 
        specific economic sanctions, including possibly an oil embargo, against 
        Khartoum if the violence does not stop within a short period of time. 
      <p> Some have called for the U.S. to intervene alongside the AU, as well 
        as other willing powers, to impose an end to the killing. 
      <p> In his introductory essay, Roth argued that a large, U.N.-authorized 
        military force is now needed to protect Darfur's residents and create 
        the conditions for them to return home safely. He assailed the United 
        States and western governments for simply ”handing the problem to the 
        (AU), a new institution with few resources and no experience with military 
        operations of the scale needed.” 
      <p> ”Darfur is making a mockery of our vows of 'never again,'” Roth said 
        Thursday, noting that the western powers ”have seemed more focused on 
        limiting their obligation to the people of Darfur than on ending the killing.” 
      <p> As for the mistreatment of U.S. detainees held in violation of the Geneva 
        Conventions, Washington has not only seriously weakened its ability to 
        speak out with any credibility about human rights violations by other 
        countries, according to the HRW director, but has also actually made it 
        easier for terrorists, who are responsible for much more serious crimes, 
        to recruit followers. 
      <p> ”(B)ecause deliberately attacking civilians is an affront to the most 
        basic human rights values, an effective defense against terrorism requires 
        not only traditional security measures but also reinforcement of a human 
        rights culture,” Roth wrote. 
      <p> ”But when the United States disregards human rights, it undermines that 
        human rights culture and thus sabotages one of the most important tools 
        for dissuading potential terrorists,” he said. ”Instead, U.S. abuses have 
        provided a new rallying cry for terrorist recruiters, and the pictures 
        from Abu Ghraib have become the recruiting posters for Terrorism, Inc.” 
      <p> The U.S. government's systematic use of coercive interrogation, he said, 
        has weakened a pillar of international human rights law -- that governments 
        should never subject detainees to torture or other mistreatment, even 
        in the face of war or other serious threat. 
      <p> ”Yet in fighting terrorism, the U.S. government has treated this cornerstone 
        obligation as a matter of choice, not duty,” he wrote. 
      <p> Not only is such treatment considered by professional interrogators 
        as far less likely to produce reliable information than time-tested techniques 
        of careful questioning, probing, cross-checking, and gaining the confidence 
        of the detainee, but it completely undermines the credibility of Bush's 
        insistence that Washington is acting in defense of human rights and democratic 
        values, the group says. 
      <p> Moreover, its actions have already resulted in other countries, such 
        as Egypt, Malaysia, Russia, and Cuba, citing the U.S.'s violation of the 
        Geneva Conventions and other questionable activities conducted in pursuit 
        of its ”war on terror” as justifications for their own abuses. 
      <p> ”Governments facing human rights pressure from the United States now 
        find it easy to turn the tables,” said Roth. ”Washington can't very well 
        uphold principles that it violates itself.”
