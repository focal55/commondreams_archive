<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><P>The American Civil Liberties Union asked the state Wednesday to reveal 
whether law enforcement agents were gathering information on California 
activists, in light of revelations that the federal government monitored a 
conference on Iraq at Stanford University and an anti-war protest at UC Santa 
Cruz. 
<P>The ACLU asked whether local and state law enforcement officials were 
providing information to the FBI about a variety of groups, including 
Greenpeace, United for Peace and Justice, Code Pink, UC Santa Cruz Students 
Against the War, and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. 
<P>Three California affiliates of the ACLU filed their request with Attorney 
General Bill Lockyer, citing the state Public Records Act. 
<P>The FBI has said it conducts investigations legally and according to 
Justice Department rules. Lockyer spokesman Nathan Barankin had not yet seen 
the request Wednesday but said the office would comply. 
<P>The ACLU seeks any intelligence compiled by the California Anti-Terrorism 
Information Center, a clearinghouse of information about domestic intelligence. 
Lockyer reorganized the center in 2003 after concerns that it was collecting 
intelligence on activists conducting peaceful demonstrations. 
<P>The ACLU is concerned that because federal officials have greater leeway 
to investigate organizations than do their California counterparts, state and 
local agents could be conducting surveillance for Washington that would be 
illegal under California law. 

<P>"The Bay Area has a rich tradition of opposing various activities of the 
government and having a robust debate on current issues," said Mark Schlosberg, 
police practices policy director of the ACLU of Northern California. "The 
prospect of the government monitoring that peaceful activity is disturbing." 
<P>On Tuesday, the national ACLU released FBI documents it had obtained that 
the group said "showed the FBI expanding the definition of 'domestic terrorism' 
to include citizens and groups that participate in lawful protests and civil 
disobedience." 
<P>Included in the thousands of pages were documents showing that FBI agents 
had obtained a contact list for "attendees at the Third National Organizing 
Conference on Iraq," a 2002 event at Stanford University at which activists and 
academics discussed the effect of sanctions on Iraq. 
<P>Though the report was heavily redacted, the documents said the event was 
"affiliated with (the) American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee," a 
25-year-old civil rights organization that was one of the co-sponsors of the 
conference. 
<P>"Why would you have surveillance of a conference at a respected 
university?" said Mary Rose Oakar, a former Ohio congresswoman and president of 
the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, who noted that no one involved 
in the event had been arrested. "Do we not have academic freedom in this 
country?" 
<P>The FBI files released this week by the ACLU also showed that the 
government had been monitoring the activities of People for the Ethical 
Treatment of Animals. 
<P>Noting the group's penchant for street theater, PETA general counsel Jeff 
Kerr said, "The FBI ought to be able to tell the difference between a terrorist 
and a guy in a chicken suit handing out leaflets." 
<P>Last week, MSNBC obtained 400 pages of Pentagon documents revealing that 
the U.S. military had listed 1,500 "suspicious incidents" across the country 
over a 10-month period dating back to 2004, including dozens of anti-war 
meetings and protests. 
<P>Among the incidents was an April 6 anti-military recruiting protest at UC 
Santa Cruz. The military, which defended its intelligence as "properly 
collected" to MSNBC, listed the Santa Cruz protest as a credible security 
threat. 
<P>"If the Pentagon is gathering information about students and labeling 
nonviolent protest as a threat, then what is the average American going to feel 
about picking up a sign and getting out to the streets to protest the war?" 
said Josh Sonnefeld, a UC Santa Cruz student and anti-military recruiting 
organizer who attended the demonstration.<p align="center">&copy;2005 San Francisco Chronicle</p>
