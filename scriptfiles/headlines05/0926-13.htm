<p><a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2005/09/23/publiceye/entry880650.shtml">CBS News is running this blog</a> from one of their guys down in New Orleans, which includes, in part:

<blockquote><i>The teams working in St. Bernard Parish, which is now an enormous toxic waste dump, are waking up with sore throats and other respiratory ailments. Privately, the EPA testers have told them that all the pollutants and environmental toxins are way off the scale. No one is looking to stay there long.</i></blockquote>
<p>If this is true, there must be an immediate stop to any plans to repopulate and an immediate fullscale investigation into the EPA and what they are holding back.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/weather/articles/2005/09/25/breaches_renew_fears_of_toxins/">Associated Press is reporting in this story </a>that the sludge and everything else was stirred up by new flooding in New Orleans due to Rita, and they have no idea if there were any breaches at any hazardous sites. Just more reason to slow everything down.</p>
