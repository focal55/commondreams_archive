<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p>The tangled issue of Iraq returned to haunt Prime Minister Tony Blair, just 10 days before Britain's general election, as he was forced to defend himself against new accusations that he misled the nation in the run-up to the conflict.

<P>Blair faced a tough grilling from reporters following a weekend newspaper report that the government's chief legal officer had raised a series of worries about the war's legality just before it started in March 2003.

<P>Adding to the pressure, the leader of the Conservative Party openly accused Blair of lying about his reasons for supporting the US-led military campaign.

<P>The smaller Liberal Democrats, meanwhile, demanded a full public inquiry into the Iraq war and called for British voters -- many of whom opposed it -- to punish Blair at the May 5 election.

<P>Blair had hoped to use a morning press conference to talk up his government's handling of the economy, but instead had to field a series of questions on Iraq, an issue which has haunted him for more than two years.

<P>He and opponents of the Iraq war would "never resolve" their differences, Blair conceded, but said the time for such arguments was now over.

<P>On Sunday, a newspaper published what it said were extracts from pre-war legal advice given to Blair by Attorney General Lord Peter Goldsmith, the government's top legal officer.

<P>Since the war, Goldsmith has repeatedly said that he advised ministers the conflict was permitted under international law, but has refused to issue his full reasoning, saying this is confidential.

<P>The Mail on Sunday said it had obtained a 13-page advice document drawn up by Goldsmith which raised six separate legal concerns about the war.

<P>These included the possible need for a second United Nations resolution -- which was never passed -- and a caution that the UN had not authorised the use of "all necessary means" to enforce its resolutions against Baghdad.

<P>Opponents have accused Blair of steamrollering Goldsmith into concluding the war was legal, despite the attorney general's serious reservations.

<P>But facing repeated questions about the newspaper report, Blair insisted Goldsmith had never changed his mind.

<P>"Downing Street did not pressure the attorney general," Blair said, calling Goldsmith's legal advice "very clear".

<P>In the run-up to the conflict, Blair repeatedly told a highly sceptical British public that Saddam Hussein had to be removed because of the Iraqi dictator's stocks of weapons of mass destruction.

<P>However, none were ever found, leading to accusations -- hotly denied by the prime minister -- that he deliberately misled the public.

<P>Conservative leader Michael Howard said Monday that although his party supported the war, it did not back Blair's stated reasons for waging it.

<P>"I think it was possible to go to war but to tell the truth, and Mr Blair did not tell the truth," said Howard, whose party is seeking to portray Blair as an untrustworthy and duplicitous leader.

<P>Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy, who opposed the conflict, called on voters to give their verdict on the war on May 5.

<P>"Tony Blair says history will be his judge. He is wrong -- the British people will be his judge," Kennedy said.

<P>Despite the pressure, opinion polls are forecasting Blair's Labour Party to win a comfortable House of Commons majority on May 5, and the prime minister was scathing about Monday's attacks.

<P>"You have got to ask yourself why this is happening today -- why it is that the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives have gone back to this issue?" Blair asked.

<P>"I would suggest to you it's because they have got nothing serious to say about the issues facing the country for the future."
