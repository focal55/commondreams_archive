<p> A three-year boycott of the American fast food chain Taco Bell has ended in victory for the farm labourers behind the protest.

<P>In what is seen as an historic settlement, Taco Bell agreed to the demands of the workers, some of whom went on hunger strike outside the company's California headquarters.

<P>The deal between the Coalition of Immokalee Workers and Taco Bell's parent company, Yum! Brands, the largest restaurant firm in the world, aims to improve the wages and conditions of the Florida tomato pickers, for years one of the most exploited groups in the US workforce, some of whose conditions have led to prosecutions under slavery laws.

<P>The boycott began in 2002 after the mainly immigrant workers failed to persuade Taco Bell to pressure suppliers to pay proper wages.

<P>It grew gradually, with student activists campaigning to ban Taco Bell from campuses. When farmworkers began a hunger strike outside the company's headquarters in Irvine, California, there was damaging publicity.

<P>The coalition called off the boycott after the Carter Center, a human rights group founded by the former US president Jimmy Carter, helped to negotiate a deal.

<P>In a joint statement, they announced a one cent rise per pound of tomatoes, almost doubling the rate paid per 32lb (14kg) bucket. Farmworkers are paid by the pound, not the hour. Taco Bell will also introduce a conduct code to ensure "more humane labour standards".

<P>The settlement is likely to have major consequences for farmworkers, as Yum! Brands also owns Pizza Hut and KFC.

<P>"This is an important victory for farmworkers, one that establishes a new standard of social responsibility for the fast-food industry and makes an immediate material change in the lives of workers," said the coalition's Lucas Benitez. "This sends a clear challenge to other industry leaders."

<P>The president of Taco Bell, Emil Brolick, said: "We recognise that Florida tomato workers do not enjoy the same rights and conditions as employees in other industries and there is a need for reform. We have indicated that any solution must be industry-wide, as our company simply does not have the clout alone to solve the issues raised."

<P>Taco Bell will now make tomato suppliers pass on the increase directly. Mr Brolick said the firm would only buy tomatoes from growers who accepted the deal.
