<p>WASHINGTON  - From New York's Times Square  to a lawn outside an old government building in Hawaii,  American anti-war activists prepared to mark the 2,000th U.S.  military death in Iraq with prayer, candlelight and protest.</p>

</font>In more than 300 events set for Wednesday, one day after  the milestone number was reported, those who oppose the war in  Iraq plan to gather at war memorials, federal buildings and in  New York, on a city street corner -- as well as at such  landmarks as Rockefeller Plaza and a recruiting station in  Times Square.</p>
<p>          &quot;It is time to end the destruction, and rebuild war-torn  Iraq and hurricane-ravaged communities in the U.S.,&quot; wrote the  organizer of an event at the Montana state capitol building in  the city of Helena.</p>
<p>          In Lihue, on the Hawaiian island of Kauai, another  organizer invited activists to a prayer vigil on the lawn of  the old county building: &quot;Bring prayers and songs to share.&quot;</p>
<p>          Another vigil, by candlelight, was planned for the sidewalk  outside the White House in Washington D.C., the site of a noisy  demonstration and numerous arrests in September.</p>
<p>          The featured speaker at that earlier event, military mother  Cindy Sheehan, whose son was killed in Iraq, said she plans to  speak at this one, and then tie herself to the White House  fence to protest the war. Sheehan's son, Army Specialist Casey  Sheehan, was killed on April 4, 2004.</p>
<p>          &quot;To me, every single member since Number One has been  tragic and needless and unnecessary,&quot; Sheehan said in a  telephone interview. &quot;My son was somewhere around 615, and I've  been working so hard for peace since my son was killed and now  almost 1,400 more soldiers have been killed since Casey died.&quot;</p>
<p>          Vigils were also expected in San Diego, Los Angeles and San  Francisco.</p>
<p>          In Houston, a weeklong observance to honor those killed in  Iraq, including U.S. military and Iraqi casualties, was to  begin October 29 at the memorial to the Second World War in  that city.</p>
<p>          Peace activists in Oklahoma City scheduled a candlelight  vigil in Memorial Park.</p>
<p>          The peace group American Friends Service Committee, which  helped coordinate some of these events online at <a href="http://www.afsc.org/2000/" target="_new">www.afsc.org</a>,  urged the U.S. Congress to halt funding for the Iraqi war.</p>
<p>          &quot;As parents, citizens and compassionate people, we have to  demand that the funding of this exhausted war stops now, before  one more death occurs or one more dollar is spent,&quot; Lila  Lipscomb, whose son Sgt. Michael Pederson was killed in Iraq in  2003, said in a statement announcing the campaign.</p>
<p>          Lipscomb was set to speak at an anti-war event in Lansing,  Michigan on Wednesday.
