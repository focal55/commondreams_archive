<p>The federal prosecutor investigating
who leaked the identity of a CIA operative is expected to
signal within days whether he intends to bring indictments in
the case, legal sources close to the investigation said on
Wednesday.

        <!--/endimage/--> As a first step, prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald was expected
to notify officials by letter if they have become targets, said
the lawyers, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the
sensitivity of the matter.</p>
<p>Fitzgerald could announce plea agreements, bring
indictments, or conclude that no crime was committed. By the
end of this month he is expected to wrap up his nearly
two-year-old investigation into who leaked CIA operative
Valerie Plame's identity.</p>
<p>The inquiry has ensnared President George W. Bush's top
political adviser, Karl Rove, and Vice President Dick Cheney's
chief of staff, Lewis "Scooter" Libby. The White House had long
maintained that Rove and Libby had nothing to do with the leak
but reporters have since named them as sources.</p>
<p>Rove's attorney, Robert Luskin, declined to say whether his
client had been contacted by Fitzgerald. In the past, Luskin
has said that Rove was assured that he was not a target.</p>
<p>Libby's lawyer was not immediately available to comment.</p>
<p>"It's an ongoing investigation and we're fully
cooperating," said Cheney spokeswoman Lea Anne McBride.</p>
<p>The outcome of the investigation could shake up an
administration already reeling from criticism over its response
to Hurricane Katrina and the indictment of House Republican
leader Tom DeLay on a conspiracy charge related to campaign
financing.</p>
<p>New York Times reporter Judith Miller testified to the
grand jury on Friday about the conversations she had with
Libby.</p>

<p>Plame's diplomat husband, Joseph Wilson, has accused the
administration of leaking her name, damaging her ability to
work undercover, to get back at him for criticizing Bush's Iraq
policy.</p>
<p>Fitzgerald's agreement to limit the scope of Miller's
testimony to her conversations with Libby -- a proposal he
rejected a year earlier -- suggested that Libby had become "the
focus of interest," said one of the lawyers involved in the
case.</p>
<p>After initially promising to fire anyone found to have
leaked information in the case, Bush in July offered a more
qualified pledge: "If someone committed a crime they will no
longer work in my administration."
