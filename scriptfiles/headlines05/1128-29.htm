<p> Last February, I wrote a column for the Portland Press Herald about the conflict I felt as my son, Ben, was preparing to go to a war I don't support.

<p>I was worried that he might be killed, but I knew that he would also be put in the position of killing others. I questioned why we were at war in Iraq, and I was angry at those who voted for it and supported it.

<p>The reality Ben knows in Iraq today is very different from the made-up version that the Bush administration tries to shove down our throats.

<p>The Iraqis do not want us to occupy their country. They are angry at us for devastating their country, for killing and maiming their citizens and for destroying their economy.

<p>Ben has come close to being killed a number of times, and he has killed. He is shot at and mortared constantly, and he has had to pick up a dead friend. The stress on him is unrelenting and mind-numbing.

<p>Why are he and tens of thousands of our soldiers being subject to that kind of treatment for a year or more at a time? Why are we really at war in Iraq?

<p>'<b>STOP LOSS' EQUALS SERVITUDE</b>
<p>I recently visited Dirk Maurer, an aide to Sen. Susan Collins and a major in the Marine Reserve who served two tours in Iraq. He told me that "the Marines were the best thing that happened to Fallujah, although there were a few holes in the buildings."

<p>I have seen the disgraceful pictures of a butchered Fallujah, images that my country is ashamed to show its citizens. Do Americans really approve of what are usually classified as crimes against humanity? Why won't Sen. Collins hold public meetings on the war in Iraq to discuss this, and the torture, and the slaughter, and the obscene costs of this war?

<p>I recently met with Sen. Olympia Snowe and asked her if she understood "stop loss," the term for the military's authority to hold onto troops after their enlistments are up, a virtual license to enslave soldiers. She said she knew the term.

<p>I asked her if troops were being asked to serve multiple terms in combat because recruitment numbers have plummeted. She said that the soldiers had contracts that allowed that practice and since we have a volunteer military, it was up to the Pentagon to deal with that.

<p>Do Americans really believe that it is OK to recycle our soldiers and subject them to the daily cruel brutality of war for multiple tours just to protect their own sons and daughters from such heartless treatment?

<p>Why won't Sen. Snowe hold public meetings on the war in Iraq to find out how we feel about the sadistic treatment of our soldiers and the justification for it?

<p><b>'ADDICTED TO RE-ELECTION'
</b>
<p>Rep. Tom Allen is proud of voting against the war in Iraq. He blames the Republicans who control government for avoiding an inquiry into the Bush administration's stated justifications for the war in Iraq.

<p>Unfortunately, Allen has supported the war by voting for the supplemental budget requests to finance the war ever since, and he has done this in virtual silence. Why doesn't Allen recognize that the war in Iraq isn't just a Republican or Democratic problem?

<p>Why isn't Allen sponsoring a series of public meetings on the war in Iraq and the horrible future we have in store for us when the demand for payment comes due? Why doesn't he vote against financing the war now?

<p>President Bush is literally the kiss of death in Iraq and at home, and our elected politicians are sitting on the sidelines letting it happen. There is no leadership, no plan and certainly no public discussion on the war in Iraq.

<p>Our politicians are avoiding public discussion. Our politicians are addicted to re-election more than they are to public service.

<p>Our politicians are disconnected to what happens to ordinary citizens and seem to favor the rich and powerful.

<p>It is time to make changes. Why should my son die or have his mind reduced to Jell-O because of the silence and inaction of our politicians?

<p>For that matter, why should that happen to your loved one or any other citizen of the world?
