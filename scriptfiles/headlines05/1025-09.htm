<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->BAGHDAD, Iraq - The war in Iraq saw two milestones Tuesday that reflect the country's path to democracy and its human toll as officials said the referendum on a draft constitution passed and the U.S. military's death toll reached 2,000.</b></p>
<p>CNN's count of U.S. fatalities reflects reports from military sources and includes deaths in Iraq, Kuwait and other units assigned to the Iraq campaign.</p><p>Among the latest casualties, an American soldier was killed Saturday by a roadside bomb, and a roadside blast killed two Marines in combat Friday near Amariya in the western Anbar province, according to the U.S. military.</p><p>Since the U.S.-led invasion in March 2003, more than 15,000 American service members have been wounded in the conflict, according to the Defense Department.<b></b></p><p>According to CNN's tally, 2,194 coalition troops have died in the war.</p>
<h3>Turnout was 63 percent</h3><p>Iraqi election officials touted the passage of the draft constitution, voted on October 15 after months of contentious, painstaking negotiations by the 275-member interim National Assembly.</p><p>A representative from the Independent Electoral Commission of Iraq said these are "final provisional figures" that need to be certified. (<a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/meast/10/25/iraq.constitution/index.html" target="_blank">Full story</a>)</p><p>Authorities with the commission said 9.85 million people voted in the referendum, about 63 percent of registered voters. More than 78 percent of voters backed the constitution, officials said.</p><p>While passage required a simple majority, there was one obstacle the measure faced -- if two-thirds of the voters in at least three of 18 provinces had rejected it, the draft would have failed.</p><p>Supporters of the referendum were concerned about the voting in several provinces with significant populations of Sunni Arabs, who make up about 20 percent of Iraq's population and largely opposed the measure.</p><p>But figures show that the tally received a two-thirds "no" vote in only two provinces.</p><p>Anbar overwhelmingly voted against the document, with a "no" vote of 97 percent. In Salaheddin province, 82 percent rejected the charter.</p><p>On Monday, election officials said the vote count from the northern province of Nineveh would help determine the outcome. There was a "no" vote in Nineveh, but it was 55 percent.</p><p>In Diyala province, which has a slight Sunni Arab majority, 51 percent of voters said "yes."</p><p>When questioned about extreme results, including the 99 percent "yes" vote in one Kurdish province, electoral officials said U.N. experts and Iraqi teams verified the results.</p><p>Sunni Arab leaders actively boycotted the vote in January electing the National Assembly and found themselves with little voice in the interim government.</p><p>Government officials said they were gratified that Sunnis got involved in the political process this time, even though there was significant Sunni opposition to the draft. Shiites and Kurds have largely backed the constitution.</p>
<p>New parliamentary elections are set for December 15.</p><h3>Other developments</h3><p></p><ul _implied_="true"><li>Three explosions near two Baghdad hotels rocked Iraq's capital at sunset Monday, killing 10 people and wounding 22, Baghdad emergency police said.
