<p>Charles Clarke, the Home Secretary, faced calls yesterday for an urgent review of the 'shoot-to-kill' policy against suicide bombers as MPs demanded the public be consulted.</p>
<p>Sir Bill Morris, the former transport union leader who chaired a pioneering inquiry into disciplinary measures in the Metropolitan Police, led the calls for a public debate. He said citizens should be consulted about such a 'gigantic and fundamental' step taken in their name. His call was backed by opposition politicians.</p>
<p>It emerged yesterday that the Met's guidelines for confronting bombers allow armed police, in some cases, to fire a 'critical headshot' without even challenging the individual to stop, if it is feared an explosion is imminent. Until now, it has been assumed that suspects would be given a chance to surrender.</p>
<p>Gareth Peirce, solicitor for the family of Jean Charles de Menezes - the innocent man shot dead after being mistaken for a suicide bomber - called for Clarke to disclose all details of the policy rather than wait for the official inquiry into her client's death. 'We need the facts in the case now. It's an emergency situation,' she said.</p>
<p>The new tactics were actually disclosed a week after the 7 July bombings, but the full implications did not become apparent until de Menezes was shot on 22 July. The Met has still not published the full guidelines.</p>
<p>Home Office ministers have repeatedly insisted that the 'shoot-to-kill' policy is an operational matter for the police that does not require political approval. However, opposition MPs said it could no longer hide behind operational constraints.</p>
<p>'The new terrorist threat requires new responses,' said Jeremy Browne, a Liberal Democrat member of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee. 'But an operational policy decision as fundamental as shoot to kill poses wider questions about the power of the state, and should be subject to proper political scrutiny and approval.'</p>
<p>Morris said while these tactics might be necessary in some exceptional circumstances, the police needed public support. 'If that is being done in our name, then it seems to me that there needs to be a debate, and political ownership of that has got to go to the elected authority,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today program. 'Operational matters spring from policy, and this is clearly a significant change in policy. When we as a nation decided that we wanted to end capital punishment, we didn't have chief police officers meeting and taking the decision.' But the former Home Office Minister John Denham warned there could be more complicated factors involved than just the police guidelines.</p>
<p>'When I was policing minister, I had the then Police Complaints Authority carry out an assessment of 20 police shootings in which I think the vast majority were of innocent or harmless people, none of which was under the current guidance,' he said.</p>
<p>'The issues turned out to be around training, the handling of information, assessment of intelligence. It would be quite surprising if the same issues don't arise in this case.'</p>
<p>He said it was possible the select committee would investigate the approach to suicide bombers, but only once the Independent Police Complaints Commission - which is now investigating the de Menezes shooting - has established the full facts.</p>
<p>Hazel Blears, the policing minister, told the Today program it was 'right and proper' that there were new tactics for a new threat, adding: 'These are operational matters for the police service about how these decisions are made.'</p>
<p>The new guidance for the campaign against suicide bombers, known as Operation Kratos, was produced after consultation with Israeli security experts.</p>
<p>Officers are advised to shoot at the suspect's head rather than the chest to disable him instantly to avoid detonating explosives strapped to the body.</p>
<p>West Midlands police used a non-lethal Taser stun gun to subdue one of the bombing suspects captured last week. However Sir Ian Blair, the Met Police Commissioner, has openly criticized such tactics, saying a Taser could actually set off a device.</p>
