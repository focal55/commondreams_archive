<P>PARK CITY, Utah  - The Sundance Film Festival kicked off on Thursday with a political tone struck by founder Robert Redford, who called independent film a voice of dissent and encouraged movie-makers to speak their minds.

The curtain rose at the premier U.S. gathering for independent movies on the same day President Bush was inaugurated for his second term, which was not lost on Redford, the Oscar winning actor and director of movies like "The Sting" and "Ordinary People."

<P>Redford told a packed house at Sundance's opening-night premier of the tolerance-themed comedy "Happy Endings" that a goal of the festival was to give a platform to a diverse group of filmmakers with something to say about the times.

<P>"This is really a festival about different voices in film that really reflect, a little more accurately, the world we live in," Redford said.

<P>People believed the times were either "chaotic" or "on course," depending on their place on the political spectrum, he said. Redford has been a champion of environmentalism and free expression and a longtime Democratic contributor. Many conservatives deride the Hollywood film industry as a hotbed of liberalism antagonistic to their values.

<P>"I like to think of this festival as a festival of dissent, and I'd like to celebrate that," Redford said.

<P>A DIVERSE U.S.

<P>"Happy Endings," directed by Sundance alumnus Don Roos and starring Lisa Kudrow, Tom Arnold and Maggie Gyllenhaal, is not so much about dissent as it is about alternative lifestyles, keeping secrets, telling lies and, in the end, tolerance.

<P>Festival director Geoff Gilmore told Reuters before the festival that the film was a good way to kick off Sundance 2005 because it explores modern American values and mores in a rapidly changing world, and that many of this year's movies explored similar themes.

<P>The film tracks the intertwined lives of three different groups of people. Kudrow portrays a counselor at an abortion clinic who remains conflicted over her decision to have a child at a young age.

<P>Arnold is the father of a gay teenage boy who ends up dating the girl, played by Gyllenhaal, who claimed his son's virginity.

<P>Roos took a swipe at last year's battles over gay marriage when he introduced "Happy Endings." He thanked his boyfriend for supporting him through the making of the film and told the audience: "We had a very busy year threatening the sanctity of marriage."

<P>Sundance runs for 10 days in Park City, a mountain resort town east of Salt Lake City, that swells from a population of around 7,500 to somewhere up around 45,000 at festival time, Gilmore said.

<P>Those film fans will be treated to many more festival movies that, like "Happy Endings," explore American values and mores.

<P>Among the 120 other films are a range of documentaries such as "Murderball," about quadriplegic athletes, as well as feature films including "The Chumscrubber," a satirical look at life in the American suburbs.

<P>The festival reaches its climax on Saturday, Jan. 29, in which awards will be handed out for U.S. documentaries and dramas, as well as international documentaries and dramas. <p align="center">Copyright &copy; 2005 Reuters Limited</p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable --></font></td></tr>
