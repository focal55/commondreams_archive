<p> UNITED NATIONS  - Jeers and catcalls greeted the
top U.S. delegate to a global women's conference on Friday as
she stressed Washington's opposition to abortion and support
for sexual abstinence and fidelity.
<p>

 After withdrawing an unpopular anti-abortion amendment from
a key U.N. document, the United States joined in approving the
declaration that reaffirmed a 150-page platform agreed 10 years
ago at a landmark U.N. women's conference in Beijing.
<p>
 The final approval prompted cheers, applause and a standing
ovation by some participants.
<p>
 However, top U.S. delegate Ellen Sauerbrey drew boos from
the audience, which included some of the 6,000 activists who
came from around the world, when she commented on Washington's
interpretation of the document.
<p>
 "We have stated clearly and on many occasions ... that we
do not recognize abortion as a method of family planning, nor
do we support abortion in our reproductive health assistance,"
Sauerbrey said.
<p>
The loudest catcalls, unusual at the world body, came when
she articulated U.S. policy on AIDS  prevention for adolescents:
"We emphasize the value of the ABC -- abstinence, be faithful,
and correct and consistent condom use where appropriate --
approach in comprehensive strategies to combat the spread of
HIV/AIDS and the promotion of abstinence as the healthiest and
most responsible choice for adolescents."
<p>

 Earlier Friday, Sauerbrey said the United States was
dropping its demand that the document be amended to say that
abortion is a matter of national sovereignty and not a human
right delineated by the 1995 conference in Beijing.
<p>
 After a week of closed-door negotiations at the United
Nations during a two-week conference on women's equality,
Sauerbrey said the U.S. point had been made and therefore
Washington's amendment was no longer needed.
<p>
 U.S. GOALS ACCOMPLISHED
<p>
 The first version of the abandoned amendment said the
Beijing meeting's final document did not recognize abortion as
a fundamental right; a later version said the document did not
create any new international human rights, code for abortion.
<p>
 "We think we have really accomplished what we set out to
do," Sauerbrey said. "We have heard from countries ... that our
interpretation is their interpretation. So the amendment we
recognize is really redundant, but it has accomplished its
goals. We will be withdrawing the amendment."
<p>
 Despite U.S. lobbying, support for Washington's abortion
stance was limited to the Vatican, Costa Rica, Nicaragua and
Panama.
<p>
 Mary Ann Dantuono, the Vatican delegate, was interrupted by
shouts when she said the Catholic Church "would have preferred
a clearer statement emphasizing that the Beijing documents
cannot be interpreted as creating new human rights including
the right to abortion."
<p>
 Delegates from the European Union, Asia and Africa
forcefully opposed the U.S. position.
<p>

 "The text of Beijing is unequivocally clear. We should not
spend hours splitting hairs over phrases that mean the same
thing," said New Zealand's U.N. Ambassador Don Mackay, speaking
for his country, Canada and Australia. He said the Beijing
document included a woman's right to control her sexuality.
<p>
 Nigeria echoed Mackay's sentiments on women's sexuality,
but thanked Washington for withdrawing its amendment.
<p>
 The current U.N. session is meant to assess how far women
have come toward equality since the 1995 Beijing conference and
a follow-up meeting five years ago. Organizers seeking
consensus drafted a streamlined document they hoped would be
easily approved without controversy.<p align="center">&copy; 2005 Reuters Ltd</p>
