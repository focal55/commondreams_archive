<p>WASHINGTON - Protesters will march  through Washington, stage a &quot;die in&quot; across from the White  House and turn their backs on President George W. Bush's  limousine during his inaugural celebration next week,  organizers said on Wednesday.

As U.S. authorities prepared unprecedented security for the  Jan. 20 event, organizers said thousands of protesters will  stage a noisy counterpoint to the lavish $40 million  celebration.<p>
</p> One group of anti-war activists said it would carry 1,000  coffins to the White House and stage a &quot;die in&quot; to protest the  lives lost in Iraq.<p>
</p> Another group said it had obtained a permit to protest  along a 200-foot (60-metre) section of the parade route but  planned to sue for more access to the large sections of  Pennsylvania Avenue set aside for Bush supporters.<p>
</p> &quot;The Bush administration, in conjunction with the National  Park Service, is trying to stage-manage democracy,&quot; said Mara  Verheyden-Hilliard, a lawyer for the anti-war group  International ANSWER.<p>
</p> A spokeswoman for the U.S. Secret Service, which is  overseeing security for the event, declined immediate comment.<p>
</p> U.S. authorities plan to involve thousands of police,  troops and bomb-sniffing dogs in the first inaugural event  since the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. Spectators will pass through  metal detectors before attending any inaugural events or  watching the parade from the street.<p>
</p> Organizers said the protests were to express opposition to  a range of Bush policies, from the war in Iraq to economic  programs.<p>
</p> &quot;We're facing a right-wing future that has no sympathy for  the concerns of black people and the poor in this country,&quot;  said Shazza Nzingha, founder of the National Alliance of Black  Panthers.<p>
</p> One organization called <a href="http://www.turnyourbackonbush.com/" target="_new">Turn Your Back on Bush</a> wants people  to stake out spots along the parade route and turn their backs  on Bush's limousine when it rolls by.
<p>
</p> &quot;There are a lot of people who feel Bush has turned his  back on them,&quot; said field director Sarah Kauffman, who said she  is expecting busloads of participants from across the country.<p>
</p> In a separate event, black-clad anarchists will wave  puppets and beat drums to protest capitalism and organized  government, said Lila Kaye of Anarchist Resistance.<p>
</p> Bush's inauguration plans have also drawn protest from the  District of Columbia government, which says its security costs  for the event should not come out of its Homeland Security  budget.<p>
</p> &quot;We the people of Washington, D.C., rejected Bush by over  90 percent (in the last election),&quot; said Washington resident  Nancy Shia. &quot;Maybe this is our punishment.&quot;
