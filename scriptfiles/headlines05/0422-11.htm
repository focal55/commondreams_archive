<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p>DENVER -- The Secret Service has opened a criminal investigation into the removal of three people from President Geroge W. Bush's town hall event last month after they were singled out because of a "No More Blood for Oil" bumper sticker on their car, their lawyer said Thursday.

<P>The Secret Service is looking into whether a man dressed in a dark suit and who was wearing an earpiece criminally impersonated a Secret Service agent when he escorted the three Denver Progressives out of the event March 21 in Denver, where President Bush was touting his Social Security reforms, attorney Dan Recht said.

<P>An agent from Washington, D.C., contacted Recht and asked if his clients Alex Young, Karen Bauer, and Leslie Weise could be interviewed this week as part of the second investigation into the incident, Recht said. The Secret Service has said the first investigation determined the man was not one of its agents but a staff member with the host committee.

<P>Jonathan Cherry, a Washington, D.C.-based spokesman for the Secret Service, said he could not comment or confirm the second investigation. When asked if the case was closed, he also declined comment without elaborating.

<P>The White House has said the man was a volunteer who probably feared the three might have disrupted Bush's event. Bauer, Young and Weise acknowledge they wore T-shirts under their clothing that read, "Stop the Lies" that night but did not plan to reveal them at the event.

<P>Members of Colorado's congressional delegation from both parties have raised concerns about the case. Sen. Ken Salazar and Reps. Diana DeGette and Mark Udall, all Democrats, had asked for investigations while Democratic Rep. John Salazar said he had hoped the town hall would have been a forum for all sides to present their views.

<P>Among Republicans, Rep. Marilyn Musgrave has said she didn't think people should be removed from an event because of a bumper sticker, while Rep. Bob Beauprez said earlier this month that based on what he had heard about the residents' removal, there wasn't a good reason to remove them.
