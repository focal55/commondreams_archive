<p> WESTFIELD, NJ -- Scores of protesters demonstrated Friday morning near a town hall-style meeting where President Bush was to outline his proposal to create personal accounts within Social Security.

<P>One woman was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct, police said. Witnesses said she tried to walk into the street against police wishes.

<P>Speakers at the protest rally were to include Rep. Frank Pallone, D-Long Branch, a Ramapo College student, a senior citizen and a Roselle councilman, organizers with New Jersey Citizen Action said.

<P>Several hundred people gathered outside the Westfield Armory where the president started speaking about 11 a.m. People in the crowd, mainly made up of protesters, were bundled in hats and scarfs as they awaited the president's arrival.

<P>Michelle Rowland, 64 of Scotch Plains, said she came to make her voice heard. She hoped the president would see her sign, which read, "If you want to gamble, Mr. President, go to Atlantic City."

<P>The president has proposed a system of private accounts, which would enable younger workers to divert a portion of their payroll taxes into stock market investments. At campaign-style events around the country, Bush has stressed the current system's problems and the benefits of personal accounts.

<P>Not everyone in the crowd was upset about the proposal.

<P>"I'm really excited he's here too convey to the people of Westfield what his plan to privatize Social Security is all about," said Marcus Swillingsley, 18.

<P>According to the most recent figures available from the Social Security Administration, 1.3 million New Jersey residents received Social Security benefits in December 2002. That included nearly 936,000 retired workers and 131,000 widows and widowers. Social Security beneficiaries represented 15.8 percent of the state's total population.

<P>New Jersey Citizen Action is working with Americans United to Protect Social Security, a coalition of more than 200 organizations formed, at the urging of Democratic congressional leaders, to defeat Bush's proposal.<p align="center">&copy; MMV Infinity Broadcasting Corp</p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable --></font></td></tr>
