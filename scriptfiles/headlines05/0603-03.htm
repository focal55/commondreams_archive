<p>SEATTLE -- A federal appeals court found Thursday that police during the 1999 World Trade Organization meeting may have erred by keeping some protesters out of a restricted zone based on their beliefs.

<p>The ruling means that some demonstrators may pursue a class-action claim that the city violated their constitutional rights.

<p>The three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed, however, that the city had the right to block off part of downtown Seattle after about 50,000 protesters swarmed the area.

<p>A relatively small number also smashed storefronts and overwhelmed police, causing about $2.5 million in damage.

<p>Protesters sued the city, mayor and then-police chief over the curfew zone, saying it violated their rights to free speech and assembly. They also said their rights to equal protection were violated because demonstrators were barred, but not business owners, workers, shoppers and residents.

<p>Thursday's ruling partly reversed a 2001 finding by U.S. District Judge Barbara J. Rothstein and ordered a new trial on the question on who was allowed into the restricted zone.

<p>"In some instances police conduct may have gone too far and infringed on certain individual protesters' constitutional rights by making the content of their expressed views the test for their entry into the restricted zone," Judge Ronald M. Gould wrote for the majority.

<p>But supporting the curfew zone itself, Gould wrote that a city must be allowed to provide "physical security and the maintenance of order."

<p>Arthur Bryant, an attorney who represented some of the protesters, called the decision "both a great victory and a great loss" because of its mixed result.

<p>Ted Buck, a lawyer for the city, said he was pleased the ruling said the city "has the authority to keep order in the streets."

<p>The 135-nation WTO sets rules for world trade. Protesters claimed the organization promotes international commerce at the expense of human rights, labor protections and the environment.
