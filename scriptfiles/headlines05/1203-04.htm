<p>Journalists in Iraq say they are shocked by revelations that the US military paid Iraqi newspapers and journalists to run positive articles about US activities in Iraq.</p>
<p>


"It is a scandal that the US administration would use methods like these which contradict all principles of the profession and seek to defraud public opinion," well-known Iraqi journalist and political analyst Ahmed Sabri said.</p>
<p>

"A newspaper should reflect the reality on the ground, not sponsored information aimed at improving the image of the The United States, which in reality has failed in Iraq," Sabri added.</p>
<p>

The Los Angeles Times <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines05/1130-07.htm">reported</a> Wednesday that dozens of stories written by "information operations" soldiers were secretly placed with media outlets in Iraq through a defense contractor to mask the military's involvement.</p>
<p>

The report relied largely on leaks from members of the military establishment who say they fear that US attempts to influence the Iraqi media may actually be subverting a free press.</p>
<p>

As recently as Tuesday, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld pointed to the free press in Iraq as evidence of the progress made in Iraq.</p>
<p>

Knight-Ridder newspapers on Thursday reported that the military also was paying Iraqi reporters up to 200 dollars a month to write sympathetic stories.</p>
<p>

It said the payments were made to members of the Baghdad Press Club, an organization set up by US army officers more than a year ago.</p>
<p>

An Iraqi female journalist, who preferred to remain anonymous, told AFP about working for the Baghdad Press Club, which is headquartered is at the airport, for three months before quitting.</p>

<p>

"We were called to go out with them on various educational, reconstruction, health or aid projects and asked to write positive articles about them in exchange for 50 dollars," she recalled.</p>
<p>

"After three months, I left. The whole thing was ridiculous and against the ethics of journalists," she said, recalling a US-sponsored trip to Sadr City where people called her a traitor and threw rocks at her.</p>
<p>

Another Iraqi journalist in Baghdad who also preferred not to be named was more philosophical about the entire affair.</p>
<p>

"It's true that it's fraud, but a professional journalist shouldn't fall into such a trap," he said.</p>
<p>

Major General Rick Lynch, the US military spokesman in Iraq, cast the matter as an effort to counter lies spread by Al-Qaeda.</p>
<p>

"We do empower our operational commanders with the ability to inform the Iraqi public, but everything we do is based on fact not based on fiction," he said.</p>
<p>

Military officials would not comment on whether newspapers and journalists were paid to plant the articles.</p>
<p>

Lieutenant Colonel Barry Johnson, head of the US military's press department in Baghdad, cited operational secrecy in withholding information about the program.</p>
<p>

Johnson explained that the Iraqi press has traveled a long hard road from total control under ousted president Saddam Hussein to the current period characterized by a lethal insurgency.
<p>


"There's outright intimidation and many murders and other ways of manipulating the press, so it was felt operationally that it was necessary to make sure the facts were out," he said.
<p>


The White House announced on Wednesday that it was "very concerned" about the report.</p>
