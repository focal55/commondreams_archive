<p> COLUMBIA, MO. -- Most people breeze right by the large, gold-trimmed watercolor hanging in the small lobby of Lowry Hall. They rarely glance at, much less give a thought to, the portrait of Kenneth Lay, AB `64, MA `65, one of the more prominent graduates of the University of Missouri.

<P>Every once in a while someone notes the irony that the painting of Lay, the former chairman of Enron Corp. who faces federal charges that he lied about Enron's financial condition before the energy giant's stunning collapse in 2001, resides in the university's Honors College.

<P>"One student was very upset," said Karen Aitkens, a secretary whose office is across the hall from the painting. "He poked his head in here and said `Is that who I think it is?' He was angry.

<P>"And then somebody walked by and gave the picture the finger," Aitkens added.

<P>These are the risks that universities run when wealthy alums return with checkbooks in hand, willing to exchange a donation for a building in their name or, in Lay's case, an endowed chair in the department of economics.

<P>The painting of Lay, smiling and relaxed in a double-breasted blue sport coat, occupies that spot in the Lowry Hall lobby because his charitable foundation donated $1.1 million to the university in 1999, two years before he lost his perch in the corporate catbird seat. That endowed chair has yet to be filled and the betting is it will remain vacant at least until after Lay's trial, which is scheduled to start in January.

<P>Some faculty members have suggested the money be returned to Lay. The university, financially challenged like many publicly funded schools, is riding out the storm. For now.

<P>"We're looking for people, and beyond that I don't think it does the economics department any good to talk about this," said Professor Michael Podgursky, the department chairman, clearly weary of the controversy involving a deep-pocketed alum who became a national symbol of corporate malfeasance.

<P>If there is any comfort for the university, it is knowing that the Columbia campus is not the only institution of higher learning that squirms in an ethical quandary.

<P>Seton Hall University, in South Orange, N.J., has Kozlowski Hall, which houses the schools of business, education and human services, psychology and the center for public service. The building is named after alumnus and former Tyco International Ltd. chairman Dennis Kozlowski, who is on trial in New York on charges of looting the company for hundreds of millions of dollars.

<P>Seton Hall also has a recreation center named after alum Robert Brennan, formerly of First Jersey Securities. Brennan was convicted of bankruptcy fraud.

<P>St. Bonaventure University, in St. Bonaventure, N.Y., is home of the Rigas Family Theater, named for John Rigas, the former chairman of the cable company Adelphia Communications. Rigas and his son Timothy were found guilty in July of conspiracy, securities fraud, bank fraud and stealing more than $100 million from the now-bankrupt cable company.

<P>Roads, parks, a library and a campus of a community college in Birmingham, Ala., are named for Richard Scrushy, the former CEO of HealthSouth who is standing trial for alleged accounting fraud. There was even a statue of Scrushy at the company's headquarters. Vandals spray-painted it with the word "thief."

<P>In Providence, R.I., Brown University's A. Alfred Taubman Center for the Study of Public Policy and American Institutions is named for Taubman, the former chairman of the auction house Sotheby's. Taubman served a year in federal prison after his conviction for price-fixing.

<P>Back in Columbia, the University of Missouri recently endured more public embarrassment over its new $75 million basketball arena, which last fall had been named for a 22-year-old heiress of Wal-Mart after the young woman's parents effectively bought the naming rights for $25 million. She didn't attend the university and was later accused of cheating her way through another college. Missouri quickly changed the name of Paige Sports Arena to Mizzou Arena.

<P>Last week's criminal fraud conviction of former WorldCom chief executive Bernard Ebbers and the release of a new book on the collapse of Enron, "Conspiracy of Fools," have intensified the focus on corporate wrongdoing and the claims by Lay, Ebbers and others that they had no idea of the illegalities occurring at their respective companies.

<P>"I remember seeing it (Lay's portrait) when I took the campus tour and went to the Honors College, and I thought then that it was kind of embarrassing," Cynthia Juedemann, a freshman from New Haven, Mo., said last week. "I still think it's embarrassing."

<P>Jacob Harper, a senior from Springfield, Mo., majoring in English, said he thinks "it's kind of funny that no one really makes a big deal out of it, but I think they should."

<P>Just across the sidewalk from Lowry Hall is Middlebush Hall, home of the Harry S Truman School of Public Affairs. Black-and-white photos hang in the lobby - Truman with Gen. George Patton, Truman with comedian Jack Benny. Not pictured, but not lost on those who know the reputation of Missouri's favorite son, is a picture of the walnut-base plaque that sat on Truman's desk through most of his presidency: "The Buck Stops Here," it reads.

<P>The plaque was made for Truman in 1945, in the federal reformatory in El Reno, Okla.
