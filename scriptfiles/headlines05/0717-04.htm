<p>WASHINGTON --
In the months before the Iraqi elections in January, President Bush 
approved a plan to provide covert support to certain Iraqi candidates and 
political parties but rescinded the proposal because of congressional 
opposition, current and former government officials said Saturday.

        <!--/endimage/--> In a statement issued in response to questions about a report in the next 
issue of the <a href="http://www.newyorker.com" target="_new">New Yorker magazine</a>, Frederick Jones, the spokesman for the 
National Security Council, said that "in the final analysis, the president 
determined and the United States government adopted a policy that we would not 
try  --  and did not try  --  to influence the outcome of the Iraqi election 
by covertly helping individual candidates for office."
<P>The New Yorker article, by Seymour M. Hersh, reports that the 
administration proceeded with the covert plan over the congressional 
objections. 
<P>Several senior Bush administration officials disputed that, although they 
recalled renewed discussions within the administration last fall about how the 
United States might counter what was seen as extensive Iranian support to pro-
Iranian Shiite parties.
<P>Any clandestine U.S. effort to influence the Iraqi elections, or to 
provide particular support to candidates or parties seen as amenable to 
working with the United States, would have run counter to Bush's assertions 
that the vote would be free and unfettered.
<P>The article cites unidentified former military and intelligence officials 
who said the administration had gone ahead with covert election activities in 
Iraq that "were conducted by retired CIA officers and other nongovernment 
personnel, and used funds that were not necessarily appropriated by Congress." 
But it does not provide details and says "the methods and the scope of the 
covert effort have been hard to discern."
<P>Rep. Jane Harman, D-Rancho Palos Verdes (Los Angeles County), the senior 
Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, issued a statement saying that 
she could not discuss classified information, adding, "Congress was consulted 
about the administration's posture in the Iraqi election. I was personally 
consulted. But if the administration did what is alleged, that would be a 
violation of the covert action requirements, and that would be deeply 
troubling."
<P>Despite the denials by some Bush administration officials Saturday, 
others who took part in or were briefed on the discussion said they could not 
rule out the possibility that the United States and its allies might have 
provided secret aid to augment the broad overt support provided to Iraqi 
candidates and parties by the State Department, through organizations such as 
the International Democratic Institute.

<P>They said they were basing their comments primarily on the intensity of 
discussions within the administration about the potential harm of a victory by 
Iraqi parties hostile to the United States.
<P>Officials and former officials familiar with the debate inside the White 
House last year said that after considerable debate, Bush's national security 
advisers recommended that he sign a secret, formal authorization for covert 
action to influence the election, called a finding. 
<P>They said that Bush either had already signed it or was about to when 
objections were raised in Congress. Ultimately, he rescinded the decision, the 
officials said.
<P>Among those who discussed the matter in interviews Saturday were a dozen 
current and former government officials from Congress, the State Department, 
intelligence agencies and the Bush administration. None would speak for the 
record, citing the extreme sensitivity of discussing any covert action, which 
by design is never to be acknowledged by the U.S. government.
<P>Time magazine first reported in October 2004 that the administration had 
encountered congressional opposition over a plan to provide covert support to 
Iraqi candidates. The New Yorker account detailed more elements of that debate.
<P>Bush's precise reasons for rescinding the plan are not clear. Among those 
whom Time and the New Yorker cited as raising objections was House Minority 
Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-San Francisco.
<P>A spokeswoman for Pelosi, Jennifer Crider, said Saturday that Pelosi 
could neither confirm nor deny that she objected. "Leader Pelosi has never 
publicly spoken about any classified information and would never threaten to 
take any classified information public," Crider said. "That is against the law.
