<p>UNITED NATIONS  - Some 90 sites in Iraq that the  United Nations had monitored for unconventional arms materials  have been razed or looted since the U.S. intervention,  according to a new U.N. inspection report.
<p> 
			
The U.N. Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission  (UNMOVIC), created to track Iraq's weapons of mass destruction,  based its conclusion in a Friday report on satellite imagery  from sites with material that had weapons potential.<p> 
			
			Repairs and new construction have begun at 10 of the 90  sites, said the report to the U.N. Security Council from  Demetrius Perricos, the chief weapons inspector.<p> 
			
			UNMOVIC, using photographs and serial numbers, previously  reported that the looting of unguarded sites resulted in  missile engines turning up among scrap in the Dutch port  Rotterdam as well as in Jordan.<p> 
			
			But the new report gave more comprehensive figures on how  many of the unguarded sites were looted or destroyed in bombing  during the U.S. invasion of Iraq two years ago.<p> 
			
			Before they left Iraq, U.N. inspectors had examined 411  sites, the report said. After the war, they examined 353 sites  and determined that 70 of them were "subjected to varying  degrees of bomb damage."<p> 
			
			"The continuing examination of the imagery has revealed  that approximately 90 of the total 353 sites analyzed  containing material of relevance have been stripped and/or  razed," Perricos said in the report.<p> 
			
			U.N. inspectors were in Iraq between 1991 and 1998  searching for and destroying nuclear, biological and chemical  arms and materials as well as long-range missiles after first  U.S.-led Gulf war that drove Baghdad's troops from Kuwait.<p> 
			
			Saddam Hussein's government let the U.N. inspectors back in  late 2002 after a U.S. war threat. But the United States  refused to allow them to return after the March 2003 invasion.<p> 
			
			The Security Council will discuss the report on Tuesday  amid continuing questions over the future of the agency.<p> 
			
			Council members since the end of the war have pressed    American and British officials to utilize UNMOVIC's vast  research and allow the inspectors to complete monitoring work.<p> 
			
			The United States said it did not want to take up the issue  until its own searches ended, first led by David Kaye, a former  International Atomic Energy Agency official, and then Charles  Duelfer, also a former U.N. inspector. But there are  indications Washington now wants to discuss closing down  UNMOVIC.<p> 
			
			Friday's report also said the U.N. inspectors agreed with  Duelfer, whose CIA-organized Iraq Survey group had expressed  concern about biological materials that were unaccounted for  since 1991.<p> 
			
			Duelfer's report in October said his inspection group found  no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, President Bush's main  reason for the invasion.<p> 
			
			The new U.N. report noted that the Iraqis had handed over  90 unopened vials of biological agents to weapons inspectors.  But it declared that 13 vials of "seed stock" or strains of  microorganisms had been used, some in biological arms programs.<p> 
			
			"The issue remains as part of the residue of uncertainty with respect to the continued existence in Iraq of seed stocks that could possibly be used in the future for the production of biological weapons agents," Perricos said in the report.<p>

"Given its unresolvable nature, the issue could best be dealt with through monitoring to detect inter alia any possible future activity associated with biological weapon agent production or significant laboratory research work," he said.
