<p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Venezuelan President Hugo Ch&aacute;vez escalated his war of words with America yesterday, when he accused the US drug enforcement administration (DEA) of spying, and said Venezuela was suspending cooperation with the agency. </font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mr Ch&aacute;vez, who regularly accuses the US of plotting against him, said "the DEA is not absolutely necessary for the fight against drug trafficking." </font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The DEA was using the fight against drug trafficking as a mask to support drug trafficking and to carry out intelligence in Venezuela against the government, Mr Ch&aacute;vez told reporters. </font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Under those circumstances we decided to make a clean break with those accords, and we are reviewing them," Mr Ch&aacute;vez said, referring to the cooperative agreements under which the DEA has operated in Venezuela. </font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Prosecutors last month opened an investigation into the DEA's activities in Venezuela. "We have detected intelligence infiltration that threatened national security and defense," Mr Ch&aacute;vez said. </font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While he recognized that Venezuela is a transit point for Colombian cocaine, Mr Ch&aacute;vez said Venezuela's armed forces have made important advances against trafficking. </font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"We will continue working with international organizations against drug trafficking," he said. </font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mr Ch&aacute;vez said specifics of the DEA decision will be announced soon. Mr Ch&aacute;vez's comments were the most specific to date on the accusations against the US agency. </font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The US ambassador, William Brownfield, said last week in a radio interview that the US hoped to maintain cooperative anti-drug efforts in Venezuela, and that without them "there is only one group that wins, and that group is the drug traffickers". </font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mr Ch&aacute;vez sharply criticized US policy on drugs, saying that while the US is the world's top consumer of drugs, its government does little to try to lessen consumption. </font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He also criticized the US Central Intelligence Agency and Federal Bureau of Investigation of not doing enough to catch drug kingpins in the US. </font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The accusations were the latest in a series of rhetorical clashes between Mr Ch&aacute;vez and American officials. </font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The US secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, has called Venezuela a "negative force" in Latin America and accuses Mr Ch&aacute;vez of turning it into a totalitarian society. </font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Last month saw the launch of Telesur, a pan-Latin American television channel based in Caracas. The channel's promoters describe it as an antidote to US media domination, but American politicians say it is a vehicle for anti-US propaganda.  </font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Even before the channel was launched, the House of Representatives voted to enable the US to broadcast its own signals into Venezuela in retaliation. In response, Mr Ch&aacute;vez threatened to launch "electronic warfare" with the US. </font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Relations between Venezuela and the US have been tense since Mr Ch&aacute;vez took office in 1999. Mr Ch&aacute;vez accuses the CIA of involvement in the military coup that briefly deposed him in 2002, and in February said that President Bush was plotting to assassinate him. </font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">US officials dismissed the accusations as ridiculous, but the White House gave implicit support to the coup attempt and has done little to hide its displeasure with Mr Ch&aacute;vez. </font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Despite frequent harsh words between governments, Venezuela remains a major supplier of oil to the US. </font>
