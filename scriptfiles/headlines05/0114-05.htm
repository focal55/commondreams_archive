<p>The growing debate over a possible withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq got an added boost Thursday with the dissemination of comments by former Secretary of State James Baker suggesting that the Bush administration should consider a phased withdrawal of some of the 150,000 troops now there.

<P>"Any appearance of a permanent occupation will both undermine domestic support here in the United States and play directly into the hands of those in the Middle East who -- however wrongly -- suspect us of imperial design," Baker said Tuesday in a speech at Rice University in Houston. News reports of his comments were disseminated on national news wires on Thursday.

<P>Baker, a Republican Party stalwart, was an architect of the 1991 Persian Gulf War in the administration of President Bush's father. Bush enlisted him to help win international debt relief for the newly conquered Iraq.

<P>Baker couched his remarks by saying that any such withdrawal should happen only if the security situation improves and once Iraqi forces are ready.

<P>But his comments followed stronger doubts about the viability of the U.S. presence in Iraq expressed by Brent Scowcroft, national security adviser for former President George H.W. Bush, and by Rep. Howard Coble, R-N.C., who supported the decision to invade Iraq. On the other side of the aisle, Rep. Lynn Woolsey, D-Petaluma, led 15 other House Democrats in an appeal Wednesday for immediate steps toward a U.S. withdrawal.

<P>The White House has maintained that U.S. troops cannot leave until Iraqi forces are up to the challenge of maintaining the country's security.

<P>Administration defenders and some analysts insist that a precipitate withdrawal would be a disaster for Iraq, certainly a recipe for civil war. Some argue that the United States should be working toward a permanent presence there to protect America's regional interests and push reform in neighboring countries.

<P>"The measure of success for us is not how quickly we can get out, but how long we can stay," said Thomas Donnelly, a military affairs scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. "We have a huge investment in making Iraq work."

<P>Critics of the war say its cost in U.S. lives, dollars and credibility outweigh any possible benefit of staying the course. They argue that the troops' presence is actually making the violence in Iraq worse.

<P>"Some people are predicting all hell is going to break loose. I say all hell has already broken loose," said Ivan Eland, senior fellow and director of the Center on Peace & Liberty at the Independent Institute in Oakland.

<P>Eland called for a rapid but controlled withdrawal, which he said would remove the irritant of occupation and give Iraqis self-determination, even if that meant allowing the country to break into three chunks along ethnic and religious lines -- Kurds in the north, Shiites in the south and Sunnis in the center and west.

<P>"It's a fallacy that we have to have a united Iraq to have a stable Iraq, " he said. The tripartite solution "may not in the end work - there may be a civil war anyway. The problem is I think it's the only solution at this point."

<P>A similar argument was raised last year in a Cato Institute report calling for a withdrawal by the end of this month, said Charles Peña, the institute's director of defense policy studies.

<P>"The natural process of removing the odious dictator who held Iraq together by fear and force is that suddenly all the parties want to vie for power. Everybody's worried about the possibility of a civil war in Iraq -- that's what we've got now," he said. "If we stay or go, Iraqis are going to kill other Iraqis."

<P>Exiting Iraq would free up hundreds of billions of U.S. dollars and hundreds of thousands of troops, allowing the administration to refocus on the global fight against terrorism, he said.

<P>Other analysts oppose a rushed withdrawal for practical reasons, saying its adherents are underestimating the consequences of an Iraqi civil war and the role U.S. forces are playing in preventing it.

<P>"I don't think there's any doubt in anybody's mind that U.S. troops are the only option we have for trying to deal with the security situation at this time. The Iraqi troops are certainly not up for it," said Sheba Crocker, co- director of the Post-Conflict Reconstruction Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

<P>Crocker and other analysts said it is unrealistic to assume that Iraq can split into parts without a significant surge in violence. Militias and political groups within the Kurdish, Shiite and Sunni sections are not homogenous, they noted, and, perhaps more importantly, oil resources are not evenly distributed around the country.

<P>Under those circumstances, said Peter Khalil, former director of national security policy for the U.S. occupation in Iraq and now a visiting fellow at the Saban Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution, Iraq's central government would probably collapse quickly without U.S. support, launching a civil war with five or six sides.

<P>"If you had a complete withdrawal ... you would have 100-fold more violence than you have now. I'm talking about complete chaos," he said.

<P>Iraq's neighbors are unlikely to ignore turmoil in that region, analysts said, especially when it harms those with whom they share ties of religion or ethnicity.

<P>"Every country in the region ... would feel compelled to make sure their interests were protected," said Michael Donovan, an analyst at the Center for Defense Information. "The Saudis are now fighting the Iranians in Iraq, and those proxy wars may not stay proxy very long."

<P>That, in turn, affects the world's largest pot of oil, Donovan and other analysts cautioned -- and while it's true that Europe and Japan are more dependent on Middle East oil than is America, the consequences could ripple through the global economy right to America's shores.

<P>Another consideration is how a unilateral American withdrawal followed by chaos in Iraq would be perceived on the world stage, said James Noyes, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and a former assistant secretary of defense.

<P>"I think you have to think about the impact in the Muslim extremist world, " he said. "They defeated the Soviet superpower (in Afghanistan) ... and now they've defeated the U.S., the big superpower, in Iraq."

<P>But even those experts who argue against precipitous departure say a graduated pullout -- or at least the promise of one -- could be valuable, perhaps even helping to create the stability that would permit such a withdrawal without launching a civil war. Under this reasoning, a public announcement of some kind of gradual withdrawal agreement could give the new government much-needed legitimacy in the eyes of everyday Iraqis.

<P>"This is one of the wedding gifts we would give to the new prime minister, whoever is selected in the January election," said Mark Juergensmeyer, director of global and international studies and professor of sociology and religious studies at UC Santa Barbara.

<P>"There needs to be some symbolic show of America's will to get out of there and give authority to the new Iraqi government. If we don't, that government is doomed," he said.

<P>Several analysts cautioned that the withdrawal should be tied to indicators such as social progress, effectiveness of Iraqi forces and economic improvements rather than to a specific date.

<P>How long might it take before a genuine withdrawal could begin?

<P>"Right now, you can't answer that question," Donovan said. <p align="center">Copyright &copy; 2005 San Francisco Chronicle</p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable --></font></td></tr>
