                              NEW DELHI - When J.B. Penn, United States under secretary 
for agriculture, came visiting last month he was told that for India, 
like any other mainly farming country, importing food was as good as 
importing unemployment. <br>

        <!--/endimage/--> ‘'We can do so (open up markets as requested by Penn), provided the U.S. 
is willing to provide a visa to every farmer displaced as a consequence 
of the import of cheaper and highly subsidised food,'' Penn was told by 
India's articulate  trade minister, Kamal Nath.  
<br><br>
It was apparent that U.S. Congress would reject any deal that does not 
open markets in developing countries--even if they have agrarian 
economies-- for American farmers.    
<br><br>
A week before the World Trade Organisation (WTO) ministerial at Hong 
Kong began, Saxby Chabliss, chairman of the U.S. senate's agriculture 
committee was quoted: ‘'To say we're just going to open up our markets 
without having our farmers here have access to new markets...if that's all 
that comes out of (the WTO meeting) Hong Kong, then we've accomplished 
nothing''. 
<br>
<br>
Compare this to what Nath told Indian parliament just before he left for 
Hong Kong:  ‘'I cannot sacrifice the future of India's 600 million 
farmers at any cost. What the U.S. proposed, last month, is not real 
cuts in agriculture subsidies. The real cuts would be when there is a 
decline in the support provided by the U.S. treasury.'' 
<br>
<br>
The deadlock over agricultural subsidies will determine the future of 
the ‘Doha Development round'. International trade in agriculture is 
closely linked to the removal of agricultural subsidies-- presently 
computed at 350 billion US dollars or one billion dollars a day -- that 
the 30 rich countries forming the OECD (Organisation for Economic 
Cooperation and Development) provide. 
<br><br>

Recent estimates show that developing countries lose more than 24 
billion dollars a year because of the protection that rich countries 
provide their farmers.  
 
Now that promises associated with the ‘development round' have fallen 
flat, rich countries are strengthening defenses around domestic 
agriculture and making it difficult for the developing world to 
penetrate their markets. 
<br>
<br>
Moreover, the industrialised countries continue to exert all kinds of 
pressure to further open up developing country markets without waiting 
for the developed countries to simultaneously bring down the 
agricultural subsidies. 
<br><br>
Threats are being resorted to now that it has become impossible to shift 
the focus of ongoing negotiations from agriculture subsidies to market 
access.   - &quot;Developing countries would lose if the Doha Development Round 
fails,"  WTO chief Pascal Lamy warned African trade ministers, last 
month, at Arusha. &quot;The US can increase its trade-distorting domestic 
support (TDS) by 5 billion dollars, the EU by 25 billion and Japan by 5 
billion." 
<br>
<br>
What Lamy did not say was that  developing country agriculture was 
doomed anyway if the huge subsidies the OECD pays to its agribusiness 
corporations and rich farmers are not entirely scrapped.  
<br><br>
Bribery and bait are the two other planks of the ‘negotiating' strategy 
that are being applied. Least developing countries (LDCs) are being 
provided with an ‘aid for trade' package, expected to be in the range of 
four billion dollars, in the name of assistance to cope with adjustment 
costs, and provide infrastructure.
<br><br>
Besides, the promise of a ‘development package' contains duty and quota-
free access for LDC products, preference erosion, some special and 
differential treatment proposals and longer transition periods on trade-
related intellectual property rights (TRIPS) and investment measures. 
<br><br>
While the talks falter, highly subsidised imports from the developed 
countries have already done irreparable damage to the agricultural 
production potential of the developing countries. Between 1995 and 2004, 
Europe alone has been able to increase its agricultural exports by 26 
per cent mostly through massive domestic and export subsidies.  Each 
percentage increase in exports brings in a financial gain of three 
billion dollars. 
<br><br>
On the other hand, a vast majority of the developing countries, whether 
in Latin America, Africa or Asia have, in the first 10 years of WTO,  
turned into food importers. Millions of farmers have lost their 
livelihoods as a result of cheaper imports.
<br><br>
If the WTO has its way, and the developing countries fail to understand 
the  politics that drives the agriculture trade agenda, the world will 
soon have two kinds of agriculture systems -- the rich countries 
producing staple foods for the world's 6 billion plus people, and 
developing countries growing  cash crops like tomatoes, cut flowers, 
peas, sunflowers, strawberries and vegetables. 

<br>
<br>
This is what happened in many of the Latin American countries that were 
forced to dismantle food security and diversify to cash crops as part of 
the conditionality that came along with structural adjustment loans. The 
same strategy is now being legitimized for the rest of the world under 
the legal framework of the WTO. 
<br>
<br>
As the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have repeatedly 
emphasized, the dollars that developing countries earn from exporting 
these crops will eventually be used to buy food grains from the 
developed nations -- in reality, passing the reins of food security back 
into the hands of rich countries.
<br>
<br>
For India, a major farming country,  that would mean going back to the 
days of a  ‘ship-to-mouth' existence before it struggled to achieve food 
self-sufficiency on the backs of  hundreds of millions of small farmers. 
<br>
<br>
It is the livelihoods of these farmers, as well as the food security of 
the people they fed for decades, that is at stake at Hong Kong.
