<p>CARACAS, Venezuela  - Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez lashed out at President George W. Bush, calling him Mr. Danger and saying wars from Iraq to Colombia show the U.S. government is a menace to the world.

Chavez paused during a televised speech Friday to read aloud Bush's comments to reporters at the White House a day earlier, when he said Venezuela's plans to buy 100,000 assault rifles from Russia raise concerns the guns could fall into the hands of Colombian rebels.
<p>&quot;The rifles are defensive weapons,&quot; Chavez said, adding Kalashnikovs are nothing to the array of weapons wielded by U.S. forces, such as &quot;transatlantic missiles.&quot;
<p>&quot;If I were buying one of those devices, with which we press a button to travel, arrive at the White House, then they could worry,&quot; he said.
<p>&quot;They have thousands of those devices.&quot;
<p>Chavez, a close ally of Cuban President Fidel Castro, has accused the United States of plotting behind the scenes to overthrow him. Venezuela is a major supplier of U.S. oil but Chavez has said he would halt shipments if the Americans try to attack Venezuela.
<p>&quot;We do have reasons to be worried, Mr. Danger, about the U.S. arms buildup, about U.S. threats, about the presence of U.S. soldiers in Colombia,&quot; Chavez said.
<p>He accused the U.S. government of having &quot;an interest in having war in Colombia&quot; and providing large amounts of weapons.
<p>&quot;That's a reality, as it was in Central America, as it was in the Middle East. Who armed Saddam Hussein? Who gave Saddam Hussein weapons, ammunition, military technology? The U.S. government,&quot; said Chavez, a fierce critic of the U.S. war in Iraq.
<p>&quot;Who armed Osama bin Laden, and gave al-Qaida the great power it has? The United States,&quot; he said, apparently referring to U.S. support for Afghan forces in their war against Soviet troops in the 1980s.
<p>Chavez said he wouldn't be surprised if the United States were supplying guns to Colombian guerrillas, their paramilitary enemies and the Colombian army at the same time &quot;to justify their Plan Patriot and at the same time establish military bases in Colombia.&quot;
<p>&quot;It's the perfect excuse for them to have a military presence in Colombia, and from there to threaten Venezuela and threaten any other country that begins changes they don't like,&quot; Chavez said.
<p>&quot;The Lords of War, you can call them.&quot;
<p>Chavez said he hopes the United States will &quot;leave me in peace so that I can work.&quot;</P>
