<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p>Vic Germany thought registering a federal trademark for San 
Francisco's iconic Dykes on Bikes organization would be no problem. After all, 
the nonprofit lesbian motorcycle group has become internationally known for 
riding in the lead position at San Francisco's pride parade every year for 
nearly three decades.
<P>Instead, the group has spent a humiliating two years slogging through the 
swampland of trademark law, with no end in sight, said Germany, president of 
the San Francisco Women's Motorcycle Contingent, a.k.a. Dykes on Bikes.
<P>Twice, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has rejected the Dykes' 
application, on the grounds that "dyke" is vulgar, offensive and "scandalous." 
Patent office attorneys even point to Webster's dictionary, which says dyke is 
"often used disparagingly."
<P>"The examining attorney found it to be offensive to a significant portion 
of the lesbian community," said Jessie Roberts, a trademark administrator with 
the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. "And we're also looking out for the 
sensitivities of the general public more than that of a specific applicant."
<P>The applicants, in this case, prefer to call themselves dykes.
<P>"We self-identify as dykes on bikes," said Germany, a 48-year-old San 
Francisco environmental consultant. "To us, (the government's objection) is 
completely absurd."
<P>The push to codify "Dykes on Bikes" started two years ago when members of 
the San Francisco organization heard that a Wisconsin woman wanted to start a 
for-profit venture that would include a clothing line  --  leathers and such  -
-  using "Dykes on Bikes" as its label. 
<P>"That's not what we're about," said Soni Wolf, 56, longtime secretary for 
the Dykes on Bikes and a pride parade participant since the late 1970s. "That 
word has been used for years to tear us down. And we said, 'OK, we're going to 
take it back.' " 
<P>The women call themselves "dykes" for the same reason many gays have laid 
claim to "queer"  --  to defang a word that has long been a slur. 
<P>"I cannot imagine a more ironic twist of thinking than to judge this 
reclaimed badge of honor as insulting to the very community who has created 
its power," Joan Nestle, co-founder of the Lesbian Herstory  Archives, wrote 
in a declaration supporting the Dykes on Bikes' trademark request. "Lesbians 
do not need to be protected from their own cultural creations, their own 
transformations of stigmas."
<P>Cartoonist Alison Bechdel told the patent office that her 22-year-old 
strip, Dykes to Watch Out For  --  which has sold 300,000 copies in 
collections worldwide  --  "has uprooted the word 'dyke' from its negative 
connotations and planted it in a new context where it has flourished as a 
signifier for lesbians who are confident and open about their identity."

<P>The Dykes argue that they are succeeding in weaving the term into the 
cultural fabric. Roaring up Market Street on their motorcycles before 
thousands of onlookers at pride parades, San Francisco's Dykes on Bikes have 
paved the way for a dozen-plus similar groups elsewhere. There are Dykes 
Planning Tykes parents groups, a "Dyke TV" cable access show, and a site for 
"the Web-savvy dyke" called Technodyke.com.  
<P>The federal paper-shuffling might seem superfluous to any Bay Area 
resident who has heard the street chant, "We're here. We're queer. Get used to 
it." But "queer," a longtime slur for male homosexuals, is different  --  at 
least in the eyes of the federal trademarkers.
<P>In November, the patent office registered a trademark on behalf of the 
Bravo Network for the hit television show "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy."
<P>"So what's the difference between 'queer' and 'dyke'?" said Brooke Oliver,
the Mission District attorney who is handling the Dykes' case.
<P>Germany pointed out that the case for "Queer Eye" was supported by a deep-
pocketed television network. "And we're a nonprofit group full of working-
class women," she said. 
<P>The patent office's Roberts said she was unfamiliar with the "Queer" case 
but that apparently "queer" was deemed not to have been as vulgar as "dyke."
<P>Some of the women involved in the "dyke" case took the patent office 
rejection personally. For them, it reignited painful memories  --  some not 
too distant  --  of shouted insults labeling them "bull dykes."
<P>Germany, 48, said she heard that slur a lot as she was growing up in 
Marin County. She still hears it from hecklers who see the rainbow sticker on 
the back of her black motorcycle helmet.
<P>Her eyes filled with tears as described how her mother now rides with her 
at the front of the gay and lesbian pride parade.
<P>"She's one proud mama," Germany said. "She's proud of who I am. That's 
why, when I got that letter from the federal government denying this, it felt 
like a hate letter." 
<P>This wasn't attorney Oliver's first experience before the patent office. 
She helped "San Francisco Pride" register as a federal trademark in 2002 and 
also assisted the United Farm Workers in beating back the Mexican airline 
Aeromexico's attempt to trademark Cesar Chavez's rallying cry "Si se puede," 
roughly translated as, "Yes, we can." The UFW's trademark for "Si Se Puede" 
was registered in 1998.
<P>"It's the same sort of thing," Oliver said. "The farmworkers associate 
that phrase with their blood and sweat."
<P>Oliver asked the federal office to trademark "Dykes on Bikes" for the 
group to use for "educational and entertainment purposes" such as parades and 
festivals. Although the Dykes thought they had an airtight case, Oliver was 
wary, having detected a whiff of "prudishness" in the patent office. 
<P>Her earlier attempt to register products by Vixen Creations, a Bay Area 
company that makes dildos, under the toy category was rejected. They were 
eventually registered as medical prosthetic devices. 
<P>Still, Oliver was a bit surprised when the patent office first rejected 
the Dykes' application in October 2004. And it has been personal at times for 
her. In trying to make her point over the phone to a federal patent attorney, 
Oliver said, "But I'm a dyke."
<P>Before reapplying, Oliver recruited the National Center for Lesbian 
Rights in San Francisco, which asked scholars, linguists and activists to 
describe how the word "dyke" had evolved over the past 40 years. Filled with 
more than two dozen declarations of Harvard-trained scholars, nationally 
recognized psychologists and linguists, the submission is a lesbian history 
lesson. 
<P>"What might have been true 10 or 15 years ago with respect to the 
implications of the word 'dyke' as applied to lesbians has continued to evolve,
" said Ronald Butters, a Duke University English professor who served as the 
New Oxford American Dictionary's expert adviser on homosexual terms. 

<P>Shara Sand, a New York clinical psychologist and assistant professor at 
Yeshiva University, wrote, "My clients often speak of the 'dyke drama' in 
their lives, refer to themselves as 'strong dykes,' working for the 'dyke 
cause,' and loving being a 'diesel dyke.' " 
<P>Patent office administrator Roberts is sympathetic, yet holds to the 
responsibilities of her agency.
<P>"Yes, there is sometimes a difference between what is going on in the 
street currently," she said. "But what we have to do is apply federal law."
<P>The patent office rejected the Dykes' reapplication in May. Examiners 
found nothing new that was "significant or compelling" enough to make them 
change their decision.
<P>The Dykes are appealing the decision to a trial panel in the office. For 
Wolf, it will be one more step in the effort to reclaim "dyke," almost 30 
years after her first ride down Market Street.
<P>Politics and culture aside, there's a reason "Dykes on Bikes" resonates 
so much with people, Wolf said.
<P>"It rhymes," she deadpanned. "Just kind of rolls off the tongue."</p><p align="CENTER">&copy; 2005 San Francisco Chronicle<p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable --></font></td></tr>
