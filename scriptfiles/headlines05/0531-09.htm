<p>A former FBI official claims he was “Deep Throat,” the long-anonymous source who leaked secrets about President Nixon’s Watergate cover-up to The Washington Post, Vanity Fair reported Tuesday.
<p>W. Mark Felt, 91, who was second-in-command at the FBI in the early 1970s, kept the secret even from his family until 2002, when he confided to a friend that he had been Post reporter Bob Woodward’s source, the magazine said.
<p>“I’m the guy they used to call Deep Throat,” he told lawyer John D. O’Connor, the author of the Vanity Fair article, the magazine said in a news release.
<p>Felt, who said he was "only doing his duty" and did not seek to bring down Nixon over the cover-up of a break-in at Democratic Party offices in the Watergate complex in Washington, D.C., was initially adamant about remaining silent on the subject.
<p>“I don’t think (being Deep Throat) was anything to be proud of,” Felt indicated to his son, Mark Jr., at one point, according to the article. “You (should) not leak information to anyone.”
<p>Felt is a retiree living in Santa Rosa, Calif., with his daughter, Joan, the magazine said. He could not immediately be reached for comment by The Associated Press. His family members disagreed with their father, feeling that he should receive accolades for his role in Watergate before his death.

<p>"The Felt family cooperated fully, providing old photographs for the story and agreeing to sit for portraits," Vanity Fair stated in a press release.
<p>O’Connor is a lawyer at the San Francisco firm Howard, Rice, Nemerovski, Canady, Falk &amp; Rabkin. A receptionist there said O’Connor was out of the office but confirmed he was the author of the Vanity Fair article.
<p>The existence of Deep Throat, nicknamed for a popular porn movie of the early 1970s, was revealed in Woodward and Carl Bernstein’s best-selling book “All the President’s Men.” In the hit movie based on the book, Deep Throat was played by Hal Holbrook.
<p><b>No comment from Post, reporter</b>
<p>In 2003, Woodward and Bernstein reached an agreement to keep their Watergate papers at the University of Texas at Austin.
<p>At the time, the pair said documents naming “Deep Throat” would be kept secure at an undisclosed location in Washington until the source’s death.
<p>Bernstein issued a statement neither denying nor confirming Felt's claim. Bernstein stated he and Woodward would be keeping their pledge to reveal the source only once that person dies.
<p>The Washington Post had no immediate comment on the report.
<p><b>Well-kept secret</b>
<p>Who was the real Deep Throat was long a source of speculation and rumor.
<p>Among those named over the years as Deep Throat were Assistant Attorney General Henry Peterson, deputy White House counsel Fred Fielding, and even ABC newswoman Diane Sawyer, who then worked in the White House press office. Ron Zeigler, Nixon’s press secretary, White House aide Steven Bull, speechwriters Ray Price and Pat Buchanan, and John Dean, the White House counsel who warned Nixon of “a cancer growing on the presidency,” also were considered candidates.
<p>And some theorized Deep Throat wasn’t a single source at all but a composite figure.
<p>The last time there was a flurry of focus on Felt was in 1999, when a high school senior in New York claimed that Bernstein's son let the secret slip at a summer camp.
<p>At the time, Felt denied he was the man.
<p>“I would have done better,” Felt told The Hartford Courant. “I would have been more effective. Deep Throat didn’t exactly bring the White House crashing down, did he?”
<p>Chris Matthews, Host of MSNBC's Hardball who wrote a book about Watergate, said he wasn't surprised, adding that Felt "has always been the leading suspect."
<p><b>Family reasons</b>
<p>In the article, O'Connor reports that Felt's children, Joan and Mark Jr., urged him to go public after he revealed his secret to them in 2002. 
<p>Felt argued with them, O'Connor writes, saying he didn't want the story out there. 
<p>But Joan is quoted as saying that "Bob Woodward's gonna get all the glory for this, but we could make at least enough money to pay some bills, like the debt I've run up for the kids' education. Let's do it for the family." 
<p>O'Connor adds that Felt finally agreed, saying "that's a good reason" even though Mark Jr. recalls him as saying "he wasn't particularly interested" in disclosing the secret.
