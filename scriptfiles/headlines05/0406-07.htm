<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p> British Prime Minister Tony Blair admitted that the war in Iraq has badly eroded public trust in him, tackling one of his most difficult obstacles ahead of a May 5 general election.

<P>In an interview with the GMTV television station, Blair, who announced the election date on Tuesday, was asked whether his backing for the March 2003 US-led war had done more to erode public trust in him than anything else.

<P>"Yes, I would accept that," he said.

<P>"I think trust is also about the things we promised in 1997 (when he was first elected), but you are right, Iraq has been a difficult issue for me," Blair said.

<P>"You learn something in government, and that is sometimes decisions come on your desk and whichever way you go there isn't a fence to sit on."

<P>In the run-up to the Iraq war, Blair argued strongly that Britain should support the conflict due to the immediate danger posed by Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein's alleged stocks of weapons of mass destruction.

<P>None were subsequently found after Saddam was deposed, leading to accusations that Blair misled a skeptical nation into war, something he has vehemently denied.

<P>"With Iraq I had to decide, would the world be better without Saddam or with him? In the end I think it's better he is out but I have never disrespected someone with a different point of view," Blair said on Wednesday.

<P>"It's up to people to judge and they will have to make a judgment about it."

<P>Blair will be seeking a third consecutive term in office for his Labour Party on May 5, and polls indicate he is on course to do so, albeit with a reduced majority in parliament.

<P>In a separate interview, one of Blair's most senior ministers insisted that Iraq would only be a marginal factor when Britons decided which way to vote.

<P>Issues such as the economy and the state-run National Health Service (NHS) would determine how "90-odd percent" of people would vote, Health Secretary John Reid told BBC radio.

<P>"The biggest issues by far are the economy, the NHS, immigration, law and order, and about less than 10 percent Iraq," he said.
