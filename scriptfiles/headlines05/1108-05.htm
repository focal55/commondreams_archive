<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->When hundreds of millions of people around the globe log on to the 
Internet every day to shop, chat, check on their investments or sports scores 
or research their homework, the last thing they think of is the dull but vital 
inner workings of the Web. 
<P>But control of those innards  --  like domain names such as .com, the 
numeric addresses that most users never see and maintenance of files that 
correctly route Internet traffic  --  is at the heart of a simmering 
international dispute. It pits many foreign governments against the United 
States, the home of the Internet and of a government-chartered nonprofit 
company based in Marina Del Rey (Los Angeles County) that carries out the work 
that has fostered the Internet's explosive growth. 
<P>The issue could come to a head next week in Tunisia at a U.N.-sponsored 
World Summit on the Information Society, which is scheduled for Nov. 16-18, and 
follows a U.N. session two years ago in Geneva that ended in stalemate. 
<P>A host of nations, including those in the European Union and others such 
as China, Iran and Saudi Arabia that aren't exactly champions of free speech, 
want to break the U.S. stranglehold on Internet governance. In part, their 
stand is prompted by their feeling that the United States, the world's sole 
superpower whose hard-driving media corporations are seen as dominating global 
markets, shouldn't have sole control over a medium that is transforming so much 
of daily life. 
<P>The Bush administration says the current system has worked well and 
shouldn't be altered. Instead, it wants to allow more private companies to 
handle some of the functions now run by a variety of firms that include 
Mountain View-based VeriSign, which recently signed on to maintain control of 
its portion of the Net through 2012.  
<P>Many members of Congress go further, arguing that it would be an outrage 
if control of the Internet were ceded, even partly, to regimes that squelch 
free speech and human rights. 
<P>"Turning the Internet over to countries with problematic human rights 
records, muted free speech laws and questionable taxation practices will 
prevent the Internet from remaining the thriving medium it has become today," 
said Rep. John Doolittle, R-Rocklin (Placer County), a leader of the 
Congressional Internet Caucus. The caucus has introduced a House resolution 
expressing the will of Congress that day-to-day control of the Internet's 
operations remain in the United States. 
<P>The looming battle stems from the 1998 creation of the Internet 
Corporation of Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). Operating under an agreement 
with the U.S. Commerce Department but largely free of government interference, 
the corporation goes about its work largely shielded from the Internet-using 
public's view. VeriSign, for instance, manages the .com and .net domains under 
a contract with the corporation. 

<P>Since 1998, the Internet has continued its explosive growth. Today, the 
corporation maintains 13 root servers to handle its workload. Nine are in the 
United States, including two in California. The corporation has an office in 
Brussels and has an international advisory committee. 
<P>But many foreign governments question why control of the Internet should 
continue to reside in the United States. Their timing couldn't be better. The 
charter for the Internet Corporation of Assigned Names and Numbers expires next 
year, and the Bush administration wants to see its operations turned over to 
the private sector, even while it insists control remain in the United States. 
<P>The European Union recently proposed a "new international cooperation 
model,'' but it didn't offer a specific plan. There have been warnings, 
however, that if the Europeans' demands aren't settled soon, perhaps at the 
upcoming U.N. conference, the Internet could tear apart, meaning that U.S. 
users might not be able to access foreign sites. 
<P>"We have to have a platform where leaders of the world can express their 
thoughts about the Internet," Viviane Reding, the European Union's information 
technology commissioner, recently told the Guardian, a British newspaper. "If 
they have the impression that the Internet is dominated by one nation, and it 
does not belong to all the nations, then the result could be that the Internet 
falls apart.''  
<P>Other countries, including Iran and Pakistan, have proposed a more 
heavy-handed approach. They want to create an international council to which 
the corporation would report. Some countries that might favor that approach, 
such as China, limit their citizens' access to Web sites that authorities find 
politically objectionable. 
<P>The U.S. position is that it won't accept a new international governing 
body for the Internet. "The Internet's security and stability are best 
maintained through the current systems of technical controls,'' the State 
Department said. 
<P>With the Tunisia summit looming, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has 
tried to defuse the controversy. 
<P>In an op-ed article in the Washington Post last Saturday, Annan denied 
that the U.N. had a plan to take over the Internet. "Nothing could be farther 
from the truth," he wrote. "The United Nations wants only to ensure the 
Internet's global reach, and that effort is at the heart of this summit. 
<P>"The Internet has become so important for almost every country's economy 
and administration that it would be naive to expect government not to take an 
interest.''  
<P>U.S. technology leaders, while not wild about the corporation's ties to 
the federal government, say the status quo is preferable to getting a host of 
governments involved. 
<P>"Ideally, the private sector should be in full control of the Internet," 
said Tom Giovanetti, president of the Institute for Policy Innovation in 
Washington. "But for now, the U.S. must retain control in order to ensure the 
Internet is safe, open and free for all to use."
