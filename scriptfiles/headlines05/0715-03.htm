<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, July 14 ) - The body of a  Haitian journalist abducted last weekend was found on Thursday.  in the latest of a series of kidnappings for ransom that have  shaken the troubled Caribbean nation.<p>          Jacques Roche, in his early 40s, had been tortured and shot  several times, apparently with a small-caliber weapon. He had  been burned, his arms were broken and tied behind his back and  his body was covered with blood.<p>          Roche, the first journalist abducted in the kidnapping  wave, was snatched at gunpoint on Sunday. His body was found in  the capital, Port-au-Prince.<p>          Police say more than 450 people have been kidnapped since  March.<p>          Most kidnap victims have been released after a ransom was  paid. Roche was the fourth known to have died.<p>          Roche was a poet and the culture and society section chief  at Le Matin newspaper, as well as a sports commentator at Radio  Ibo in Port-au-Prince.<p>          Chenald Augustin, a colleague of Roche in the Le Matin  newsroom, said the killing may have been connected to the  ransom demand or could have been politically motivated.<p>          &quot;They (the kidnappers) demanded $250,000, but after a lot  of negotiation, they revised the amount downwards to $10,000,&quot;  said Augustin. &quot;His relatives and friends had collected $10,000  that was sent to the kidnappers. Then they said they were  waiting for the $240,000 remaining.&quot;<p>          Roche hosted a TV show on civil society issues for the  Group of 184, a coalition of prominent business, religious and  civic groups that played a prominent role in the ouster of  President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in February 2004.<p>          &quot;Those who called to negotiate told us that Jacques was a  member of the 184. When we told them he was just a journalist  doing his job, they insisted, saying that he should have known  his affiliation with that group could have consequences,&quot; said  Augustin.<p>          &quot;It is not clear whether they kidnapped him because of his  role in 184 group's TV program; maybe they have learned about  it afterwards,&quot; Augustin said.<p>          In April 2000, Haiti's leading radio commentator and  journalist, Jean Dominique, was shot to death outside his radio  station. Botched efforts to bring his killers to justice have  become an enduring symbol of Haiti's political turmoil and the  frailty of its justice system.
