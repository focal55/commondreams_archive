<p>SANTA MONICA - Smash! Crash! Crunch!</p>
<p>Bill Zimmerman and Pacy Markman have unleashed a band of marauding elephants on Washington, D.C., and they chortle merrily as their mischief plays across a computer screen in their Santa Monica office.</p>
<p>The U.S. Capitol: Stomp! The White House: Kaput!</p>
<p>For 2 1/2 years, the political partners have been the creative force behind MoveOn, the brick-heaving advocacy group that has energized Democrats, infuriated Republicans and distilled the rage of the left into a series of attention-grabbing advertisements, like this spot showing cartoon elephants -- the symbol of the GOP -- gone wild.</p>
<p>Subtle they are not.</p>
<p>Markman, who spent years pitching products such as Alka-Seltzer, Midas mufflers and Coca-Cola -- and has the glib patter to prove it -- offers this: ''Advertising is about conveying a simple idea in a powerful way to somewhere below the neck of the person you're talking to.''</p>
<p>In other words, skip the brain and aim for the heart. Or the gut. Oomph!</p>
<p>MoveOn, which grew out of a petition drive opposing President Clinton's impeachment, has exploded into the country's largest and most powerful online advocacy group, with a nationwide following of more than 3 million members. MoveOn and its sister organizations raised $60 million in the 2004 campaign -- far exceeding an original goal of $10 million -- and has scarcely let up since, collecting millions more to target the White House and Republicans in Congress. Coming soon: the battle over the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.zimark.com/" target="_new">Zimmerman and Markman</a> have produced more than 50 ads for MoveOn since their hiring in December 2003. Their latest, calling for the firing of presidential adviser Karl Rove, began airing recently in Washington and New York City. MoveOn accounts for roughly half the business of their seven-member company; the rest of their time is spent on various initiative campaigns. Their successes include passage ofOregon's physician-assisted suicide law, Arizona's campaign-finance overhaul and last year's California measure hiking taxes on those making more than $1 million to expand mental health programs and help the homeless. Their list of clients, past and present, reads like the pages of a left-wing telephone directory: the American Civil Liberties Union, Greenpeace, the Hollywood Women's Political Committee, People for the American Way. It seems that even the Democratic Party, with its fitful feints to the middle, is not entirely to their taste.</p>
<p>''We're not Democratic Party loyalists,'' Zimmerman says. ''We're progressives who support the Democratic Party because it's the best vehicle for achieving the kind of political power that could get us to where we want to go. But Democrats aren't all good, and Republican's aren't all bad. It depends on the issue.''</p>
<p>For people employed in the business of imagination, the two harbor few illusions. ''People don't turn on TV to be educated,'' Markman says. ''You're interrupting their show.... You may want to make them angry or sad or make them laugh. But there are certain constraints. You don't want to announce in the first five seconds it's a political ad. You're trying to move people into something they're not really that interested in.''</p>
<p>Republican leaders assail MoveOn as an extremist group, using words such as ''vulgar'' and ''beyond the pale'' to describe some of its advertising. Zimmerman and Markman delight at the criticism, though each was quick to disavow the most infamous MoveOn ad, a spot that likened Bush to Adolf Hitler and ended up hurting the group's image more than the president's.</p>
<p>The clip was submitted as part of a contest and was removed from MoveOn's Web site, with a statement of regret. Markman and Zimmerman seem almost as professionally peeved as personally offended.</p>
<p>''It made a comparison that was silly and just uncalled for,'' Markman says.</p>
<p>''And ineffective,'' Zimmerman added.
