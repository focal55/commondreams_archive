<p> PARIS - Way back in 1968, US ecologist Garrett Hardin sketched the dilemma that today besets the Kyoto Protocol, the UN's global warming pact which takes effect on Wednesday.
<p>In a landmark essay, "<i><a href="http://dieoff.org/page95.htm" target="_new">The Tragedy of the Commons</a></i>," Hardin evoked the case of common land where everyone has the right to graze their cattle.
 <p>
 

Even if the land becomes overgrazed, people will continue to put their animals on the damaged fields and even add to their herd, said Hardin.
 <p>

 

The reasoning: Individuals see no point in making a sacrifice if others continue to use a common asset. Even if everyone is aware of the risk of abuse, the mix of selfishness, competitiveness and unregulated exploitation eventually makes the land unusable for all.
 <p>
 

Swap the common land for Earth's atmosphere and overgrazing for greenhouse gases and you have the greatest environmental challenge of the early 21st century: how to tackle climate change.
 <p>
 

The evidence for man-made global warming is now doubted only by a small minority of scientists.
 <p>
 

The overwhelming view: Carbon emissions from burning oil, gas and coal are trapping the Sun's heat rather than let it radiate out to space -- a "greenhouse" effect with potentially far-reaching consequences for the delicate climate system.
 <p>
 

The world's average temperature rose by 0.6 C (1.08 F) from 1900-1990 alone, and could increase by another 5.8 C (10.4 F) by 2100, depending on how much carbon dioxide (CO2) is in the air, according to the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
 
<p>
 
After the Nineties -- the hottest decade on record -- 2004 was the fourth warmest year, with the highest temperature rises recorded in Alaska, the Caspian Sea and the Antarctic peninsula, NASA scientists reported last week.
 <p>

 

Experts admit there are some big knowledge gaps.
 <p>
 

No one can say for sure exactly how bad the climate damage will be, if there are triggers that could worsen it (or alternatively, ease it) and what is a "safe" level of emissions.
 <p>
 




But a conference staged in Exeter, England, this month by more than 100 climate scientists branded the danger as big and worsening, even if key details are lacking or open to debate.
 <p>
 


The biggest expert gathering since the 2001 IPCC report said climate change was already affecting ecosystems and rainfall patterns and damaging polar ice and glaciers.
 <p>
 

"In many cases, the risks are more serious than previously thought... (and) a number of new impacts were identified that are potentially disturbing," it said.
 <p>
 

Among them, the risk of acidification of the sea, caused by the absorption of too much atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2); the potential shutdown of the Gulf Stream, which provides western Europe with balmy weather; and early warnings of ice loss in Antarctica.
 <p>
 

So much for the threat today and worries about what could lie down the road.
 <p>

 

What about the solution? Well, the Kyoto Protocol is Hardin's dilemma personified.

   <p>
 

Only a small number of countries are being asked to make real sacrifices for the global good. The other countries, in effect, get a free ride.

<p>


The pact commits industrialized countries to make targeted curbs in emissions of six greenhouse gases by 2008-2012. This carries a cost because their economies will have to improve fuel efficiency and convert to cleaner energy.
<p>

True, rich nations, which used carbon fuels to power the Industrial Revolution that generated their prosperity, are historically to blame for global warming.
<p>


But the deal does not include fast-growing populous countries like China, already the world's second biggest CO2 polluter, and India.
<p>


Nor does it include the United States, which is responsible for a third of all global CO2 emissions and says meeting its Kyoto targets would cost too much.
<p>

Even if Kyoto is enacted in full, industrialized signatories will at best reduce their emissions by a couple of percent over 1990: not even a dent on global emissions.
<p>


The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates CO2 levels have already risen by 15 percent since 1990 and are set to rise by another 60 percent by 2030.
<p>


In contrast, the Exeter conference said that if the world wants to peg the temperature increase over pre-industrial times to 2.0 C (3.6 F) by 2100, pollution will have to peak in 2020 and then fall swiftly. Today's annual emissions of six gigatons would have to be roughly halved by 2095.
<p>


Climatologists are gloomy that this will ever happen, sensing only short-termism and a national focus for addressing a long-term, global problem.
<p>


Some hope for some technology breakthrough to wean the planet off fossil fuels or a climate shock that will focus minds. That way, the post-2012 Kyoto, for which negotiations begin late this year, could be inclusive, simple and enforce tough and universal emissions controls.
<p>


"I would be very surprised if the current growth rate of CO2 is not maintained for at least another two decades, no matter what policies are implemented," said Stephen Schneider, a professor at Stanford University in California.
<p>


"I'll be very pleased, looking back, wherever I am looking back from, if in 100 years we are able to keep it to under a doubling of CO2. That will be an effort."
