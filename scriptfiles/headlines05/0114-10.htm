<p>NEW YORK  - Green lobbyists and several  U.S. cities hope a lawsuit against U.S. development agencies  will force the government to act on global warming, even though  President George W. Bush has long insisted there's no  scientific proof linking human activity to warming.<p>
</p> Environmental lawyers say the suit will be closely watched  as lawsuits against utilities and the government tied to global  warming increase. Last July, for example, eight U.S. states and  New York City sued five U.S. power companies, accusing them of  stoking climate change.<p>
</p> &quot;Any court that rules that global warming is a problem that  needs to be addressed, just that headline, would be huge for  the people trying to do something about global warming,&quot; said  Pat Parenteau, a professor at Vermont Law School's  Environmental Law Center.<p>
</p> The lawsuit, slated to be argued in U.S. District Court in  San Francisco in April, seeks to require two U.S. development  agencies to conduct environmental assessments on coal, natural  gas and petroleum projects they financed in developing nations,  including China and Mexico.<p>
</p> Under the 1970 National Environmental Policy Act, U.S.  government agencies are required to conduct such assessments on  taxpayer-funded projects in the United States.<p>
</p> In recent briefs in the two-year old case, the plaintiffs  said the projects financed by the Export-Import Bank of the  United States and the U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corp  (OPIC), contribute 8 percent of the world's emissions of  greenhouse gas carbon dioxide.<p>
</p> NO HUMAN CONNECTION TO WARMING?<p>
</p> The plaintiffs, which include lobbyists Greenpeace and  Friends of the Earth, said global warming from the emissions  boost sea levels by melting glaciers, which threatens coastal  cities and island vacation properties. One plaintiff, the city  of Arcata, California, said warming could harm salmon  migration, and rising seas would cause flooding that would  damage the city's wastewater treatment system.<p>
</p> U.S. Department of Justice lawyers for OPIC and  Export-Import refused to comment on the suit.<p>
</p> But in a recent motion to dismiss the case, they said the  connection between the defendants and the alleged injuries is  undermined by the &quot;minimal&quot; amount of emissions from the  projects and argued that &quot;the basic connection between  human-induced greenhouse emissions and observed climate change  has not been established.&quot;<p>
</p> Given that most mainstream scientists believe that  greenhouse gases from industry and autos cause global warming,  the plaintiffs say their suit will be bolstered by  inconsistencies within the Bush administration on global  warming.<p>
</p> A report to Congress last summer signed by Bush's science  adviser and his secretaries of energy and commerce, said warmer  U.S. temperatures since 1950 were probably caused in part by  human activity.<p>
</p> Bush, who withdrew from the international global warming  Kyoto Protocol soon into his first term, denied that the  administration had changed its policy that more science was  needed.<p>
</p> Jeremy Symons, climate change specialist at the National  Wildlife Federation, says the administration's policy is  unclear. &quot;The administration has been in a bind for the past  several years because their scientists have been very clear  that global warming pollution is causing changes in climate,  and yet they're not doing anything substantive on the policy  front.&quot;<p>
</p> Vermont Law's Parenteau said the suit against the  development agencies might be won because it does not seek  monetary damages, but rather asks the agencies to consider  alternative energy projects in the environmental assessments.<p>
</p> Lawsuits seeking damages against utilities or governments  will be harder to win. &quot;Eventually you will see cases being won  establishing damage from identifiable sources of carbon dioxide  and other emissions. I think that day will come, but it's a  ways off yet,&quot; he said.
