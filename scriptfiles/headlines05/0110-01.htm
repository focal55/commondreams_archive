The incident came less than 24 hours after a mis-aimed US bomb was dropped on a home in the north of the country, killing another five Iraqis.

<p>Combined, the incidents will feed calls that US forces set a date for their withdrawal, a demand made by several Iraqi political factions during the run-up to the January 30 elections.

<p>On Saturday the conservative Sunni organisation, the Association of Muslim Scholars, joined the calls after meeting US representatives to demand a timetable for withdrawal. The group was reported to have said it would abandon its election boycott in return for a departure date for US forces.

<p>However, despite the rhetoric about withdrawal, a senior US official said last week that representatives of Iraqi political groups in regular contact with the embassy were not pushing for a departure date, while Iyad Allawi, prime minister, argues that most Iraqis support the presence of foreign forces.

<p>According to Iraqi police, the soldiers shot dead two police and two civilians after their convoy was hit by a roadside bomb in the town of Yusufiya, while a fifth Iraqi died of a heart attack at the scene.

<p>The US military did not have information on the shooting of civilians, but reported one soldier killed by a roadside bomb in or near Baghdad.

<p>Iraqis say US soldiers, fearing suicide car bombers, are quick to shoot at civilian vehicles, but the incidents often go unreported.

<p>Meanwhile, seven Ukrainian soldiers and an eighth from Kazakhstan were killed in a blast that occurred when they were loading an unexploded bomb.
