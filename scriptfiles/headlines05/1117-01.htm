<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p> The Iraqi government is to investigate the United States military's use of white phosphorus shells during the battle of Fallujah - an inquiry that could reveal whether American forces breached a fundamental international weapons treaty. </p>

        
          
          
            <p>
  Iraq's acting Human Rights minister, Narmin Othman, said last night that a 
  team would be dispatched to Fallujah to try to ascertain conclusively 
  whether civilians had been killed or injured by the incendiary weapon. The 
  use of white phosphorus (WP) and other incendiary weapons such as napalm 
  against civilians is prohibited.
</p>
<p>
  The announcement came as John Reid, the Secretary of State for Defence, 
  faced mounting calls for an inquiry into the use of WP by British forces as 
  well as what Britain knew about its deployment by American troops. Mr Reid 
  said that he would look into the matter.
</p>
<p>
  The move by the Iraqi government and the growing concern at Westminster 
  follows the Pentagon's confirmation to <i>The Independent</i> earlier this 
  week that WP had been used during the battle of Fallujah last November and 
  the presentation of persuasive evidence that civilians had been among the 
  victims.
</p>

<p>
  The fresh controversy over Fallujah, which has raged for a full 12 months, 
  was initially sparked last week by a documentary by the Italian state 
  broadcaster, RAI, which claimed there were numerous civilian casualties. A 
  Pentagon spokesman said yesterday he would "not be surprised" if 
  WP had been used by US forces elsewhere in Iraq.
</p>
<p>
  Lt-Col Barry Venable said the incendiary shells were a regular part of the 
  troops' munitions. "I would not rule out the possibility that it has 
  been used in other locations." The Pentagon's admission of WP's use - 
  it can burn a person down to the bone - has proved to be a huge 
  embarrassment to some elements of the US government.
</p>
<p>
  In a letter to this newspaper, the American ambassador to London, Robert 
  Tuttle, claimed that US forces "do not use napalm or WP as weapons"
   .
</p>
<p>
  Confronted with the Pentagon's admission, an embassy spokesperson said Mr 
  Tuttle would not be commenting further and "all questions on WP" 
  should be referred to the Pentagon. The US embassy in Rome had issued a 
  similar denial.
</p>
<p>

  The size or scale of the inquiry to be undertaken by the Iraqi government is 
  unclear, and it is not known when its investigators will arrive in Fallujah. 
  An official with the human rights ministry said that while it was also not 
  known how long the inquiry would take, "the people of Fallujah will be 
  fully consulted". The Pentagon says the use of incendiary weapons 
  against military targets is not prohibited.
</p>
<p>
  But the article two, protocol III of the 1980 UN Convention on Certain 
  Weapons bans their use against civilians.
</p>
<p>
  Perhaps of crucial importance to the Iraqi investigators, the treaty also 
  restricts their use against military targets "inside a concentration of 
  civilians except when such military objective is clearly separated from the 
  concentration of civilians".
</p>
<p>
  Mr Reid confirmed yesterday that British troops had used WP in Iraq, though 
  he said the shells had only been used to make smoke to obscure troops 
  movements, which experts say is their primary function.
</p>
<p>
   "Neither it nor any other munitions are used against civilians. It is 
  not a chemical weapon," he said. Speaking at a Nato training exercise 
  in Germany, where he was visiting British troops bound for Afghanistan, Mr 
  Reid said the US's use of WP was a "matter for the US".

</p>
<p>
  However, last week Mr Reid indicated that he would raise the issues 
  contained within the RAI documentary if presented with evidence.
</p>
<p>
  But last night MPs were openly dismissive of Mr Reid's comments and called 
  for an inquiry, saying they had previously been misled about the US's use of 
  napalm in Iraq. The US had drawn a distinction between conventional napalm 
  and updated Mk 77 firebombs, which experts say are virtually identical.
</p>
<p>
  Mike Gapes, the Labour chairman of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, 
  said: "I think there is an issue here about whether the chemical 
  weapons convention should be strengthened to include this particular 
  substance because it is defined as an incendiary not a chemical weapon, 
  therefore it is excluded from certain definitions."
</p>
<p>
  Sir Menzies Campbell, the Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman, said: "
The use of this weapon may technically have been legal, but its effects are 
  such that it will hand a propaganda victory to the insurgency. The denial of 
  use followed by the admission will simply convince the doubters that there 
  was something to hide." So far, the fall-out in the US over the 
  revelation has been minimal. But the former president Bill Clinton yesterday 
  told students at the American University of Dubai that he did not agree with 
  invasion of Iraq.
</p>

<p>
  The battle of Fallujah, an insurgent stronghold, took place over two weeks 
  last November. It led to the displacement of 300,000 people. Reports from 
  refugee camps and from an Iraqi doctor who stayed in the city during the 
  fighting suggest numerous civilians suffered burns and "melting skin"
. Photographs show rows of bodies charred almost beyond recognition.
</p>
<p><b><i>Chemical legitimately used or a WMD? </i></b></p>
<p><b>What is white phosphorus?</b></p>
<p>
  White phosphorus is a highly flammable incendiary material which ignites 
  when exposed to oxygen, and will burn human skin until all the oxygen is 
  used up. A doctor from Fallujah described victims in the US siege "who 
  had their skin melted".

</p>
<p>
  White phosphorus, known as WP or Willy Pete in the military, flares in 
  spectacular bursts with a yellow flame when fired from artillery shells and 
  produces dense white smoke. It is used as a smokescreen for troop movements 
  and to illuminate a battlefield.
</p>
<p>
   <b>Is it a chemical weapon?</b>
</p>
<p>
  No. White phosphorus has thermal properties which burn by heating everything 
  around it, rather than chemical properties which attack the body's life 
  systems . It therefore does not fall under the 1993 Chemical Weapons 
  Convention. But protocol III of the 1980 Convention on Conventional Weapons 
  bans its use as an incendiary weapon against civilian populations.
</p>
<p>
   <b>So what is all the fuss about?</b>

</p>
<p>
  The US ambassador to London, Robert Tuttle, said in a letter to The 
  Independent that "US forces do not use napalm or phosphorus as a 
  weapon. " The US position was that white phosphorus used as a 
  smokescreen was legitimate - a position outlined by John Reid, the Defence 
  Secretary, yesterday.
</p>
<p>
  But a Pentagon statement on Tuesday appears to have shifted the argument. It 
  said that US troops had used the white phosphorus as a weapon against 
  insurgents. The State Department meanwhile corrected a statement, according 
  to which white phosphorus was "fired into the air to illuminate enemy 
  positions at night, not at enemy fighters". Now the argument focuses on 
  whether those being targeted were insurgents or civilians, and, of course, 
  in a place like Fallujah, this grey area gives the US more of a get-out 
  clause.
</p>
<p>
  Humanitarian law distinguishes between combatants and non-combatants. If the 
  white phosphorus was used against insurgents they qualify as combatants and 
  there has been no protocol breach.
</p>
<p>
  Both the US and the UK have signed the convention, but Washington declared 
  at the time of the signing of protocol III in 1995 that its military 
  doctrine would abide by the protocol's provisions. These stipulate that the 
  military distinguishes between military and civilian targets.
</p>

<p>
   <b>If it turns out that civilians were killed, what legal recourse is there?</b></p>
<p>
  If an Iraqi investigation provides evidence that civilians were killed by 
  white phosphorus as a weapon, there is no recourse under the Conventional 
  Weapons Convention.
</p>
<p>
  However, the 1977 first protocol to the Geneva Conventions could be invoked. 
  The United States has signed but not ratified the protocol which relates to 
  the 4th Convention which considers the treatment of civilians.
</p>
<p>
  Article 35 of the protocol makes it clear that the use and methods of use of 
  "weapons of warfare are not unlimited." Any weapon or use of 
  weapon that causes "superfluous or unnecessary suffering" is 
  outlawed. The indiscriminate use of phosphorus on a civilian population 
  would be covered.
</p>
<p>

  Breaches of the Geneva Conventions are brought by individual countries and 
  are usually heard by the United Nations at Security Council level, or in the 
  International Court of Justice.
</p>
<p>
  Peter Carter QC, an expert in international law and chairman of the Bar's 
  human rights committee, said the latest US admissions raised serious 
  concerns about whether white phosphorus was indiscriminately used against 
  civilians. He called for an independent inquiry, possibly through the United 
  Nations, into the use of white phosphorus in Iraq.
</p>
<p>
   <b>Why has all this come out so long after the Fallujah siege?</b>
</p>
<p>
  An Italian television documentary last week, accused the US of using white 
  phosphorus in a "massive and indiscriminate way" against civilians 
  at Fallujah.
</p>
<p>

  This was denied by the Pentagon, but witnesses in the US military's Field 
  Artillery magazine described firing '"shake and bake" missions at 
  insurgents and high explosive shells to "take them out". The 
  Independent's coverage of the RAI documentary and fallout prompted a letter 
  from Ambassador Tuttle.
</p>
<p>
   <b>What does the US ambassador say now?</b>
</p>
<p>
  No comment. He referred all questions to the Pentagon.
</p>

<p><b><i>Bush's Arsenal</i></b></p>
<p><b>The allegation</b></p>
<p>
  Napalm/Mark 77s
</p>
<p>
  Widespread reports during the initial US-led invasion in March 2003 
  suggested marines had dropped incendiary bombs over the Tigris river and the 
  Saddam canal on the way to Baghdad.
</p>

<p>
  Cluster bombs
</p>
<p>
  33 civilians, including many children, were reportedly killed in a US 
  cluster bomb attack on Hilla, south of Baghdad. Reports of attacks on Basra 
  were also widespread.
</p>
<p>
  White Phosphorus
</p>
<p>
  Coalition troops were reported to have used WP indiscriminately against 
  civilians and insurgents during the Fallujah offensive of November 2004.
</p>
<p>

   <b>What the US said</b>
</p>
<p>
  Napalm/Mark 77s
</p>
<p>
  The Pentagon denied reports it had used napalm, saying it had last used the 
  weapon in 1993 and destroyed its last batch in 2001. "We don't even 
  have that in our arsenal."
</p>
<p>
  Cluster bombs
</p>
<p>

  General Richard Myers, head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said coalition 
  forces dropped nearly 1,500 cluster bombs during the war and only 26 fell 
  within 1,500ft of civilian areas.
</p>
<p>
  White Phosphorus
</p>
<p>
   "[WP was used] very sparingly in Fallujah, for illumination. They were 
  fired into the air to illuminate enemy positions at night, not at enemy 
  fighters." US State Department
</p>
<p>
   <b>How the UK backed them up</b>
</p>
<p>

  Napalm/Mark 77s
</p>
<p>
   "The US have confirmed to us they have not used Mk 77 firebombs, 
  essentially napalm canisters, in Iraq at any time." Adam Ingram, Armed 
  Forces minister, January 2004
</p>
<p>
  Cluster bombs
</p>
<p>
  The MoD said it supported the use of cluster bombs against legitimate 
  military targets to protect British troops and civilians, insisting care was 
  taken to avoid populated areas.
</p>
<p>
  White Phosphorus

</p>
<p>
   "Use of phosphorus by the US is a matter for the US," Tony 
  Blair's spokesman said yesterday.
</p>
<p>
   <b>How the US came clean</b>
</p>
<p>
  Napalm/Mark 77s
</p>
<p>
  It took five months for the US to admit its marines had used Mk 77 firebombs 
  (a close relative of napalm) in the invasion. The Pentagon said their 
  functions were "remarkably similar".

</p>
<p>
  Cluster bombs
</p>
<p>
  General Myers admitted: "In some cases, we hit those targets knowing 
  there would be a chance of collateral damage." It was "unfortunate"
 that "we had to make these choices".
</p>
<p>
  White Phosphorus
</p>
<p>
  Pentagon spokesman Lt-Col Barry Venable said this week that WP had been 
  used, "to fire at the enemy" in Iraq. "It burns... it's an 
  incendiary weapon. That is what it does."
</p>

<p>
   <b>How the UK came clean</b>
</p>
<p>
  Napalm/Mark 77s
</p>
<p>
   "First of all they didn't use napalm. They used a firebomb. It doesn't 
  stick to your skin like napalm, it doesn't have the horrible effects of 
  that. " John Reid, Defence Secretary
</p>
<p>
  Cluster bombs
</p>

<p>
  Adam Ingram, Armed Forces minister, said: "There were troops [and] 
  equipment in and around built-up areas, therefore bombs were used to take 
  out the threat to our troops."
</p>
<p>
  White Phosphorus
</p>
<p>
  The Government maintains it used WP in Iraq only to lay smoke screens. "
   We do not use white phosphorus against civilians," the Defence 
  Secretary John Reid said.
