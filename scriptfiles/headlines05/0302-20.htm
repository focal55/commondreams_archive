<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p>Torture is currently enjoying its 15 minutes of fame, courtesy of 
the war on terrorism. But, as we are all unfortunately learning, torture 
American-style is refusing to make a graceful exit from the public stage.
<P>According to the Bush administration  --  in the words of Secretary of 
State Condoleezza Rice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and the president 
himself  --  the Abu Ghraib horrors were an anomaly, a deplorable and isolated 
case of misconduct among a few in the lower ranks.
<P>Yet, as that scandal fades from view, we are confronted with new 
revelations. Writing last month in the New Yorker, Jane Mayer reports on a 
secretive U.S. government program in which U.S. agents kidnap terror suspects 
and then turn them over to foreign nations so that they may be interrogated 
with methods that would be prohibited in the United States, including torture. 
A Pentagon investigation has confirmed that U.S. interrogators at Guantanamo 
Bay have used sexual humiliation to coerce information from prisoners. Women 
interrogators fondled prisoners, flaunted their breasts, teased them about sex.
Using dye, they pretended to smear menstrual blood on the Muslim men, a 
profound cultural violation.
<P>Sexual and other types of humiliation do not leave physical scars, and so 
it is tempting to think of psychological abuse as less damaging than physical 
abuse. No one is immune from making this mental mistake. The body is visible 
and tangible whereas the mind seems elusive. The aim of torture, however, is 
always psychological.
<P>At Survivors International, we see the effects of torture firsthand. As 
providers of services to survivors of torture now living in the Bay Area, we 
note sadly that we have no shortage of clients. In 15 years, we've helped 1,
700 survivors from more than 80 countries. We know that many more are here who 
could benefit from our services.
<P>We see men and women totally overwhelmed by the memories of what was done 
to them. I think of a man so traumatized that he would shake and sweat every 
time he came to see me. He cried out through his tears: "Doctor, they turn you 
into a piece of meat!" Another client vomited in my wastebasket after the 
memories of torture overwhelmed him. Many women sat with their heads buried in 
shame, sobbing uncontrollably. The physical wounds had healed, but the 
psychological trauma lived on.
<P>The techniques employed by the American torturers in Iraq and Guantanamo 
Bay are among the most insidious and effective. Sexual abuse, whatever form it 
takes, is an extremely damaging form of torture. For tormentors to penetrate 
this most private realm produces deep feelings of despair and self-loathing; I 
have heard survivors say they would have preferred to be beaten. When they are 
forced into humiliating acts, they can feel responsible for participating in 
their own degradation. The shame they feel eats away at them forever.
<P>Long after the torture ends, many continue to suffer in silence, their 
trust in humanity so shattered, they cannot seek the help of others, not even 
family or friends. I recall one man recounting various kinds of severe 
physical torture and interrogation. Only months later did he tell me that he 
was raped. The despair that cried out from his face, then, was of another 
dimension; it spoke to the loss of dignity.
<P>Every day, our clients speak of depression, sleeplessness and nightmares. 
For many, the torturer's face and voice have entered the survivor's mind and 
will not leave. One survivor who came to see us for years had come very close 
to death. His recovery from a broken back and other injuries took months. He 
once said to me that in the United States he would ask the assistance of the 
police if he were wronged, whereas in his home country it was the police who 
tortured him. He said he did not like it when people spoke ill of America.
<P>Every time I read with dismay of a new revelation of American torture, or 
the complicity in or enabling of torture elsewhere, I think of that man. I am 
pained to wonder whether he would feel the same today. Nobody knows more about 
the horror of torture than survivors like this man. His voice should be silent 
no longer. I urge readers to ask their elected representatives in Congress to 
hold open hearings in which torture survivors, and their allies in medicine, 
psychology and law, are invited to give testimony. Whether there are 
"acceptable forms of torture" is not a question that can or should be answered 
by government officials and academics who have no experience with the price 
that torture exacts. It is time for the voices of survivors to be heard.
