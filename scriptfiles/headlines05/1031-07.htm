bombs near Baghdad, the military said on Monday, making October 
the bloodiest month for Americans in Iraq since January. 

<p>    In the far west, where U.S. marines have been fighting for 
months to stem a flow of foreign Arab fighters and funds coming 
through Syria, local doctors and tribal leaders accused American 
forces of killing some 40 civilians in an air strike. 
<p>    The military said it knew of no civilian deaths and believed 
it had killed an al Qaeda leader targeted by precision bombing. 
<p>    Two roadside bombings near Baghdad on Monday killed six 
soldiers and the military announced a Marine had been killed by 
a similar device near Falluja on Sunday. 
<p>    That made October, which saw Iraqis vote for a constitution 
and put Saddam Hussein on trial, the worst month for U.S. forces 
since January, when attacks by Sunni Arab rebels surged before 
an election that brought Kurds and majority Shi'ites to power. 
<p>    Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld warned at the weekend of a 
similar increase in bloodshed before another parliamentary vote 
in December, although officials hope a decision by Sunni leaders 
not to repeat their January boycott of the voting may deprive 
the militants of support within Saddam's once dominant minority. 
<p>    Militants claiming to speak for some nationalist rebels have 
said they held fire around the Oct. 15 constitutional referendum 
to encourage a big Sunni turnout and may do so again, despite 
disappointment that Sunnis narrowly failed to veto the charter. 
<p>    However, foreign-influenced Islamist radicals like al Qaeda 
show no sign of letting up. A suicide bomber lured Shi'ites to 
their death with a truck laden with dates on Saturday, killing 
30 in a small town north of Baghdad, and there are fears of more 
violence around this week's end of the holy month of Ramadan.
<p>    "LIBERATION CALL" 

<p>    Launching one of two big Sunni-led blocs expected to figure 
prominently among dozens of parties on the Dec. 15 ballot, one 
leader set the tone for his campaign by calling for an end to 
U.S. occupation and criticising rivals who returned from exile 
after Saddam's fall as beholden to Washington or religion. 
<p>    "We are ... working for the liberation of our country," 
Saleh al-Mutlak said, launching his Iraqi Unified Front as a 
secular pan-Iraqi bloc. "You won't find anyone in our group who 
rode into Iraq on an American tank or on a sectarian horse." 
<p>    Various secular groups accuse the ruling United Alliance, 
led by Islamists once exiled in Tehran, of seeking to bring Iraq 
under the influence of fellow Shi'ites in non-Arab Iran. 
<p>    The order parties appear on the lengthy ballot paper will be 
drawn by lot on Tuesday. Prime Minister Ibrahim Jaafari said 
that, unlike in January, up to a million Iraqis living abroad 
may not be able to vote due to the cost and a tight schedule. 
<p> Monday's roadside bomb that killed four soldiers near 
Yusufiya, just south of Baghdad, was among the most lethal of 
recent weeks. U.S. commanders have been voicing concern about 
increasing power and sophistication of such bombs. 
<p>    Devices capable of penetrating armoured vehicles have become 
more common this year, based on technology U.S. and British 
officials say has been introduced from Iran. 
<p>    "We see an adversary that ... continues to develop some 
sophistication on very deadly and increasingly precise 
standoff-type weapons," Pentagon spokesman Lawrence Di Rita said. 
<p>    Two soldiers were killed in a similar attack near Balad, 60 
km (40 miles) north of Baghdad, and the military said a marine 
was killed by a bomb near Falluja, to the west, on Sunday. 
<p>    A week after the U.S. death toll since the 2003 invasion 
passed the 2,000 mark, it rose to at least 2,026 with the 
attacks; they brought to 93 the number of Americans to die in 
October, the highest since 107 died in January.
<p>    AIR STRIKE 
<p>    Near the Syrian border on Monday, U.S. aircraft bombed a 
house close to Karabila before dawn in what the military said 
was a precision strike on an al Qaeda leader. 
<p>    Hospital doctors in nearby Qaim said 40 people were killed 
and 20 wounded, many of them women and children. 
<p>    "Civilian deaths cannot be verified and hospital officials 
frequently make such claims," U.S. spokesman Colonel David Lapan 
said. "We believe the targeted terrorist leader was killed." 
<p> U.S. forces in Tal Afar, further north on the border and the 
site of a fierce battle in September, accused insurgents of 
holding the local population in a "grip of fear", in a statement 
detailing what a military spokesman said were rebel atrocities. 
<p>    Twelve bodies were found shot in the head in a shallow grave 
along with two who had been beheaded, the military said. A 
mentally handicapped boy was forced to throw hand grenades at 
Iraqi troops, and another boy confessed to murder and holding 
the feet of people while militants cut their heads off. 
<p>    Before the election, a further hearing is scheduled in the 
trial of Saddam and seven co-defendants, including his brother 
Barzan al-Tikriti, on charges of crimes against humanity. 
<p>    Prime Minister Jaafari said on Monday that Barzan would have 
access to cancer treatment which he had demanded. Jaafari did 
not say he would be freed as he had requested, however.
