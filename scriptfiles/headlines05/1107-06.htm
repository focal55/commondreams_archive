<p>A defense lawyer who requested anonymity told Reuters moving Saddam and his aides abroad was the only way to protect the defendants and their lawyers, adding "the growing intimidation and threats against them will never allow the trial to be fair".</p><p>A statement for the lawyers of Saddam and his aides and sent to Reuters called for the "transfer of the place of detention of the President and his aides to another country because of grave danger to their lives".</p><p>It said the defense team had received no word from the court or the government guaranteeing its safety since the murder of a defense lawyer a day after his court appearance at the start of the trial on October 19.</p><p>The murder of Saadoun al-Janabi by armed men who identified themselves as Interior Ministry employees renewed accusations of sectarian violence involving government forces.</p><p>The government denied having a hand in Janabi's murder and said it stood ready to increase already tight security for the trial.</p><p>The defense team said it had become "impossible to continue visits to their clients" in the heavily guarded compound where Saddam and his aides are held.</p><p>"The defense lawyers cannot continue their visits because of the increased threats and with the serious deterioration in violence," the lawyers' statement said.</p><p>Saddam and the seven others were charged with crimes against humanity over the deaths of 148 men after a 1982 assassination attempt against the former president in the village of Dujail.</p><p>The trial has been adjourned until November 28 after the judge said witnesses were too scared to testify.</p><p>Human rights groups have called for the same protection for defense attorneys and witnesses as has been given to prosecutors and judges.</p>
<p>The defense team said it would not cooperate with the court until the authorities met their demand for protection and a full independent investigation into Janabi's murder.</p><p align="center">
