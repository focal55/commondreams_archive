      But she now says that she’s not going to jail until Warren Andersen, the former CEO of Union Carbide, is extradited to face manslaughter charges in Bhopal, India.


<p>“I’m going to go on the lam,” Wilson told Corporate Crime Reporter today. “I realize I have to go to jail. I’m quite willing to do that. But Warren Andersen – who jumped bail 13 years ago – needs to go to jail too. I’m going to stay out to expose the inequality – corporate executives don’t go to jail for high crimes and little citizens go to jail for misdemeanors.”


<p>In August 2002, Wilson scaled a Dow Chemical facility in Seadrift, Texas and unfurled a banner that read – “Dow Responsible for Bhopal.”


<p>When she came down, she was arrested and charged with criminal trespass.
<p>In January 2003, Wilson was convicted of that charge and sentenced to four months in prison and fined $2,000.


<p>An appellate court affirmed her conviction earlier this month.


<p>She is out on a $1,500 bond.


<p>Andersen was CEO of Union Carbide on December 3, 1984 when a deadly gas leak from Union Carbide’s pesticide factory in Bhopal, India poisoned at least 500,000 people.


<p>More than 8,000 people died within three days and over 20,000 people have died to date as a result of their exposure.


<p>Andersen was charged with manslaughter by prosecutors in Bhopal.


<p>He reportedly lives in Bridgehampton, New York.


<p>Midland, Michigan-based Dow Chemical purchased Union Carbide Corporation (UCC) in February 2001.


<p>Union Carbide also still faces outstanding manslaughter charges in Bhopal.


<p>Both Andersen and Union Carbide refuse to appear before the courts in Bhopal to face the charges.


<p>Wilson is scheduled to be a keynote speaker at the <a href="http://www.Bioneers.org" target="_new">Bioneers Conference</a> on October 14, 2005 in San Rafael, California.


<p>Wilson lives in Seadrift, Texas.


<p>She said she has no immediate plans to return home.


<p>She is currently on a nationwide tour promoting her book – <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1931498881/commondreams-20/ref=nosim/" target="_new"><i>An Unreasonable Woman: The True Story of Shrimpers, Politicos, Polluters and the Fight for Seadrift, Texas</i></a> (Chelsea Green, 2005).
<p>Shannon Salyer, the assistant district attorney in Calhoun County, Texas would not comment on the case.


<p>Salyer said that Dan Heard, the district attorney, won’t be back in the office until the end of the week.</p>
