<p>Braving a bitter cold wind that swept in off San Francisco Bay on Tuesday night, more than 400 death penalty protesters gathered at the gates of San Quentin State Prison to bear witness, at a certain remove, to the execution of Donald Beardslee.

<P>Speaker after speaker mounted a low wooden soapbox to shout, "They say Death Row! We say hell no!"

<P>Actor Mike Farrell, president of <a href="http://www.deathpenalty.org/" target="_new">Death Penalty Focus</a>, a California activist organization, said that earlier Tuesday evening he had spoken with one of Beardslee's attorneys.

Beardslee, through the attorney, told the protesters "that he wanted known his appreciation for these people's presence," Farrell said, adding that Beardslee "even sent his regards to the people who put the staples in the signs."

<P>Most of those signs advocated an end to the death penalty. But one sign, borne by Rudy Thered, from Sacramento, said, "Bye, bye, Beardslee."

<P>At one point, Thered threaded his way up to the speaker's stand, apparently trying to get on TV, but protesters bearing signs reading "End the Death Penalty" surrounded him and his sign, and for a few minutes, they jostled each other.

<P>As people stamped their feet in an effort to keep warm, Point San Quentin Village resident Frances Barbour Hayden, whose house is a few feet from the prison gates, brewed up a pot of tea, grabbed some cups and went outside to help the protesters warm up.

<P>She said she was doing this as a salute to people "who have come a long way to exercise their freedom of speech."

<P>Earlier in the evening before most of the protesters arrived, Steven Blair, a retired teacher of ancient history, walked briskly through the chill Marin air and down the main street of San Quentin village to join about half a dozen protesters.

<P>He and the other demonstrators were at the prison for one simple reason, perhaps best explained by the 61-year-old Blair:

<P>"My being here has nothing to do with what's his name and the two gals he murdered, and I have the utmost sympathy for their families," he said. "This is all about us. We're doing it. We're killing this guy. It's a revenge killing, and we're in the last remnant of a barbarous time. This is pre- civilized behavior."

<P>The few who gathered together early in the evening said they have been against the death penalty for decades and that coming to San Quentin's gates, where they were outnumbered about 5 to 1 by newspeople, was a way of getting their message across.

<P>"We know the early news (shows) need a visual, so that's why we get here early," said Joan Juster, 51, of San Francisco, as she held a sign saying, "Execute Justice, Not People."

<P>"If you feel strongly about an issue, you should take to the streets and let people know." <p align="center">&copy; 2005 San Francisco Chronicle</p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable --></font></td></tr>
