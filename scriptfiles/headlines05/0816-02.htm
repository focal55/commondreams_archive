<p>As an assistant White House counsel in 1984, John Roberts scoffed at the notion that men and women should earn equal pay in jobs of comparable importance, and he belittled three female Republican members of Congress who promoted that idea to the Reagan administration.
<p>The memo from Roberts, now President Bush's nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court, was a response to a letter that the three women - one of whom was Olympia Snowe of Maine, now a U.S. senator - had sent to the administration. The women had said that the concept of "equal pay for equal work" had not sufficiently boosted women's wages because women were not in many of the same fields as men. The three were promoting the notion of equal pay for different jobs of comparable value, based on factors such as skills and responsibility.</p>
<p>In his memo to White House counsel Fred Fielding, Roberts said the women's letter "contends that more is required because women still earn only $0.60 for every $1 earned by men, ignoring the factors that explain that apparent disparity, such as seniority, the fact that many women frequently leave the work force for extended periods of time. ... I honestly find it troubling that three Republican representatives are so quick to embrace such a radical redistributive concept. Their slogan may as well be, 'From each according to his ability, to each according to her gender.' "</p>
<p>The Feb. 20, 1984, memo from Roberts was among 5,393 pages of records released Monday by the National Archives that were from Roberts' work during the Reagan administration in the early 1980s.</p>
<p>The records, which have been stored at the Reagan presidential library in Simi Valley, Calif., did not include material from Roberts' tenure as deputy U.S. solicitor general from 1989 to 1993, a period in which he took part in cases involving abortion rights, school desegregation and religion in public places. Senate Democrats and the Bush administration continue to wrangle over the release of those papers. The administration has withheld the documents, saying that to release them would breach the attorney-client relationship.</p>
<p>Monday's papers reinforced the portrait of Roberts that emerged in previous releases of documents from his government work two decades ago, before he went on to a career in private practice and then became a judge on a U.S. appeals court. The papers show him as a young aide eager to advance Reagan's conservatism on civil rights, school prayer and women's rights.</p>
<p>Roberts' tone on some women's issues contrasts with that of Sandra Day O'Connor, the justice whom Roberts would succeed. As an Arizona legislator, she complained about women's low wages. As the court's first female justice, she voted for affirmative action and broadly interpreted federal law protecting girls from bias in school programs.</p>
<p>Roberts' memo in the debate over "comparable worth" in wages arose after a U.S. trial judge in Washington state ruled that federal anti-discrimination law required equal pay for men and women who held different jobs that required comparable skills and effort. Reagan officials were considering whether to urge an appeals court to reverse the ruling.</p>
<p>Snowe - along with Nancy Johnson, who is still a House member from Connecticut, and Claudine Schneider, who represented Rhode Island - wanted the ruling to stand and urged the Reagan administration to stay out of the case. (In the end, the administration did not intervene. An appeals court reversed the trial judge's decision.)</p>
<p>In a statement Monday, Snowe said that she recently had a "productive conversation" with Roberts "on a range of issues." She added, "Hopefully, 21 years later, Judge Roberts possesses an openness with respect to issues of gender-based wage discrimination."</p>
<p>One of Monday's documents might undercut the image of Roberts put forward recently by NARAL Pro-Choice America, an abortion rights group. A TV ad by the group cast Roberts as being sympathetic to bombers of abortion clinics. The group withdrew the ad last week under criticism that it was unfair.</p>
<p>In February 1986, Roberts drafted a letter for a White House official to a lawmaker who had raised concerns that Reagan might pardon people who had been convicted of bombing abortion clinics. "No matter how lofty or sincerely held the goal, those who resort to violence to achieve it are criminals," Roberts wrote, adding that "neither the cause ... nor the target of their violence will in any way be considered to mitigate the seriousness of their offense against our laws."</p>
