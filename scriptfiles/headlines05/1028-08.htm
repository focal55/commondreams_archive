<p>ANCHORAGE - Libby Roderick never set out to write a song heard round the world. But "How Could Anyone," the simple folk tune she composed in response to a friend in pain, has been embraced by a global audience ranging from prisoners to politicians.<P>

              Libby Roderick sings her song 'How Could Anyone,' on Thursday Sept. 29, 2005, in her home in Anchorage, Alaska.

        </table></font>It has been sung by participants at a China women's conference, by monks and AIDS orphans in Zambia, and in Spanish by Texas nuns. The lyrics have been reprinted in a Japanese book helping people recover from eating disorders. It's been translated into Yupik Eskimo at a sexual assault prevention workshop in Alaska and used in a U.S. presidential campaign.<P>
"It's like you have a child who goes out into the world and you hear all these great stories about them," said the 46-year-old singer-songwriter, sipping tea in her Anchorage home. "It's not about me. It's about this phenomenon and I'm just the vessel."
<P>
The song is short, more of a chorus really--it took Roderick only five minutes to compose--asking how cruelty can exist amid the miracle of humanity:<P>
"How could anyone ever tell you you were anything less than beautiful?<P>
How could anyone ever tell you you were less than whole?<P>
How could anyone fail to notice that your loving is a miracle?<P>
How deeply you're connected to my soul."<P>
"People are made to feel bad about so much," Roderick said. "They're too fat, they're too thin, too poor, too old, but I think that deep down inside they know they're better than others may think. This song speaks to both of those things at the same time, and I think that's why it's touched so many people."<P>
One of those touched is Vern Herd, who came upon the song in 1990 when he was serving a 27-year sentence in Washington state for a robbery-related murder. The song was foreign to the message he grew up hearing, that he was ugly and stupid and would never amount to anything.<P>

After being released nine years ago Herd became a prison counselor, and he wraps up his workshops on violence alternatives and self-esteem with Roderick's song.<P>
"People sing along with it. Some people hold back emotionally being in prison and all, some get choked up and I've seen some flat-out cry," said Herd, 52. "For a lot of people, the message helps shake up beliefs about themselves."<P>
Roderick said the song poured out after she got a phone call in 1988 from a friend going through an emotional, confidence-draining spell. She never intended to be a professional musician, but friends began taking her recordings out of state, and "How Could Anyone" was always the favorite.<P>
"This song has been mistaken as an old Quaker hymn, as an eastern spiritual tradition," Roderick said. "It's been attributed to so many sources. A lot of people think no one wrote it, like it emanated from the folk consciousness."<P>
Over the years, Roderick has fielded a steady stream of requests from individuals and organizations asking for permission to use her signature song in churches, hospitals, shelters, rallies, weddings and funerals.<P>
More recently, "How Could Anyone" was adopted as the unofficial theme song for supporters of a bill introduced by U.S. Sen. Mark Dayton, D-Minn., to create a federal Department of Peace and Nonviolence. Roderick sang the song at a September campaign conference in Washington, D.C., that also featured singer Judy Collins and news icon Walter Cronkite.<P>
"How Could Anyone" perfectly mirrors the goal of The Peace Alliance, which is spearheading the lobbying effort behind the legislation, said Dot Maver, alliance executive director. <P>
Maver also used the song when she ran the Democratic presidential campaign of Ohio Rep. Dennis Kucinich, who introduced the same legislation in the U.S. House seeking to set up a peace department.<P>
"It speaks to our essential humanity," Maver said. "It calls for us to be kind, compassionate, wise and it recognizes our interconnectedness."<P>
