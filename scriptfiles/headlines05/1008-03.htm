<p>LONDON - Iraq faces the threat of civil war as it prepares for next week's constitutional referendum, the secretary general of the Arab League warned on Saturday.

<P>
Secretary-General Amr Moussa made the comments as an Arab League delegation headed to Iraq Saturday to prepare a reconciliation conference. He said certain interests in Iraq were promoting tension between Shiites, Sunni Arabs and Kurds for their own advantage. But he did not blame any specific group.
<P>
"The situation is so tense there is a threat looming in the air about civil war that could erupt at any moment, although some people would say that it is already there," Moussa told British Broadcasting Corp. radio.
<P>
"There is a policy to provoke and push communities against each other and there is another policy that would bring them together. It is our policy in the Arab League that the time has come for us to talk seriously about bringing them together."
<P>
The constitution has sharply divided Iraqis, with majority Shiites supporting it and minority Sunni Arabs opposed, saying it will tear Iraq apart and leave Sunnis weakened. Sunni-led insurgents are seeking to undermine the referendum with attacks that have killed more than 300 people in the past two weeks.
<P>
Shiites and non-Arab Kurds view the Arab League with suspicion because they see it as supporting Iraq's Sunnis and resent what they see as the League's failure to speak out against the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein. Most nations that make up the League are Sunni-dominated.
<P>
The Arab League delegation is making a five-day visit to Iraq after a meeting of Arab foreign ministers suggested the organization should help prepare a national reconciliation conference.
<P>
Moussa is expected to go to Iraq later this month to chair the conference - his first visit since the fall of Saddam's regime. It is not known whether the conference will be held before Iraqis vote on the draft constitution referendum on Oct. 15.
<P>
Previous efforts to hold a pan-Iraqi conference have faltered as the Shiites and Kurds have refused to accept the participation of Sunni insurgents.
<P>

Iraq has repeatedly asked Arab states to send ambassadors and for the League to open its office in Baghdad. But the nations have been reluctant due to violence, particularly the kidnapping and killing of top diplomats from Egypt and Algeria in July.
