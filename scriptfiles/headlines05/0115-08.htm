<p> The US military investigated building a "gay bomb", which would make enemy soldiers "sexually irresistible" to each other, government papers say.
<p>
Other weapons that never saw the light of day include one to make soldiers obvious by their bad breath.
<p>
The US defence department considered various non-lethal chemicals meant to disrupt enemy discipline and morale.

The 1994 plans were for a six-year project costing $7.5m, but they were  never pursued. 

<p>


The US Air Force Wright Laboratory in Dayton, Ohio, sought Pentagon funding for research into what it called "harassing, annoying and 'bad guy'-identifying chemicals". 
<p>
The plans were obtained under the US Freedom of Information by the <a href="http://www.sunshine-project.org/" target="_new">Sunshine Project</a>, a group which monitors research into chemical and biological weapons.
<p>
<b>'Who? Me?'</b>
<p>

The plan for a so-called "love bomb" envisaged an aphrodisiac chemical that would provoke widespread homosexual behaviour among troops, causing what the military called a "distasteful but completely non-lethal" blow to morale.
<p>
Scientists also reportedly considered a "sting me/attack me" chemical weapon to attract swarms of enraged wasps or angry rats towards enemy troops.
<p>
A substance to make the skin unbearably sensitive to sunlight was also pondered. 
<p>
Another idea was to develop a chemical causing "severe and lasting halitosis", so that enemy forces would be obvious even when they tried to blend in with civilians.
<p>
In a variation on that idea, researchers pondered a "Who? Me?" bomb, which would simulate flatulence in enemy ranks.
<p>
Indeed, a "Who? Me?" device had been under consideration since 1945, the government papers say. 
<p>
However, researchers concluded that the premise for such a device was fatally flawed because "people in many areas of the world do not find faecal odour offensive, since they smell it on a regular basis".
<p>
Captain Dan McSweeney of the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Directorate at the Pentagon said the defence department receives "literally hundreds" of project ideas, but that "none of the systems described in that [1994] proposal have been developed".
<p>
He told the BBC: "It's important to point out that only those proposals which are deemed appropriate, based on stringent human effects, legal, and international treaty reviews are considered for development or acquisition."
