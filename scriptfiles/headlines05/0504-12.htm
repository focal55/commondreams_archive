<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p>Support for the decision to go to war in Iraq has fallen to its lowest level since the campaign began in March 2003, according to a USA TODAY/CNN/Gallup Poll released Tuesday.

<P>The findings, made public on the same day that Iraq's first democratically elected government in 50 years was sworn in, show that 41% say the war was worth it; 57% say it wasn't.

<P>“The patience of the American public is beginning to get worn down a little bit by how long this is taking,” said Charles Pena, a military affairs analyst at the Cato Institute, a think tank in Washington. “While we have made progress … I think people are just tired of this and want it to be over.”

<P>The poll conducted Friday through Sunday asked 514 adults the question. The margin of error was +/-5 percentage points.

<P>Public support peaked as Saddam Hussein's regime fell in 2003 when 76% of those polled said the war was worth it.

<P>The latest poll shows a drop in positive feelings sparked by Iraqi elections in January. In a similar poll taken Feb. 7-10, 48% said the war had been worth waging, while 50% said it had not been. Violence declined in the weeks after the election, but insurgents launched a wave of suicide bombings and attacks in recent weeks, raising concerns that violence will continue.

<P>Among 492 adults asked whether the United States made a mistake in sending troops to Iraq in view of developments since the war began, 49% say it was a mistake, while 48% say it was not. In a poll taken Feb. 4-6, 45% said sending troops was a mistake; 55% said it was not.

<P>U.S. officials continue to cite steady progress in Iraq. Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said Tuesday that a captured letter to insurgent leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi shows “that his influence and effectiveness is deteriorating.”

<P>In Baghdad, Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari pledged to unite Iraq's ethnic and religious factions as the new government he will lead was sworn in.

<P>“You all know the heavy legacy inherited by this government. We are afflicted by corruption, lack of services, unemployment and mass graves,” al-Jaafari told lawmakers after taking the oath of office. “I would like to tell the widows and orphans … your sacrifices have not gone in vain.”

<P>Five ministries — including defense and oil — and two deputy prime minister slots remained unfilled as al-Jaafari continues efforts to bring Iraq's Sunni Muslim minority into the new regime while juggling demands of other groups.
