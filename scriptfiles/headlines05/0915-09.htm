<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --> <P>A federal judge in Sacramento ruled Wednesday that requiring children to 
recite a Pledge of Allegiance that contains the phrase "under God" in public 
schools is unconstitutional, a move that sets the stage for another Supreme 
Court showdown over the daily classroom ritual. 
<P>Reaction to the ruling by U.S. District Judge Lawrence Karlton was swift 
and widespread. Religious conservatives condemned the decision, while senators 
at the confirmation hearings of chief justice nominee John Roberts referred to 
the ruling in an attempt to gauge Roberts' views on the constitutional 
separation of church and state. 
<P>Karlton granted legal standing in the case to two families represented by 
Sacramento attorney Michael Newdow  --  an atheist who lost a previous pledge 
case before the Supreme Court last year  --  and ruled that the pledge's 
reference to one nation "under God" violates schoolchildren's right to be "free 
from a coercive requirement to affirm God."  
<P>He said he was bound in his decision by the precedent set by the Ninth 
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, which in 2002 ruled in Newdow's 
favor that the pledge is unconstitutional. However, the judge limited his 
ruling to three Sacramento-area school districts, and it would take a ruling by 
either the Ninth Circuit Court or the U.S. Supreme Court to widen its impact. 
<P>The Supreme Court dismissed the appellate court's ruling in the first 
Newdow case in June 2004, saying Newdow lacked standing because he did not have 
full custody of his elementary school daughter. The court avoided the 
constitutional question but left the door open for a suit by a parent who met 
the court's standards for legal standing, a decision that set up Wednesday's 
ruling. 
<P>"I'm passionate about treating people equally," Newdow told The Chronicle. 
"Imagine you send your kids to school every day, and the teachers made them 
stand up and say, 'We are one nation that denies God exists.' Imagine you are 
Jewish, and they say, 'We're one nation under Jesus.' Imagine you are 
Christian, and they say, 'We're one nation under Mohammad.' "  
<P>"Do you think it's a big deal? Because that's exactly what goes on against 
atheists," Newdow said. 
<P>The Washington, D.C.-based Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, a party to 
the case, immediately announced that it will appeal the decision to the Ninth 
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and to the Supreme Court if necessary. 

<P>"This decision is certainly unfortunate, but it was anticipated," said 
fund attorney Jared Leland. "We're confident from what Justices at the Supreme 
Court have suggested that 'under God' will keep its place in the Pledge of 
Allegiance." 
<P>The decision was handed down at a time when the Supreme Court's membership 
is in flux. John Roberts, who would succeed the late William Rehnquist as chief 
justice, is undergoing confirmation hearings this week. No replacement has yet 
been named for Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who announced her retirement in 
July but said she will stay on until a successor is confirmed. 
<P>It is unlikely that the case could land in the court before the 2006-07 
session. 
<P>In the Supreme Court's 5-3 ruling dismissing Newdow's case in June 2004, 
justices Rehnquist, O'Connor and Clarence Thomas said in their dissent that 
they would have upheld "under God" as constitutional. 
<P>Karlton's ruling was brought up at Roberts' confirmation hearings 
Wednesday by Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., who said he would not ask Roberts what 
he thought of the ruling because the issue might go before the Supreme Court. 
<P>But Sessions said such rulings result in part from the high court's lack 
of clarity in its decision on the tension between the constitutional ban on 
government establishment of religion and the guarantee of free exercise of 
religion. 
<P>The court's rulings in the area "could be clearer," said Roberts, citing 
the rulings earlier this year that upheld one state government's display of the 
Ten Commandments and banned another. Roberts added that the court "could 
redouble its efforts to try to come up with some consistency in its approach." 
<P>Later during the hearing, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said the pledge 
case is undermining the public's confidence in the judiciary and called the 
ruling an example of "where judges do not protect us from having religion 
imposed upon us but rather declare war on religion." 
<P>Conservative groups also swiftly criticized what they called an 
inappropriate act of judicial activism. 
<P>"This is another bad ruling that warps the U.S. Constitution and dashes 
parents' hopes of patriotism in the next generation," said Randy Thomasson, 
president of the California-based Campaign for Children and Families. "When the 
Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals delivered the craziest ruling in American 
history by striking down the pledge three years ago, the Supreme Court stepped 
in and stopped the insanity. The lower courts striking down the pledge again is 
like a dog returning to its vomit." 
<P>The original pledge, which did not include the words "under God," was 
written by Francis Bellamy, a Baptist minister's son, to commemorate the 400th 
anniversary of Christopher Columbus' arrival in America. Congress adopted the 
pledge in 1942. 
<P>The phrase "under God" was added in 1954 by legislation that recognized a 
belief that "from the time of our earliest history our peoples and our 
institutions have reflected the traditional concept that our nation was founded 
on a fundamental belief in God," according to the House Report accompanying its 
passage. 
<P>Karlton said he will sign a restraining order prohibiting the recitation 
of the pledge at Elk Grove Unified, Rio Linda and Elverta Joint Elementary 
school districts in Sacramento County, where the children of Newdow and his 
fellow plaintiffs are enrolled. 
<P>Jim Elliott, a spokesman for the Elk Grove Unified School District, said 
that students there will continue to say the pledge until the order is signed. 
<P>"We are disappointed that our district ... needs to continue to devote 
time, energy and resources to defend this case. These are resources we could 
otherwise use on our mission of teaching and learning," said Elk Grove 
Superintendent Steven Ladd.
<P><b>Breaking down the 
case </b>
<P><b>What the judge ruled:</b> A federal judge in Sacramento ruled that the 
Pledge of Allegiance's reference to one nation "under God" violates 
schoolchildren's constitutional  
right to be "free from a coercive requirement to affirm God." 

<P><b>The ruling's effect:</b> The ruling is limited to three Sacramento-area 
school districts. It would take a ruling either by the federal Court of Appeals 
in San Francisco or the Supreme Court to widen its impact. 

<P><b>Why the case was back in court:</b> The Supreme Court dismissed atheist 
Michael Newdow's case in 2004, ruling that he had no standing because he had 
only limited custody of his elementary-school-age daughter. The court left open 
the possibility of a suit by parents who met its standard. Newdow, an attorney, 
now represents those parents. 

<P><b>What's next:</b> The ruling is likely to be appealed to the same appellate 
court that ruled against the pledge in 2002.
