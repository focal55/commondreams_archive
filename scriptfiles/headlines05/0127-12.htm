After Sunday's Iraqi elections, Kennedy said President Bush  should state he intends to negotiate a timetable with the new  Iraqi government to draw down U.S. forces.<p> 
			
			At least 12,000 U.S. troops should leave at once, Kennedy  said, "to send a stronger signal about our intentions to ease  the pervasive sense of occupation."<p> 
			
			The Massachusetts Democrat, who opposed the U.S. invasion  of Iraq, became the first senator to lay out a plan for Bush to  start withdrawing troops a day after the Pentagon warned  lawmakers that strikes by insurgents may increase after  Sunday's elections.<p> 
			
			Besides ending its military presence, Kennedy said the  United States must stop making political decisions in Iraq and  turn over full authority to the United Nations to help Baghdad  set up a new government.<p> 
			
			He said an international meeting led by the United Nations  and Iraq should be convened immediately in Iraq or elsewhere in  the Middle East to start that process.<p> 
			
			"We now have no choice but to make the best we can of the  disaster we have created in Iraq," Kennedy in a speech to the  Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. "The  current course is only making the crisis worse."<p> 
			
			He said the indefinite presence of U.S. troops is "fanning  the flames of conflict" in what has become "a war against the  U.S. occupation."<p> 
			
			The Republican National Committee criticized the Senate's  leading liberal for delivering "such an overtly pessimistic  message only days before the Iraqi election."<p> 
			
			"Kennedy's partisan political attack stands in stark  contrast to President Bush's vision of spreading freedom around  the world," RNC spokesman Brian Jones said.<p> 
			
			Kennedy emphasized that Bush must also make it clear that  the United States does not intend to have a long-term presence,  and announce that it will dramatically reduces its embassy in  Baghdad, which is the largest in the world.<p> 
			
			While many in the Republican-led Senate have expressed  dismay as the death toll of U.S. troops stands at more than  1,400, Kennedy is the first to lay out a plan for a troop  withdrawal, his office said.<p> 
			
			In the Republican-led House of Representatives, 24  Democrats this week introduced a resolution calling on Bush to  begin an immediate pullout.<p> 
			
			The administration has refused to offer a timetable for  pulling troops, and Bush on Wednesday said the United States  would remain until the new government can defend itself.<p> 
			
			Democrats like Kennedy have been the strongest critics of  the war but many Republicans are also concerned, in part  because Iraq is costing more than $1 billion a week and has put  a great strain on America's military and its budget.
