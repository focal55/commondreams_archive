<p>WASHINGTON  - The Bush administration is preparing
plans for possible lifetime detention of suspected terrorists,
including hundreds whom the government does not have enough
evidence to charge in courts, The Washington Post <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A41475-2005Jan1?language=printer" target="_new">reported</a>
Sunday.

  
<p>
 Citing intelligence, defense and diplomatic officials, the
newspaper said the Pentagon  and the CIA  had asked the White
House to decide on a more permanent approach for those it would
not set free or turn over to courts at home or abroad.
 <p>
 As part of a solution, the Defense Department, which holds
500 prisoners at Guantanamo Bay, plans to ask the U.S. Congress
for &#36;25 million to build a 200-bed prison to hold detainees who
are unlikely to ever go through a military tribunal for lack of
evidence, defense officials told the newspaper.
 <p>
 The new prison, dubbed Camp 6, would allow inmates more
comfort and freedom than they have now, and would be designed
for prisoners the government believes have no more intelligence
to share, The Post said.
 <p>
 "It would be modeled on a U.S. prison and would allow
socializing among inmates," the paper said.
 <p>

 "Since global war on terror is a long-term effort, it makes
sense for us to be looking at solutions for long-term
problems," Bryan Whitman, a Pentagon spokesman, was quoted as
saying. "This has been evolutionary, but we are at a point in
time where we have to say, 'How do you deal with them in the
long term?"'
 <p>
 A Pentagon spokeswoman, Lt. Col. Ellen Krenke of the Air
Force, had no information on the reported plan.
 <p>
 The Post said the outcome of a review under way would also
affect those expected to be captured in the course of future
counterterrorism operations.
 <p>
 One proposal would transfer large numbers of Afghan, Saudi
and Yemeni detainees from the U.S. military's Guantanamo Bay,
Cuba, detention center into new U.S.-built prisons in their
home countries, it said.
 <p>
 The prisons would be operated by those countries, but the
State Department, where this idea originated, would ask them to
abide by recognized human rights standards and would monitor
compliance, a senior administration official was quoted as
saying.</p>
