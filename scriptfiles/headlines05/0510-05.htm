<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p>WASHINGTON -- Breaking party lines, former Gov. Howard Dean said Monday he supports Rep. Bernard Sanders' bid for the U.S. Senate, saying the Independent makes a "strong candidate."

<P>"A victory for Bernie Sanders is a win for Democrats," Dean said in a telephone interview Monday.

<P>Sen. James Jeffords, I-Vt., announced last month he would not seek re-election, clearing the way for what's expected to be a crowded race in fall 2006.

<P>But Dean, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, added that his support is not unconditional.

<P>"We've got a few things to work out with Bernie," he said, adding, "Bernie's not a Democrat."

<P>Dean, the outspoken former presidential candidate whose aspirations for the White House abruptly ended during the primary more than a year ago, refused to describe Sanders' shortcomings in the eyes of Democrats.

<P>"I'd rather tell him in person," Dean said.

<P>Sanders' practice of voting with House Democrats and his name recognition - bolstered by his position as the only U.S. representative in Vermont - makes him appealing to Democrats desperate to regain seats in every branch of government.

<P>"Sanders is a strong candidate," Dean said.

<P>Jeff Weaver, Sanders' chief of staff and campaign spokesman, said the congressman won't formally announce his candidacy until "much later this year."

<P>But Weaver said Dean's support is natural in a political atmosphere dominated by conservative voices.

<P>"I think Gov. Dean and Congressman Sanders share an interest in beating back a very aggressive reactionary agenda of President Bush and congressional Republicans," Weaver said. "We intend to win this seat and Bernie will be a strong voice against the Bush agenda."

<P>Weaver said the campaign will lean heavily on Democratic volunteers and supporters, but also on groups not necessarily aligned with a political party. He mentioned working families, farmers, senior citizens and veterans.

<P>"This is going to be in many ways a historic grass roots campaign for Vermont," Weaver said.

<P>Jim Barnett, chairman of the state Republican committee, criticized the new alliance, saying it raises questions about whether "backroom deals" are being made between Dean and Sanders.

<P>"This is exactly the kind of cynical politics that Bernie Sanders once said was corrupt," Barnett said.

<P>Weaver, calling Barnett a "White House protégé" and a "Karl Rove character," said, "He can throw his bombs and we'll do our work for the people."
