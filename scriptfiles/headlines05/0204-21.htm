<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON -- U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld conceded yesterday that fears he could be charged as a war criminal may keep him from a conference in Germany set for next week.

<p>A lawsuit filed by the New York-based <a href="http://www.ccr-ny.org/" target="_new">Center for Constitutional Rights</a> with German prosecutors accuses Rumsfeld and other senior U.S. officials with war crimes for their part in the Abu Ghraib prison torture scandal.

<p>Until Rumsfeld was asked about the possibility at a news briefing, the Pentagon had maintained it was merely a scheduling conflict which could prevent him from attending the Munich Conference on Security Policy, an annual event which draws top defense officials from all over the world.

<p>German law allows charges to be laid in war crimes and human rights cases regardless of the nationality of the accused, but because the United States is not a member of the International Criminal Court, charges cannot be laid in this country.

<p>"It's something that we have to take into consideration,'' Rumsfeld said.

<p>"Whether I end up there we'll soon know. It'll be a week and we'll find out.''

<p>The Center for Constitutional Rights filed a complaint last Nov. 30 naming 10 U.S. officials, including Rumsfeld.

<p>This week, they added the name of newly minted Attorney-General Alberto Gonzales to the complaint.

<p>The Center has won important legal challenges on the treatment of detainees at Guantanamo Bay and has also filed suit against former attorney-general John Ashcroft for his role in the arrest and detention in Syria of Canadian Maher Arar.

<p>Center president Michael Ratner said Rumsfeld's threats not to attend the conference are merely a bid to bully the Germans into dropping the case.

<p>"We believe that Donald Rumsfeld cannot escape accountability for his alleged crimes," he said.

<p>Last night, on CNN's Larry King Live, Rumsfeld revealed that he twice offered his resignation to U.S. President George W. Bush when the Abu Ghraib scandal broke last spring.

<p>"I told him he ought to make the decision as to whether or not I should stay on," Bush said. "He did make that decision and he did want me to stay on.'<P align="CENTER">&copy; 2005 Toronto Star<p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable --></font></td></tr>
