<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p>An anti-Bush protester has sued several police officers,     accusing them of violating his free-speech rights after he was arrested     last year for carrying a sign that read, &quot;No more Bush-it.&quot;    <p>      Chris Kelly, 43, filed the federal lawsuit Wednesday against officer       David Weaver, 37, 10 unidentified officers and an unidentified       supervisor of the Houston Police Department.    </p><p>      Kelly was holding the cardboard sign near a crowd of Houston Astros       baseball fans on Oct. 18 when police approached him. Police handcuffed       him, put him into a police car and drove through downtown before       releasing him without explanation, the lawsuit alleges.    </p><p>      A municipal judge later dismissed the misdemeanor citation.    </p><p>      The lawsuit asks U.S. District Judge Kenneth Hoyt to declare that       Kelly's rights were violated under the U.S. and Texas constitutions.    </p><p>      Kelly, represented by the Texas Civil Rights Project, said he filed the       lawsuit &quot;so that I and other Houstonians can feel free to express our       political views about our government without the threat of assault and       arrest and bogus prosecution by the police.&quot;    </p><p>      Police spokesman Alvin Wright said Weaver could not comment because he       had not been served with the lawsuit.    </p><p>      Jim Harrington, director of the Texas Civil Rights Project, said Kelly's       arrest was part of a pattern in Texas of discouraging protests against       the president.    </p><p>      Similar incidents include five protesters who were jailed two years ago       as they headed to protest the Iraq war at Bush's ranch. The city of       Crawford agreed to a $43,000 settlement in the case.    </p><p>      And in a case pending in Travis County, protesters are suing Austin       police for keeping them from crossing a street to reach the front of the       Governor's Mansion in 2001, Harrington said.    </p><p align="CENTER">&copy; 2005 Associated Press</p><p align="CENTER">###</p><!-- #EndEditable --></font></td></tr>
