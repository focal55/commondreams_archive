<p>ABUJA, Nigeria   - Many Africans, accustomed to humanitarian 
disasters on their own continent, feel empathy toward Americans 
suffering in the wake of hurricane Katrina and share their 
disappointment at the U.S. government's response.</p>
<p> Opinions vary about whether there was an element of racism 
in why it took days to get basic aid to Katrina's mostly poor, 
black victims, but there is unanimous solidarity with the 
bereaved and the homeless of the U.S. Gulf Coast.</p>
<p> "It's disastrous, it's devastating, I feel so sorry for 
these people," said Abdulwahab Garba, a pump attendant at a 
filling station in the Nigerian capital Abuja, waving a copy of 
a newspaper with a front-page picture from the disaster zone.</p>
<p> "If I had money I would have contributed for food and 
shelter. I don't have money, but my assistance is to pray for 
them," he said.</p>
<p> Many Liberians, whose country was founded by freed American 
slaves more than 150 years ago and who still feel close links 
with the United States, said they felt Washington had not done 
enough to help those in need.</p>
<p> "I feel very sad about the situation in New Orleans at this 
time. It looks like a conflict in Africa. The U.S. as a 
superpower should have done more to solve the situation," said 
Edith Thompson, a restaurant owner in the capital Monrovia.</p>
<p> In Rwanda, where an estimated 800,000 ethnic Tutsis and 
moderate Hutus died in a 1994 genocide, university lecturer 
Emmanuel Kamasa saw racism behind the slow response to Katrina.</p>
<p> "I think failure by the U.S. government to respond 
instantly is related to the fact that the affected area is 
dominated by the blacks," he said.</p>
<p> The view was echoed by others across the continent, 
although there were just as many who disagreed. January 
Makamba, a civil servant in Tanzania, blamed bureaucracy, not 
prejudice.</p>
<p> "The slow pace in response we have seen after Katrina was 
due to institutional constraints. I don't buy the racial line. 
I can liken bureaucracy to asking an elephant to do 
gymnastics," he said.

<p> RICH AND POOR EQUAL</p>
<p> Some said they could see why looting would happen in a poor 
African country but were startled to see people in the world's 
superpower doing it.</p>
<p> "For them as a great nation, I was surprised by the 
looting. You expect people to pull together," said George 
Sempa, a telecoms worker in the Ugandan capital Kampala.</p>
<p> Saida Luguga, a Tanzanian charity worker, said footage from 
the Gulf Coast showed that Americans and Africans were equal.</p>
<p> "What I see on TV, people carrying their most important 
belongings and fleeing, it's the same as anywhere in Africa," 
she said.</p>
<p> Many Africans concluded that wealth and power were simply 
not enough in the face of a natural catastrophe like Katrina.</p>
<p> "The floods in the U.S. are a natural event that transcends 
America's power. Despite all their technology and money, they 
weren't able to do much," said Samba Thiam, a student in the 
Senegalese capital Dakar where the worst flooding in 20 years 
have brought chaos in the last few weeks.</p>
<p> Jacki Randindrarison, secretary-general of Madagascar's 
national emergency council dealing with cyclones and floods 
that regularly hit the Indian Ocean island, saw lessons to be 
learned from Katrina.</p>
<p> "It is not enough to have a warning system. You need to 
sensitize people to take warnings seriously. Tell them: 'Forget 
your attachments, you need to get out."'</p>
