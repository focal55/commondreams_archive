"We live in a great country and we all love our country very much, and I am so amazed that you did this, the people of America, that you voted for this film," Moore said as he accepted it.
<p>The movie, which became the best-selling documentary of all time, beat out "Spiderman 2," "Shrek 2", "The Incredibles" and "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind."
<p>"I love making movies and I'll take this as an invitation to make more Fahrenheit 9/11s," Moore said of his unabashedly partisan look at the handling of the September 11, 2001 terror attacks and the US war in Iraq that mercilessly flays President George W. Bush.
<p>Viewers crowned Mel Gibson' religious epic "The Passion of the Christ" favorite movie drama, while animated sequel "Shrek 2" won favorite movie comedy.
<p>Gibson thanked fans for making a success out of the film he personally funded after failing to find backers. The controversial account of the brutal final days of Jesus Christ's life raked in more than 370 million dollars in North America, becoming the ninth best performing film of all time.

<p>Comic Ellen DeGeneres beat out Oprah Winfrey as favorite daytime talk show host and was also dubbed favorite funny female star. Fans of the late night gabfests picked David Letterman as their favorite host.
<p>Jason Alexander, known for his portrayal of George Costanza on "Seinfeld," and Malcolm-Jamal Warner, one of Bill Cosby's television sons on "The Cosby Show," emceed the program from the Pasadena Civic Auditorium.
<p>Former "Friends" actor Matt LeBlanc was voted favorite male TV star and his new vehicle, "Joey," won best new TV comedy. The sexy new show "Desperate Housewives" was the top new TV drama.
