        <!--/endimage/--> The ambitious, behind-the-scenes plan was passed to The Independent this 
  week, just as 189 countries are painfully trying to agree the second stage 
  of Kyoto at the UN climate conference in Montreal. It was pitched to 
  companies such as Ford Europe, Lufthansa and the German utility giant RWE.
</p>

<p>
  Put together by a lobbyist who is a senior official at a group partly funded 
  by ExxonMobil, the world's biggest oil company and a fierce opponent of 
  anti-global warming measures, the plan seeks to draw together major 
  international companies, academics, think-tanks, commentators, journalists 
  and lobbyists from across Europe into a powerful grouping to destroy further 
  EU support for the treaty.
</p>
<p>
  It details just how the so-called "European Sound Climate Policy 
  Coalition" would work. Based in Brussels, the plan would have 
  anti-Kyoto position papers, expert spokesmen, detailed advice and networking 
  instantly available to any politician or company who wanted to question the 
  wisdom of proceeding with Kyoto and its demanding cuts in carbon dioxide 
  emissions.
</p>
<p>
  It has been drawn up by Chris Horner, a senior official with the 
  Washington-based Competitive Enterprise Institute and a veteran campaigner 
  against Kyoto and against the evidence of climate change. One of his 
  colleagues &shy; who describes himself as an adviser to President George Bush &shy; 
  was the subject of a censure motion by the Commons last year after he 
  attacked the Government's chief scientist.
</p>
<p>

  Mr Horner, whose CEI group has received almost $1.5m (&pound;865,000) from 
  ExxonMobil, is convinced that Europe could be successfully influenced by 
  such a policy coalition just as the US government has been.
</p>
<p>
  He thinks Europe's weakening economies are likely to be increasingly ill at 
  ease with the costs of meeting Kyoto. And in particular, he has spotted 
  something he thinks most of Europe has not yet woken up to. Most of the 
  original 15 EU Kyoto signatories &shy; Britain is an exception &shy; are on course 
  to miss their 2010 CO2 reduction targets. But under the terms of the treaty, 
  they will face large fines for doing so, in terms of much bigger reduction 
  targets in any second phase.
</p>
<p>
  These will prove unacceptably costly to their economies, Mr Horner believes, 
  even if they try to buy their way out by buying up "spare" 
  emissions for cash from countries such as Russia. Mr Horner believes the 
  moment for his coalition is at hand and has been seeking support for it from 
  multinational companies. In his pitch to one major company, he wrote: "
  In the US an informal coalition has helped successfully to avert adoption of 
  a Kyoto-style programme by maintaining a rational voice for civil society 
  and ensuring a legitimate debate over climate economics, science and 
  politics. This model should be emulated... to guide similar efforts in 
  Europe."
</p>
<p>

  Elsewhere he claimed: "A coalition addressing the economic and social 
  impacts of the EU climate agenda must be broad-based (cross industry) and 
  rooted in the member states. Other companies (including Lufthansa, Exxon, 
  Ford) have already indicated their interest!" 
</p>
<p>
  Last night green groups hit out. Kert Davies, Greenpeace's climate campaign 
  co-ordinator, which initially obtained the documents, said: "These are 
  the hitmen for the Bush administration and the likes of Exxon. They are 
  behind the scenes doing the dirty work. They are extending efforts to Europe 
  where they are trying to undermine the momentum to solve global warming."</p>
<p>
  While there is nothing illegal about the lobbying, the documents reveal a 
  rare insight into the well-funded efforts within the US to influence opinion 
  at senior levels of European corporations. Campaigners say the campaign is 
  similar to a notorious lobbying effort carried out during the 1990s to 
  undermine support for Kyoto within the US. 
</p>
<p>
  The revelation comes as international negotiators in Montreal are discussing 
  the next step within Kyoto and the possibility of introducing new emissions 
  targets. The Bush administration &shy; which has rejected the treaty &shy; has 
  insisted it will not agree to any measures that legally bind it to reduce 
  emissions. Mr Horner has been present this week in Montreal.

</p>
<p>
  When contacted by The Independent, Mr Horner confirmed the strategy document 
  was the draft of a presentation he sent to RWE. He defended his lobbying 
  effort saying "that is what I do". He said he simply promoted a 
  point of view, as did Greenpeace. "I don't begrudge them what they do 
  [but] they begrudge me what I do," he said.
</p>
<p>
  Asked if he thought it was appropriate for a major American oil company to 
  be funding a lobbyist targeting European companies, he replied: "
  Everybody else does." But Mr Horner, who is also a senior figure within 
  the Cool Heads Coalition, a group that questions the evidence of global 
  warming and opposes any policies to "ration" energy, claimed his 
  efforts to influence opinion in Europe had been unsuccessful. He said RWE 
  had not taken up the suggestions contained within his presentation, and that 
  other companies had also rejected his ideas.
</p>
<p>
  "I don't know why it's surprising [I have lobbied European companies],"
 he said. "What is surprising to me is why it's not working." Ford 
  and RWE confirmed that they and other companies had met Mr Horner and other 
  advocates in Brussels last February. He had not been paid any fee nor had 
  they contributed to his expenses. Mr Horner apparently travelled to Europe 
  at the request of the European Enterprise Industry, a fledgling group hoping 
  to emulate the CEI.
</p>
<p>
  Bill McAndrews, a spokesman for RWE, said: "He met with [us and] other 
  German companies in Brussels. Brussels is the EU capital, there are a lot of 
  people who come to meet. We have not approached him since then." He 
  added: "RWE talks to all sorts of people. We talk with Greenpeace and 
  the World Wildlife Fund. We discuss matters with all opinions. It's 
  important to hear everybody's side on such a global issue. It does not mean 
  that RWE shares that opinion." 
</p>

<p>
  In a statement, ExxonMobil, said: "The notion adopted by some groups 
  ... that only their views and only their funding and lobbying are acceptable 
  is, in our opinion, not helpful to the debates vital to developing good 
  public policy." 
</p>
<p>
  Adrian Schmitt, a spokesman for Ford Europe, said Mr Horner had met with 
  company representatives on one occasion "at a Brussels level". He 
  insisted that Ford had not supported Mr Horner's opinions. "Exactly the 
  opposite. Our position is that climate change is a serious issue and 
  appropriate steps need to be taken now."
</p>
<p>
  He said that the company had been one of the first companies to withdraw its 
  support for the Global Climate Coalition &shy; a now-defunct lobbying effort 
  that worked to oppose US reductions in greenhouse gas emissions during the 
  late Nineties.
