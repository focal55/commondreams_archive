<p>University of Cincinnati College Democrats are planning to protest the  appearance Tuesday of William J. Bennett, the former education secretary who said on his radio show that the country's crime rate would drop if every black baby were aborted.</p>

 Bennett's UC appearance, hosted by the College Republicans, had been in the works well before the controversy. College Republicans chairman Kevin Welch said his group wanted to bring a prominent conservative speaker to campus to counter the liberal speakers who have visited there, including filmmaker Michael Moore, who stopped by last October.
<p>Bennett's comments Wednesday on his "Morning in America" call-in show drew sharp criticism from the NAACP and high-ranking Democrats including Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, who demanded Bennett apologize.</p>
<p>But the anti-abortion Bennett told Fox News Thursday that his remarks  - made during a discussion with a caller who suggested that abortions have led to a drop in tax revenue  - have been twisted, "as if I am supporting such a monstrous idea, which of course I don't."</p>
<p>Bennett told the caller: "I do know that it's true that if you wanted to reduce crime, you could  - if that were your sole purpose  - you could abort every black baby in this country, and your crime rate would go down. That would be an impossible, ridiculous, and morally reprehensible thing to do, but your crime rate would go down. So these far-out, these far-reaching, extensive extrapolations are, I think, tricky."</p>
<p>Welch said a student's parent is paying for the speaker. He didn't know how much Bennett was charging.</p>
<p>Until Wednesday, Bennett's appearance wasn't creating much of a stir on campus. Democratic students had no plans to protest the conservative author and talk-show host, said College Democrats President Erich Streckfuss.</p>
<p>But the comments sent college Democrats scrambling to set up a protest outside Tangeman University Center, where Bennett is set to speak at 7:30 p.m. in Great Hall.</p>
<p>"I think it's horrible to say that an entire race of people shouldn't have been born," Streckfuss said.</p>
<p>Before his speech, Bennett is scheduled to attend a reception held by Hamilton County Commissioner Phil Heimlich and his Promoting Issues Today group.</p>
<p>Heimlich, who thinks Bennett's comments are being taken out of context, said he has no plans to cancel the event.</p>
<p>Neither do the College Republicans.</p>
<p>Welch, who calls the uproar over Bennett's comments "the latest example of political correctness run amok," said his group is excited that a conservative speaker is drawing such attention. He said he hopes the Democrats will stop in and listen.</p>
