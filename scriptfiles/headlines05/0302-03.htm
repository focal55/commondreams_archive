<p> Urging the United States to embrace "debt relief," Kenya's Nobel Peace Prize winner said Tuesday that the Bush administration should forgive the tens of millions of dollars that her country owes to U.S. coffers.

<P>Wangari Maathai, who won the first Peace Prize ever awarded to an environmentalist, said Kenya's indebtedness to the United States and other Western countries was a major reason Kenya was suffering economically. She said Kenya's former leader, Daniel arap Moi, who ruled over the country from 1978 to 2002, had siphoned off many millions of dollars in aid from the United States and other developed countries -- and that world leaders who had done business with Moi knew he was corrupt.

<P>"The people who are really being punished (for Kenya's debt) are the poor people who never received that money to begin with," Maathai said in an interview with The Chronicle during a visit to San Francisco. "Those who did business with our leaders knew they were corrupt, that they were not delivering services, that the money was quite often stolen and stashed away. Yet when you request cancellation (of debts), people want to pretend that you got that money."

<P>Two weeks ago, the United States rejected proposals initiated by Britain and France that would relieve 100 percent of the estimated $50 billion in debt that Africa owes to the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and other international financial institutions. The United States is the biggest contributor to the World Bank and the IMF. The British and French proposals, made at a G-8 finance ministers meeting in London, would pay off Africa's debt by using the IMF's gold reserves and money from new bonds.

<P>Kenya's external debt is estimated at $9 billion. The country reportedly spends about 40 percent of its annual budget to pay interest on that debt.

<P>"The debt issue needs to be addressed," Maathai said in the interview.

<P>Since winning the Nobel Prize in October, Maathai, 64, has used her prominence to speak out about issues she believes are crucial to the future of not just Africa, but the world. The environmentalist founded Kenya's Green Belt Movement, which has planted 30 million trees in the past 28 years.

<P>The tree-planting campaign, says Maathai, has helped scores of Kenyan women gain employment, reforested large swaths of the country and demonstrated to Kenyans and other Africans that there's a deep connection between the environment, the economy and peace. Wars are often fought over natural resources, she notes, pointing to the current conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where diamonds and timber have become the booty of rival factions.

<P>In addition to the Nobel Peace Prize, she has won many other awards, including the Goldman Prize, an annual award for grassroots environmentalists that was started by San Francisco philanthropist Richard N. Goldman, who introduced her Tuesday at a speech to a crowd of several hundred people, sponsored by the World Affairs Council of Northern California.

<P>At the event at the Fairmont Hotel, Goldman called her a role model for her activism. Maathai has endured arrests and beatings at the hands of Kenyan police for her public protests. In 1989, she led a movement against a proposal by Moi to build Africa's largest skyscraper in Nairobi. The daughter of a peasant farmer, Maathai became the first woman in East Africa to earn a Ph.D. (in 1971, at the University of Nairobi).

<P>"Do not feel overwhelmed, do not feel discouraged," she said, when asked a question by the audience about her philosophy. "Do not feel discouraged if some people have ratified the Kyoto protocol and others have not."

<P>Maathai's comment was an indirect reference to the Bush administration's rejection of the Kyoto clean-air protocols.

<P>In her interview with The Chronicle, Maathai said she would like to meet with Washington officials sometime in the next year to discuss issues surrounding trade and the environment.

<P>"Africa needs aid," she said, "but it ought to be given adequate aid. ... There are certain countries that aren't paying their debt anyway because they can't do it. ... While African governments are working very hard to remove corruption, to respect democratic space and respect human rights, it's very important for governments that have the power to provide (money), and America is definitely in that position."
