TORONTO<b> - </b>The powerful hurricane, with a storm surge of waters topping six metres,
flooded an estimated 230,000 square kilometres in the southern U.S. states
of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama on August 29.
<br>
<br>
Katrina altered coastlines, wiped out fisheries, destroyed 1.75 million
hectares of timber and left a toxic mess of oil spills and waste in the city
of New Orleans and many other places.
<br><br>
"It's been impossible to get people on the ground in order to assess the
extent of the damage," said Clint Jeske, a wildlife biologist at National
Wetlands Research Centre, based in Lafayette, Louisiana.
<br><br>
Until recently, all available boats and aircraft were involved in rescue
efforts, and now security and safety concerns have restricted access, Jeske
told Tierramérica.
<br><br>
However, satellite photos reveal that at least 52 square km of coastal
wetlands and a number of offshore barrier islands in the Gulf of Mexico have
entirely disappeared. Some of the barrier islands are wildlife refuges and
important bird areas, especially for neo-tropical migrating species that
spend the northern hemisphere autumn and winter in Mexico, Central America
and South America.
<br><br>

"Shorebirds were on their way south. They probably took a huge hit from the
storm," Jeske said.
<br><br>
In flooded New Orleans there is hardly a bird left alive. The few that Jeske
saw while involved in evacuation efforts last week were "all beat up".
<br><br>
"It was really strange to see a pigeon falling out the sky into the water,"
he said. Any surviving birds are starving or sick from drinking the polluted
floodwaters, he said.
<br><br>
Millions of litres of New Orleans' contaminated floodwaters are being pumped
into nearby Lake Pontchartrain with the full knowledge it will damage marine
life. Louisiana's Department of Environment says it expects large numbers of
fish to die but fully supports the pumping.
<br><br>
Lake Pontchartrain is actually a huge estuary that opens directly into the
Gulf of Mexico, so there are fears that contaminants will hurt the marine
life in the Gulf.
<br><br>
New Orleans is not only a major port and supplier of 30 percent of seafood
to the United States, it is one the world's largest oil and petro-chemical
centres.
<br><br>
With about 140 large refineries and chemical plants, the area is responsible
for nearly 30 percent of U.S. oil, 20 percent of its natural gas and a large
percentage of chemicals, including fertilisers.
<br><br>
"You couldn't pick a worse place to be hit by a major hurricane," said Alan
Covich, director of the Institute of Ecology at the University of Georgia.
<br><br>
Katrina was an exceptional hurricane with powerful winds and an enormous
storm surge, said Covich who has studied the effects of hurricanes on the
environment.

<br><br>
"There's been no storm of this scale in the United States before," Covich
told Tierramérica.
<br><br>
The U.S. Coast Guard has said that 26 large oil drilling platforms in the
Gulf of Mexico were missing and about another 20 had sustained damage.
<br><br>
An unknown number of refineries and chemical plants, storage tanks and
shipping containers were damaged, along with many thousands of kilometres of
oil and gas pipelines.
<br><br>
Two major oil spills have been identified so far. A 13.5-million-litre spill
from leaking refinery storage tanks contaminates much of the town of
Chalmette and surrounding wetlands.
<br><br>
Another set of ruptured storage tanks at the mouth of the Mississippi River
has dumped an estimated 12 million litres of crude oil into the surrounding
wetlands and Gulf according to the Louisiana Department of Environment.
<br><br>
There are likely other spills of oil, gasoline, diesel and chemicals
throughout the region, but until all the floodwaters are gone it will be
impossible to verify.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, most scientists are being prevented by the military
patrolling the hurricane-damaged area from investigating on their own,
Covich said.
<br><br>
Officials at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have done
limited water sampling and not found contaminants in New Orleans floodwaters
other than very high levels of lead and bacteria.
<br><br>

That result surprises most experts -- and the EPA stresses that the data is
preliminary.
<br><br>
The agency is under criticism for taking two weeks to release those results
and for not making public the many damage and spill reports it received from
oil and chemical companies.
<br><br>
"I'm surprised the EPA is not doing more," said Covich. "The economic
recovery is tied to the ecological recovery of the region."
<br><br>
He worries the federal government is failing to take the lead in a prompt
scientific assessment of the environmental issues.
<br><br>
"There are a huge range of environmental impacts from the storm," says David
Shaw, director of the GeoResources Institute at Mississippi State
University.
<br><br>
While Mississippi does not have as much floodwater as low-lying Louisiana,
it took the worst of the storm surge, which has left piles of debris four
metres high all along its coast.
<br><br>
"Disposing of the debris is a major problem," Shaw told Tierramérica.
Burning debris has been banned because of an ongoing drought and the
millions of downed trees.
<br><br>
Beaches are gone, a thick layer of mud covers everything for several
kilometres inland and much of the groundwater is contaminated, either by
salt or bacteria, he said.
<br><br>
Fish kills have been reported in lakes and rivers and the entire fishery
along the Gulf may have been wiped out. Boats and ports were destroyed along
with shrimp and oyster beds.

<br><br>
"We will feel the effects of this storm for another 15 years," Shaw said.
