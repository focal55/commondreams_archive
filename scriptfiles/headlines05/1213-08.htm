<P>KUALA LUMPUR - Myanmar has bowed to pressures and agreed to release pro-democracy leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, a top Philippine official said Tuesday.
<p>Myanmar Prime Minister General Soe Win “accepted it [Suu Kyi’s release]” as he pledged to take concrete steps toward democracy in his country, the official told reporters covering the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit here.</p><p>The ASEAN has recently abandoned its policy of non-interference in the internal affairs of member states and pressed Myanmar’s ruling junta to release Suu Kyi from house arrest and institute democratic reforms in the country ruled by a military junta for close to two decades.</p><p>At the same time, Myanmar was open to President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo's suggestion to bring the issue before the United Nations Security Council to give Yangon a chance to explain its side on the issue, the official who refused to be named said.</p><p>Myanmar's refusal to embrace reforms or free Suu Kyi dominated discussions within the 10-nation bloc, which had pressed Yangon to demonstrate actual progress on the ground.</p><p>The official said Arroyo and Soe Win had discussed about Myanmar’s situation "lengthily and seriously” at least twice at the sidelines of the 11th ASEAN Summit here.</p><p>ASEAN leaders on Monday agreed to send an envoy to Myanmar to look for signs that the military rulers are taking steps towards democracy.</p><p>Since Myanmar joined the bloc in 1997 -- with strong support from Malaysia -- the international community has criticized ASEAN for defending Myanmar despite its lack of progress toward democracy and improved human rights.</p><p>Suu Kyi, the 1991 Nobel Peace laureate, and her deputy Tin Oo, have been detained since May 2003 when a pro-government mob attacked her and her followers as she toured northern Myanmar. Her house arrest was extended by six months in November.</p><p>Myanmar's current junta has been in power since 1988. It called elections in 1990 but refused to hand over power when Suu Kyi's party won a landslide victory, saying the country first needed a new constitution.</p><p>In 2003, the junta unveiled a seven-point road map toward democracy and convened a National Convention to draw guidelines for the new constitution, but no timetable has been set to complete the task.
