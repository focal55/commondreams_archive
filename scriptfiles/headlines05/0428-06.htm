<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p>WASHINGTON -- Dozens of Republicans who have received sizable campaign donations from Representative Tom DeLay's political action committee have also donated to his legal defense fund, in a few cases making the contributions within months of receiving their campaign checks.

<P>There is no evidence that House members were pressured to pitch in or invited to make donations to Mr. DeLay with the promise of reciprocity. But Mr. Delay, the House majority leader, has benefited from the generosity of peers he helped elect with his Americans for a Republican Majority PAC, campaign finance records show.

<P>In February 2004, Representative Dana Rohrabacher, Republican of California, took in $5,000 from Armpac for his re-election bid. Between October and December of the same year, Mr. Rohrabacher gave $5,000 to the Legal Expense Trust that Mr. DeLay is using to pay for lawyers' fees related to inquiries about his fund-raising and overseas travel.

<P>Representative E. Clay Shaw Jr., of Florida has received $30,000 from Armpac over the last three election cycles, including $5,000 in June 2004. He returned the sentiment last fall, giving $5,000 to the DeLay legal fund in the final quarter of 2004.

<P>"Congressman DeLay has worked hard to strengthen and maintain a Republican majority in the House, and he's also appreciative of the support he's received in fending off this barrage of attacks from the Democrats and their allies," Dan Allen, a spokesman for Mr. DeLay, said Wednesday night. He said he had not had a chance to review the data in question.

<P>Several of the House donors to Mr. DeLay's legal fund defended the practice, citing their longstanding ties to him. Several have accused the Texas prosecutor, Ronnie Earle, a Democrat, of running an overzealous partisan inquiry to destroy Mr. DeLay and cited their anger over the inquiry as one reason for making a donation to the DeLay legal fund.

<P>Altogether, about 53 current and former House lawmakers have a similar give-and-take relationship with Mr. DeLay, contributing some $200,000 to his legal fund since 2000. There is nothing illegal about the donations on either side. And the bulk of the new donations to Mr. DeLay's defense fund, which has collected nearly $1 million since it was created in 2000, occurred in the latter part of last year.

<P>Watchdog groups and nonprofit organizations that track campaign finance say any donations made in such close proximity could be construed as an effort to circumvent legal restrictions on contributions, capped at $5,000 per individual a year.

<P>"I think the House ethics committee would frown on the practice, if in fact it was earmarked for the legal fund," said Jan Baran, a prominent Republican elections lawyer.

<P>The Texas contributor-recipients included: Representative Michael Burgess, who received $15,000 in 2002 and 2003 from the DeLay political fund-raising operation and gave $5,000 to the DeLay legal fund in 2004; Representative Kenny E. Marchant, who received $10,000 in April 2004 and gave $5,000 in the first quarter of 2005; Representative John Carter, who received $20,000 in 2002 and 2003 and gave $5,000 in 2004; and Representative Henry Bonilla, who got $10,000 in 2002 and gave $10,000 in 2004, in addition to the $5,000 he gave in 2001.

<P>"Congressman Carter was a judge in central Texas for over 20 years and has a long history and knowledge of Ronnie Earle," said Gretchen Hamel, the communications director for Mr. Carter. She said the congressman believes Mr. DeLay "was wrongfully accused, and felt compelled to give to Tom DeLay's defense fund." About 260 House candidates have received a total of about $2.7 million from Mr. DeLay's political action committee from 2000 to 2004, according to PoliticalMoneyLine, which tracks campaign finance. A separate advocacy group, Public Citizen, did an analysis of the defense fund, which showed that about 20 percent of those also gave to the Mr. DeLay's legal fund. The defense fund reaped about $200,000 from that smaller group of Republican House members, who had received almost $700,000 for their campaigns.

<P>"There's no correlation between the two," said Rebecca Rudman, press secretary for Mr. Rohrabacher. "My boss is one of the people out there batting for DeLay. He's had his disagreements, but when it comes down to it, he's a big supporter. I think that's what spurred it more than anything was seeing people coming after him on potentially false premises."

<P>But Melanie Sloan, director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said that if money were donated from the political action committee to candidates with the expectation that some portion would be skimmed off and returned to the DeLay legal fund, "that would not be okay."

<P>"You're not allowed to make a conduit contribution," she said.

<P>Representative Tom Cole, Republican of Oklahoma, received $15,000 in the last two election cycles and gave $5,000 to the DeLay fund in late summer of 2004.

<P>Perhaps more notably, Mr. Cole sits on the House Ethics Committee, one of five Republicans on the panel, all of whom have either received or given money to Mr. DeLay. The panel members' donations to his defense were reported in USA Today on Wednesday.

<P>A spokeswoman for Mr. Cole, Julie Shutley, said there was no correlation between Mr. Cole's campaign funds and his donations to Mr. DeLay's defense. "During the 2004 election cycle, Congressman Cole also contributed to over 40 other Republican candidates as well as numerous other Republican organizations," she said, including the National Republican Congressional Committee and the national party. "Congressman Cole's contribution should be seen in that context."
