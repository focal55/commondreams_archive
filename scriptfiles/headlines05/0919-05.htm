<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->TINLEY PARK, Illinois - Farm Aid staged  its 20th annual benefit concert on Sunday, with a galaxy of  stars pledging help for overlooked rural victims of Hurricane  Katrina.
<p></p> The daylong show at an outdoor arena south of Chicago  grossed $1.3 million in ticket sales and played to an  enthusiastic crowd of more than 28,000 for over ten hours.<p></p> Farm Aid's president, Texas music legend Willie Nelson,  with trademark long braid, black cowboy hat and battered guitar  &quot;Trigger,&quot; closed the show after energetic performances by  fellow founding members Neil Young and John Mellencamp.<p></p> After thanking the crowd for its support of Farm Aid's  Gulf Coast relief effort, Young launched into Fats Domino's  &quot;Walking to New Orleans&quot; and a blistering &quot;Southern Man,&quot; his  rarely performed early 1970s anthem about racial prejudice.<p></p> Singer Dave Matthews, who joined the Farm Aid board several  years ago, said he was &quot;still a little nervous&quot; during a solo  performance but less so around &quot;big brothers like Willie, Neil  and John.&quot;<p></p> Others on the bill included Wilco, Buddy Guy, Emmylou  Harris and country singer Kenny Chesney, appearing days after  splitting with wife, actress Renee Zellweger.<p></p> FARM SUPPORT GROUP CARVES NEW NICHE<p></p> Conceived by Nelson during the depths of the U.S. farm  income crisis and first staged in Champaign, Illinois, in 1985,  when Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash were among the headliners, Farm  Aid has survived to see better times for many farmers.<p></p> The group is now closely associated with the &quot;good food  movement&quot; of small-scale and organic producers against huge  factory farms and corporate-driven production agriculture.<p></p> &quot;We are here to promote food from family farms,&quot; said  Caroline Mugar, executive director of Farm Aid. &quot;Changing the  food you buy changes the way your food is grown.&quot;<p></p> The number of farmers' markets in the United States rose by  79 percent in 2002 from 1994. The organic food industry grew by  20 percent in 2003 to account for more than $10 billion in  consumer sales.<p></p> Farm Aid's organizers moved quickly to ensure that some  funds from the concert were earmarked for rural areas on the  Gulf Coast devastated by Hurricane Katrina in late August,  which they say have been neglected by the authorities.<p></p> &quot;It's hard to believe President George Bush gave a speech  in New Orleans about disaster recovery and failed to mention  the word 'farm' or the word 'rural,'&quot; said Jim Hightower, a  columnist and former Texas Agriculture Commissioner.<p></p> Two decades worth of Farm Aid events have raised some $27  million, of which the group says over 80 percent has been spent  on programs to promote family farming.<p></p> Of that, only a small percentage goes directly to farmers  in the form of grants, the Chicago Tribune reported on  Saturday, raising the hackles of the Farm Aid  organization.<p></p> The goals of Farm Aid are broader than just cutting checks  to needy farmers, said Brian Snyder, executive director of the  Pennsylvania Association for Sustainable Agriculture.<p></p> &quot;Farmers want organizations like Farm Aid to organize  across the country and create an equitable food system,&quot; he  said, adding that small-scale farmers aimed to be vocal as the  2007 U.S. Farm Bill covering federal agricultural subsidies is  written.<p></p> The Chicago-based American Institute of Philanthropy has  graded Farm Aid an A-minus is terms of financial efficiency,  ranking it ahead of charities including the American Heart  Association and Amnesty International.
