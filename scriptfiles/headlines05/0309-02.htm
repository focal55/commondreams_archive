<p> WASHINGTON -- Crowded schools, traffic-choked roads and transit cutbacks are eroding the quality of American life, according to an analysis by civil engineers that gave the nation's infrastructure an overall grade of D.

	 

<P><a href="http://www.asce.org/reportcard" target="_new">A report</a> by the American Society of Civil Engineers released Wednesday assessed the four-year trend in the condition of 12 categories of infrastructure, including roadways, bridges, drinking water systems, public parks, railroads and the power grid.

<P>The overall grade slipped from the D-plus given to the infrastructure in 2001 and 2003.

<P>"Americans are spending more time stuck in traffic and less time at home with their families," William Henry, the group's president, said in a statement.

<P>The report said $1.6 trillion should be spent over the next five years to alleviate potential problems with the nation's infrastructure. Transportation alone requires $94 billion in annual spending, the report said.

<P>The House is to begin debate Wednesday on a six-year, $284 billion highway and mass transit bill, which stalled last year in a money dispute between the White House and Congress.

<P>The report concluded that airports will face the challenge of accommodating more regional jets and super-jumbo jets. Grade: D-plus.

<P>It's uncertain, the report said, whether schools can handle growing enrollment and smaller class sizes required by the No Child Left Behind Act. Grade: D.

<P>The report also noted that many transit systems are borrowing money to maintain operations as they're raising fees and cutting back service. Grade: D-plus.
