<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p> Protesters began descending on Edinburgh this morning ahead of the G8 summit, to urge the leaders of the world's richest nations to act to tackle climate change and eliminate poverty in Africa.

<p>Hopes that the summit will boost aid to Africa were raised yesterday by George Bush's promise to double American aid to the continent. But agreement on climate change appears unlikely with the US seemingly refusing to accept the problem exists.<p>

While Downing Street welcomed the president's aid offer, which includes a promise to spend $1.2bn (£670m) on cutting malaria deaths in half by 2010, Tony Blair is understood to be contemplating splitting with the US over climate change and producing a communique agreed with the other leaders minus President Bush.

<p>Travelling on a specially chartered train from London to Edinburgh, protesters were sceptical about the prospect of progress on climate change at the summit but hopeful about the chances of agreement on greater aid and debt relief for Africa.

"I think something will come out of this week for Africa, but, from what I have read, I don't think climate change will really be on the agenda," one Mexican protester, Pedro, told Guardian Unlimited.

<p>Sarah, a nurse from London, described how she and her friends had been planning their trip for the last six months. "I'm not naive about how much the G8 will achieve, but you can't have an event in your own country without showing your face," she said.<p>Some 150,000 people are expected to march through Edinburgh tomorrow, according to organisers from the Make Poverty History campaign, with the summit starting in Gleneagles on Wednesday.

<p>Protesters started to arrive at the G8 campsite in Niddrie, south Edinburgh, today and, by early afternoon there were around 150 tents pitched at the site, which has a capacity of 15,000.

<p>The site's managers said they had no intelligence on how many protesters overall would turn up, but reported no problems early on.<p>There were 100 stewards and 16 first-aiders on the site, with a dedicated security team of 10 mostly tasked with guarding the site's entry points.

<p>The council had originally planned to levy a "service charge" of £5 per pitch on the site, which features showers, fresh water and cooking facilities, but backed down after concerns were raised.

<p>Councillor Brian Fallon, who is responsible for event safety, said, while visiting the campsite: "The facilities are first-class. What we are providing here is a truly excellent facility ... We hope that it will be a nice dry weekend and the march in aid of reducing poverty in Africa will go according to plan."

<p>The police chief overseeing the security operation in the Scottish capital insisted today there was a "one in 10" chance of violence over the next week. In an interview printed in Scottish editions of Metro, the chief constable of Lothian and Borders police, Ian Dickenson, said the force would be adopting a "softly softly" approach to defuse situations before they developed into the kind of clashes seen at previous G8 summits in Genoa and Evian.

<p>"People will be expecting widespread mayhem on the streets of Edinburgh, which is not going to happen; I'm absolutely certain of it," he said.

<p>In the city centre this afternoon, however, stores along Princes Street were taking no chances. Several had completely boarded up their fronts ahead of the week of protests, many of which will be centred on the city's famous shopping street.

<p>The issue of Africa will also be highlighted by a series of Live 8 concerts around the world, with musicians as diverse as Coldplay, Jay-Z and Mötley Crüe adding their voices to the calls for greater aid and debt relief for the troubled continent.

<p>Harvey Goldsmith, the chief organiser of the events, said that his team were working against huge time pressures to prepare London's Hyde Park for the concert.

"I am not nervous but there is a huge amount of work going on," he told the BBC. "We are turning round one particular set-up for a show for 30,000 people into a huge great arena for 150,000 people. We have got to clear it out, change it and put up our set and we have got 31 hours. That's not a lot of time."<p align="center">&copy; 2005 Guardian Newspapers, Ltd.</p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable --></font></td></tr>
