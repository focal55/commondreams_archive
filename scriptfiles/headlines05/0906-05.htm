<p>The Greenpeace environmental group denounced a UN report that radiation released from Ukraine's Chernobyl nuclear power plant nearly two decades ago may cause fewer deaths than expected as "whitewashing" the impact of the world's worst nuclear accident.

<p>The United Nations report, which found that only 56 people have so far died and 4,000 may eventually perish from the effects of the disaster, was being discussed at a two-day conference in Vienna sponsored by the International Atomic Energy Association (IAEA).

<p>"It is appalling that the IAEA is whitewashing the impacts of the most serious industrial accident in human history," said Jan Van de Putte, a Greenpeace nuclear campaigner, in a statement released by the organization's headquarters in Amsterdam.

<p>"Denying the real implications is not only insulting the thousands of victims -- who are told (they are) sick because of stress and irrational fears -- but it also leads to dangerous recommendations, to relocating people in contaminated areas," Van de Putte said.

<p>Greenpeace charged that a more careful reading of the 600-page report and other published research by UN bodies leads to a different conclusion.

<p>The ecological group also cited omissions in the report. For example, it said that the 4,000 deaths only relate to a studied population of 600,000, whereas radiation was spread over most Europe and the report omits the impact on millions of Europeans.

<p>Also the World Health Organization referred to a study of 72,000 Russian workers at the nuclear plant, but Greenpeace said the number of workers in Russia, Belarus and Ukraine was estimated at nearly 10 times that figure.

<p>The report to be discussed by nuclear, health and development experts in Vienna concludes that out of more than 600,000 people who suffered the most exposure from the accident -- reactor staff, emergency and recovery personnel in 1986-87 and residents of the nearby areas -- an estimated 3,940 are expected to die from radiation-induced cancer and leukemia.
