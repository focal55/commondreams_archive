<p>PARIS  - The medical aid group <a href="http://www.msf.org/" target="_new">Medecins Sans
Frontiers</a> (Doctors without Borders) urged donors Tuesday to
stop sending it money for Asian tsunami victims, saying it had
collected enough funds to manage its relief effort there.

  <p>
 In an unusual step, the group's branches in France and
Germany said they had 40 million and &#36;27 million respectively,
enough to finance emergency medical aid projects they were
supporting in Sri Lanka and Indonesia.
 <p>

 Their decision surprised other aid groups and drew
criticism that it could undercut an unprecedented wave of
private giving to provide relief to the region devastated by
the Dec. 26 tsunami which has killed at least 150,000 people.
 <p>
 "It's the first time we are led to take this kind of
decision," MSF Director General Pierre Salignon said.
<p>
 "This might seem to run counter to the mood of general
mobilization, but it's a question of honesty toward our donors.
We don't want to continue to lobby the public for projects that
are already financed," he said in a statement.
<p>
 A spokesman for MSF's German branch, Aerzte Ohne Grenzen,
said it had adopted the same policy.
<p>
 "What shocks me is that you are taking the risk of pulling
the carpet under the feet of other aid organizations. Many
groups still need more money," said Jean-Christope Rufin, head
of the French aid group Action Contre la Faim (Action against
Hunger).
<p>
 "It's a bit irresponsible. We're all in the same boat in
humanitarian aid," Rufin told France 2 television.
<p>
 Some German agencies said they had no plans to follow suit
and privately several said they were shocked by MSF's decision.
<p>

 "MSF mainly provides emergency aid, whereas Unicef stays
on. We build schools, carry out vaccination programs and so on.
For us this is just the beginning and that's why we still need
donations," said Astrid Prange of Unicef Germany, which has
received more than 10 million euros in pledges.
<p>
 "Our experience is -- and our feeling is -- that people
want to give to this or nothing. It's not that they want to
give in general," said Oxfam Germany director Paul Bendix.
<p>
 Some German aid agencies attributed MSF's move to its focus
on providing short term aid, which is treated differently for
tax purposes under German law on charitable donations than
long-term development assistance.
<p>
 A spokesman for the German Protestant church charity
Diakonie Katastrophenhilfe, which has also received 10 million
euros in pledges, said most German charities had been careful
to broadly frame their aid requests so that they were not
legally tied to providing specific assistance in one country.
<p>
 MSF in France said it was committed to use money donated
for South Asia only there and not for other crises.
<p>
 "If a person calls us to make a donation, we will tell them
that these programs are already financed and that they can make
a donation for a different crisis," a MSF spokeswoman said.</p>
