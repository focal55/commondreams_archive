<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->BAGHDAD, July 15  - Five suicide car bombs blew up  in different locations across Baghdad within hours of each  other, including two attacks on Iraqi military patrols that  police sources said killed six people and wounded more than 20.<p> Eyewitnesses said at least one of the bombers struck a U.S.  convoy, although there were no immediate reports of American  troops among the casualties.<p> Firefighters tried to douse the flames near one blast site  targetting Iraqi troops in the north of the city, where several  cars were destroyed and bloodsoaked survivors argued with police.<p> &quot;The (Iraqi) army vehicles were parking right here when a  speeding Daewoo car approached and exploded. It split in two  parts,&quot; eyewitness Raed Salman said.<p> A police source said six people were killed and 16 hurt in  that blast. The bodies were too charred to immediately identify  how many were Iraqi soldiers and how many civilians.<p> In the New Baghdad district in the southeast of the city,  eyewitness Basim Mohammed said he saw a car bomber ram an  armoured U.S. convoy at high speed, but he saw no casualties.<p> Another bomb struck near Andalus square in the town centre.  Reuters correspondents in central Baghdad heard that blast,  followed by gunfire. An Interior Ministry source said the blast  was caused by a suicide car bomb that wounded five Iraqi  soldiers and three civilians.<p> He said there were two other apparent suicide car bombs,  near an old Defence Ministry headquarters and near a U.S. patrol  in east Baghdad. He had no reports of casualties at either site.<p> A U.S. military spokesman said he was checking the various  reports.   <p align="CENTER">&copy; 2005 Reuters<p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable --></font></td></tr>
