<P>At least four Afghan civilians were killed and many more wounded in a US bombing raid in the southern province of Zabul, locals and officials say.
<p>Governor Ali Khail told the Associated Press US-led forces had made a mistake and villagers were among casualties.
<p>The US said one of its soldiers and "at least 16 enemy forces" were killed in fighting in the area on Monday.
<p>US forces said on Thursday that another US soldier and six militants had died in fighting in Paktika province.
<p>Last month, the US military said it regretted that civilians had been killed in an air strike by US forces in eastern Konar Province.
<p><b>'Why are they killing us?'</b>
<p>Three members of the same family from the village of Rauf in Zabul Province's remote district of Deh Chopan are reported to be among the dead.
<p>Local woman Sadia Bibi, 50, told the Associated Press that her brother, his wife and their 16-year-old son had been killed in the bombing.
<p>"The children were crying and they were very afraid. These planes killed my relatives. We are poor and innocent people. Why are they killing us?" she asked.
<p>Her daughter and her one-and-a-half-month-old grandson are being treated by doctors in the provincial capital, Qalat, a few hours drive away.
<p>Ms Bibi said they had injuries to their hands and legs after being struck by pieces of bricks during the bombardment.
<p>A fourth victim from Rauf, a woman, died on Thursday morning after being transferred to Kandahar for treatment, the BBC's Mirwais Afghan says.
<p>Two other women also taken to Kandahar in a critical condition are said to be stable.
<p>Abdul Malik, a doctor at Qalat's hospital, said: "We have received six wounded people from the bombing and they say that three civilians died."
<p>The US military said it did not believe there had been civilian casualties.
<p>"My understanding is that our intelligence shows no civilians in this area. We don't have any assessment of any civilians in this area," US military spokeswoman Lt Cindy Moore told reporters.
<p>Observers say the number of civilians killed in Rauf could be higher. Locals say there were 18 casualties, but it is still unclear if more than four were killed.
<p><b>Complex of caves</b>
<p>The death of the US soldier in south-eastern Paktika Province brings to six the number of US troops killed in the past week in Afghanistan. Another was wounded in the clash.
<p>In a separate incident, US forces said six insurgents were killed near the border with Pakistan.
<p>Three US soldiers and their Afghan interpreter were wounded in the clash.
<p>The fighting took place in a complex of caves on Tuesday after Afghan and US forces encountered the militants during a patrol.
<p>Escalating violence mainly in southern and eastern Afghanistan has seen some 800 people, including 41 US troops, killed this year.
