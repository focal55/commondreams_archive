<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->European leaders expressed shock and regret last night at the size of the no victory in the Dutch referendum, strengthening the hand of Britain and other countries in "new" Europe who want to cancel their polls.

<p>Jacques Chirac, who led the calls for the referendums to continue in the wake of his own defeat on Sunday, declared last night that the "European project" was in grave difficulty.

<p>But he insisted other countries should still have their say on the constitution. "While 11 countries have already come to a decision, it is the responsibility of all the other member states of the union to have their say," he said. "This new negative result in a founding member of the union and committed to European construction shows strong expectations, questions and concerns about the development of the European project."

<p>Gerhard Schröder, the German chancellor, admitted that leaders would now have to face up to widespread concerns about the direction of Europe after the 55% no vote in France and the 62% no vote in the Netherlands.

<p>"I take note of the result of the referendum in the Netherlands with respect but also with great regret," the chancellor said. "We must acknowledge that many Europeans doubt that Europe is able to answer the urgent questions of the moment."

<p>But Mr Schröder insisted ratification should continue. "Each member state has the right and the obligation to give its own vote. The crisis surrounding the ratification of the European constitution must not become Europe's general crisis."

<p>The chancellor's call shows that - for the moment at least - most European leaders are likely to stick to the official position that referendums and parliamentary votes on the EU constitution should continue. But the change in tone from Paris and Berlin indicates that Tony Blair may have a slightly easier ride at the European summit in Brussels on June 16 when he tries to persuade fellow leaders to abandon the ratification process.

<p>Jose Manuel Barroso, the president of the commission, hinted at a more flexible approach when he avoided mentioning ratification.

<p>But in a swipe at Britain, which is privately leading the calls for the constitution to be declared dead, he added: "We should ask all member states to abstain from unilateral initiatives."

<p>It was left to Jean-Claude Juncker, the Luxembourg prime minister who holds the EU's rotating presidency, to call for the votes on the treaty to continue. Mr Juncker, whose country is due to hold the next vote on July 10, said that the no campaigns had offered "contradictory arguments", adding: "The ratification process should continue in the member states that have not yet voted. People have the right to have their say."

<p>As president of the European council, Mr Juncker will put proposals to the summit in Brussels. Leaders in "new" Europe, who believe it is now impossible to hold referendums in their countries, want a declaration that the constitution is dead.

<p>None has been willing to deliver the last rites to the constitution in public because they do not want to be blamed for killing it off. Mr Blair is treading carefully because Britain knows that France holds him partly responsible for the no vote - Mr Chirac called a referendum only after his hand was forced by the British prime minister's decision to hold a poll.

<p>Amid such sensitivity, a careful diplomatic dance is likely to be played out over the next two weeks. Wounded by the 55% no vote in France, which he blames on fears about an "Anglo-Saxon" economy sweeping across Europe, Mr Chirac may be in no mood to give Britain an easy ride.

<p>A key moment may come next Monday when Jack Straw, the foreign secretary, gives his first formal response to the French and Dutch votes.

<p>As a one time Eurosceptic who privately believes the constitution cannot be rescued, Mr Straw may nudge France along by saying he is suspending the parliamentary bill which must be passed to allow a referendum in Britain.

<p>Supporters of the constitution will accept a delay but insist the treaty must still be given a chance.

<p>Alex Stubb, a visiting professor at the College of Europe in Bruges, who is also a Finnish MEP, said: "We should go on with the ratification. This is like a snooker game with 25 frames - if we reach 22 frames won out of 25 we are doing quite well. Perhaps the countries that have voted against will have to reassess."

<p><b>The hurdles ahead
</b>
<p><b>Turkey
</b>
<p>Ankara's 40-year dream of joining the EU is likely to be a casualty of the French referendum which highlighted unease about Turkish membership. Talks will open on October 3, but the process may be kicked into long grass because each chapter has to be agreed by all 25 countries.

<p><b>Romania and Bulgaria
</b>
<p>Will sneak through because they have signed accession treaties. But entry may be delayed by a year to 2008.

<p><b>EU soft power
</b>
<p>A little noticed casualty may be EU success in stabilising former Yugoslavia by holding out the chance of membership. Croatia should still join but Serbia may be in trouble. This would destabilise Kosovo - one of the ways of persuading Belgrade to accept Kosovan independence is the chance of EU membership.

<p>Services directive

<p>Proposal to liberalise provision of services across the EU is in doubt after Jacques Chirac pledged to uphold France's social model.

<p><b>Lisbon agenda
</b>
<p>EU's plan to put the economy on a par with the US will be set back. Jose Manuel Barroso, commission president, who is championing liberalisation of labour markets, is blamed by Mr Chirac for the no vote.

<p>Budget

<p>The budget negotiations, which were meant to dominate this month's European summit, will now be placed on the back burner.

<p><b>British budget rebate
</b>
<p>No agreement on the EU budget means no serious negotiations on Britain's £3.2bn rebate. Britain will say its rebate must stay as long as France does better than anyone from agricultural subsidies.

<p><b>Running the EU
</b>
<p>Enlarged EU of 25 will continue to run on the basis of the 2001 Nice treaty. This will store up trouble because Germany does not have enough votes in the council of ministers relative to its population. <p align="CENTER">&copy; 2005 Guardian Newspapers, Ltd.<p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable --></font></td></tr>
