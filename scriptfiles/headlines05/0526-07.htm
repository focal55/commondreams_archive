<p> EAST LYNNE, Mo. -- A Missouri boy was kicked off school computers for the rest of the year after teachers said that he accessed pornography online, KMBC's Emily Aylward reported Tuesday.

</font>Matthew Schooler, 13, pulled up <a href="http://www.whitehouse.org/" target="_new">WhiteHouse.org</a> in class last week. Schooler's mom is fighting the school's action against her son because she said safeguards weren't in place and that the Web site wasn't pornographic, but a Web site that <a href="http://www.whitehouse.org/" target="_new">parodies</a> the official <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">White House Web site.</a>
<P></P>
"I'm at a loss, you know. What did my son do that was so wrong," Tammi Rusk said.
<P></P>
Rusk told Aylward that she is concerned about how her son will keep up in class now that he has been kicked off school computers.
<P></P>
"It hurts because I want my son to have the best that he can, to do the best he can, and I feel they are depriving him," Rusk said.
<P></P>
Aylward reported that teachers at East Lynne Elementary School insist that Matthew was at fault for pulling up what they saw as a pornographic Web site and showing it to classmates nearby.
<P></P>
Matthew told Aylward that he was researching the White House for a school project and that his teacher suggested the Web site herself.
<P></P>
"We don't condone it. We don't like it and we discipline it," Superintendent Dr. Dan Doerhoff (<a href="mailto:grw002@mail.connect.more.net">grw002@mail.connect.more.net</a>) said.
<P></P>
Doerhoff insists that Matthew knew exactly what he was doing. The school district has Internet policies outlining "grave consequences."
<P></P>
"The information we had to act on was very certain, very definite and necessary. And the action we took was imperative," Doerhoff said.
<P></P>"I've looked at the Web site and I don't see anything wrong there," Rusk said.</p>
