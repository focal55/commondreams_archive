<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->CARACAS, Venezuela  - U.S. efforts to create a free trade zone in the Americas have failed and "should be buried," Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said on Tuesday.<p> The left-wing leader, a fierce critic of the policies of the United States, Venezuela's main oil client, has lobbied against the U.S.-proposed Free Trade Area of the Americas. He has portrayed Washington's plan as an attempt to impose U.S. economic and political dominance over weaker Latin American economies.<p> "Thank God the FTAA is dead, it should be buried," Chavez said during a ceremony commemorating the anniversary of Venezuela's 1811 Declaration of Independence.<p> The FTAA, discussed since the early 1990s, envisages a free trade area stretching from the southern tip of South America all the way to Alaska. Cuba would be the only country excluded.<p> No real progress has been made in the negotiations in the last few years and a January target date for the introduction of the FTAA was missed.<p> The populist leader regularly rails against the FTAA as a vehicle of U.S. "imperialism" aimed at sabotaging Latin America's attempts to unite.<p> "This is the path to the most complete disintegration, through competition and the predominance of the strongest over the weakest," Chavez said.<p> Chavez, who has positioned his self-styled socialist "revolution" in Venezuela as a counterweight to U.S. influence in Latin America, has proposed his own regional integration mechanism called the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas, or ALBA.<p> Chavez, who says he is inspired by Latin America's Venezuelan-born 19th century independence hero Simon Bolivar, argues his ALBA proposal is based on complementary trade and cooperation, not free-market competition.<p> The only country to formally subscribe to ALBA is Cuba, which has turned to Venezuela for oil supplies to help its cash-starved economy.<p> Relations between Venezuela, the world's No. 5 oil exporter, and the United States, the top buyer of its crude oil, have soured since Chavez was first elected in 1998 and he strengthened ties with Cuba and Iran. </p>
