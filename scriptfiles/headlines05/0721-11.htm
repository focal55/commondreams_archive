He said that the Indian Constitution can provide necessary inputs to manage the contradictions of Iraqi polity. <br /><br />The speech of the Prime Minister earned several rounds of applause. <br /><br />When asked about the conflict between cross-border terrorism and peace process with Pakistan, Dr. Singh said: the climate of concrete dialogue process with Pakistan can easily be vitiated if Pakistan’s territory continues to be used to fan terror activities in India.” <br /><br />He also said that terror attacks like Wednesday’s suicide bomb blast in Srinagar could derail the ongoing peace process and he can do little to save it. <br /><br />“If that commitment (to stop terror activities from Pakistani soil) is not kept, I, as a Prime Minister of a democratic country cannot move ahead of public opinion. If acts of terror continues to take place originating from the Pakistani territory, that affects my capability to carry forward the peace process,” Dr. Singh said. <br /><br />Prime Minister, however, accepted that he had not received any commitment from the US President on India’s candidature for a permanent seat in the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) but pointed out that US has recognised the need for India’s role in the management of international affairs in coming years. <br /><br />He also reiterated India’s emergence as a global power to be reckoned with in various areas. Apart from highlighting India’s pains about terrorism again, he talked about the need for strong Indo-US joint mechanisms to deal with upcoming global problems in the areas of defence, healthcare and social development. <br /><br />The Prime Minister is also elaborated upon the discussions he had with the US leadership including US President George W Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney over the past two days. Dr. Singh held meetings with US Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, US Treasury Secretary Paul O’Neil, besides other key officials on Tuesday following an address to the joint session of the US Congress. He also attended Congress International Relations Committee meeting, Indian Caucus lunch and a meeting with Indian community at the US on Tuesday. <br /><br />The National Press Club has been a part of American life for more than 90 years. Its members have included Presidents of the United States—from Theodore Roosevelt to Bill Clinton. Most have spoken from the Club’s podium, some to declare their candidacies for the highest office in the land. <br /><br />An average of 70 luncheons each year provide a national forum for the views of Presidents, Prime Ministers, business and cultural leaders, members of the Cabinet and Congress. Over the years, major news has been made at the Club: Nikita Khrushchev, Winston Churchill, Madame Chiang Kai Shek, Golda Meir, Indira Gandhi, Charles deGaulle, Boris Yeltsin, Nelson Mandela, Yasir Arafat and many others have made headlines at the Press Club podium. <P align="CENTER"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&copy; 2005 NewKerala.com</font></P><p align="center">###</p></font><!-- #EndEditable --></font></td></tr>
