the U.S. military for detaining thousands of Iraqis for long 
periods without charge and wants to change a U.N. resolution 
that gives foreign troops immunity from Iraqi law.</p>
<p> Speaking to Reuters, Justice Minister Abdul Hussein Shandal 
also criticized U.S. detentions of Iraqi journalists and said 
the media, contrary to U.S. policy in Iraq, must have special 
legal protection to report on all sides in the conflict.</p><p> "No citizen should be arrested without a court order," he 
said this week, complaining that U.S. suggestions that his 
ministry has an equal say on detentions were misleading.</p><p> "There is abuse (of human rights) due to detentions, which 
are overseen by the Multinational Force (MNF) and are not in 
the control of the justice ministry," said Shandal, a Shi'ite 
judge respected for standing up to Saddam Hussein on the rule 
of law.</p><p> Killings and unjustified arrests of Iraqi civilians by U.S. 
troops risked going unpunished, he said, because of U.N. 
Security Council resolution 1546, which granted U.S.-led forces 
sweeping powers following their overthrow of Saddam in 2003.</p><p> "The resolution ... gives immunity to the MNF and means 
taking no action against the MNF no matter what happens or 
whatever they do against the people of Iraq," Shandal said.</p><p> "We're hoping to make more efforts with the Security 
Council and the whole United Nations to end this resolution or 
amend it so that anyone who violates Iraqi law or assaults any 
citizen is held accountable," he said. "This is a matter of 
sovereignty."</p><p> He said he was pressing the occupying forces to speed up 
releases for some of the 10,000 Iraqis held at Abu Ghraib 
prison and elsewhere, often for many months without charge, on 
suspicion of aiding Sunni Arab insurgents.</p><p> Last month, 1,000 men were freed from Abu Ghraib, notorious 
under Saddam and under U.S. control since 2003, as Iraq's 
Shi'ite-led government and Washington tried to appease the once 
dominant Sunni minority. The United Nations said last week 
faster releases could promote Sunni acceptance of the new 
political system.</p><p> Iraqi officials voice frustration with U.S. and British 
vetoes on some requests for release, noting that Iraqis have 
been held for two years without charge to "gather 
intelligence."</p><p> Speaking of the Combined Review and Release Board (CRRB) 
which guarantees detainees a hearing every six months, Shandal 
said: "The representatives of the MNF in the committee have the 
rights and all the authority under the U.N. resolution."

</p><p> MEDIA RIGHTS</p><p> Shandal said he was concerned about the U.S. military's 
refusal to accord special consideration to the media and at the 
number of journalists detained for many months by U.S. troops.</p><p> Among these are two cameramen for Reuters. One of them is 
Ali Omar Abrahem al-Mashhadani, who was ordered detained by the 
CRRB last month as a "threat to the people of Iraq." The 
military will not say what suspicions it has against him.</p><p> Asked to clarify the CRRB definition of "threat," Shandal 
said: "It's a catch-all term to portray this person as a threat 
to the nation and allow the other side to keep him in custody."</p><p> Asked if the government approved of such measures, which 
U.S. generals say they implement with Iraqi official support, 
he said: "I am a man of law and a judge and I respect human 
rights ... No citizen should be arrested without a court 
order."</p><p> Though the nature of their work brings journalists under 
suspicion from both sides, the U.S. command in Iraq refuses to 
consider special treatment for accredited reporters and says it 
will detain them under the same conditions as any other 
suspect.</p><p> Shandal, however, said journalists needed special 
protection and defended independent reporting from all sides, 
including from rebel-held areas. He insisted on journalists' 
right to film and interview Iraq's insurgents without fear of 
arrest or worse.</p><p> "In this time of conflict ... between terrorists and the 
army or Multinational Forces, the journalist comes to the fore.</p>
<p> "Full freedom should be given to journalists to take 
pictures and film in the field," he said. "Without images what 
would we know of history? ... We would know nothing."</p><p align="center"> &copy; Reuters 2005</p>
