<p>AN AMERICAN environmentalist and peace activist, in Australia to
talk about non-violent methods of protest, has been arrested as a
security threat.</p>
<p>History teacher Scott Parkin, 35, was arrested by the Australian
Federal Police in Melbourne on Saturday as he traveled to a
workshop he was conducting on the US peace movement. Last night he
was being held at the Melbourne Custody Center.</p>

An Immigration Department spokesman confirmed he had been
arrested on "character grounds" at its request and he would be
deported "as soon as practicable".
<p>The move has sparked outrage among politicians, refugee groups,
environment and legal groups.</p>
<p>At the end of a week in which the Federal Government put forward
unparalleled anti-terrorist arrest and detention provisions, they
say Mr Parkin's arrest highlights the abuses to which such sweeping
powers are open.</p>
<p>The high-profile American activist works for Houston Global
Awareness and writes for on-line magazine <i>Zmag</i>. He was
arrested under the Immigration Act, which allows the deportation of
any non-citizens who "incite discord in the Australian community
&#133; or represent a danger to the Australian community".</p>
<div id="adSpotIsland" class="islandad"></div>
<p>The act also specifically allows a visa to be canceled where "a
person's presence is, or would be, prejudicial to relations between
Australia and a foreign country".</p>
<p>Mr Parkin, a community college instructor from Texas who gives
talks on companies investing in Iraq, has been arrested a number of
times in America.</p>
<p>He arrived in Australia three months ago on a six-month
visitor's visa.</p>
<p>He was working with Greenpeace and had already given talks in
Brisbane and Sydney and taken part in street theater protests
outside the US corporation Halliburton during the recent Forbes
meeting.</p>
<p>ASIO phoned him last Wednesday but he refused to attend a
voluntary interview. Liz Thompson from the National
Anti-Deportation Alliance, one of about 30 people protesting
outside the Melbourne Custody Center yesterday, said: "This is a
major attack on dissent, free speech and the anti-war
movement."</p>
<p>Marika Dias, of Brimbank Community Legal Service, assisting Mr
Parkin, said he had been declared a risk to national security
without any evidence or a proper opportunity to tell his side of
the story.</p>
<p>Opposition Leader Kim Beazley said he would seek a briefing on
the matter.</p>
<p>Greens Senator Bob Brown called for an explanation from the
Government, accusing it of appearing "to be doing the Bush
Administration's bidding".</p>
<p>"He was granted a visa to enter the country, so his arrest
contradicts the Government's own assessment of his credentials," he
said.</p>
<p>Greenpeace Australia Pacific spokesman Dan Cass said: "The
silencing of a peace activist for the 'crime' of satirizing US
policy will only confirm many people's worst fears."</p>
<p>Fitzroy Legal Service's Dan Nicholson said the real threat to
security came from "Government officials who imprison and deport an
innocent person because of his political views".</p>
