"I can't go into any detail except to say that it's going to be pretty exciting," she said.<p>
Fonda said her anti-war tour in March will use a bus that runs on "vegetable oil." She will be joined by families of Iraq war veterans and her daughter.<p>
They plan to return to the Santa Fe area, where she was promoting her book, "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0375507108/commondreams-20/ref=nosim/" target="_new"><i>My Life So Far</i></a>" on Saturday.<p>
Prompted by a question from the audience, Fonda said war veterans that she has met on a nationwide book tour have encouraged her to break her silence on the Iraq war.<p>
"I've decided I'm coming out," she said.<p>
Hundreds of people in the audience cheered loudly when Fonda announced her intentions to join the anti-Iraq war movement.<p>
"I have not taken a stand on any war since Vietnam," she said. "I carry a lot of baggage from that."<p>
Fonda incited controversy in July 1972 when she was photographed sitting on a North Vietnamese anti-aircraft gun while on a tour of the country to drum up support to end the war.
