But new analysis suggests Europe is also falling behind in its attempt to meet legally binding United Nations targets.  <P>The US energy department report shows emissions rose 2% in 2004 and stood one year ago at 7,122.1m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent a year - about 25% of the world total. The rise was the greatest in five years and is part of an accelerating trend. Revised figures also published showed emissions in 2003 were at the second highest level. This year's figures have not been published but are expected by analysts to be similar or greater because of strong US economic growth.  <P>The data, released just two weeks after the US government claimed at the Montreal climate talks that its voluntary approach to cutting emissions was working, drew immediate criticism from European environment groups and academics. <P>Lord Rees, the president of the UK's Royal Society, said the new data showed all industrialised countries needed to intensify efforts to cut emissions.  <P>"At the G8 summit in Gleneagles in July, the US and other G8 countries agreed to 'act with resolve and urgency to meet our shared and multiple objectives of reducing greenhouse gas emissions'. But these figures emphasise the need to act with even greater urgency and resolve now." He said the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was about 380 parts per million, probably the highest for 20m years and more than a third higher than before the industrial revolution.  <P>"Industrialised countries will need to cut emissions by at least 60% by 2050 if we are to stabilise atmospheric concentrations at twice pre-industrial levels. It seems unlikely that the present US strategy ... will be enough," he said.  <P>But there was little cheer for Europeans. A paper published next week suggests 10 of the 15 EU countries committed to reducing climate-change gases under the Kyoto agreement will fall short of their targets unless they take urgent action. Only the UK, Sweden and France are remotely on target, the Institute for Public Policy Research is expected to say, while Denmark, Ireland and Italy are up to 20% off target. Emissions are rising in 13 of the 15 countries .  <P>In a separate development, the governors of seven US north-east states, frustrated by the federal government's refusal to set targets, yesterday signed up their states to work together to reduce global warming emissions. From 2009, Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York and Vermont will begin trading carbon under the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). <P>The states intend to cap emissions from power stations at present levels until 2015, and then reduce them by 10% on 2005 levels by 2019. Household bills are predicted to rise about $3 to $24 (&pound;1.70 to &pound;13.80) a year once the initiative starts. <P>At least 25% of the money generated by the buying and selling of the carbon credits will be used to encourage the efficiency of machinery, buildings and appliances <P>"In the face of the Bush administration's refusal to cut heat-trapping pollution, this is a bold act of leadership," said Peter Frumhoff, of the Global Environment Programme at the Union of Concerned Scientists. "These governors are sending a strong signal that Americans are ready to implement innovative solutions to meet the challenge of global warming."
