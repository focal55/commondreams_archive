<p>RAMALLAH, West Bank  - Mahmoud Abbas won a  landslide victory on Sunday in the election to succeed Yasser  Arafat as Palestinian president with a strong mandate to talk  peace with Israel and end corruption, exit polls showed.<p> 
			
			Waving flags and honking horns, Abbas supporters celebrated  a victory with some 65 percent of the vote -- as high as any  had predicted. Turnout looked healthy despite a boycott by  Islamist militants opposed to Abbas's call for a truce.<p>

</font>But a bid to usher in a new era of Middle East diplomacy  after the death of iconic leader Arafat will still be  vulnerable to the militants, who fired rockets into Israel  during polling in a show of force.<p> 
			
			Exit polls released after the 2 p.m. EST close of voting  showed Abbas, candidate of the dominant Fatah movement with  over 65 percent compared with about 20 percent for his nearest  challenger, pro-democracy activist Mustafa Barghouthi.<p> 
			
			"This means that Abu Mazen has the mandate to implement his  program," said campaign manager Mohammed Shtayeh, using Abbas's  nickname.<p> 
			
			Amid bursts of celebratory gunfire in Gaza, 30-year-old  Mazen Saeed said: "Now it is time for Abu Mazen to pay back the  people. Those people need security, better lives and peace."<p> 
			
			Five other presidential candidates, ranging from a Marxist  ex-guerrilla to an academic under U.S. house arrest on  suspicion of funneling funds to Hamas militants, trailed far  behind.<p> 
			
			HEALTHY TURNOUT<p> 
			
			An independent estimate that turnout was a healthy 65  percent also appeared to quell concerns that low participation  as a result of the boycott call by Islamist militants could  dent Abbas's mandate for talking peace and carrying out  internal reform.<p> 
			
			A top Hamas official said the Islamic faction would respect  the choice of Palestinians, but that he thought Abbas's result  was actually "very weak."<p> 
			
			Palestinian election officials extended polling in the West  Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem by two hours because, they  said, some voters were being held up by Israeli checkpoints in  the territories occupied since the 1967 Middle East war.<p> 
			
			But monitors said Israel appeared to have largely kept its  promise to ease the passage of Palestinians through  checkpoints.<p> 
			
			"It has been a very good day. The moment is historic,"  European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana said while  observing voting.<p> 
			
			Israel sees Abbas as a man to do business with, but has  criticized his intention to co-opt rather than confront  militants and insists on an end to militant attacks before real  discussion of Palestinian statehood.<p> 
			
			PLEDGE TO CURB GRAFT<p> 
			
			As well as curbing violence, Abbas is under pressure at  home and abroad to enact reforms to end widespread corruption  and revive a Palestinian Authority whose structures crumbled  during years of Arafat's chaotic rule.<p> 
			
			Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon is expected to meet  Abbas within days of his victory being made official. A result  is likely on Monday.<p> 
			
			After decades as a backroom technocrat in Arafat's circle,  Abbas waged a populist campaign pledging to uphold his old  guerrilla boss's quest for total Israeli withdrawal from  occupied lands but parted from him in urging an end to  violence.<p> 
			
			Abbas caused disquiet in Israel with campaign vows to  insist on Palestinian statehood in all of the West Bank, Gaza  and East Jerusalem, as well as a "right of return" for millions  of Palestinian refugees to lands now inside the Jewish state.<p> 
			
			Israel plans to withdraw 8,000 Jewish settlers from tiny  Gaza this year. But it rules out ceding East Jerusalem or  taking back refugees and has won U.S. assurances that it should  never have to give up much larger settlements in the West Bank.<p> 
			
			On the Israeli political front, a new government was to be  sworn in on Monday. Sharon's coalition pacts with veteran  peacemaker Shimon Peres's Labour Party and a religious faction  were submitted to parliament on Sunday.<p> 
			
			With new partners, Sharon will have a parliamentary  majority for the first time in six months to press ahead with  the removal of all 21 Gaza settlements and four of 120 in the  West Bank.<p> 
			
			"It can turn a new page for both sides. Maybe that will  help to get things going," said Sharon's spokesman Raanan  Gissin.<p>
