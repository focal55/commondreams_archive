<p>British officials are seriously concerned about the level of corruption in the Iraqi defence ministry, after the embezzlement of vast amounts of money earmarked for the country's security forces.
<P>Officials from the British Ministry of Defence had already warned US and Iraqi authorities against the squandering of money - and have been proved right, on a catastrophic scale.<P>A report compiled by the Iraqi Board of Supreme Audit has concluded that at least half, and probably more, of $1.27bn (&pound;700m) of Iraqi money spent on military procurement has disappeared into a miasma of kickbacks and vanished middlemen - or else has been spent on useless equipment.<P>The report, leaked to the US news organisation Knight Ridder, comes as a blow to the credibility of the Iraqi army and its ability to contain the increasingly cogent insurgency.<P>According to the report, led by former human rights minister Abdel Baset al-Turki, the vanished money came solely from Iraqi funds, not from foreign donations to Iraq's military or the US-funded training budget.<P>The report focuses on an eight-month period after the transfer of sovereignty from the US-led occupation to caretaker Iraqi authorities on June 28 2004.<P>The report found that contracts were awarded to favoured weapons suppliers, via middlemen, without bidding or approval from the prime minister's office. Contracts included a clause stating that the full value of deals was to be paid up front, in cash.<P>All deals were done through third-party companies or agencies headed by Iraqi middlemen, who have disappeared, leaving the Iraqi government without recourse when it complained of unfulfilled contracts.<P>Internal documents, said the report, "incorrectly indicated that the &#91;Iraqi&#93; ministry of defence signed contracts with Poland, Arab countries, the United States and Europe, but we discovered that all contracts were signed and executed with Iraqi suppliers".<P>Among those missing is a man called Nair Mohamed al-Jumaili, sole beneficiary of 43 out of 89 contracts, into whose bank account several million dollars was paid.<P>Nine ministry officials, all of them appointed by the US, have been fired by the ministry, and face possible criminal charges. Among them is the ministry's procurement chief, Ziad Cattan.<P>Mr Cattan, who returned to Iraq two days before the war began, contacted Knight Ridder from hiding, to deny the charges and the claims that he took a 10% finder's fee on every contract. He said the Americans controlled the purse strings of Iraqi defence expenditure.<P>During the period covered by the report, 20 US officials worked alongside the Iraqi defence ministry, and all the sacked officials had been appointed by the Coalition Provisional Authority - the administration headed by American Paul Bremer.
<P>British defence officials say that "ultimately, Iraqi spending decisions are a matter for the Iraqi government"
