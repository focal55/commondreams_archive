<p>MIAMI -- A computer glitch caused Miami-Dade County's electronic voting machines to throw out hundreds of ballots in a special election this month and raised questions about votes in five other municipal elections, officials said.

<P>The problem came to light when officials noticed a high number of undervotes in the March 8 election on whether to have slot machines at tracks and jai alai frontons. Undervotes are ballots with no recorded votes.

<P>The elections department also identified five other suspicious municipal elections: West Miami, Bay Harbor Island, Surfside, Golden Beach and Cutler Ridge.

<P>The undervotes wouldn't have changed the results of any of the elections, county Elections Supervisor Constance Kaplan said.

<P>But County Manager George Burgess wants all the votes reviewed.

<P>"It's disturbing, and that's an understatement," Burgess told The Miami Herald. "We have to take our responsibility seriously. Every vote needs to be counted."

<P>Kaplan said 477 of 1,246 electronically cast undervotes in the slot machine referendum could be blamed on a faulty computer program. Bad coding told the machines to reject ballots if voters didn't press a red flashing button to complete the process. Normally, other safeguards would have ensured those votes were counted.

<P>Kaplan blamed human error and said two supervisors have been reassigned. She said a project manager with Elections System & Software, which makes the machines, should have detected the problem.

<P>The company said the county bears ultimate responsibility for all aspects of an election.
