<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->As a U.S. citizen residing in Canada, I campaigned with Democrats Abroad during last year's U.S. election, attending the Democratic Convention in Boston and helping the group register upward of 30,000 American voters in Canada. Given the excesses of the Bush administration, I concurred with former U.S. President and Nobel Peace Prize winner Jimmy Carter that this election cut to the very "soul" of America.

<p>Two weeks after the November 2004 election, I returned to the United States and saw firsthand how that soul was faring in the wake of the Democrats' defeat and the Bush ascendancy. It was a poignant visit that was captured in four "postcards" that I brought back with me.

<p>The first postcard was from a writer's conference at which Dana Gioia, celebrated author and chairman of the U.S. National Endowment for the Arts, delivered a rather dispiriting assessment of American reading patterns. As he told the gathering, "If any of you leaves here smiling, I have not done my job."

<p>Gioia outlined the findings of a survey on reading trends conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau and involving more than 17,000 people. The study showed that for the first time since such surveys have been taken, fewer than 50 per cent of Americans had read anything of a literary nature in the past year (including a poem on a fridge magnet). Most perturbing was the precipitous decline in literary reading among those aged 30 and under. While noting a 400 per cent increase in electronics purchases, the study suggested that within 30 to 40 years, if present trends continue, there will be no reading of literature, outside of school assignments, anywhere in U.S.

<p>Any remaining grins were transformed to grimaces as Gioia showed a direct link between a decline in literary reading and a decline in participation in the arts, cultural events, volunteer groups, civic organizations, and the democratic process itself. Many of us at the conference had the gnawing, visceral sense that literature was the canary in the mine of the U.S social fabric, and it was beginning to choke. (The report, <i>Reading at Risk: A Survey of Literary Reading in America,</i> can be found at <a href="http://www.arts.gov/pub/ReadingAtRisk.pdf" target="_new">http://www.arts.gov/pub/ReadingAtRisk.pdf</a>)

<p>The second postcard I picked up on the train home, where I met an African-American woman from Harlem. She was travelling to a town near Rochester for the funeral of her two-year-old nephew who had been beaten to death by his stepfather. The swirl of sorrow, pain, anger, shame and despair in her eyes pre-empted any consoling nostrums I might have offered. I had a sense of the violence and tragedy that have become fixtures, like abandoned warehouses and burned-out tenements, in America's forgotten communities, and I saw the silhouettes of American citizens, minorities, veterans, mentally ill, the homeless, who had somehow been rendered non-persons in today's America. I felt I was talking to a woman who was one of millions who would — and did — fall outside the purview of the $8,000-a-plate Inaugural Ball in Washington.

<p>I got my third postcard a few hours on as we neared the Canadian border. There, U.S. Customs and Immigration officials appeared, asking to see everyone's passports.

<p>"What's up?" I inquired.

<p>"Exit check," was the retort.

<p>In more than two decades of crisscrossing the border, I had never encountered U.S. Customs asking for identification upon leaving the U.S. Fleeting images of Soviet exit scrutiny and the Berlin Wall came to mind. As the border agents checked our documents, I recalled that freedom of movement has always been hailed as a cornerstone of democractic societies and that the right to leave and re-enter one's country is enshrined in Article 13 of the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights.

<p>The final postcard arrived shortly after returning to Toronto, when I learned that one of the conference organizers had just heard that her son, a U.S. serviceman, had been killed in Iraq that weekend. The wound was deepened by the fact the woman was a pacifist who opposed the invasion of Iraq.

<p>When people ask me how are things in the U.S. I turn to these postcards, and think of other postcards that are being sent from my homeland — postcards of tortured "illegal non-combatants" in Guantanomo Bay, of wilderness areas now being opened up to logging and mining, of retirees worried about the privatization of their social security benefits, of academics losing academic freedom, and of poor families facing deeper cuts to their already fading social services.

<p>And I think of the postcards I might send to U.S. friends and family from Canada: of the ratification of the Kyoto accord, of citizens visiting doctors and digging for their health cards instead of their Mastercards, of federal troops not going to Iraq. I've yet to send these postcards — perhaps because it seems too much like sending salt for fresh wounds. But if I were to send them, I'd send them with deep heartache for a country I love. I think I might simply but reluctantly scrawl on the back: "Wish you were here."
