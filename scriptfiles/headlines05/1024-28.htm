<p>Recently, in the Rose Garden, a member of the press asked President Bush about his ability to perform the functions of his office with the distraction of the investigation of Plamegate. Bush smirked, “It’s background noise.”  

            

<p>The “background noise” during the first term of George W. Bush was that of his singing sycophants, crooning <i>Hail to the Chief.</i>
<p>The tune changed to <i>Cry me a River</i> when the President vacation and played golf as Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf coast.  And when Bush did go to the scene to appear sympathetic to the needs of all those people who’d lost everything and, then, blew it when he mentioned Trent Lott’s beach house that was gone but not forgotten, he’d have heard  Great Pretender followed by <i>Blame It On The Rain</i>, recorded by two other pretenders, Milli Vanilli. As George W. saw his poll numbers sliding so low, the volume of <i>Whiskey River</i> must have sounded so high.

            

<p>Then, there’s Harriet Miers who for years has whispered in Bush’s ear <i>Nobody does it Better</i> (the same lyrics Bush was using to praise Fema’s Michael Brown) and <i>First Time Ever I saw Your Face</i> as she scribbled cutesy, little notes about her admiration for him and his smarts.  

            

<p>Of course, Bush ignored Cindy Sheehan even though her rendition of <i>I am Woman</i> was loud and clearly roared to galvanize the anti-war movement outside the Crawford getaway and, then, served as a backdrop for September’s monumental Peace Rally.  

 

<p>At the top of the charts and looping through the President’s mind has to be <i>A Worried Man</i> as he realizes that all of us who disapprove of cronyism are singing <i>Friends In Low Places</i> only to make him wish he <i>Should’ve Been A Cowboy.</i>
<p>Now, there’s all that leak, leak, leaking like a breached levee and Laura’s aria is probably <i>Baby, The Rain Must Fall</i> to which George replies,<i> “All My Trials.”</i>

By the time this investigation is over, Scooter Libby , Karl Rove, and maybe even Dick Cheney could be joining Tom Delay in a quartet of <i>Folsom Prison Blues</i> accompanied by that old curmudgeon, Robert Novak, even though he’s just a bit player in the opera.  And Bush, himself, with more than half the population saying he should be impeached if it’s shown he lied in stating the rationale for war in Iraq, could be singing <i>I Walk the Line</i>. He should, of course, since the death toll of our troops is nearing 2,000 and many more than that have been maimed and psychologically damaged.  Add the tragedy of the huge number of Iraqis who have been killed as well as the terrorists we’ve inspired and all Americans may be wailing <i>Masters of War.</i>
<p> It is time to form a chorus, louder than any “background noise” George W. Bush, this temporary American Idol, has heard thus far.  It should be thunderous in its intensity so that he, finally, is held accountable and hears over and over in his head for the rest of his life <i>I’ve Just Destroyed the World.</i>
