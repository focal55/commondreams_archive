<p>OSLO  - Hurricane Katrina has spurred debate about 
global warming worldwide with some environmentalists sniping at 
President George W. Bush for pulling out of the main U.N. plan 
for braking climate change.
<p> Experts agree it is impossible to say any one storm is 
caused by rising temperatures. Numbers of tropical cyclones 
like hurricanes worldwide are stable at about 90 a year 
although recent U.S. research shows they may be becoming more 
intense.</p><p> Still, the European Commission, the World Bank, some 
environmentalists, Australia's Greens and even Sweden's king 
said the disaster, feared to have killed thousands of people in 
the United States, could be a portent of worse to come.</p><p> "As climate change is happening, we know that the frequency 
of these disasters will increase as well as the scope," 
European Commission spokeswoman Barbara Helfferich said.</p><p> "If we let climate change continue like it is continuing, 
we will have to deal with disasters like that," she said. She 
said it was wrong to say Katrina was caused by global warming 
widely blamed on emissions from cars, power plants and 
factories.</p><p> Sweden's King Carl XVI Gustaf told reporters he was deeply 
shaken by the damage and suffering of millions of people.</p><p> "It is quite clear that the world's climate is changing and 
we should take note," he said. "The hurricane catastrophe in 
the United States should be a wake-up call for all of us."</p><p> Climate change policies sharply divide Bush from most of 
his allies which have signed up for caps on emissions of 
greenhouse gases under the U.N.'s Kyoto protocol. Bush pulled 
out of Kyoto in 2001, saying it was too expensive and wrongly 
excluded developing nations from a first round of caps to 2012.</p><p> In July this year, Bush launched a six-nation plan to 
combat climate change with Australia, China, India, Japan and 
South Korea focused on a shift to cleaner energy technology. 
Unlike Kyoto, it stops short of setting caps on emissions.

</p><p> SEA LEVEL RISE</p><p> U.N. studies say a build-up of greenhouse gases is likely 
to cause more storms, floods and desertification and could 
raise sea levels by up to a meter by 2100.</p><p> Sea level rise could expose coasts vulnerable to storms 
because levees would be swamped more easily. Some scientists 
dispute the forecasts and the United States is investing more 
heavily than any other nation on climate research.</p><p> In Australia, the opposition Greens party said Katrina was 
aggravated by global warming and criticized Bush for pulling 
out of Kyoto. The United States, the world's biggest polluter, 
and Australia are the only rich nations outside Kyoto.</p><p> "It demonstrates the massive economic, as well as 
environmental and social penalties, of George Bush's policies," 
Greens leader Bob Brown told Reuters. He did not believe Bush 
would shift to embrace Kyoto-style caps on emissions.</p><p> Concerns were also voiced in Germany.</p><p> "The U.S. must be more involved," Gerda Hasselfeldt, a 
leading German candidate to become environment minister if the 
conservative opposition wins the September 18 election, told 
n-tv television.</p><p> In the United States, the focus has been far more on 
tackling the human disaster than on links to climate change.</p><p> "People are still reeling from the tragedy," said Katie 
Mandes, a director at the Washington-based Pew Center, a 
climate change think-tank. "Politically it's too early to tell 
what it will mean for Americans' views."</p><p> Ian Johnson, the World Bank's top environmental official, 
said Katrina could also be a wake-up call for developing 
nations, many of which are vulnerable.</p><p> An opinion survey published this week showed that 79 
percent of Americans feel global warming poses an "important" 
or "very important" threat to their country in the next 10 
years. Worries among Europeans were even higher.</p><p> Taken before Katrina in June, the Transatlantic Trends 
survey showed that Americans felt more threatened than 
Europeans by terrorism, Islamic extremism, weapons of mass 
destruction and economic downturn.</p><p> Some individual climatic disasters in the past have changed 
perceptions about climate change. Steve Sawyer, climate change 
director at Greenpeace, said that ice storms in Canada in the 
late 1990s had dramatically raised public concerns.</p><p> Greenpeace called Katrina a "wake-up call about the dangers 
of continued global fossil fuel dependency."</p><p> Recent research by Kerry Emanuel, a leading U.S. hurricane 
researcher, shows the intensity of hurricanes -- the wind 
speeds and the duration -- seems to have risen by about 70 
percent in the past 30 years.</p><p> "Globally a new signal may be emerging in rising 
intensity," said Tom Knutson, a research meteorologist at the 
U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Higher 
water temperatures in future may lead to more storms. 
Hurricanes need temperatures of about 26.5 C (80F) to form.</p>
