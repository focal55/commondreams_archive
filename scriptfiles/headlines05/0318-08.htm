<p> WASHINGTON -- Environmental and public interest groups are girding for renewed battle over oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge after the Senate endorsed the idea, handing a key victory to President George W. Bush and proponents of exploration.

<P>Senators voted 51-49 Wednesday in favor of a budget resolution that assumes drilling fees would generate $5 billion in revenues over the next decade. The federal government and state of Alaska, the site of the refuge, would split the money.

<P>''This razor-thin vote is by no means a mandate to drill in the arctic refuge,'' said Carl Pope, executive director of the Sierra Club. ''A strong, bipartisan coalition of Senators, backed by the will of the American people, will press on with a vigilant campaign to keep the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge where it belongs: wild and free and out of the budget.''

<P>The vote dealt a body blow to activists who had lobbied long and hard to block any move toward drilling in one of the last unspoiled regions of wilderness in North America.

<P>At issue is about 1.5 million acres of coastal plain within the refuge, which covers 19 million acres in total. Oil industry representatives have said that drilling would be limited to about 2,000 acres within the 1.5 million acres, and that it could be done with minimal environmental damage.

<P>For drilling to take place, the senators would have to pass a separate measure explicitly authorizing drilling in the refuge. Then the House of Representatives would have to explicitly authorize drilling. The House has endorsed arctic drilling in previous years and is expected to do so again this year so advocates from both sides saw this week's Senate vote as crucial.

<P>The narrow margin by which supporters of drilling prevailed could portend intense debate, however, and lobbyists geared up Thursday and Friday to add as many votes as possible to their camp.

<P>A vote on the same matter last year defeated drilling 52-48 but the Republican party picked up four Senate seats in November, changing the chamber's voting arithmetic.

<P>Seven Republicans and the Senate's lone independent sided with Democrats in opposing drilling this week. Three Democrats crossed party lines to give Republicans their two-vote victory.

<P>Congress has failed to approve a final budget each of the last two years, largely because of add-ons promoting specific positions on abortion, creationism, or other politically prickly issues.

<P>This week's vote ''only succeeded in adding more controversy to an already controversial and difficult budget process,'' said Buck Parker, executive director of Earthjustice, a California-based public interest law firm.

<P>A failure to pass a budget this year would nullify the Senate approval and require a drilling bill to get not just 50 votes but rather the 60 votes necessary to spare it from a filibuster, a procedural tactic in which lengthy speeches are used to stall a vote on a given measure.

<P>Bush, in a statement, applauded the Senate vote. ''A reliable domestic supply of energy is important to America's security and prosperity,'' he said, adding that the refuge eventually could yield up to one million barrels of oil a day.

<P>The United States uses about 20.8 million barrels of oil a day. If the refuge were opened to drilling, its oil would take about a decade to come online, Senate Democrats said, adding that conservation efforts and tighter fuel standards could make a greater impact much sooner.

<P>''Drilling the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge won't make a dent in gas prices at the pump or break our dependence on Middle East oil,'' said Karen Wayland, legislative director at the Natural Resources Defense Council.

<P>The U.S. Energy Information Administration has estimated that Americans' energy demand could increase by about 30 percent over the next 20 years. Democrats said that if Americans somehow managed to hold their oil consumption at today's levels, the refuge might hold a total of six months' worth of the fuel.

<P>The American Petroleum Institute, representing the oil industry, said 10.4 billion barrels of oil were thought to lie beneath the tundra and this estimate could double once exploration started. The refuge ''could provide the equivalent of current oil imports from Saudi Arabia for more than 20 years,'' it said in a statement.

<P>Coal, oil, and gas provide 86 percent of U.S. energy consumption, the Government Accountability Office, Congress's investigative arm, reported this week. It urged policymakers to curb demand and to avoid sudden or short-lived policy changes so consumers, suppliers, and investors get ''consistent signals'' and don't contribute to the volatility of energy prices.

<P>This week's Senate vote also could ease the way for Congress to pass Bush's energy plan, which collapsed during his first term amid disagreement over Alaska drilling.

<P>A Zogby International poll found last December that 55 percent of Americans favored keeping oil companies out of the arctic refuge.

<P>The area is home to pristine tundra and some 100 bird and animal species. Native Alaskan communities along the coastal plain live off the land and water. For many, caribou in particular represent a cultural compass point and a staple of their diet.

<P>President Dwight Eisenhower, a Republican, created the refuge in 1960. Congress expanded it in 1980 and said the 1.5 million acre coastal plain could be opened to oil development only if lawmakers specifically authorized it. Efforts to get them to do so began soon after.
