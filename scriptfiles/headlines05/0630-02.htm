<p>Reports of the alleged kidnapping by the US secret services in 2003 of an Egyptian Islamic cleric in Italy forced the government into an embarrassed denial of any knowledge or involvement in the operation and into summoning the US ambassador to provide an explanation.</p>
<p>"Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has summoned the American ambassador in Italy to clarify the affair of the Imam Abou Omar," Minister for Parliamentary Relations, Carlo Giovanardi, told the Italian senate, saying the ambassador would probably meet Berlusconi Friday.</p>
<p>"This operation was never brought to the attention of the republic," Giovanardi said. "It is out of the question that an operation of this type would have been authorized (by the Italian government) and that the Italian secret services had played any part."</p>
<p>Osama Mustafa Hassan, also known as Abu Omar, was seized in a Milan street on February 17, 2003, by two Italian-speakers claiming to want to check his identity. He has been missing ever since.</p>

<p>The incident two years ago made the news last week when the Corriere della Sera daily reported that a judge had issued arrest warrants for 13 agents of the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).</p>
<p>They are suspected of abducting Hassan and taking him to the US military base at Aviano in northern Italy before transferring him to Egypt, where his entourage claim he was tortured during interrogation.</p>
<p>Corriere della Sera said Thursday that even if Rome did not know about the abduction "it would be strange that the government had not asked the secret service for a report on such an embarrassing affair". </p>
<p>The CIA "told a number of people" in the Italian secret service about its kidnapping plan, but "certainly not the magistrate, nor the Milan police," an unnamed CIA veteran told The Washington Post.</p>
<p>The paper's sources said the CIA station chief in Rome -- who has since retired but remains undercover -- briefed and sought approval from his counterpart in Italy for the operation, but it was unclear how far up the chain of command the information was shared or whether Berlusconi's office was aware.</p>
<p>Intelligence officials also told the Post that the CIA had conducted more than 100 such apprehensions since September 11.</p>
<p>This latest affair is the second incident in only a matter of months to strain Italy's relations with the United States following the killing of its secret service agent Nicola Calipari at a US checkpoint as he was escorting a freed Italian hostage to Baghdad airport in March.</p>
<p>Berlusconi will likely feel obliged to give some public expression to his displeasure only a week before a Group of Eight summit of most industrialized countries in Scotland, where he will meet US President George W. Bush, of whom he boasts to be one of the closest allies in Europe.</p>
