<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --> BRUNSWICK, Maine -  Appearances are deceiving in the case of Kathy Kelly. 
<p> The high-profile peace activist visited Brunswick to protest the weekend's air show and promote her eternal message of peace; but rummaging through luggage in her hosts' car after returning from Peaks Island, Kelly looked more like a tourist stretching the last days of summer. 
<p> With her characteristically peaceful and almost otherworldly expression, Kelly hardly looks like an outraged, demanding poster-child for extremist government protests, as some who don't hold her views have portrayed her.

A VOICE IN THE WILDERNESS <br>
Kathy Kelly, founder of <a href="http://vitw.org/" target="_new">Voices in the Wilderness</a>, enjoys some quiet moments at a Brunswick home Monday afternoon following a weekend of speaking engagements throughout the Mid-coast region about her peacemaking activities in Iraq and elsewhere.

Yet, no one can deny that this serene woman stirs things up. Kelly has made 26 trips to Iraq, repeatedly defying U.S. sanctions. She also landed herself in federal prison three times for her efforts to promote peace by challenging the U.S. war machine. 
<p> Standing just over 5 feet tall, with a heavy ponytail of graying brown hair, Kelly resembles a child, but it's her child-like faith in peace that initially prodded her to follow her convictions to what she believes to be their logical &#8212; if sometimes unpleasant &#8212; end. 
<p> "I was, I suppose, a very pious child," she said during an interview at her hosts' home in Brunswick Monday afternoon. Although Kelly has told her story to hundreds of media outlets, she seems contemplative and unsure as if she's telling it for the first time. 
<p> An Irish Catholic, Kelly went to Mass every day and adored the nuns who furnished most of her education.  "There was plenty coming from Scripture and pulpit that said, 'Don't kill,'" she said. 
<p> When she entered college, Kelly found her ideological soulmates among pacifists, a group that said, "You don't let convenience interfere with your conscience."  
<p> They taught Kelly to pare her yearly income below the $3,000 taxable level so she wouldn't have to support national defense through federal taxes, something she has been doing since the 1980s. 
<p> Although Kelly says her chief gripe is with the military, she has trouble finding anything about government &#8212; and particularly the U.S. government &#8212; she approves of. 
<p> But it's not the government she's pointing fingers at by speaking out against the Great State of Maine Airshow. Rather, during her third trip to Brunswick this weekend, she tried to hold a mirror to the 200,000 who cheered at the Navy's aerobatics feats, asking them, "Is this the best way to use our resources?"  
<p> "When you find yourself in one of the most beautiful settings in the world along, the coast of Maine, enjoying Peaks Island, you immediately feel a reverence for the natural resources this country is blessed with," she said. 
<p> "It's one thing to be looking at the weapons and another thing to be on the receiving end," she said, giving examples of injured Iraqi children and disillusioned Marines responsible for inflicting damage. 
<p> She admits that for many people, including her former students, the military offers a ticket out of poverty and misery, but said her full support lies with those who are smart enough not to enlist in the first place, even if it means going to jail. 
<p> The real question, according to Kelly, isn't about supporting the troops but rather whether Americans, whose country was born from warfare, are tired of maintaining their lifestyles by causing death throughout the world.  
<p> "Are we as Americans ready to say with George Bush Sr., in Rio de Janeiro at an energy conference in 1992, that the American way of life is non-negotiable?" she asked, wondering when the country's priorities will change from material good to moral good. 
<p> "The real religion is shopping," she said, which is evidenced by U.S. refusal to buy oil at market price and while Iraqi children starve. 
<p> As for the war in Iraq, the solution for Kelly is for U.S. troops to leave. "As long as the U.S. presence is there, I think that's going to occasion any Iraqi attacks on civilian establishments seen to support the United States," she said. 
<p> She'd like the military to follow the example of her organization that closed its Iraqi headquarters when its presence, as a 'Western' organization, threatened its Iraqi friends. 
<p> She'd like timetables for withdrawal of all troops in Iraq, the United States to pay free market prices for barrels of oil and for Americans to leave their good-paying jobs in the rebuilding Iraq to struggling Iraqi citizens.  
<p> But she doesn't expect that to happen soon. "I think the midterm elections will arrive sooner," she said, referring to the role that the American political process plays in shaping events in Iraq. 
<p> Kelly expects Republicans, wanting to keep their majority in Congress, will move troops to nearby bases in a symbolic effort of progress, she said. 
<p> But even if every U.S. soldier left Iraq, Kelly would be unsatisfied until the nation had fully dismantled its army. 
<p> "We could take that $524 billion and use it for peace activity," she said, citing projects like inter-city train lines to improve infrastructure.   
<p> This morning Kelly flew back to Chicago. Today she will start fasting until the end of the month to urge the International Monetary Fund to cancel all Iraq's war debt. Next month she will organize efforts in 100 cities across the United States and United Kingdom to ring bells signifying each Iraqi mortality. The following months bring more fasts and protests between steady speaking engagements and facing prison again for refusing to pay fines. After Iraq, she will focus on North Korea, Haiti and Iran, which also need a voice, she said. But will that voice always reside in the wilderness of American society? 
<p> Kelly doesn't think so: she's starting a new group called <a href="http://vcnv.org/" target="_new">Voices For Creative Non-Violence</a>.
