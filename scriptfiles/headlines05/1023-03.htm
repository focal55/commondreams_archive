<p>WASHINGTON -- The Pentagon paid $20 apiece for plastic ice cube trays that once cost it 85 cents. It paid a supplier more than $81 apiece for coffeemakers that it bought for years for just $29 from the manufacturer.</p>
<p>That's because instead of getting competitive bids or buying directly from manufacturers like it used to, the Pentagon is using middlemen who set their own prices. It's the equivalent of shopping for weekly groceries at a convenience store.</p>
<p>And it's costing taxpayers 20 percent more than the old system, a Knight Ridder investigation found.</p>

<p>The higher prices are the result of a Defense Department purchasing program called prime vendor, which favors a handful of firms. Run by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), the program is based on a military procurement strategy to speed delivery of supplies such as bananas and bolts to troops in the field.</p>
<p>Military bases still have the option of getting competitive bids, but the Pentagon has encouraged them to use the prime vendor system. At the DLA's main purchasing center in Philadelphia, prime vendor sales increased from $2.3 billion in 2002 to $7.4 billion in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30.</p>
<p>The Defense Department touts the program as one of its "best practices" and credits it with timely deliveries that have eliminated the need for expensive inventories and warehousing. For purchases under the food prime-vendor program alone, DLA claimed a savings of $250 million in five years.</p>
<p>But those savings would have happened even without turning to the prime vendor program, competing suppliers say. For years, most suppliers have offered goods on an as-needed basis so that the military doesn't need to store them in costly warehouses.</p>
<p>Knight Ridder chose to examine just one aspect of military purchasing - food equipment - but the prime vendor program is being used increasingly for everything the Pentagon buys.</p>
<p>"There is nothing prime about the program. In fact, it's very expensive," said Keith Ashdown, vice president of the Washington-based nonprofit Taxpayers for Common Sense. "They have reduced competition and now we're seeing them pay higher prices."</p>
<p>In response, DLA warned that comparing prime vendor and non-prime vendor prices - as Knight Ridder did - is "extremely difficult" because shipping, installation and special modifications to items may result in higher charges.</p>
<p>Though DLA officials refused to be interviewed for this story, they did answer some questions by e-mail.</p>

<p>DLA said that price comparisons "do not take into account the large investment, infrastructure and manpower savings the government realizes from its prime vendor program." Others say these are savings that would be realized in any event, as long as the government bought from suppliers, prime or non-prime, willing to deliver just in time.</p>
<p>In thousands of purchases of food service equipment items, Knight Ridder found massive markups. The case of a special 7-foot refrigerator-freezer for airplanes illustrates the problem.</p>
<p>MGR Equipment Co. of Inwood, N.Y., which makes the unit, charged DLA  $17,267 in 2003 for each one. That's the price that MGR President Gerald Ross said he charges everyone.</p>
<p>In September 2004, prime vendor Lankford Sysco Food Services Inc. sold the government nine MGR refrigerators for $32,642.50 apiece - a markup of 89 percent. The government paid $138,445 extra, when all prices were adjusted for inflation into 2005 dollars.</p>
<p>"We'd like to see the government get the best pricing, but we get the same amount regardless of whether we sell to (a prime vendor) or whatever," Ross said. "The government is aware of this. They're aware they're paying a premium for going through prime vendors."</p>
<p>Lankford Sysco didn't respond to three phone calls for comment.</p>
<p>The markups upset Charles Jones, president of Commercial Marketing Co., a Columbia, S.C., vendor cut out of the prime vendor program. He sells kitchen equipment, but because of the prime vendor program, his sales are limited to just a few bases.</p>
<p>"What value is this prime vendor program adding? Zero," Jones said. "We think it's a crooked deal."</p>
<p>Another government agency, the General Services Administration, has its own purchasing system that the military can use. And it's cheaper.</p>

<p>Jones and Eagle Marketing of Houston, a vendor not in the prime system, compared the DLA's prime vendor prices with how much the GSA pays for the same food service equipment.  The DLA's prime vendor prices were 39 percent higher.</p>
<p>Eagle President Paul Fellencer sends letters to potential military customers touting the lower prices he charges. For example, Fellencer pointed out in one letter that the DLA bought a warming oven for $2,089. "If this item had been purchased through a GSA contract, you would have paid only $1,727!" he said.</p>
<p>The Virginia-based DLA is the largest of the military's combat support departments. The agency "supplies almost every consumable item America's military services need to operate," according to its brochure. That amounted to $31 billion in sales in the budget year that ended Sept. 30. At DLA's lead supply center, in Philadelphia, nearly 60 percent of sales were through the prime vendor program.</p>
<p>Knight Ridder Newspapers conducted a computer database analysis of prices charged by a small segment of prime vendors and how much the DLA paid for the same items from companies outside the prime vendor program. The database comprised 122 separate food equipment items purchased by the DLA between 1996 and 2005. In all, 2.37 million pieces of equipment were involved, costing the government a total of $37 million.</p>
<p>Prices were tracked using a database run by Bidlink, an Ohio company that monitors government purchases.</p>
<p>The average prime vendor price - when adjusted for inflation - was higher for 102 of the 122 items. Even with this small sample of purchases, Knight Ridder found the government spent $1.2 million more than it needed to by using the prime vendor system.</p>
<p>A few examples illustrate how the system can cost taxpayers more than necessary:</p>
<p>In August 2003, the Defense Department paid $20.23 each for two ice cube trays from prime vendor Lankford Sysco. A month earlier, Lankford Sysco charged the department $15 apiece for two ice cube trays. But in July 2002, the Defense Department bought 171 of the same ice cube trays from Appliance Parts Distributors - not a prime vendor; the price was 85 cents each.</p>
<p>Before the prime vendor program started for food service equipment in 1999, the Defense Department bought coffeemakers from West Bend for $28.96 apiece, which, when adjusted for inflation, would now cost $33. But in March 2003 - just four years after getting the $29 coffeemakers - Lankford Sysco billed the Defense Department $81.24 for each West Bend coffeemaker.</p>

<p>This January, the Pentagon bought nine charcoal grills from the biggest of the prime vendors, Gill Marketing, paying $290 apiece. The same grill 29 months earlier cost $145 from a non-prime vendor. On average, taxpayers paid $227 in current inflation-adjusted dollars for the grill when the Pentagon used prime vendors, but only $132, when adjusted for inflation, when it bought competitively.</p>
<p>One manufacturer who previously sold directly to the government but now sells to the prime vendors said the system doesn't make sense.</p>
<p>"I resent it as a taxpayer," said the firm's chief executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of losing business. "Before we'd sell it to them (the Defense Department) at a hell of a lot less money. I don't make that money on it. Dietary (one of the prime vendors) is making money hands over fist. ... It makes no sense."</p>
<p>A second manufacturing CEO, who also asked not to be identified for the same fear of losing what little business is left, called it "three-card Monte economics." A third company president said the "prime vendor program is mismanaged; the costs are way, way too high."</p>
<p>In June, DLA announced that it had awarded the prime vendor food contracts to four companies: Dietary Equipment of Columbia, S.C.; Gill Marketing Inc. of Phoenix; JAL Enterprises of Hampton, Va.; and FEM Food Equipment Marketing Inc. of Rockville, Md.</p>
<p>Officials at Dietary, Gill, JAL and Lankford Sysco, which had been a prime vendor until this summer, either declined to speak with Knight Ridder for this story or didn't respond to repeated requests for interviews. FEM is a new prime vendor, so the database analysis didn't include purchases from FEM.</p>
<p>Dietary Equipment President Wade Hampton Oliver Jr. said in a letter last week that price isn't the only factor to consider in the prime vendor program.</p>
<p>"The prime vendor system in part replaced thousands of Department of Defense officials and allowed the closing of many Department of Defense supply depots," Oliver wrote.</p>
<p>Defenders of the prime vendor program highlight its speed: Fast deliveries eliminate the need for stocking and warehousing, shifting those costs to manufacturers and vendors. The DLA borrowed these cost-saving strategies from the private sector, which successfully experimented with the consolidation of supply chains in the 1980s.</p>

<p>It's not only the DLA and its prime vendors who extol the program. Their praise is echoed on military bases across the nation.</p>
<p>Fort Jackson in Columbia, S.C., has used a prime vendor for food since 1994 and Dietary as its prime vendor for food service equipment since 1999.</p>
<p>"The program is very effective," said Michael Heckman, a civilian who places the orders for the base. "We've got a good choice of brands."</p>
<p>The base frequently compares prices, he said. While prime vendor prices often reflect small markups, "it's nothing that would make you not want to use the prime vendor."</p>
<p>But critics of the program say the advantages offered by prime vendors are overstated.</p>
<p>"Once the order gets here, we can turn it around as fast or faster than the prime vendor," Eagle's Fellencer said.</p>
<p>Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., called for an investigation of the program.</p>
<p>"Can Congress do anything? Yes. Will Congress do anything? No," he said.</p>
<p>Tom Schatz, president of the Washington-based, nonprofit Citizens Against Government Waste, said: "It's supposed to save money, and it's well-intentioned but doesn't do what it's supposed to. People figure out how to take advantage of it."</p>
