<p>LANCASTER COUNTY, PA -  Police who detained protesters along President Bush's re-election campaign bus route didn't want the protest to deteriorate into a riot, a lawyer representing the police in a lawsuit said Monday.An attorney for East Lampeter Township police said he will file a response this month to a federal civil rights lawsuit brought by five protesters who were arrested and charged with disorderly conduct last year after they dropped their pants in protest during a presidential visit to Smoketown.

The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, accuses East Lampeter Township police, Pennsylvania State Police and U.S. Secret Service agents of violating the men's right to free speech when they were arrested and charged July 9, 2004.

<P>Minutes before President George W. Bush's re-election campaign tour bus arrived in Smoketown, seven men stripped to thong underwear and piled on top of each other in an attempt to re-create one of the photographs from the Abu Ghraib prison scandal in Iraq.

<P>The men were arrested and detained until after the president left the area. One of the men escaped from police, and the remainder became known as the Smoketown Six.

<P>One of the arrested protesters chose not to participate in the lawsuit because he no longer lives in Pennsylvania.

<P>Harrisburg attorney Robert G. Hanna Jr. of the law firm Lavery, Faherty, Young and Patterson declined to discuss the specifics of the police officers' defense, saying those questions would be answered when he files a response to the complaint.

<P>"There is a certain amount of confusion about what was going on at the time," Hanna said Monday. "The Secret Service had an overall plan, and nobody expected anything like this to happen. There was no preplanning for how they would handle this type of situation."

<P>Hanna said as a First Amendment claim, the case boils down to whether the plaintiffs had a right to demonstrate.

<P>"We have to sort through not only the elements of the case, but also who actually participated," Hanna said. "One of the (defense) parties simply provided transportation. It just so happens that the officer who provided the transportation also wrote up the charges, so he got sued even though he didn't actually participate."

<P>When the plaintiffs made similar demonstrations at other political events involving the president, demonstration areas were in place to accommodate them, Hanna said.

<P>"This was hardly a spontaneous event," Hanna said. "Unfortunately, they chose the most offensive place in the world to do this: very conservative Lancaster County with many angry people nearby. What these officers didn't want was a situation that deteriorated into a riot."

<P>Hanna said he also questions whether the police officers had knowledge of the political events that shaped the demonstration.

<P>"One of the officers told me he had never even seen that particular photograph from the prison in Iraq," Hanna said. "He thought this was a bunch of college kids who were attempting to moon the president. That type of conduct would not have been protected by the First Amendment."

<P>The lawsuit, filed last month by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of the protesters, was recently amended because it named several civilians who were listed as witnesses to the demonstration.

<P>"The suit named certain civilians who were not participants," Hanna said. "We surmise that what happened was the lawyers for the plaintiffs saw the witness list and just started suing people."

<P>In October, District Attorney Donald Totaro dropped the disorderly conduct charges against the protesters, saying that while their actions were distasteful, "offensive conduct alone is not sufficient to convict."

<P>Prosecutors would have needed to prove the demonstrators' actions served no legitimate purpose, Totaro said. His office could not pursue the charges because the actions were designed to protest U.S. policy in Iraq.

<P>"Any attempt to pursue a criminal prosecution under the current legal standards imposed by our courts would not further the ends of justice, but would only serve to advance the agenda of six protesters through a very public forum," Totaro said in a statement in October.

<P>Named in the civil rights lawsuit are East Lampeter Township police Officers Christopher Witmer, James Ely and Christopher Jones; state police Troopers Linda Geron, Blaine Hertzog and Wayne Kline; five unknown state officials and five unknown federal "employees, agents or actors."

<P>Plaintiffs include Tristan Egolf, 33, of West Lemon Street; David J.C. O'Bryant, 21, of Ruby Street; Jonathan A. Kohler, 22, of North Marshall Street; Benjamin Keely, 23, of West Lemon Street and Adam Clayton Willard, 21, of South Lime Street.

<P>Attorney Paula Knudsen of the Harrisburg ACLU and Lancaster attorney J. Dwight Yoder of Gibble, Kraybill and Hess are representing the men.

<P>"We feel very strongly that the First Amendment rights of these individuals were violated," Yoder said. "They had the right to engage in a peaceful symbolic protest, which is what they did. They did not engage or confront anyone around them. Under those circumstances, it's hard to understand why the police would have thought there was a possibility for violence or chaos."

<P>Egolf, the group's unofficial spokesman, remains unapologetic.

<P>"We'll humor (the police) as far as they're willing to take it," Egolf said Monday. "We'd love to discuss this in the Supreme Court."

<P>U.S. District Court Judge Paul Diamond has been assigned to hear the case.<p align="center">&copy; 2005 Lancaster Newspapers</p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable --></font></td></tr>
