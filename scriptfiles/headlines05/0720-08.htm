<p>NEW DELHI - More than 30 years after the United States 
walked out of a nuclear cooperation agreement with India, because it 
conducted an atomic test, the two countries have agreed to resume 
collaboration in civilian nuclear energy.<p>
							  
A joint-statement issued by US President George W. Bush and visiting 
Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in Washington on Tuesday said the US 
would now ''work with friends and allies to adjust international regimes 
to enable full civil nuclear energy and trade with India.'' 
<p>
Essentially, this means that Washington has now accepted India as a 
nuclear weapons-state (NWS) although it is euphemistically referred to 
as ''a state with advanced nuclear technology''. 
<p>
That would entail a dilution of the global nuclear regime, founded on the 
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which only recognizes five NWSs. 
All five crossed the atomic threshold before 1967 while India became a 
self-declared NWS only in 1998. 
<p>
The US-India agreement is likely to run into problems on the supply side, 
in the US and in the Nuclear Suppliers' Group comprising 44 relatively 
industrialized states as well as on the recipient side - India. 
<p>
Under the agreement signed between Bush and Singh, the US has promised to 
sell nuclear materials and equipment to India and also to involve it 
in  'advanced' areas of research. 
<p>

Interestingly, this could mean a role for India in the International 
Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) which will experiment with 
fusion reactions that release  energy when nuclei are forced together - 
unlike fission in which nuclei are split to release energy.
 
In return, India would ''assume the same responsibilities'' and ''acquire 
the same benefits and advantages as other leading countries with advanced 
nuclear technology''  that could only be read as nuclear weapon states.  
<p>
Besides ''working to prevent the global proliferation of weapons of mass 
destruction'', India would take a series of steps towards ''identifying 
and separating civilian and military nuclear facilities and programs.''
<p>
India would also be required to file a declaration regarding its 
civilians facilities with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
and place them under its safeguards, continue its ''unilateral moratorium 
on nuclear testing'' and work with the US for the ''conclusion of a 
multilateral Fissile Material Cut-Off Treaty''.  
<p>
India would also ''secure nuclear materials and technology through 
comprehensive export control legislation'' and through ''adherence to 
Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) and Nuclear Suppliers' Group 
(NSG) guidelines'' although it is not a member of either grouping. 
<p>
There are deep divisions within the US establishment over restructuring 
the global nuclear order to accommodate India. For instance, security 
experts like Ashley J. Tellis advocate that the US should integrate India 
into the global non-proliferation regime by treating it as a de facto 
nuclear state and transferring nuclear technology to new facilities, but 
under safeguards. 
<p>
Others like George Perkovich argue that the ''the US and others should 
not adjust the nuclear non-proliferation regime to accommodate India's 
desire for access to nuclear technology - The costs of breaking faith 
with non-nuclear weapons states such as Japan, South Africa, Brazil, 
Argentina, Sweden and others who forswore nuclear weapons [are] too high 
to warrant accommodating India's nuclear desires''. 
<p>
These states are also NSG members and could put up stiff resistance to 
Bush's promise to relax the global non-proliferation regime. The NSG's 
guidelines are tougher than many IAEA safeguards. 
<p>
Resistance is likely from within the Indian establishment too. ''The 
first problem with the agreement is that it misses the point about the 
extremely limited scope for meaningful nuclear cooperation between India 
and US,'' argues A Gopalakrishnan, a nuclear engineer and former chairman 
of India's Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (IAERB). 
<p>
''The US has no worthwhile current expertise in the design, construction, 
operation, maintenance or safety of any of the type of reactors existing 
or envisaged in the Indian nuclear power program,'' Gopalakrishnan 
said.  

<p>
India's reactors include two obsolete US-built enriched uranium-boiling 
water reactors  more than a dozen reactors which burn natural uranium 
with heavy water, and fast-breeder reactors. The US has no commercial 
natural uranium-based heavy water reactors, the mainstay of the Indian 
nuclear power program.
<p>
While India could change its nuclear technology trajectory from natural 
to enriched uranium and import US-made reactors this would make it too 
dependent as India has not been able to enrich uranium in large enough 
quantities. 
<p>
External dependence is unacceptable to many Indian policy-makers, 
especially in the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE), which has had an 
unpleasant experience with procuring enriched uranium fuel for two US-
built reactors at Tarapur, near the western port city of Mumbai.  
<p>
India does need raw uranium too because its existing mines are rapidly 
depleting and there is popular resistance to the opening of new mines. 
Importing uranium will need relaxation of NSG guidelines and the US has 
promised to bring this about. 
<p>
''Yet, it is far from clear that the other 43 members of the NSG will 
agree,'' says a high-level DAE source, who requested anonymity. ''In the 
past, the NSG failed to reach a consensus on supply of enriched uranium 
for Tarapur. The guidelines demand full-scope safeguards under the IAEA. 
This is something we in the DAE are unwilling to fall in line with''. 
<p>
The same source said it is difficult to isolate India's civilian nuclear 
facilities and activities from military ones. Often, the two occur in the 
same location or laboratory. So having IAEA inspectors will interfere 
with India's ''sovereignty''. 
<p>
''Besides most DAE scientists would be loath to subject, say, fast-
breeder reactors to IAEA safeguards. They are the next stage in our 
energy independence plans, and will pave the way for the use of thorium, 
of which India has an abundance. We in the DAE believe in the doctrine of 
self-reliance and independence in matters nuclear,'' the source said.  
<p>
However, this belief is not supported by facts. In the past, India has 
lawfully imported or clandestinely bought nuclear technology or materials 
from diverse sources like the US, China, the former USSR, Russia, France, 
Norway and Britain. 
<p>

But the idea of nuclear self-reliance remains an article of faith with 
many DAE officials and scientists. One of them, A.N. Prasad, a former 
director of the Bhabha Atomic Research Center, has been quoted as saying 
that allowing IAEA safeguards ''goes against the national interest''. 
<p>
Thus the Indo-US deal does not have the full support of the principal 
Indian agency responsible for its execution. It is also likely to run 
into rough weather politically because there is no broad consensus on the 
issue of safeguards or conformity with NSG and MTCR guidelines. 
<p>
There is the trickier issue of India agreeing to extend its moratorium on 
conducting nuclear weapons tests. In 1995-96, the Comprehensive Test Ban 
Treaty was vehemently opposed by a cross-section of political parties but 
after the 1998 blasts, India unilaterally declared a moratorium on 
further tests.
<p>
Reiterating that commitment in a joint declaration with the US is sure to 
raise fears about loss of - sovereignty” and vulnerability to pressure 
from Washington and is fraught with political consequences at home. 
<p>
The emphasis in the agreement on promoting nuclear power  to 
meet ''growing global energy demands in a cleaner and more efficient 
manner'' is likely to invite opposition from India's environmentalist 
movement. 
<p>
Environmentalists have pointed to the grave hazards posed by nuclear 
technology through its propensity for serious accidents, and the problem 
of high-level radioactive wastes which remain menacing for tens of 
thousands of years.</p>
