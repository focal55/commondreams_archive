''While these engineering solutions help provide food, water, and electricity for many people, they have also severely disrupted the functioning of aquatic ecosystems.''</p><p><!--/beginimage/-->

        </table><!--/endimage/--> According to the report, for example:<p>--Dam construction affects more than half of the world's major river systems and more than three-quarters of large river systems in the United States, Canada, Europe, and the former Soviet Union. More than 45,000 large dams now exist, up from 5,000 in 1950.</p><p>''Dams contribute to species and habitat loss, deter fish migration, destroy natural flow patterns, and alter water temperature and nutrient and sediment transport,'' Postel wrote.</p><p>--Pollution, especially from increasing amounts of fertilizer, pesticides, heavy metals, and synthetic chemicals, are being released into aquatic ecosystems, drastically altering the chemistry of lakes, rivers, and streams.</p><p>These pollutants lessen the safety of drinking water, harm fish and wildlife, and lead to the spread of oxygen-depleted ''dead zones.'' In particular, use of nitrogen fertilizer, implicated in the spread of these zones, has increased eightfold since 1960.</p><p>--Climate change linked to the buildup of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is expected to shift rainfall and runoff patterns, melt glaciers and shrink snowpacks, and increase the number and intensity of floods and droughts.</p><p>Rivers, lakes, wetlands, and other freshwater ecosystems provide a myriad of services that are essential to human welfare, according to the report.</p><p>''Healthy watersheds are nature's water factories and it pays to protect them,'' said Postel. ''Forests and wetlands can churn out high-quality water supplies at a lower cost than conventional treatment plants do while providing many other valuable benefits at the same time, from recreational enjoyment to biodiversity conservation to climate protection.''</p><p>Prevailing water management systems are plagued by waste and inefficiency, placing unnecessary strain on natural water sources. It is common for cities to lose 20-50 percent of their water to leaks and other problems in the distribution system.</p><p>Taiwan, for example, loses nearly 2 million cubic meters of water a day to leakage--roughly equal to 325 million flushes of a toilet, the report said.</p><p>''Governments and utilities continue to spend taxpayer and customer dollars on expensive dams and treatment plants while a third or more of their existing supply is leaking away,'' it added.
<p>
By reducing waste and encouraging conservation, cities can leave more water in rivers and lakes, build fewer and smaller dams, pump less groundwater, and reduce the amount of energy and chemicals needed to treat and distribute their supply, according to Worldwatch.
<p>
The report credited what it termed ''forward-thinking cities and municipalities'' with discovering that it is more cost-effective to employ nature's services rather than further destroy them. It cited examples including:
<p>
--New York City, which in 1997 reached an agreement with local and federal officials, environmental organizations, and 70 towns to spend $1.5 billion over 10 years on watershed protection and conservation measures, thereby avoiding construction of a filtration plant that would cost $6 billion to build and $300 million a year to operate. As of 2004, the city had invested more than $1 billion in the watershed program.
<p>
--Bogota, Colombia, which through successful conservation efforts has delayed the need to build new water supply facilities for at least 20 years. By protecting the natural filtering capacity of wetlands in its watershed, the city also keeps treatment costs low. Today, 95 percent of households in Bogota have potable water and 87 percent have sewage services.
<p>
--The Boston metropolitan area, where water use hit a 50-year low in 2004 due to an aggressive conservation program launched in the late 1980s that has indefinitely postponed a proposed diversion of the Connecticut River, saving residents more than $500 million in capital expenditures.
<p>
Watershed protection also could help quell hunger among 852 million people in poor countries, the report said.
<p>
Rainwater harvesting methods coupled with affordable small-plot irrigation technologies are enabling poor farmers to boost crop outputs by using local water supplies more effectively, it said. Better management of soils, water, and nutrients has quadrupled irrigated rice yields in parts of Madagascar while also saving water.
<p>

With 5 million children dying each year from malnutrition, equitable access to water for the poor is ever more crucial as governments seek to meet the U.N. Millennium Development Goals of reducing hunger, poverty, and child mortality, the report said.
<p>
Postel said watershed protection also could prove crucial in mitigating disasters.
<p>
''Distinguishing a natural disaster from a human-induced one is getting more difficult,'' she said. While storms, droughts, floods, and tidal waves are natural events, the degree to which they produce disastrous outcomes is heavily influenced by human actions. The Indian Ocean tsunami of December 2004, for example, showed that clearing of mangroves and destruction of other aquatic habitats make coastal communities even more vulnerable to flooding.
<p>
For the same reason people buy home and life insurance--to avoid catastrophic losses--societies need to ''buy'' disaster insurance by investing in the protection of watersheds, floodplains, and wetlands, Worldwatch said.</p><p align="center">&copy; 2005 OneWorld.net</p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable --></font></td></tr>
