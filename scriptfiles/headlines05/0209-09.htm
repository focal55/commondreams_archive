<p>WASHINGTON - Despite a sharp increase in the amount of money President George W. Bush  wants Congress to provide in foreign aid next year, development activists say it is not as much as Bush himself had previously promised.

<P>At an international summit on development finance in Monterrey, Mexico, 2002, Bush--who had been criticized at the time for not joining major global initiatives such as the Kyoto Protocol -- surprised his audience by promising to increase U.S. development assistance by 50 percent, or US$5 billion, by fiscal year (FY) 2006.

<P>"The United States will lead by example," he told his fellow leaders. "I have proposed a 50 percent increase in our core development assistance over the next three budget years. Eventually, this will mean a $5 billion annual increase over current levels."

<P>Three years later, Bush is indeed proposing a sharp increase to development aid--by some 17 percent in FY06--or $3 billion over FY05 level. But, as noted by development activists, this amount still falls short of the Monterrey commitment.

<P>"We acknowledge and welcome the overall increase in the Foreign Operations budget," said Mary McClymont, CEO of Interaction--a coalition of more than 160 private U.S. development and relief agencies--Tuesday. "We are concerned, however, that some core development programs were cut or funded at last year's levels during a time when there is increased need around the world."

<P>"Not only do these core programs help people help themselves, they are also an important element for making the world more stable and America safer," she noted.

<P>The foreign aid request--which must still work its way through Congress--is part of the proposed FY06 federal budget unveiled by the administration Monday. The budget, which also requests $419 billion in defense spending, does not include some $75 billion more the administration is asking Congress to approve as a supplemental appropriation to fund U.S. military operations in Iraq  and Afghanistan.

<P>The total foreign aid request--$22.9 billion, or roughly six percent of the Pentagon's budget--includes about $9 billion in military and security assistance, chiefly for Israel, Egypt, and other strategic allies in the Middle East and elsewhere.

<P>Most of the remainder consists of development assistance and contributions to international organizations, such as the World Bank, the UN, and peacekeeping operations.

<P>Bush is asking Congress for $3 billion for his Millennium Challenge Account (MCA)--a program designed to reward poor countries that are committed to economic and political reforms, fighting corruption, and protecting human rights--which he launched at the Monterrey Summit. Indeed, when Bush announced his intention to increase development aid by $5 billion, he said the additional money would be channeled through the MCA.

<P>The fact that Bush is asking for $3 billion, rather than the promised $5 billion, however, has come as a major disappointment to development advocates. They charge that the administration had failed to push the program--which is administered by a quasi-public Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC)--aggressively both with respect to launching it and persuading Congress to fund it fully in FY04 and FY05.

<P>"They really sat on their hands and did not get this program on line," said Stephen Radelet of the Center for Global Development (CGD). He noted that Congress has appropriated $2.5 billion--$2.0 billion dollars less than Bush had originally requested--for the MCC to date, but the agency has yet to disburse any of the money.

<P>As a result, according to Radelet, an increasingly deficit-conscious Congress may try to cut even the $3 billion request for FY06. "We had hoped the ambitious funding targets would be reached," he said, "but (the MCA) is beginning to lose steam" as a result of the administration's failure to follow through.

<P>McClymont also regretted Bush's failure to seek full funding for the new agency. "We don't want to send a signal to the rest of the world that we are failing to meet our commitments," she said. "It hurts our credibility and undermines our national interest."

<P>In contrast to the MCA, however, Bush's proposed budget is consistent with his previous pledge to gradually increase U.S. aid to fight HIV/AIDS  and other infectious diseases in Africa, the Caribbean and Vietnam as part of a five-year, $15 billion emergency program announced two years ago.

<P>The new budget will provide $3.2 billion--a $300 million increase over FY05--for his anti-AIDS program in 2006. Only $300 million of this amount however, is earmarked for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. The Global Fund--a multilateral agency created with U.S. support two years ago--is designed to disburse grants quickly for effective treatment and prevention programs, with a minimum of red tape and bureaucratic review.

<P>The $300 million is $135 million less than Congress appropriated to the Global Fund last year and, according to Radelet, would not be nearly enough to keep pace with demands on the agency's resources. "That is an unwelcome development," he said, "and my guess is that some members of Congress will try to increase that amount."

<P>Aside from the MCA, total funding for President Bush's core humanitarian and development aid programs will remain more or less unchanged from FY05 levels, although he is proposing significant shifts among the different accounts.

<P>Spending for child survival and health programs, which stood at $1.8 billion in FY04 and $1.53 billion in FY05, will fall to $1.25 billion next year under Bush's plan. At the same time, long term development assistance, particularly in education, environment, and water and sanitation, will be cut from $1.5 billion this year to $1.15 billion in FY06.

<P>"The president said he would fund (MCA and his Global AIDS program) without cutting back on existing programs," said Radelet, "but unfortunately he has failed to deliver on that pledge because these are significant cuts"

<P>Money for these programs will instead be shifted to the global AIDS account, to refugee, migration and disaster assistance, and to "transition initiatives," a multi-purpose program designed to bolster "fragile states," primarily Ethiopia, Sudan, Afghanistan, and Haiti which together will receive $270 million, some of which may include long term development assistance.

<P>Contributions to international organizations will be cut by some $47 million, including cuts of $10 million to the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) to $114 million, and of $13 million to the UN Development Program (UNDP), to $95 million.

<P>On the other hand, the new budget includes a sharp increase of 113 percent for UN peacekeeping operations--to $1.03 billion--in order to make up for a shortfall in the current year's Congressional appropriation of only $483 million, as well as the costs of new operations. <p align="center">&copy; 2005 OneWorld US</p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable --></font></td></tr>
