<p>BAGHDAD, Iraq, July 31 - Under intense American pressure, Iraqi leaders agreed Sunday to finish writing the country's constitution by the middle of August, raising the possibility that they will leave unresolved some of the fiercest disagreements over the future of the Iraqi state.
<p>The 71 Iraqis empowered to write the constitution turned down a proposal to extend the Aug. 15 deadline by six months, an extension that some Iraqis contend is necessary to help bridge the vast differences that still divide Iraq's Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds.
<p>Among the most divisive issues are the rights of women, the role of Islam and the scope and reach of Kurdish self-rule.
<p>Sticking to the Aug. 15 deadline is favored by the Americans, but it runs the risk that some of the most contentious issues facing the country will be left to fester.
<p>"The decision has been taken, and there will be no extensions," said Saleh Mutlak, a Sunni member of the drafting committee. "Frankly, if we took six more months, it wouldn't make much a difference. What we need is a better attitude from all the leaders to bring this agreement together."
<p>Keeping the political process on track is central to the Bush administration's desire to begin drawing down the number of American troops here by early spring. If the political process continues apace, a new government would be elected to a full term, under the new constitution, in December.
<p>Despite the constitutional committee's resolve to meet the deadline, some members were discussing whether to seek a shorter delay of about 30 days to complete their work. The committee has until the end of Monday to ask the National Assembly for more time.
<p>The events on Sunday unfolded amid renewed diplomatic efforts by the Americans to persuade the Iraqis to stick to the Aug. 15 deadline at almost any cost. Extending the deadline, American officials have argued, would probably prolong the constitutional stalemate rather than resolve it, alienate more Iraqis and help the insurgency. The more contentious issues could best be dealt with by an elected legislature, the American officials say.
<p>Moreover, the Americans are concerned that if the more extreme versions of the contested provisions actually make it into the Iraqi constitution, that could set the conditions for civil war. "What we are stressing is the value of a pared-down version of the constitution, without the bells and whistles," a senior Bush administration official involved in Iraqi affairs said in Washington last week. "We don't think the constitution is where a lot of these issues belong." The official would not allow his name to be used because to do so would it violate administration policy.
<p>The American efforts were in evidence on Sunday afternoon, when the Iraqi president, Jalal Talabani, emerged from a meeting with the new American ambassador here, Zalmay Khalilzad, and proclaimed his fealty to the Aug. 15 deadline.
<p>That meeting was the latest in a series of initiatives by senior American officials to play a more active role in helping along the Iraqi democratic process, which they contend is the country's best hope for reconciling the divergent desires of Iraq's ethnic and sectarian groups.
<p>The American effort mirrors the one pursued in the negotiations last year over the interim constitution. That document, which provides the framework for Iraq's transition to full democratic rule, avoided addressing several contentious issues, like the future of the contested city of Kirkuk.
<p>But this time around, the American strategy to set aside the most delicate issues is risky. The American pressure appears to have already alienated a number of Iraqi leaders, who warn that the country's differences can be set aside only at great peril.
<p>"The Americans are the ones who want to have this done quickly," said Mahmood Othman, a Kurdish member of the Iraqi National Assembly and a member of the constitutional drafting committee. "And they are doing it so they can begin to implement their exit strategy."
<p>"We would prefer to resolve all these issues in the constitution," Mr. Othman said.<p>&nbsp;He warned that if the major issues dear to the Kurdish leadership were not resolved in the constitution, then the Kurdish people might exercise their right to nullify the entire document when it is put to Iraqi voters in an October referendum.
<p>Under the rules agreed on by the Iraqis last year, if a two-thirds majority in three Iraqi provinces votes against the constitution, it will fail. The Kurds constitute a majority in three provinces in northern Iraq. The Kurdish leadership has suggested that Kurdish voters will reject a constitution that does not to address several of the issues that are now unresolved.
<p>One is the desire of the Kurdish leaders to expand the area under the control of the Kurdish autonomous region. Kurdish leaders say they will insist that a number of majority Kurdish areas, like Mahmoor in northern Iraq, be turned over to their control. Arab leaders staunchly oppose such a move.
<p>Another unresolved Kurdish issue is the status of the ethnically fractious city of Kirkuk, from which tens of thousands of Kurds were expelled by Saddam Hussein's government and replaced by Arab migrants. The Kurds have been returning home by the thousands, but most of the Arabs have stayed put.
<p>Kurdish leaders say they want the Iraqi constitution to spell out a process by which the "Arabization" of the region will be reversed, the Kurds resettled and a plebiscite held to determine whether the region will come under Kurdish control.
<p>Many Arab leaders oppose Kurdish plans for the region. They say the issue should be left for the National Assembly, which is likely to be dominated by Arabs, who make up an overwhelming majority of the Iraqi population.
<p>"We can talk about Kirkuk later," said Bahaa Al-Aaraji, a Shiite member of the constitutional drafting committee.
<p>Some of the issues bedeviling the framers of the Iraqi constitution are symbolic but still explosive. One is the name of the new Iraqi state; some committee members want to call it the Federal Islamic Republic of Iraq. Others, especially the Kurds, are opposed to the word "Islamic" in the name because they advocate a stricter separation between religion and the state.
<p>The Kurds also oppose efforts by some Shiites and Sunnis to put a phrase in the constitution declaring Iraq to be "a member of the Arab nation." The Kurds, who speak their own language, are not Arabs.
<p>As the debate over the constitution continued, violence around Iraq continued. The American military said that five American soldiers were killed Saturday in two attacks in Baghdad.
<p>One American soldier was killed and two were wounded when a roadside bomb exploded under a Humvee that was passing through the restive neighborhood of Al Doura. Four Americans were killed when their Humvee struck a roadside bomb southeast of Baghdad International Airport about 11 p.m. Saturday.
<p>In Haswa, south of Baghdad, seven people were killed and 12 were wounded Sunday when a car laden with explosives blew up near a crowd at a sheep market. Witnesses said three men had parked the car nearby and detonated the payload by remote control.
<p>Also Sunday, gunmen in Latifiya, a predominantly Sunni town south of Baghdad, opened fire on a convoy of the Iraqi National Congress, the party of Iraq's deputy prime minister Ahmad Chalabi. One Iraqi commando was killed and three others were wounded. An aide said Mr. Chalabi and other senior party officials were not in the convoy, Reuters reported. The motive of the attack was unclear.
