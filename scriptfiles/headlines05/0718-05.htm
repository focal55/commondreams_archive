<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p>Australia's national broadcaster says it has proof Japan bought the votes of some small nations for a return to commercial whaling -- a claim Tokyo consistently denies.</p><p>


In a program to be screened on ABC TV on Monday night, the fisheries chief of the Solomon Islands in the South Pacific says Japan poured money into the country in exchange for its support over whaling and cheap access to tuna.</p>
<p>

Similar charges are made by former officials from the tiny Caribbean nations of Dominica and Grenada.</p><p>

The Solomons official, Tione Bugotu, says he is now investigating the theft of millions of dollars paid to the fisheries department by the Japanese, ABC said on its website.</p><p>

"The fact is that this is money which is due to the government of the Solomon Islands, as revenue through fisheries," he told ABC's Four Corners program</p>
<p>

"Money had been diverted elsewhere and certain officers chose to help themselves."</p><p>

The Solomon Islands is heavily dependent on Australia for aid but last month it lined up with Japan at the International Whaling Commission (IWC) meeting in South Korea.</p><p>

At the meeting, despite losing a non-binding vote 27 to 30, Japan vowed to continue with plans to double its kill of whales in a so-called scientific catch strongly opposed by Australia.</p><p>

The program entitled "The Whale Wars" also presents the former environment minister of the tiny Caribbean nation of Dominica, Atherton Martin, who resigned in 2000 after Japan allegedly bought his government's vote with aid.</p>
<p>

He said Japan told the government there would be no more aid without its vote.</p><p>

"That is more than extortion," Martin said. "I don't think the international legal community has yet come up with a term to describe this blatant purchasing of small country governments by Japan.</p><p>

"That has to go down in legal history as being the high end of public sector extortion."</p><p>

Four Corners said it also obtained a letter from Grenada's government showing Japan covered all its IWC expenses.</p><p>

Grenada's former IWC commissioner Michael Baptiste was charged for allegedly pocketing the money in 2002 and he says such "vote buying" does occur.</p><p>

"I would get to an airport and someone would meet you at the airport and pay for your expenses and give you money for your expenses," he said.</p><p>

"I can't say it's the government of Japan because they wouldn't identify themselves, but individuals would do so, yes."</p><p>

ABC quotes Japan's IWC delegate Joji Morishita denying the allegations of vote buying.</p><p>

"I don't believe that happened," he said. "That's a serious allegation I guess and we will look at this issue.</p><p align="CENTER">&copy;  2005 AFP</p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable --></font></td></tr>
