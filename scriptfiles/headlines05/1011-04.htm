blocked a U.N. envoy on Monday from briefing the Security
Council on grave human rights violations in Sudan's Darfur
region, saying the council had to act against atrocities and
not just talk about them.</p>
<p>Bolton, joined by China, Algeria and Russia, prevented Juan
Mendez, Secretary-General Kofi Annan's special adviser for the
prevention of genocide, from briefing the council on his recent
visit to Darfur, despite pleas from Annan and 11 other council
members that Mendez be heard.</p>
<p>"I strongly regret and deplore that Mr. Mendez ... was not
authorized to brief the council today as Mr. Kofi Annan had
asked," French Ambassador Jean-Marc de la Sabliere told
reporters outside the council chambers.</p>
<p>But Bolton said he had objected to the briefing to make the
point the council should be "talking more about the steps it
can take to do something about the deteriorating security
situation" in Darfur. He gave no new proposals.</p>
<p>"How many officials from the secretariat does it take to
give a briefing?" he said, noting the council had just
concluded a briefing on Darfur from Hedi Annabi, the assistant
secretary-general for peacekeeping operations.</p>
<p>Mendez, who visited Darfur for a week in late September,
later briefed reporters on his findings. He said Sudanese
officials were taking only cosmetic steps to prevent systematic
human rights abuses there that might amount to genocide. crimes
against humanity or war crimes.</p>
<p>He also accused Khartoum of refusing to cooperate with the
prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, a tribunal
strongly opposed by the Bush administration on grounds it might
pursue frivolous prosecutions of U.S. soldiers or officials
working abroad.</p>
<p>INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE</p>
<p>"We cannot let the government of Sudan get away with that,"
Mendez told a news conference. "I haven't seen any indication
of the international community telling Sudan, 'You don't have a
choice, you have to cooperate with the ICC."'</p>

<p>Mendez said the Security Council had to put more pressure
on the Sudanese to disarm nomad Arab gangs, known as Janjaweed,
responsible for many of the atrocities now escalating in camps
housing African tribesmen thrown off their land. So far
Sudanese trials of any perpetrators were meaningless, he said.</p>
<p>Secondly, Mendez recommended that the international
community make good on its pledges to give aid to the Africa
Union, which has monitors and troops in Darfur.</p>
<p>Council diplomats who wanted to hear from Mendez said it
was a council tradition to give the envoy a platform when Annan
called for a briefing from his adviser on genocide.</p>
<p>They noted Bolton had lined up with the three council
members -- Algeria, China and Russia -- which have watered down
action against Khartoum.</p>
<p>"He's playing into the hands of people who don't want to do
anything," said one council diplomat, who spoke on condition of
anonymity so as not to irritate Washington.</p>
<p>The Security Council met for a briefing on the latest
developments in Darfur after rebels in the western Sudanese
region abducted a number of African Union peacekeeping troops
and killed some of them.</p>
<p>The incident prompted Annan to warn in Geneva on Monday
that a surge of violence in the region may force the world body
to suspend some aid to Darfur.</p>
