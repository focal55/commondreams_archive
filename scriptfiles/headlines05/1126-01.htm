<p>Friends, politicians, team-mates, opponents, ex-wives, relatives and admiring members of his huge family of fans were united last night in their appreciation of George Best, the extravagantly gifted former footballer who died  at 12.55 pm Friday. 
<p>As bouquets, flags, scarves, Manchester United shirts and a wooden model of the World Cup were placed on a flower bed outside Cromwell Hospital, west London, the 59-year-old's family, including his father, Dickie, 86, thanked well-wishers and doctors and appealed for privacy.


<p>On a bitterly cold afternoon, Best's son, Calum, 24, stood on the steps of the private hospital and said: "Not only have I lost my dad, but we have all lost a wonderful man." Phil Hughes, friend and agent to the footballer for most of his troubled retirement, said the former Northern Ireland international would be buried in the city of his birth, Belfast, alongside his mother, Ann. "He's gone somewhere where no one can hurt him anymore," he said, in tears. "He is safe now."

<p>Other friends, former managers and bamboozled opponents were quick to pay fond tribute to the man they believe was the most gifted footballer of all time.

<p>Kim Book, the Northampton Town goalkeeper who was beaten a record six times by the Manchester United winger during the 8-2 victory in the 1970 FA Cup said he first saw Best play as a 16-year-old, when he was "a little imp and incredible even then". Eight years later, he could only watch helplessly as Best glided over the boggy pitch and left him on his backside. "We hadn't a chance against United with Best in that form. Not even the Berlin Wall could have stopped him."

<p>Best was admitted to the hospital on September 30 suffering from a flu-like infection. His health deteriorated when he developed a kidney infection, but he rallied until eight days ago, when he developed a lung infection. He died of multiple organ failure.

<p>Professor Roger Williams, who oversaw Best's liver transplant three years ago and had cared for him ever since, admitted he had become attached to his patient. "One does with a person like George, who has enormous personality and charm in so many ways. He was a great player and is a great person and for me as a patient he has been a very great patient."

<p>His former United team-mate Denis Law, who stayed up for much of the night with Best's family, called his death a "blessing" because he had been in such pain. "When we talked to him we just said 'See you Besty and bless you and hope everything goes well.' It was very difficult."

<p>While figures in the football world sought to capture his sublime skills, other public figures dwelt on the poignancy of his career, prematurely curtailed by his fondness for drink. Best was a "footballing pop star," said Gordon Taylor, another opponent on the pitch and now head of the Professional Footballers' Association. For Colin Bloomfield, an ordinary fan who laid down a shirt with Best's number 7 on its back outside the hospital, Best was the Elvis Presley of football, "a genius balanced on a knife edge".

<p>Tony Blair, Irish president Mary McAleese, Northern Ireland secretary Peter Hain and Irish prime minister Bertie Ahern were among those to praise what Mr Hain rather primly called his "larger than life character".

<p>The steady stream of fans visiting the hospital included many whose understanding of Best's genius was passed down from their fathers or caught on brief film clips and some who still treasured personal memories of their idol.

<p>Daniel Pritchard, 18, brought his former neighbor a wooden model of the World Cup as a final gift. "Georgie, you never got the World Cup but here is yours," he wrote on a piece of paper pinned to the top. "He was the best player ever," he said. "David Beckham is nothing to Best."

<p>Pauline Sorrell, 70, came clutching a business card inscribed with the name of a Mayfair club, Blondes, signed "George". It was meant as an invitation. "I never turned up," she said. "Now it's too late."
