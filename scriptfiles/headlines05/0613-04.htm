<p>CARACAS, Venezuela -- 
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez blamed the Bush administration for weeks of widespread protests in Bolivia.</p>
<p>

  In his weekly radio address, Chavez alleged U.S. efforts to impose its economic model on poor nations like Bolivia was "poison medicine." </p><p>
  "That is what is killing the people of Latin America," said the leftist leader.</p><p>
  Earlier this month the Bush administration accused Chavez of using Venezuela's oil revenue to fund opposition groups throughout Latin American.</p><p>
  Chavez denied the allegations as ridiculous. </p><p>
  Bolivian protesters were calling for the nationalization of its gas industry, a constitutional assembly and the resignation of President Carlos Mesa, who stepped down last week. </p><p>
  Former Bolivian President Mesa said there was no evidence of Chavez's involvement in Bolivia's protests or opposition groups. </p><p>

  "I didn't see any evidence of Venezuelan intelligence interfering in Bolivian affairs," said Mesa in an interview with Mexican media during the weekend.</p>
