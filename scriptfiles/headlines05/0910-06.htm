<p>Frustration mounted among European countries that have been stymied in their efforts to send aid to the United States in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, with tons of supplies sitting idly at airports awaiting a green light from Washington.</p>

 "Since last Saturday we have been waiting for permission to fly into the United States but so far we haven't got any response," lamented Claes Thorson, spokesman at the Swedish embassy in Washington.
<p>

Thorson said as soon as the United States appealed for foreign aid, his government loaded a transport plane with water purification equipment, temporary cell-phone networks, blankets and jerry cans.</p>
<p>

But the Hercules C-130 has yet to be given permission to fly into the United States, despite repeated requests by Sweden, Thorson said.</p>
<p>

"The only answer we get is that our request (to fly) has been suspended until further notice," he said.</p>
<p>

According to European Union officials in Washington, the bloc's 25 members as well as five non-EU countries offered assistance after the hurricane struck, in the form of tents, generators, blankets, search-and-rescue teams, as well as forensic and logistics experts.</p>
<p>

Andras Bacsi-Nagy, spokesman at the Hungarian embassy in Washington, said his country was willing to provide forensic experts to help identify the bodies of victims as well as other assistance but had yet to get a response from American officials.</p>
<p>

"We made the offer right after the hurricane and since then we haven't had any replies," he said. "Of course, they were polite and nice (...) and we understand it takes a lot of time to sort through all these offers."</p>
<p>



Switzerland has also offered aid and is awaiting a response as is the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>


"All we can do is wait," Andreas Stauffer, of the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC), said.</p>
<p>

Croatia on Friday said six of its forensic experts were waiting for the go-ahead from Washington to travel to the states pummeled by the hurricane.</p>
<p>

Education and Science Minister Dragan Primorac told AFP that the team could provide "important help" due to the experience they gained in the country's 1991-1995 independence war.</p>

<p>

US officials for their part say they are deeply grateful for the outpouring of sympathy but have appealed for patience in trying to sort through all the donations.</p>
<p>

Harry Thomas, a State Department official in charge of coordinating international aid for the hurricane, said 95 countries had stepped forward and efforts were being made to match all the donations with needs on the ground.</p>
<p>

"The last thing we want to do is take something that can't be utilized -- can't be utilized quickly, accurately and to the benefit of the American people," he told reporters. "So we have to look at each offer closely and we go back to people and we're doing that."</p>
<p>

But not everyone on the domestic front is satisfied with Washington's response and critics are heaping blame on the administration for being woefully ill-prepared to handle the disaster and international offers of assistance.</p>
<p>

"It is regrettable that our government's abysmal coordination in the early days of the recovery effort has prevented critical international aid from being delivered to our stricken citizens and communities in the affected Gulf States," Senator Patrick Leahy, a Democrat, told a congressional hearing Thursday. "The sluggish response has left foreign governments frustrated and baffled."</p>
