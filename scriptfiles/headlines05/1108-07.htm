UNITED NATIONS - Iran has found the  wreckage of two U.S. unmanned spy planes on its territory in  recent months, Tehran said on Monday, accusing Washington of  violating its sovereignty through illegal overflights.<p></p> Iran &quot;strongly protests against such unlawful acts and  emphasizes the necessity to observe the principles of  international law concerning the sanctity of the sovereignty  and territorial integrity of states,&quot; its Foreign Ministry  said.<p></p> The Pentagon had no immediate comment to the protest, which  came in letters to the U.S. government written months ago but  only made public at the United Nations on Monday.<p></p> They described the crash of a Shadow 200 RQ-7 drone in Ilam  Province last July 4, 36 miles (60 kms) from the border, and of  a Hermes drone in the Khoram Abad area on Aug. 25, found 120  miles (200 kms) inside Iranian territory.<p></p> An investigation found that both of the unmanned aircraft  were American, the Foreign Ministry said. Its letters were  delivered to the Swiss Embassy in Tehran for transmission to  U.S. authorities as Iran has no diplomatic ties with the United  States.<p></p> U.S. President George W. Bush once branded Iran as a part  of an &quot;axis of evil&quot; pursuing weapons of mass destruction along  with Iraq and North Korea. His administration has accused  Tehran for more than two years of pursuing nuclear weapons  under the guise of a peaceful nuclear energy program.<p></p> Britain and the United States also suspect Tehran of  smuggling arms to insurgents in Iraq.<p></p> Tehran has denied helping fuel the insurgency in Iraq and  says it has every right to pursue atomic power as a domestic  energy source.<p></p> But the International Atomic Energy Agency, the  Vienna-based U.N. nuclear watchdog agency, has accused it of  keeping parts of its nuclear program secret for years, in  violation of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.<p></p> The European Union has joined the United States in  insisting that Iran freeze all its sensitive nuclear activities  but EU states France, Britain and Germany said on Monday they  were studying a new Iranian offer of negotiations aimed at  resolving the impasse.
