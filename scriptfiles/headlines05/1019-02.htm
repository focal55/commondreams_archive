<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p>Saddam Hussein is back in the box today, for what Iraqi
prosecutors insist is the serious business of dealing with the
former dictator's abuse of his people and his power.</p>
<p>Deep within the blast-walled and razor-wired perimeter of
Baghdad's green zone, a marble-clad building that Saddam used as a
store for gifts he received as Iraqi leader is the setting for a
remarkable encounter between the accused and his accusers.</p>
<p>The names of the five judges will not be disclosed - it remains
to be seen if their faces will be shown on TV - and witnesses will
speak from behind screens. Much of the proceedings will take place
behind bullet-proof glass.</p>
<p>But when details of the charges against Saddam, 68, and his
seven co-accused are revealed for the first time, many will wonder
how an obscure assassination attempt on the former president could
become the reason for his actual death.</p>

<p>Instead of atrocities such as the gassing of the people of
Halabja in 1988; the death and disappearance of thousands in
Saddam's war against Iran and invasion of Kuwait; or his notorious
Anfal campaign against the Kurds; all attention will be on the
small mixed community of Dujail, 60 kilometres north of the
capital.</p>
<p>The gunmen opened fire as Saddam's motorcade swept out of this
mixed community on July 8, 1982, after a visit to rally support for
the war with Iran.</p>
<p>But instead of speeding away, Saddam ordered his driver to back
up and he made a second speech to the people of Dujail. Cameramen
accompanying the president failed to capture the attack, but they
did record his dire warning that a "small number" of traitors who
were "agents of foreigners" [read Iranian-backed] would be rooted
out.</p>
<p>In subsequent days, tanks, helicopters and soldiers on foot
moved through, killing at least 143 and trucking away hundreds of
others - only a handful of whom were heard of again.</p>
<p>Various reasons are given for Dujail being selected as the first
case, ranging from a central role in the attempted assassination of
members of the now victorious Shiites to a belief that the case
against Saddam is easily proved. There are different schools of
thought. Foreign observers worry that Saddam never put anything in
writing; Iraqis close to the prosecution say documentary proof
exists.</p>
<p>But perhaps more importantly, if Saddam is convicted on the
comparatively tight circumstances of the Dujail case, it is enough
to see him hang without having to proceed with any others in a raft
of much bigger cases against him, which would run for years and
devour limited resources.</p>
<p>The laws governing Saddam's trial set it apart from those faced
by other tyrants of modern times.</p>
<p>Human rights groups have criticised the exclusion of foreign
judges and the inability of the Iraqi authorities to commute a
death sentence in the event of a guilty verdict.</p>
<p>Coupled with a legal insistence that proceedings based on other
charges against an accused are not a reason to delay execution,
Saddam would have to be hanged within 30 days of exhausting his
right of appeal to a nine-member appeals chamber of the Supreme
Iraqi Criminal Tribunal.</p>

<p>One of the most vocal critics of the process by which Saddam
will be tried is a human rights group that worked hard to gather
material against him, the New York-based Human Rights Watch.</p>
<p>But in a paper published this week the group identified the
reasons for its anxiety about the fairness of the process: no
requirement for guilt to be proved beyond reasonable doubt; the
denial to the accused of the procedural advantages enjoyed by the
prosecution; political interference in the court; and the
insistence on carrying out the death penalty.</p>
<p>In a statement the group said: "In Iraq's fragile political
climate the legitimacy of the court will be in question. To provide
a measure of truth and justice for hundreds of thousands of victims
of gross human rights violations in Iraq, fair trails are
essential."</p>
<p>Saddam's legal team is expected to respond to the reading of the
charges today with a demand that the hearing be deferred for as
long as six months to allow it to prepare a complete defence.</p>
<p>In the meantime, it remains to be seen whether the sight of
Saddam on trial will go any way to fulfilling a hope among Iraqi
authorities that his humiliation will dissipate support for the
insurgency.</p>
