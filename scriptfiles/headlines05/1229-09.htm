Pablo Rodriguez, a lawyer for the 90-year-old ex-dictator who ruled Chile from 1973-90, called the procedure "an affront to a former President of the Republic."</p>
<p>But government spokesman Osvaldo Puccio said the booking of Pinochet "shows that in Chile all citizens are equal before the law."</p>
<p>Pinochet had been indicted and held under house arrest in other human rights in other legal cases against him, but had never been submitted to a police booking.</p>
<p>No details were made public from the booking at his guarded suburban Santiago mansion where he remains under house arrest since his Nov. 24 indictment.</p>
<p>The law, however, mandates that the booking must be done by police officers, taking the prints from all 10 fingers of the person and taking front and side pictures.</p>
<p>Wednesday's procedure was ordered by Judge Victor Montiglio, who issued the indictment of Pinochet for the killing and disappearance of nine dissidents in 1975 in a case known as Operation Colombo. The nine were among 119 victims of the operation; the Pinochet regime said they were killed in clashes between rival opposition groups.</p>
<p>Rodriguez is expected argue Pinochet is unfit for trial for health reasons. Four times health problems have prevented him from being tried on human rights charges. Court-appointed doctors in the recent case have affirmed that, although he suffers from mild dementia, he can stand trial.</p>

<p>He also is under indictment on tax evasion and corruption charges related to secret multimillion-dollar bank accounts he maintained overseas.</p>
<p>Also Wednesday, a Chilean appeals court upheld a life prison sentence for Pinochet's secret police chief, who was convicted of killing 12 suspected urban guerrillas in 1987.</p>
<p>Retired Gen. Hugo Salas can still appeal his sentence before the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Sixteen of Salas' subordinates in the Central Information Central, the feared security service of Pinochet's 1973-90 rule, were also sentenced to prison terms ranging from five to 15 years.</p>
<p>All were convicted in the killing of 12 suspected members of the Manuel Rodriguez Patriotic Front, a pro-communist guerrilla that fought Pinochet's regime.</p>
<p>The government said at the time that the suspected guerillas had been killed in clashes with security agents, but a judicial investigation revealed they were assassinated in three separate incidents after being arrested.</p>
