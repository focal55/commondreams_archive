allowing the U.S. government to demand information about

The lawsuit was filed against U.S. Attorney General Alberto 
Gonzales and FBI Director Robert Mueller in the U.S. District 
Court for the District of Connecticut by an unnamed library and 
the American Civil Liberties Union.
</p>
<p> The suit -- filed on August 9 and made public by the ACLU 
on Thursday -- calls the FBI's order to produce library records 
"unconstitutional on its face" and said a gag order preventing 
public discussion of the lawsuit is an unlawful restraint on 
speech.</p><p> Critical details of the lawsuit were blacked out on the 
ACLU's Web site in compliance with the gag order. The library 
is thought to be based in Connecticut since the lawsuit was 
filed there with the participation of the Connecticut branch of 
the ACLU.</p><p> The ACLU said in its lawsuit that legal changes made under 
the Patriot Act "remove any requirement of individualized 
suspicion, (and) the FBI may now ... demand sensitive 
information about innocent people."</p><p> Enacted after the September 11, 2001, attacks, the Patriot 
Act lets U.S. authorities seek approval from a special court to 
search personal records of terror suspects from bookstores, 
businesses, hospitals and libraries, in a provision known as 
the library clause.</p><p> The FBI letter requesting the information, called a 
National Security Letter, is effectively a gag order because it 
tells the recipient that the request must be kept secret.</p><p> As a result, "the Patriot Act is itself gagging public 
debate about the Patriot Act," said Ann Beeson, the ACLU's lead 
lawyer in the case.</p><p> The civil liberties group has asked the District Court to 
lift the gag order so its client can participate in the public 
debate and upcoming congressional hearings on the Patriot Act. 
A hearing about lifting the gag order is scheduled for 
Wednesday in Bridgeport, Connecticut.</p><p> An FBI spokesman referred calls to the Department of 
Justice. A Justice spokesman said the department had no comment 
and declined to say if it had required libraries to turn over 
records under the Patriot Act.</p><p> The U.S. House of Representatives, ignoring protests from 
civil liberties groups, voted this summer to reauthorize 16 
provisions of the act that expire at the end of the year, 
including the library clause. The Senate is expected to take up 
the matter after lawmakers return from an August recess.</p><p> A copy of the ACLU lawsuit said the library involved 
"strictly guards the confidentiality and privacy of its library 
and Internet records, and believes it should not be forced to 
disclose such records without a showing of compelling need and 
approval by a judge."</p><p> The FBI, in a copy of the letter demanding the library 
records and attached to the lawsuit, said "the information 
sought is relevant to an authorized investigation to protect 
against international terrorism or clandestine intelligence 
activities."
