President Bush's nomination of his White House counsel, Harriet Miers, suggests that, in the end, he values her gender and her loyalty. But by choosing a friend, Bush ensures that his nominee will face questions about her credentials and whether she benefited from cronyism.
</p>
<p>Unlike the nine other Supreme Court nominees since 1975, Miers has never been a judge. The late Chief Justice William Rehnquist was the last non-judge to ascend to the court when he was appointed in 1972, but he was an assistant U.S. attorney general with a conservative track record.</p>
<p>Miers' selection recalled an era in which presidents often turned to personal friends to fill vacancies on the Supreme Court. Franklin D. Roosevelt put two friends - Felix Frankfurter and William O. Douglas - on the court. Lyndon B. Johnson nominated his long-time pal and adviser Abe Fortas.</p>
<p>Throughout U.S. history, it hasn't been that unusual for presidents to go off the bench to pick Supreme Court nominees. However, next to the 20 such nominees during the past century - including Cabinet members such as Arthur Goldberg and a California governor, Earl Warren - the qualifications of Miers, who has been White House counsel for less than a year, are modest.</p>
<p>Although she has rung up a series of firsts - she was the first woman to head the Dallas Bar Association and the Texas Bar Association - her credentials do not compare with those of Frankfurter, an esteemed Harvard law professor, or Douglas, once a member of the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission.</p>
<p>Miers, 60, who once was Bush's personal lawyer in Texas, was for years a quiet, successful player in a large Dallas law firm. Besides her leadership positions in the bar, she served on the Dallas City Council.</p><p>For Democratic senators such as New York's Charles Schumer who complained that new Chief Justice John Roberts' legal record was scant, Miers' lack of a paper trail presents a new level of mystery. Schumer and several other Democrats had a generally positive response to Miers' nomination, but they said uncertainty over how she views abortion rights and other controversies will lead them to seek much more information about her views.</p>
<p>Other Democrats went so far as to praise Miers while stopping short of endorsing her. The Senate's highest-ranking Democrat, Harry Reid of Nevada, said he found Miers to be "very personable" and "genuine," and he said her lack of judicial experience could be a plus, not a minus. He said it is important to have justices with a range of life experiences.</p>
<p>In a reflection of the odd political dynamics stemming from Miers' nomination, harsh criticism came from conservative commentators such as Pat Buchanan. He accused Bush of blowing a historic opportunity to appoint a strong conservative in place of the retiring Sandra Day O'Connor, whose moderate positions on key issues - namely her support of abortion rights - have long angered Buchanan and other conservatives.</p>
<p>"In selecting her, Bush capitulated to the diversity-mongers, used a critical Supreme Court seat to reward a crony, and revealed that he lacks the desire to engage the Senate in fierce combat to carry out his now-suspect commitment to remake the court in the image of (Justices Antonin) Scalia and (Clarence) Thomas," Buchanan said in a statement posted at Human Events Online. "Were she not a friend of Bush, and female, she would never have even been considered."</p>
<p>Appointing presidential friends to the court has had mixed results. Fortas continued to advise Johnson after he took the bench, and when Johnson tried to elevate him to chief justice in 1968, Fortas faced accusations that he was benefiting from cronyism. That nomination failed. Fortas resigned from the bench in 1969 under the cloud of a financial scandal and a threatened impeachment by Congress.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Byron White, a friend of President Kennedy's who joined the court in 1962, wound up serving for three decades and became known for his independent streak.</p>
<p>Georgetown University law professor Mark Tushnet says the pitfalls of choosing a friend for the high court can be twofold: The appointee might not rise to the demands of the office, or the appointee could maintain a close relationship with the president - as Fortas did - and jeopardize judicial independence. "It's hard to say how it will play out in (Miers') case," Tushnet said. "People will say ... that you have to go back quite a ways to find someone whose credentials were as thin as hers."</p>
<p>Stanford University law professor Deborah Rhode says Miers' limited r&#233;sum&#233; may play into criticism that Bush has received because of the administration's response to Hurricane Katrina. "Here's someone who has just been roasted for picking on partisan grounds a person who was demonstrably unqualified to head FEMA," said Rhode, referring to Bush's appointment of former FEMA director Michael Brown. "We've just seen what some of the costs of cronyism are. ... I don't want to suggest that she lacks judicial capacity. But it's the appearance of cronyism."</p>
<p>Vanderbilt University law professor Suzanna Sherry said Miers should not be underestimated. "Is she the most qualified person he could have chosen? Probably not," Sherry said. "But you can't be White House counsel and not have some legal acumen."</p>
<p>Symbolic choices</p><p>Presidents have long used their power of lifetime appointments to the Supreme Court to make symbolic statements. Regionalism, sex and race, along with friendship, have affected nominations. President Johnson named Thurgood Marshall as the first black justice in 1967. In 1981, President Reagan appointed O'Connor as the first woman justice.</p></p>
<p>Bush was under pressure to pick another woman to replace O'Connor. (The second woman justice, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, was tapped in 1993 by President Clinton.) First lady Laura Bush had said she wanted another woman on the court.</p>
<p>
But unlike in 1981, when Reagan broke ground in choosing O'Connor and there were few women on the nation's courts, there are now many women judges. </p>
<p>
Much of the talk over a new appointee had focused on several federal judges, such as appellate court judges Priscilla Owen and Edith Jones, both of Texas, and Janice Rogers Brown, formerly of California and now on a court based in Washington, D.C. All three women have conservative records, and their nominations might have prompted a Democratic filibuster in the Senate. Republicans control 55 of the chamber's 100 seats, and 60 votes are needed to end a nomination-blocking filibuster.</p>
<p>
When he announced Miers' nomination, Bush emphasized that she stood out as "exceptionally well-suited to the job." He said she had sound legal judgment and called her a trailblazer. </p>
<p>
She was the first woman hired by the Dallas law firm of Locke, Purnell, Boren, Laney &amp; Neely in 1972; the first woman president of the Dallas Bar Association in 1985; the first woman president of the Texas Bar Association in 1992-93; and the first woman elected president of her large law firm, in 1996. As a corporate litigator, Miers' clients included Microsoft, Disney and SunGard Data Systems. </p>

<p>
As president of the Dallas Bar, Miers urged managing partners of the city's law firms to provide volunteers to staff free neighborhood legal clinics. She received an award in 1996 from the Legal Services of North Texas for her legal work on behalf of the poor.</p>
<p>
The personal connection </p>
<p>
Miers first worked with Bush as his personal lawyer on his 1994 campaign for Texas governor. From 1995 to 2000, Miers was the Bush-appointed chairwoman of the Texas Lottery Commission. When Bush was elected president in 2000, he selected Miers to be an assistant and staff secretary.</p>
<p>
"It was not my intent to come to Washington," Miers said in an interview with USA TODAY last March. She had lived nearly her whole life in Texas. But, Miers said, she was persuaded "to serve the American people at a time that was important."</p>
<p>
Notre Dame law professor Richard Garnett said that critics of Miers might be overlooking one of her strongest attributes: Bush believes he knows how she would rule on the bench. That could contrast with the situation Bush's father faced with his appointment of David Souter in 1990.</p>
<p>
The elder Bush's chief of staff, John Sununu, had said Souter would be "a home run" for conservatives, but it hasn't turned out that way. Souter wound up being one of the nine-member court's four most liberal justices.</p>

<p>
The current president "wanted to get somebody in whom he had confidence," said Garnett, a former law clerk to Rehnquist. "Whatever she becomes on the bench, the president should know."</p>
<p>
Amid questions about Miers' qualifications for the court, Vice President Cheney went on Rush Limbaugh's radio show to defend the nominee. The conservative talk-show host said "the early line of criticism" was that Bush was using the appointment to reward a loyal supporter. Limbaugh also wondered whether Bush's choice was an effort to "appease the left."</p>
<p>
Cheney rejected that notion, and said "the idea that Harriet (was) selected on the basis of cronyism makes no sense. ... She'd been a very successful private attorney before she joined the administration."</p><p align="center">  Copyright &copy; 2005 USA TODAY</p>
