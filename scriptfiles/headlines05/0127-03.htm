<p>WASHINGTON -- Rep. Lynn Woolsey, D-Petaluma, led 24 other Democratic co-sponsors in introducing a resolution in the House Wednesday calling on President Bush to begin the immediate withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq.

<P>The resolution is a follow-up to a letter that Woolsey and 15 other House Democrats sent Bush earlier this month.

<P>Her proposal also calls on Bush to step up reconstruction spending in Iraq and to try to create an international peacekeeping force for the country.

<P>"The presence of nearly 150,000 U.S. troops in Iraq is a rallying point for anti-American sentiment in the Arab world," Woolsey said in a speech on the House floor.

<P>"Even worse, the U.S. military presence in Iraq is nothing short of stifling to the prospect of democracy. How can democracy possibly take root if forced upon the Iraqi people by the barrel of a gun?''

<P>Among the co-sponsors for her proposal, which has essentially no chance of ever reaching the floor for a vote in the Republican-controlled House, are Democratic Reps. Sam Farr of Carmel, Mike Honda of San Jose, Barbara Lee of Oakland and Pete Stark of Fremont. <p align="center">&copy; 2005 San Francisco Chronicle</p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable --></font></td></tr>
