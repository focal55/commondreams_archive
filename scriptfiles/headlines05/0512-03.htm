<p>The reports come in with numbing regularity. Iraqi police blown up 
by suicide bombs. Government officials murdered in the street. Dozens of 
insurgents killed by U.S. forces. Shoppers killed when cars explode near busy 
markets. Grieving mourners killed by explosions at funerals for their loved 
ones. 
<P>In the past two weeks alone, about 400 Iraqis reportedly have died across 
the country. On Wednesday alone, five car bombs and a man with explosives 
strapped to his body killed at least 69 people in Baghdad and elsewhere.

But while the incidents and the numbers all start to blur together, they 
raise once again the hotly debated and problematic issue of Iraqi civilian 
deaths since the United States invaded in March 2003. 

<P>The estimates of ordinary Iraqis killed  --  by insurgents, U.S. troops 
and Iraqi criminals  --  vary greatly,  from as low as 6,000 up to nearly 100,
000, depending on the methodology used. 
<P>Most experts say more precise estimates are complicated by numerous 
factors, including the Islamic custom of speedy burial, political pressures to 
inflate or deflate the count and the lack of effective government, especially 
in rural areas, that make tracking deaths difficult.
<P>"I've also heard of people ... who fear reprisals and don't want names of 
their dead relatives identified," said Mark Jurgensmeyer, director of global 
and international studies at UC Santa Barbara.
<P>"On the other side," he added, "numbers are inflated when deaths related 
to blood feuds or conflict over illegal economic activities are masked as 
'terrorist attacks.' The real problem is that for large segments of Iraqi 
society, there is precious little civil order, so even reading a water meter 
or giving out a parking ticket is problematic, much less keeping track of 
violent deaths."
<P>The Defense Department says that more than 1,600 U.S. troops have died 
since the war began. While it has announced insurgent casualties after major 
military actions such as the current campaign near the Syrian border, the U.S. 
military says it does not keep track of civilian deaths.  "We don't do body 
counts," Gen. Tommy Franks, who commanded U.S. troops in both Afghanistan and 
Iraq, said in 2002. 
<P><b>'An invisible issue' in the U.S.
</b>
<P>The Pentagon's stance infuriates activist Andrea Buffa, communications 
director for San Francisco-based Global Exchange, who visited Baghdad and 
Fallujah early last year.
<P>"Everywhere I went, I saw people dressed in mourning," she said. "If 
Americans had any idea of the toll of war, of how many civilians are killed 
every day, public sentiment would be anti-war. It's a tragedy that it is an 
invisible issue in the United States."
<P>In March, 23 health experts from five countries, including Dr. Thomas 
Hall, a UCSF epidemiologist, called for an independent probe on civilian 
casualties and criticized the U.S. and British governments for being "wholly 
irresponsible" for not counting such deaths. 
<P>"Monitoring casualties is a humanitarian imperative," said the statement. 
"Understanding the causes of death is a core public-health responsibility 
nationally and internationally." 
<P>Richard Kohn, a professor of military history at the University of North 
Carolina at Chapel Hill, says that for the Bush administration, "it's more 
politically advantageous not to count and not to know." But he says he 
suspects the U.S. military keeps a general count of Iraqi casualties.
<P>"It would be hard for me to believe the military doesn't keep some sense 
of that," he said. "You need to know how much havoc you're wreaking in a 
county if you're trying to accomplish something in that country."
<P>Malcolm Muir Jr., a military historian at the Virginia Military Institute,
recalls the U.S. military tallying body counts as a "measure of its success" 
in Vietnam. 
<P>But Kohn says that practice ended during the 1990-91 Persian Gulf War. 
"We were emphasizing the use of air power so much we were unwilling to admit 
there were significant collateral (civilian) casualties," he said. "The issue 
is ... how will that play in world opinion?"
<P><b>Contested counts
</b>
<P>Thomas Mockaitis, a history professor specializing in defense and arms 
control at DePaul University in Chicago, says counting civilian casualties can 
provide important data, especially in an air war, where the count could show 
whether the amount of firepower being used is disproportionate to the amount 
of force necessary to reach a given goal.
<P>But Mockaitis says compiling an accurate tally of civilian deaths is 
complicated by the fact that in an insurgency, the difference between a 
combatant and a noncombatant can be clouded.

<P>"By definition, insurgents operate within a sympathetic or at least a 
tolerant population," he said. "Who is a civilian and who isn't and what is 
collateral damage is really something that can be contested."
<P>As an example, he pointed to the widely seen footage of a U.S. Marine 
shooting a wounded and apparently defenseless insurgent in a Fallujah mosque 
in November. Critics of the war decried the act as the murder of a helpless 
noncombatant, while supporters of the military called it a legitimate act of 
combat since insurgents sometimes booby-trap wounded or dead fighters. The 
military said there was insufficient evidence to charge the Marine with 
wrongdoing.
<P>In October, the British medical journal Lancet estimated 98,000 Iraqis 
had died as a result of the invasion and occupation. The study was based on 
interviews with people in 988 households with 7,868 residents randomly 
selected across Iraq. Forty-six percent of the violent deaths were of children 
younger than 15, and 7 percent were women, the researchers reported. The 
findings were dismissed by the U.S and British governments as inaccurate.
<P>The London-based Iraq Body Count, a Web site that tallies deaths reported 
by the media or by official bodies and does not include casualty estimates or 
projections, puts the death toll since March 2003 between 21,523 and 24,415 as 
of Wednesday. 
<P><b>Humanitarian dimension
</b>
<P>The Brookings Institution's Iraq Index estimates between 11,690 and 12,
930 civilians have been killed by insurgents and U.S. military as of April 13. 
If deaths from crime are included, between 21,490 and 41,600 have been killed 
as of March 31, according to the Brookings index. 
<P>And the Iraqi government, which counts only civilians who have been 
killed by insurgents and criminal gangs, estimates 6,000 victims as of April 5.
<P>"It speaks well of people who are wondering where we're going and what 
we're accomplishing," Mockaitis said of those pressuring Washington for an 
accurate accounting of civilian deaths. "There is a humanitarian dimension, 
that people are concerned not only about American deaths, but also the deaths 
of Iraqis  --  and they should be."
