<p>WASHINGTON   - In the months before Hurricane 
Katrina, President George W. Bush sought to cut a key program 
to help local governments raise their preparedness, and state 
officials warned of a "total lack of focus" on natural 
disasters by his homeland-security chief, documents show.</p><p> The disclosures add to questions over the administration's 
emergency-response planning, Homeland Security Secretary 
Michael Chertoff's priorities and the way the White House 
budgets for disaster preparedness after the September 11, 2001, 
attacks.</p><p> Organizations representing emergency-response and security 
officials at state and local agencies had complained of funding 
shortages and what they saw as an excessive shift by the 
Homeland Security Department away from preparing for natural 
disasters, as it focused increasingly on terrorism.</p><p> In July, the National Emergency Management Association 
wrote lawmakers expressing "grave" concern that still-pending 
changes proposed by Chertoff would undercut the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).</p><p> "Our primary concern relates to the total lack of focus on 
natural-hazards preparedness," David Liebersbach, the 
association's president, said in the July 27 letter to Sens. 
Susan Collins, a Republican, and Joseph Lieberman, a Democrat, 
the leaders of a key Senate committee overseeing the agency.</p><p> He said Chertoff's emphasis on terrorism "indicates that 
FEMA's long-standing mission of preparedness for all types of 
disasters has been forgotten at DHS."</p><p> FEMA, formerly a cabinet-level agency, was folded into the 
new Homeland Security Department as part of a major government 
reorganization after the September 11 attacks. The agency has 
borne the brunt of criticism over the delays and problems in 
responding to Katrina, and its head, Michael Brown, resigned 
after being removed from the recovery effort.</p><p> Local emergency officials had also warned the 
administration over problems meeting a National Response Plan 
requested by Bush as a battle-plan for emergencies.

</p><p> "DESPERATE NEED"</p><p> The International Association of Emergency Managers said in 
April that state and local emergency management programs were 
in "desperate need" of federal funding to meet new standards.</p><p> When the response plan was unveiled in January, 
then-Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge called it "a bold 
step forward in bringing unity in our response to disasters and 
terrorist threats and attacks."</p><p> A month later, however, Bush's fiscal 2006 budget proposed 
a 6 percent cut in funding for Emergency Management Performance 
Grants, from the $180 million appropriated by Congress in 2005 
to $170 million in 2006.</p><p> State and local officials protested what they saw as White 
House cuts targeting the very program that would help them meet 
Bush's new disaster-preparedness goals.</p><p> "The grants are the lifeblood for local programs and, in 
some cases, it's the difference between having a program in a 
county and not," said Dewayne West, the director of Emergency 
Services for Johnston County, North Carolina, and president of 
the International Association of Emergency Managers.</p><p> "It's awfully difficult," he said. "More money is needed."</p><p> The White House said it is unfair to characterize Bush's 
budget for the performance grants as a "cut," since it was 
Congress, not the White House, that had increased the funding 
to $180 million in 2005.</p><p> Scott Milburn, spokesman for the Office of Management and 
Budget, said there were several major grants programs 
supporting state and local efforts, and that nearly 10 percent, 
$268 million, went to emergency-planning activities.</p><p> According to a Congressional Research Service report, Bush 
proposed $3.36 billion for state and local homeland-security 
assistance programs for fiscal 2006 -- $250 million less than 
these programs received from Congress in 2005.

</p><p> FUNDING DROP</p><p> Louisiana alone saw its funding for key Homeland Security 
Department grant programs drop 26 percent in a year, to $42.6 
million in 2005, an analysis by Democratic Louisiana Sen. Mary 
Landrieu's office showed.</p><p> Bush, faced with the lowest approval ratings of his 
presidency, has acknowledged poor coordination in the response 
to Katrina and ordered a top-to-bottom review of U.S. disaster 
planning.</p><p> Homeland Security Department spokesman Russ Knocke said 
Chertoff also was frustrated at the lack of preparedness, and 
had told lawmakers last month that urgent changes were needed. 
"We were racing against the clock and now it's clear the clock 
beat us," Knocke said.</p><p> So far, Chertoff is balking at appeals from Lieberman and 
other lawmakers to delay proposed changes at FEMA until after a 
review of the Katrina response. "At this point of time, we 
continue to move forward," Knocke said.</p>
