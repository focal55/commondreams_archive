<P>Counting is under way after Iraq's remarkable election day - by gas and torchlight when the power fails. But it could be a week before anxious Iraqis and the world know if they have elected a religious or secular administration.

<P>Immediately, as they confront a virulent insurgency, they face a bruising new contest to lock in the fundamentals of their democracy - the role of Islam in the law, the presence of US-led forces, and ethnic or religious control of private armies, territory and Iraq's vast oil wealth.

How each of these is handled will determine the legitimacy of the new government.

<P>But the interim government failed to split the insurgency and the new team's failure or refusal to include Iraq's disgruntled Sunni minority and address festering resentment in Baghdad could prolong the violence.

      <P>Yesterday, the interim Prime Minister, Iyad Allawi, appealed for national unity, 
        speaking as though he would be staying in the job: "The terrorists now 
        know that they cannot win. We're entering a new era of our history and 
        all Iraqis - whether they voted or not - should stand side by side to 
        build their future." 
      <P>Even as Iraqi officials markedly reduced their estimate of the voter turnout, down from 72 per cent to "about" 60 per cent, world leaders hailed the vote in the face of unrelenting insurgency violence.

<P>The poll is assumed to have delivered control of Iraq's new National Assembly to representatives of the dominant Shiite community, but Dr Allawi's fate will not be known till at least a significant portion of an estimated 8 million-plus votes are counted.

      <P>Gambling on the appeal of his image as a "strongman", Dr Allawi's supporters 
        are promoting him as a consensus candidate to remain in office. But unless 
        he has garnered a solid vote, he is likely to be challenged by the interim 
        Finance Minister, Adel Abdul-Medhi, a nominee of the more conservative 
        religious parties. 
      <P>The secular- and US-backed Dr Allawi headed List 285, a mainly Shiite 
        but secular group of candidates. But the lion's share of the vote is expected 
        go to a coalition of Shiite religious parties assembled under the patronage 
        of Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, supreme spiritual leader of the Shiites. 
      <P>Iraqis were counting their dead after a bloody poll day in which 45 are thought to have died in insurgency suicide-bomb attacks on polling stations.

<P>A total ban on the movement of private transport during voting made it impossible for the insurgents to dispatch their preferred car-borne suicide bombs, but some senior Iraqis interpreted the extent to which violence was contained as a defeat for the bombers.

<P>Adnan Pachachi, the former Iraqi foreign minister and a high-profile Sunni candidate, said: "The insurgency has been exposed. They have no popular support of any kind. I think this election will weaken the insurgency."

<P>There are conflicting accounts of the extent voting by Sunnis, who were urged by some of their political parties and tribal elders to boycott the poll.

<P>Mr Pachachi claimed that in some regions the Sunni vote was as high as 40 per cent, but in others, like the Sunni Triangle, the turnout was only a trickle.

<P>The US President, George Bush, said the election was proof that Iraqis would not be intimidated. "The Iraqi people have firmly rejected the anti-democratic ideology of the terrorists."

<P>There was no foreign observation of the poll, usually considered vital in such a turbulent and fragile political environment. But Carlos Valenzuela, the United Nations' electoral adviser in Iraq, seemed to be giving a UN stamp of approval for the process when he told reporters he was encouraged by early indications.

<P>The UN Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, told Iraqis they could count on further UN help in the fraught task of drawing up a new constitution, a process which he said must include all those who were unable or unwilling to cast a ballot.

<P>The British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, Mr Bush's chief ally in the Iraq war, argued that the election was a blow to global terrorism. However, European governments that were against the US-led invasion in 2003, particularly France and Germany, restrained themselves to praising only the courage of Iraqis.<p align="center">Copyright &copy; 2005.
