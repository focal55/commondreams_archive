<p>WASHINGTON - Taken by surprise by the sudden and unexpectedly bloody
repression in Uzbekistan, the administration of President George W. Bush appears
to be backing away from its initial, reflexive support for its authoritarian ally
in the war against terrorism, Uzbek President Islam Karimov.
</p>
<p>
Echoing Karimov himself, the White House expressed particular concern about the 
escape of ''some members of a terrorist organization'' during a massive prison break
in Andijan in the strategic Fergama Valley last Friday.
</p>
<p>
The escape touched off clashes that local rights groups claim have killed nearly
750 people, the majority of them innocent demonstrators who were mowed down by government
security forces in Andijan's old town after gathering to protest Karimov's rule.
Scores more reportedly were killed trying to flee over the border to Kyrgyzstan 
over the weekend and hundreds of suspected dissidents reportedly have been rounded
up.
</p>
<p>
Washington's tone changed distinctly Monday when the State Department began playing
up the urgency of implementing far-reaching political reforms.
</p>
<p>
''We have been encouraging the Karimov government to make reforms, to make the system
more open,'' Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said Monday, adding that Central
Asia's most populous and wealthiest country ''needs, in a sense, pressure valves
that come from a more open political system.''
</p>
<p>
On Tuesday, her spokesman, Richard Boucher, was more direct.

</p>
<p>
''We have made clear to Uzbek authorities that stability depends on reaching out
to their citizenry and instituting real democratic reform and respect for rule of
law,'' he told reporters. ''Repression and violence will in no way lead to long-term
stability but to the reverse.''
</p>
<p>
That also is the analysis of independent experts, one of the most prominent of whom,
Martha Brill Olcott of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace (CEIP), warned
here Tuesday that in the absence of major reforms on both the political and economic
fronts, Uzbekistan could easily slip into civil war of the kind that effectively
paralyzed Tajikistan in the early 1990s.
</p>
<p>
''I do believe that Uzbekistan is at a tipping point'', Olcott said, adding that
the weekend's demonstrations were far more about ''economic reform and social justice''
than Islam. Although force appears to have worked in quelling the weekend's challenge
to the rule, if similar uprisings should take place simultaneously in three cities
or more, ''force won't work, and the regime will crumble from within.''
</p>
<p>
Moreover, given Uzbekistan's central location and its status as the region's most
populous country with the most powerful armed forces, its plunge into chaos could
destabilize the entire region. 
</p>
<p>
''This can potentially create tipping situations elsewhere,'' Olcott said. Neighboring
Tajikistan already had seen civil war and just last month, opposition forces in 
Kyrgyzstan ousted a long-time authoritarian leader in a largely peaceful upheaval.
</p>
<p>
''These are very fragile states,'' agreed Nancy Lubin, a Central Asia expert who
runs JNA Associates, a consulting firm that advises governments, companies, and 
non-governmental groups on operations in the region. ''If this breaks into violence
or even civil war, it will have repercussions in all of the surrounding countries,
even including Afghanistan,'' she said.
</p>
<p>
Washington already has a great deal at stake in Uzbekistan itself.
</p>
<p>
While long concerned about Karimov's iron grip -- he has ruled the country since
even before its 1991 independence from Moscow -- the U.S. has cultivated friendly
ties with the regime since the Soviet Union's collapse.
</p>
<p>

The relationship became significantly warmer shortly after the Sep. 11, 2001 terrorist
attacks on New York and the Pentagon when Karimov opened the strategic Karshi-Khanabad
air base for U.S. military use during and after the war in Afghanistan.

</p>
<p>
Tashkent was rewarded with sharply increased military and economic aid, Bush's public
declaration that Karimov's most dangerous foe, the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan
(IMU), would be treated as a branch of al-Qaeda, a White House meeting with Bush,
and frequent visits by senior defense officials.
</p>
<p>
While the Defense Department has been especially enthusiastic about the Uzbek leader,
however, other parts of the government have grown increasingly frustrated by his
refusal to implement far-reaching political and economic reforms.</p>
<p>
In addition, Karimov's controversial human-rights record -- international human 
rights groups continue to describe as ''routine'' torture, particularly of thousands
of devout Muslims whom he has imprisoned -- became increasingly embarrassing to 
the Bush administration, particularly after a former British ambassador to Tashkent,
Craig Murray, publicly confirmed that at least one dissident had been boiled to 
death.
</p>
<p>
Last July the State Department, declaring that Tashkent had failed to implement 
political reforms to which it had committed itself, announced that it would cut 
up to 18 million dollars in aid in 2005. That represented a small percentage of 
Washington's total aid program but enough to draw a protest -- and a special allocation
of 21 million dollars ostensibly to help the government there dispose of Soviet-era
biological weapons -- from its friends in the Pentagon.
</p>
<p>
Despite continued aid and Tashkent's close partnership with the Defense Department
(and with the Central Intelligence Agency, which ''rendered'' terrorist suspects
for detention and interrogation to Uzbekistan), U.S.-Uzbek ties became slightly 
more distant over the past two years, particularly as Karimov, apparently wary of
Bush's ''pro-democracy'' rhetoric after the Iraq war, drew closer to Russia.
</p>
<p>
That cooling, according to Olcott, has reduced Washington's leverage with Karimov
and makes it more difficult to persuade him to implement reforms. ''He doesn't like
just being scolded, (and) he's surrounded by sycophants,'' she said. ''We have to
think of some carrots, as well as sticks.''
</p>
<p>
She also said economic reforms may be more important than political ones and suggested
that increasing prices for this year's cotton crop and easing the tax burden on 
poor farmers could buy the regime some time. Permitting greater freedom of assembly
and purging ''power ministries'', including those that control the security forces
that carried out the repression, also could reduce unrest, she said.
</p>
<p>
In some ways, according to Lubin, U.S. aid has been counter-productive. Its focus
on strengthening military and security forces has, in the absence of effective oversight,
''raised a lot of questions'' among the population, she said, some economic measures,
such as improving tax collection and instituting a sales tax, failed to take account
of the political implications for ''extremely poor people who can barely eke out
a living.''

</p>
<p>
''Very often, we inadvertently help the very corruption we are trying to address
and legitimate structures that we are trying to change,'' she told IPS.
</p>
<p>
''We're still focused on finding the bad apples, but we're not paying attention 
to the barrel,'' she added. ''This is a barrel where only bad apples can make it.''</p>
