<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p>ROME — Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi resolved a bruising fight with his coalition partners Saturday and named a new government tasked with reviving the economy ahead of next year's general election.

<P>The Cabinet was sworn in at the presidential Quirinale Palace, becoming the nation's 60th government in as many years.

<P>Center-left opposition politicians said the Cabinet, put together in just three days, was a carbon copy of the old administration and would be incapable of confronting the economic and social problems facing Italy.

<P>But coalition allies said the new government represented a break with the past and promised that it would focus its efforts on boosting industry, increasing employment in the poorer south and protecting the purchasing power of Italian families.

<P>Saturday's overhaul saw the appointment of new health, communications, industry and culture ministers. However, National Alliance party chief Gianfranco Fini remains foreign minister and deputy premier.

<P>Berlusconi also announced the formation of a new ministry — Development and Territorial Cohesion — under Gianfranco Micciche, former vice minister of economy. Micciche, who is from Sicily, will oversee efforts to develop the economy in southern Italy — a concession by Berlusconi to Fini's faction, the largest in his coalition.

<P>Berlusconi was forced to step down last week by two allied parties demanding radical changes in strategy after the center-right suffered a crushing defeat in regional elections this month.

<P>The prime minister's political woes have grown out of Italy's economic troubles. Recent data suggest that the economy fell into a recession in the first quarter of 2005, the trade deficit is climbing and business confidence is at a 20-month low.
