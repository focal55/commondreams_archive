<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON - Prosecutors in the CIA leak case have shown intense interest in a 
2003 State Department memorandum that explained how a former diplomat came to 
be dispatched on an intelligence-gathering mission and the role of his wife, a 
CIA officer, in the trip, people who have been officially briefed on the case 
said.

        <!--/endimage/--> Investigators have been trying to learn whether officials at the White 
House and elsewhere in the administration learned of the CIA officer's 
identity from the memorandum. They are seeking to determine if any officials 
then passed the name along to journalists and if officials were truthful in 
testifying about whether they had read the memorandum, the people who have 
been briefed said, asking not to be named because the special prosecutor 
heading the investigation has requested that no one discuss the case.
<P>The memo was sent to Colin Powell, then the secretary of state, just 
before or as he traveled with President Bush and other senior officials to 
Africa starting on July 7, 2003, when the White House was scrambling to defend 
itself from a blast of criticism a few days earlier from the former diplomat, 
Joseph Wilson, current and former government officials said.
<P>Powell was seen walking around Air Force One during the trip with the 
memo in hand, said a person involved in the case who also requested anonymity 
because of the prosecutor's admonitions about talking about the investigation.
<P>Investigators are also trying to determine whether the gist of the 
information in the memo, including the name of the CIA officer, Valerie Plame, 
Wilson's wife, had been provided to the White House even earlier, said another 
person who has been involved in the case. Investigators have been looking at 
whether the State Department provided the information to the White House 
before July 6, 2003, when her husband publicly criticized the way the 
administration used intelligence to justify the war in Iraq, the person said.
<P>The prosecutors have shown the memo to witnesses at the grand jury 
investigating how the CIA officer's name was disclosed to journalists, blowing 
her cover as a covert operative and possibly violating federal law, people 
briefed on the case said. The prosecutors appear to be investigating how 
widely the memo circulated within the White House and the administration, and 
whether it might have been the original source of information for whoever 
provided the identity of Plame to Robert Novak, the syndicated columnist who 
first disclosed it in print.
<P>On Thursday, a person who has been officially briefed on the matter said 
that Karl Rove, Bush's senior adviser, had spoken about Plame with Novak 
before Novak published a column on July 14, 2003. Rove, the person said, told 
Novak he had heard much the same information, making him one of two sources 
Novak cited for his information.
<P>But the person said Rove first heard from Novak the name of Wilson's wife 
and her precise role in the decision by the CIA to send her husband to Africa 
to investigate a report, later discredited, that Saddam Hussein was trying to 
acquire nuclear material there.

<P>It is not clear who Novak's original source was, or whether Novak has 
revealed the source's identity to the grand jury.
<P>Rove also talked about the Wilsons with Matthew Cooper, a Time magazine 
reporter, on July 11, 2003, two days after he discussed the case with Novak. 
After his conversation with Cooper, the Associated Press reported Friday, Rove 
sent an e-mail message to Stephen Hadley, then the deputy national security 
adviser, about the exchange, saying he "didn't take the bait" when Cooper 
suggested that Wilson's criticisms had been damaging to the administration.
<P>Rove told the grand jury in the case that the e-mail message was 
consistent with his assertion that he had not intended to divulge Plame's 
identity but instead to rebut Wilson's criticisms of the administration's use 
of intelligence about Iraq, the AP reported, citing legal professionals 
familiar with Rove's testimony.
<P>Dozens of White House and administration officials have testified to the 
grand jury, and several officials have been called back for further 
questioning.
<P>The special prosecutor, Patrick Fitzgerald, has sought to determine how 
much Ari Fleischer, the White House spokesman at the time of the leak, knew 
about the State Department memo. Lawyers involved in the case said Fitzgerald 
asked a number of questions about Fleischer's role.
<P>Fleischer was with Bush and much of the senior White House staff in 
Africa when Powell received the memo. A spokeswoman for Powell said he was out 
of the country and could not comment on the memo. Fleischer said in an e-mail 
message this week that he would not comment on the case.
<P>Fitzgerald has also looked into any role that might have been played by 
Lewis Libby, Vice President Dick Cheney's chief of staff. Lawyers with clients 
in the case have said their clients have been asked questions about Libby's 
conversations in the days after Wilson's article  --  in part based on Libby's 
handwritten notes, which he turned over to the prosecutor.
<P>In addition, several journalists have been asked about their 
conversations with Libby. At least one, Tim Russert of NBC News, has suggested 
that prosecutors wanted to know whether Russert had told Libby of Plame's 
identity. After Russert met with Fitzgerald, NBC said in a statement that he 
did not provide the information to Libby.
