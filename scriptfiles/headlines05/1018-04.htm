<p>"We have grave concerns that the court will not provide the fair trial guarantees required by international law," said Richard Dicker, director of the International Justice Program at the Human Rights Watch, one of the world's leading rights advocacy groups.</p>
<p>Last Sunday, the group released an 18-page briefing paper, providing a concise explanation of human rights concerns arising from the statute of the "Supreme Iraqi Criminal Tribunal" established to try the deposed Iraqi leader and others.</p>
<p>Legal experts point out that the Tribunal has no requirements to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt and that it also lacks adequate protections for the accused to mount a defense on conditions equal to those enjoyed by the prosecution.</p>
<p>In addition, the Tribunal has the powers to impose the death penalty, a measure that has received scathing criticism from the Geneva-based UN Commission for Human Rights.</p>
<p>"The Tribunal's powers to impose the death penalty demonstrate the extent to which it contravenes international human rights standards," said Leandro Despouy, the Commission's rapporteur, in a new report to the General Assembly.</p>
<p>"Because it was established during an occupation and was financed by the United States, its legitimacy has been widely questioned, with the result that its credibility has been tarnished," he added.</p>
<p>Hussein and seven other former Iraqi officials will go on trial on October 19, despite attempts by defense lawyers to get the proceedings delayed. If convicted they could indeed face the death penalty.</p>

<p>The case involves crimes that took place in the town of al-Dujail in 1982. Hussein and others are accused of being responsible for the killing of 140 people at the hands of government security forces, which opened fire in retaliation for an assassination attempt on Hussein as his motorcade passed through the town.</p>
<p>Noting that the Tribunal may only try Iraqis for acts committed before the May 2003 U.S.-led invasion, Despouy has urged the Iraqi government to "follow the example of other countries with deficient judicial systems by asking the UN to set up an independent tribunal."</p>
<p>So far, there has been no response from Baghdad to his suggestion.</p>
<p>The Iraqi Special Tribunal was first set up by the U.S.-led Coalition Provisional Authority and later reaffirmed by the Iraqi interim government. It hears cases involving Iraqi nationals or residents accused of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, or other serious crimes committed between 1968 and 2003.</p>
<p>In his report, which focuses on the independence of judges and lawyers, Despouy also criticized the United States for its refusal to allow UN officials to visit U.S.-run prisons in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Guantanamo Bay. The UN human rights observer described the retrial of suspects at Guantanamo by the U.S. military commissions as "another</p>
<p>disturbing development."</p>
<p>"They do not allow appeals to be brought before a civil judge, deny the right to defense and discriminate between nationals and non-nationals, among other problems," he said.</p>
<p>Early this year, the U.S. government continued to insist that "circumstances were not favorable" to honor request by several UN human rights experts to visit its detention centers in Iraq, Guantanamo, and other places, he added.</p>
<p>However, UN experts have decided to conduct an investigation regardless of whether they are allowed to visit the U.S.-run prisons, Despouy told the General Assembly.</p>

<p>As for Saddam's trial, Human Rights Watch said as long as the political climate in Iraq remains fragile, the legitimacy of the court will continue to be in doubt. "To provide a measure of truth and justice for hundreds of thousands of victims of gross human rights violations in Iraq, fair trials are essential," he said.
<p>
The group's briefing paper has urged the tribunal to adopt changes that will improve its compliance with international human rights law concerning fair trials.
<p>
"The proceedings must be fair and be seen to be fair, and that means ensuing that the accused can vigorously defend themselves," says Dicker, who has closely monitored the legal steps taken for Hussein's trial.
<p>
"These trials will be closely watched inside Iraq and throughout the world," he adds. "It's not too late for the tribunal's judges to fix some of these problems if they take steps for a fair trial."</p>
