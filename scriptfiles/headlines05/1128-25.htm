<p>"Former FEMA Director Michael Brown, heavily
criticized for his agency's slow response to Hurricane
Katrina, is starting a disaster preparedness
consulting firm to help clients avoid the sort of
errors that cost him his job."<i> (link:

<p>This mind-bending news got me to thinking: If it is
possible to convert ill-managed catastrophes into
personal financial gain, what kind of consultancy work
could other power-brokers get into once their careers
started to wind down? 

<p><b>The Consultant: George W. Bush</b><br>
<b>The Company Name: The Bring It On Group</b><br>
<b>The Pitch:  </b>President George W. Bush made a career out
of failing to understand the basic tenets of
geo-political strategy. Who can forget the incredible
moment when the Commander-in-Chief of the United
States military actually encouraged the enemy to
attack his own troops with the infamous line, "Bring
it on!"? This timeless piece of macho, bone-headed
leadership paved the way for the formation of The
Bring It On Group: a consultancy firm dedicated to
eliminating testosterone-soaked managerial decisions
that could, in retrospect, seem like organizational
suicide.
<p><b>The Consultant: Rupert Murdoch</b><br>
<b>The Company Name: Socialist Advisory Cooperative</b><br>
<b>The Pitch:</b>  With a stable of media companies that
includes Fox News, The Sun (UK), and The New York
Post, Rupert Murdoch is ideally placed to help
organizations eliminate harmful corporate practices
such as war-mongering, xenophobia, sexism and
narrow-minded bigotry. Groups hoping to instill
egalitarian, socialist values into their organization
should consider the Socialist Advisory Cooperative.
Rupert Murdoch, via his News Corporation tentacles,
made billions in profits from playing (simultaneously)
the soft-porn, populist, moralistic, xenophobic and
nationalist cards. His hypocrisy and double-standards
knew no bounds! Now that your organization wishes to
go in the opposite direction, Mr. Murdoch can lead the
way.
<p><b>The Consultant: John Kerry</b><br>
<b>The Company Name: The Relatively-Moderate-Yet-Patriotic Consulting Company
of Jonathan Forbes Kerry</b><br> 
<b>The Pitch:</b>  Are your mangers indecisive? Wishy-Washy?
Pampered? The Relatively-Moderate-Yet-Patriotic
Consulting Company of Jonathan Forbes Kerry is here to
help. We are not exactly sure how, but we are probably
better than the Bring It On Group...not that loving
America or supporting Guantanamo are wrong. We're just
better. But not in a snobby East Coast way. We like
beer like the rest of you. We were in Vietnam. We
wanted to bomb Iraq like everyone else. Don't get us
wrong.
<p><b>The Consultant:</b> <b>Bill Bennett<br>
The Company Name:</b> <b>Blackjack Consultancy</b><br>
<b>The Pitch:</b>  When Bill Bennett drops a few hundred
thousand at the tables in Las Vegas, it isn't the
house that wins...your company does! After making a
career out of pontificating about everything from the
state of education in the United States, to drugs, to
the ethical decline of our nation, Bennett can offer
your business priceless insights into the perils of
taking the moral high-ground once too often. Employees
love guidance, but when bosses cross the line and
become pompous hypocrites, company morale can sag
along with management credibility. Let Blackjack
Consultancy help you avoid the pitfalls of
self-righteousness!   
<p><b>The Consultant:</b> <b>John Bolton</b><br>
<b>The Company Name:</b> <b>One Globe Solutions</b><br>
<b>The Pitch:</b>  In an increasingly globalized world,
companies require expert advice on how to build
meaningful, lasting relationships across religious,
geographic and cultural boundaries. Clients will
benefit from John Bolton's vast experience of consensus-destruction and strong-arm bullying. Who better to help your organization
adopt an internationalist outlook than the man who put the "UN" in "Unilateral"?
<p><b>The Consultant:</b> <b>Samuel Robson "Rob" Walton</b> (Chairman
of the Board of Directors, Wal-Mart)<br>
<b>The Company Name:</b> <b>Living Wage Consultancy</b><br>
<b>The Pitch: </b>Workers in large corporations are often
subjected to the union-busting tactics of their
owners. Living Wage Consultancy is here to help
workers break free of those shackles! Rob Walton can
teach unions the "tricks of the trade" used by mega-corporations to destroy worker solidarity and maximize profits, such as:
reducing healthcare costs by not hiring anyone who looks like they might get sick in the next 15 years; forcing workers to buy their
own insurance at rip-off rates; and -- the old classic -- threatening to fire anyone and everyone who even looks at a union leaflet.
<p><b>The Consultant:</b> <b>Pat Robertson</b><br>
<b>The Company Name:</b> <b>WWJD Consultants</b><br>
<b>The Pitch:</b> WWJD (What Would Jesus Do?) Consultants can
help businesses integrate Christian pacifist ethics
into their corporate operations. As any literate
third-grader could tell you, Jesus would probably have
been opposed to the state-sanctioned murder of an
elected head of a sovereign nation. Still, this didn't
stop WWJD founder Pat Robertson from endorsing such an
action against Hugo Chavez! With Pat at the helm, WWJD Consultants can teach organizations, corporations, governments and
individuals the Christian values of equal wealth redistribution, turning the other cheek and the evils of violence. The Reverend
Robertson misunderstood the Bible...let him show you how to avoid his sins! 
<p><b>The Consultants: Wolf Blitzer, Judy Miller & Dan
Rather</b><br>
<b>The Company Name:  Soft Ball Consulting
</b><br>
<b>The Pitch: </b>Leaders of news organizations who wish to
train their journalists in the arts of tough
cross-examination and investigative reporting need
look no further. Soft Ball Consulting sees the
creation of the journalistic "Dream Team" of Blitzer,
Miller and Rather. This trio has an unparalleled
history of pandering to the powerful, lobbing
cream-puff questions to the corrupt power elite,
accepting the party line as gospel, and ignoring
issues central to the workings of American democracy
in favor of the inane and the sexy. They have now
learned from their myriad mistakes, and so can you.   
<p><b>The Consultant: Tony Blair</b><br>
<b>The Company Name: The Poodle Group<br>
The Pitch:</b> The Poodle Group, led by former British
Prime Minister Tony Blair, is dedicated to helping
individuals and organizations who find themselves
under the thumb of a more powerful co-worker,
organization, or "ally". Nothing creates tension more
than an imbalanced power relationship: a situation
which can lead to undignified fawning and gutless
sycophancy. Let the Poodle Group teach you how to
assert your individuality and opinions, while
maintaining your dignity. (!!!Ask about our 90%
discount for U.S. customers!!!) 
<p><b>The Consultant: Dick Cheney</b><br>
<b>The Company Name: Go Fuck Yourself Consulting</b><br>
<b>The Pitch: </b>If not Dick Cheney to tell you that
government contracts are unfairly awarded to companies
with the closest ties to the administration in power,
then who? If your business wishes to bid for a
government contract, but you are worried that it will
simply be palmed off to a company with party hacks on
the payroll, Dick Cheney and his partners have three
words for you: "Go Fuck Yourself!"
