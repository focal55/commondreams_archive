<p>BAGHDAD   - Tens of thousands of followers of a  rebel Shi'ite cleric marched in Baghdad on Saturday to denounce  the U.S. presence in Iraq and demand a speedy trial of Saddam  Hussein on the second anniversary of his overthrow.

      Chanting "No, no to the occupiers," men loyal to cleric  Moqtada al-Sadr streamed from the poor Shi'ite district of Sadr  City to Firdos Square in central Baghdad where Saddam's statue  was torn down two years ago, in a peaceful show of strength.
<p> 
			
			The square and side streets were quickly packed with crowds  waving Iraqi flags and brandishing effigies of Saddam, British  Prime Minister Tony Blair and President Bush.
<p> 
			
			"No America! No Saddam! Yes to Islam!" many chanted. One  group of demonstrators burned an American flag.
<p> 
			
			"We want a stable Iraq and this will only happen through  independence," said a statement from Sadr's office read out at  the rally. "There will be no security and stability unless the  occupiers leave... The occupiers must leave my country."
<p> 
			
			Iraqi security forces shut down central Baghdad ahead of  the march and were keeping a tight watch. U.S. forces, around  135,000 of whom remain in Iraq, were out of sight. Most  protesters were searched for weapons before reaching the  square.
<p> 
			
			"I came from Sadr City to demand a timetable for the  withdrawal of the occupation," said Abbas, a young, bearded  protester sitting on the grass in the square. "Every Iraqi has  a right to demand his freedom. The Americans wanted time and we  gave them time, now we want to rule ourselves."
<p> 
			
			Followers of Sadr from the southern Shi'ite cities of  Basra, Amara and Nassiriya traveled hundreds of miles to join  the protest, showing the appeal the young cleric, who has led  two uprisings against U.S.-led forces, can command.
<p> 
			
			By early evening, most protesters had dispersed. There were  no reports of violence.
<p> 
			
			MASS TURNOUT
<p> 
			
			The protest was the largest since the Jan. 30 election and  the first since a new government began forming.
<p> 
			
			U.S. forces last year pledged to arrest Sadr, a low-ranking  cleric in his mid-30s, and destroy his Mehdi Army militia. But  as part of a peace deal to end his uprising in August, he was  not detained and he pledged to renounce violence.
<p> 
			
			Firdos Square has become a central rallying place for  Iraqis since Saddam's overthrow two years ago. U.S. forces last  year shut down the square, sealing it off with razor wire, to  prevent people massing on the first anniversary.
<p> 
			
			Saturday's protest taps into the growing frustration among  large swathes of the Iraqi population against the U.S. presence  in the country. Armed insurgents continue to target U.S.  soldiers and Iraqi security forces they regard as  collaborators.
<p> 
			
			A U.S. soldier was killed in a roadside bomb blast north of  Baghdad on Friday, raising to at least 1,543 the number of U.S.  troops who have lost their lives in Iraq.
<p> 
			
			On Saturday, the bodies of 15 Iraqi soldiers were found in  the lawless area just south of Baghdad, Iraqi police said.  Police said the soldiers were in a truck that was stopped by  insurgents the previous day. All the men had been shot.
<p> 
			
			In the northern city of Mosul, a suicide car bomber killed  two policeman and a child, and wounded several, police said.

      Even many Iraqis who would not take up arms against the  Americans still want U.S. and foreign troops, together  numbering around 160,000, to leave. U.S. commanders say they  will withdraw only once Iraqi forces are strong enough.
<p> 
			
			Scandals such as the abuse of Iraqi detainees by U.S.  soldiers at Abu Ghraib and the deaths of Iraqi detainees in  U.S. custody have exacerbated tensions.
<p> 
			
			There is also anger that more than two years since the war,  Saddam and his senior lieutenants have still not been tried.  Trials are expected to begin later this year, although Saddam  is unlikely to be one of the first to appear in court.
<p> 
			
			"We want to try Saddam and his men ourselves with no  foreign interference," said Baghdad protester Murtatha  al-Yaqubi.
<p> 
			
			The demonstration came as efforts continued to complete a  the formation of a government 10 weeks since the election.
<p> 
			
			A president, two vice presidents and a prime minister have  been named, but the prime minister, Islamist Shi'ite leader  Ibrahim al-Jaafari, was still working on his cabinet and has  said it could take up to two weeks before it is finalized.
<p> 
			
			Iraqi officials have cautioned that the longer it takes to  form a government the more it will play into the hands of  insurgents, who will view authorities as weak and indecisive.
