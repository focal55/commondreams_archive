<p>LA PAZ, Bolivia   - Bolivia's Congress on Thursday  named Supreme Court President Eduardo Rodriguez to replace  Carlos Mesa as president in an effort to end weeks of political  crisis in the Andean nation.
<p> 
			
			Rodriguez, takes over the presidency of a country polarized  between indigenous movements demanding more power and wealthy  regional provinces pressing for more independence.<p>

Bolivia's new interim president, Eduardo Rodriguez, takes office on Friday with a vow to hold elections and work with indigenous movements clamoring for nationalization of energy reserves and regional provinces demanding autonomy. La Paz is still struggling with fuel and food shortages after blockades by the poor Indian majority, who called for state control over natural gas reserves and a special assembly on constitutional reforms to give them more political power.

The new president, a lawyer with a master's degree in  public administration from Harvard University, is an interim  leader who is required by the constitution to call elections  later this year.<p> 
			
			President Carlos Mesa resigned after three weeks of  blockades by the poor Indian majority, who called for  nationalization of energy reserves and a special constitutional  assembly. Protests caused fuel and food shortages in La Paz and  stoked fears of violence in South America's poorest nation.<p> 
			
			"Constitutional duty has brought me here as a judge, who  has a mandate to fulfill and who is convinced Bolivians need  democracy, union and peace," Rodriguez said as he was sworn in  during an emergency session by the Congress.<p> 
			
			Lawmakers, who abandoned earlier attempts to vote on the  new president amid violent protests, held a brief late-night  session after Senate President Hormando Vaca Diez and the  leader of the lower house of Congress both declined to assume  the presidency.<p> 
			
			The constitution allowed Vaca Diez to replace Mesa, but he  faced growing opposition from Indian leaders and many Bolivians  who saw him as representative of a failed traditional political  class.<p> 
			
			"Hopefully this decision will help pacify the country,"  Mesa said as he left the presidential palace. "I apologize to  the country, but I did my best."<p> 
			
			Bolivian troops shot and killed a miner in protests on  Thursday as lawmakers suspended the first session. Police  firing tear gas battled peasants and miners who set off sticks  of dynamite and set fire to tires in the streets to protest the  miners death and demand Vaca Diez step aside.<p> 
			
			Bolivia's military commanders had earlier called for calm  and said they would support Congress, if its decision upholds  the law.<p> 
			
			"We will respect the Congress' decision ... as long as  there is no break with the constitution and no break with  democracy, the armed forces will remain the supervisors of this  process," Armed Forces Commander-in-Chief Adm. Luis Aranda  said.<p> 
			
			CALL FOR NATIONALIZATION<p> 
			
			The naming of Rodriguez as president was a key demand for  protesters in the militant city of El Alto, a sprawling poor  area in the mountains above La Paz, who had vowed to maintain  their blockades of the capital unless Vaca Diez renounced the  presidency.<p> 
			
			Evo Morales, a left-leaning former coca grower and  indigenous leader, warned that his MAS party would not allow  Vaca Diez to assume power and called for civil disobedience to  pressure for elections.<p> 
			
			But Morales and other indigenous leaders say  nationalization is a key issue they will not negotiate. It was  unclear how Rodriguez would deal with those demands.<p> 
			
			Peasant protesters have blocked access to several natural  gas fields operated by foreign companies in eastern Santa Cruz  province and forced them to halt production.<p> 
			
			Spanish energy group Repsol YPF said protests had forced it  to reduce output by an amount equal to 0.3 percent of its  global production and Brazil's Petrobras warned civil unrest  could hurt its natural gas supplies.<p> 
			
			Bolivia's deepening crisis prompted U.N. Secretary-General  Kofi Annan to dispatch a senior official to the country at the  request of the government.<p> 
			
			Mesa, who came to power in 2003 after his predecessor was  ousted during a bloody Indian siege, urged early elections  after offering to resign. The former TV presenter had little  congressional support and was weakened as Bolivia became  polarized during his term. Rodriguez inherits a difficult task.<p> 
			
			Indian groups say Bolivia's energy riches have benefited  only the white, European-descended elite. They want an assembly  on constitutional reform to give them more representation. But  in wealthy Santa Cruz, business leaders fed up with what they  see as pandering to radical indigenous groups are demanding  more autonomy from La Paz.<p> 
			
			Weeks of often violent protests and roadblocks in La Paz  have left gas stations dry and meat and bread increasingly  scarce. Several airlines have suspended flights and the United  States ordered nonemergency personnel to leave its embassy.<p>
