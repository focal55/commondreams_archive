Cheney is due to attend the inauguration on Monday of Afghanistan's first parliament in nearly three decades, with thousands of US troops here since helping to topple the hardline Taliban in 2001.</p>
<p>"US forces are still detaining people without charge indefinitely in operating bases," <a href="http://www.hrw.org/doc/?t=asia" target="_new">Human Rights Watch Asia</a> research director Sam Zarifi told AFP Sunday.</p>
<p>"The problems are not (the main bases of) Bagram and Kandahar, but the 20 to 30 operation bases in the country. We don't know where they are. They are the places where the bad treatments are," he said.</p>
<p>"We'd like to see Karzai ask Cheney to place some legal framework about the behaviour of US forces here, to give access to the Afghan Human Rights Commission, which has a constitutional mandate to observe places of detention."</p>
<p>US troops conducting their "war on terror" in Afghanistan, including hunting down militants from the Taliban and other Islamic groups, have been accused of several violations in Afghanistan.</p>

<p>At least eight detainees are believed to have died in US custody at the main US base at Bagram, near Kabul, since 2001.</p>
<p>"The US detain people, keep them for a while and then release them without charges. It sometimes take two months for the family to know where the detainees are," Zarifi said.</p>
<p>Cheney should in turn use his visit to affirm Washington's support for "justice and accountability" in Afghanistan, including a plan to deal with its war-torn past by putting on trial rights violators.</p>
<p>"Otherwise Mr Cheney's presence tomorrow (Monday) could be interpreted by many Afghans as US approval for the inclusion of many warlords and human rights abusers in the parliament," Zarifi said.</p>
<p>Several men accused of rights abuses will be among the legislators to take their seats in parliament on Monday and rights groups said they may use their new powers to vote themselves an amnesty.</p>
<p>"Why can we put Saddam on trial after two years and not Afghan warlords who violated human rights and who are now going to sit at the parliament he's going to inaugurate?" Zarifi asked.</p>
