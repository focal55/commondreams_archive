<p>ISTANBUL, Turkey -
A group of Turkish female activists confronted Undersecretary of State 
Karen Hughes on Wednesday with heated complaints about the U.S.-led invasion of 
Iraq, turning a session designed to highlight the empowerment of women into a 
raw display of anger at U.S. policy in the region.

        <!--/endimage/--> "This war is really, really bringing your positive efforts to the level of 
zero," said Hidayet Sefkatli Tuksal, an activist with the Capital City Women's 
Forum. She said it was difficult to talk about cooperation between women in the 
United States and Turkey as long as Iraq was under occupation. 
<P>Hughes, a longtime confidante of President Bush with the job of burnishing 
the U.S. image overseas, has generally met with polite audiences  --  many of 
whom received U.S. funding or consisted of former exchange students  --  during 
a tour of Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Turkey this week. 
<P>In this case, the U.S. Embassy asked Kader, an umbrella group that 
supports female candidates, to assemble the guest list. None of the activists 
currently receive U.S. funds, and the guests apparently had little desire to 
mince words. Six of the eight women who spoke at the session, held in Ankara, 
the capital, focused on the Iraq war. 
<P>"War makes the rights of women completely erased, and poverty comes after 
war  --  and women pay the price," said Fatma Nevin Vargun, a Kurdish women's 
rights activist. Vargun denounced the arrest of Cindy Sheehan, the Vacaville 
activist mother of a soldier killed in Iraq, in front of the White House on 
Monday at an antiwar protest. 
<P>Hughes, looking increasingly pained, defended the decision to invade Iraq 
as a difficult and wrenching moment for President Bush, but necessary to 
protect America. 
<P>"You're concerned about war, and no one likes war," she said. But, she 
said, "to preserve the peace sometimes my country believes war is necessary." 
Hughes also asserted that women are faring much better in Iraq than under the 
rule of deposed leader Saddam Hussein. 

<P>"War is not necessary for peace," shot back Feray Salman, a human rights 
advocate. She said countries should not try to impose democracy through war, 
adding that "we can never, ever export democracy and freedom from one country 
to another." 
<P>Tuksal said she was "feeling myself wounded, feeling myself insulted here" 
by Hughes' response. "In every photograph that comes from Iraq, there is that 
look of fear in the eyes of women and children. ... This needs to be resolved 
as soon as possible." 
<P>Turkey, a member of NATO, has long been a close ally of the United States, 
but relations have soured during the Bush administration, especially after the 
Turkish parliament blocked a request to allow U.S. troops to stage an invasion 
of northern Iraq via Turkey.  
<P>A June poll by the Pew Global Attitudes Project showed that only 17 
percent of Turks supported the U.S. war on terror and many considered the 
United States a threat to world peace. 
<P>Later Wednesday, Hughes traveled to Istanbul, where she met privately at 
the historic Topkapi Palace with Islamic, Jewish and Christian leaders. 
<P>"We discussed the problems of the world," Hughes said afterward, adding 
that the religious leaders were supportive but did not hold back critical 
comments. She gave no further details.
