<p>LONDON - Nelson Mandela, 86, needed no support when he 
walked up to address thousands at Trafalgar Square in London Thursday. He 
had the support of a cheering crowd, and of one of the most powerful 
movements ever to gather against world poverty.

<p>
Mandela spoke at Trafalgar Square -- London's traditional venue for 
people to make a political statement -- on the eve of the meeting Friday 
and Saturday of finance ministers from the G7 countries (the United 
States, Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Japan). He was 
carrying a message for that meeting, and succeeded before it began.

Steps to counter poverty are already set to dominate the G7 meeting. 
Traditionally G7 finance ministers are more given to talk of exchange 
rates and macro multinational issues.
<p>
What Mandela says counts, and behind Mandela spoke about 220 British 
civil society groups who invited him to the Trafalgar Square rally. The 
British groups came together late last year in a campaign '<a href="http://www.makepovertyhistory.org/home.html" target="_new">Make Poverty 
History</a>'.
<p>
''Many of us realized that 2005 is going to be an important year to 
campaign against poverty,'' Lysbeth Holdoway from Oxfam who has been 
working with the Make Poverty History campaign told IPS Thursday. This 
year Britain has presidency of G8 (which includes also Russia) and will 
have presidency of the European Union (EU) in the second half of the year.
<p>
''So we have come together this year in UK and around the world to put 
pressure on governments to act,'' she said. The British movement is tied 
internationally into the Global Campaign for Action Against Poverty. 
<p>
Mandela was invited to Trafalgar Square ''because he is such an important 
leader, and we know that if he came people would have to take action,'' 
Holdoway said. 
<p>
The immediate result was that civil society, backed by all major trade 
unions and the Church of England, has managed at least in substantial 
measure to set the agenda for a G7 finance ministers' meeting.
<p>
''As you know, I recently formally announced my retirement from public 
life and should really not be here,'' Mandela said. ''However, as long as 
poverty, injustice and gross inequality persist in our world, none of us 
can truly rest.'' 
<p>

Mandela linked the new civil society campaign with his own campaign 
against apartheid. ''The Global Campaign for Action Against Poverty can 
take its place as a public movement alongside the movement to abolish 
slavery and the international solidarity against apartheid,'' he said. 
<p>
Mandela told the wildly cheering crowd: ''I can never thank the people of 
Britain enough for their support through those days of the struggle 
against apartheid. . . . Through your will and passion, you assisted in 
consigning that evil system forever to history. But in this new century, 
millions of people in the world's poorest countries remain imprisoned, 
enslaved, and in chains. They are trapped in the prison of poverty. It is 
time to set them free.''
<p>
There was more than emotion to Mandela's appeal. ''The steps that are 
needed from the developed nations are clear,'' he said. ''The first is 
ensuring trade justice. The second is an end to the debt crisis for the 
poorest countries. The third is to deliver much more aid and make sure it 
is of the highest quality.'' 
<p>
Mandela said finally: ''I say to all those (G7) leaders: do not look the 
other way; do not hesitate. Recognize that the world is hungry for 
action, not words. Act with courage and vision.'' Mandela was due to take 
his message directly to the ministers at a meeting with them Friday. 
<p>
The task will not be easy, Mandela said. ''But not to do this would be a 
crime against humanity, against which I ask all humanity now to rise up.''
<p>
The Mandela-civil society cocktail was made considerably stronger with 
support from Britain's chancellor of the exchequer (finance minister) 
Gordon Brown. Brown wants the ministers to extend a freeze on debt 
repayment by the tsunami-hit countries, and to take decisions to write 
off the debt of the poorest nations.
<p>
At the least Brown wants about 40 billion dollars owed by the poorest 
countries, most of them in Africa, to be completely written off. He is 
also looking for radical decisions on more fair trade rules and for a 
doubling of developmental aid.
<p>
Members of the Make Poverty History campaign point out that 2.8 billion 
people around the world live in poverty, and that 30,000 die from poverty-
related causes every day.
<p>
Britain last hosted the G8 meeting in Birmingham in 1998. An estimated 
70,000 people came together then to form a human chain around the city 
center to demand cancellation of unpayable debt. 

<p>
This time the civil society groups who brought those people together are 
a stronger force -- with stronger allies.
