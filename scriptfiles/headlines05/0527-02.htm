   WASHINGTON - Democrats forced the Senate on Thursday evening to postpone a vote on John R. Bolton as ambassador to the United Nations, demanding that the White House first hand over classified information about Mr. Bolton's conduct that it has refused for weeks to provide.</p>
<p> The move put off until at least June 7, when the Senate returns from its Memorial Day break, any decision on Mr. Bolton's nomination, and it set Democrats and Republicans in the Senate at odds once again just three days after they reached a compromise intended to avert filibusters on judicial nominations. Senator Bill Frist, the majority leader, described himself as "very, very disappointed" by what Senator Harry Reid, the top Democrat, conceded was the "first filibuster of the year."</p>
<p> With Republicans holding a solid majority in the Senate, Mr. Bolton still appeared poised to win confirmation if his nomination is put to an up or down vote. But a Republican-led effort to end debate on Mr. Bolton tallied only a 56-to-42 majority, leaving Republicans 4 votes short of the 60 necessary to bring Mr. Bolton's nomination to a final roll call. </p>

<p> Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Delaware Democrat who has led the fight against Mr. Bolton, said Democrats would agree to a floor vote on Mr. Bolton when the Senate returned from its recess. But Mr. Biden said Democrats would insist that the Bush administration first provide information the Senate has sought concerning a battle Mr. Bolton waged in the summer of 2003 over intelligence assessments on Syria, and the names of Americans given to Mr. Bolton by the National Security Agency as having been mentioned in intercepted communications.</p>
<p>The showdown on the Senate floor guaranteed more chapters to come in the political battle that has raged since Mr. Bolton was nominated by President Bush more than 11 weeks ago. The struggle has been the sharpest in years over a nomination to a major foreign policy post, and it has been by far the most fractious fight over an American envoy to the United Nations. </p>
<p> The White House expressed immediate dismay at the Senate's delay in the final vote over Mr. Bolton's nomination. </p>
<p>"Just 72 hours after all the good will and bipartisanship, it's disappointing to see the Democratic leadership resort back to such a partisan approach," said Scott McClellan, the White House spokesman. Asked about the Democratic demands for additional documents, Mr. McClellan said, "They have all the information they need."</p>
<p> The vote, at 6:15 p.m. on Thursday, came at the end of 15 hours of speeches on the Senate floor that reflected bitter divisions between the parties. But with only one Republican, George R. Voinovich of Ohio, openly expressing opposition to Mr. Bolton, Mr. Biden ultimately portrayed  the vote on whether to end debate not as a referendum on  Mr. Bolton, but as a test of  the Senate's willingness  to  "stand up for itself" in insisting on access to the information. </p>
<p> Mr. McClellan indicated that the White House was not considering a recess appointment of Mr. Bolton at this point because the Republican leadership in the Senate would try again to bring the nomination to a vote when the Senate returned. </p>
<p>Three Democrats - Mark Pryor of Arkansas, Ben Nelson of Nebraska and Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana - joined 53 Republicans in seeking to bring Mr. Bolton's nomination to a vote; 40 Democrats and one independent voted no on the motion to invoke cloture, as the Senate calls a bid to limit debate under its rules. Knowing that his side had lost, Senator Frist then cast his vote with the minority, bringing their total to 42. The move was a tactical gesture intended to allow him to call for another vote later. Mr. Voinovich sided with other Republicans in seeking to bring the matter to a vote, but also took the unusual step of returning to the Senate floor for a second day to echo in emotional terms a message he had first delivered on Wednesday about the potential damage to the American image around the world if Mr. Bolton were sent to the United Nations.</p>

<p> "When was the last time so many individuals have emerged from an administration to send warning signs to the U.S. Congress about an individual?" Mr. Voinovich asked, in a reference to former colleagues of Mr. Bolton who have voiced strong public opposition to him. Mr. Voinovich added, "We owe it to the United States, our children and our grandchildren, to heed this warning, and to ask our president, 'Please, Mr. President, find a better candidate to send to the United Nations.' "</p>
<p> A spokeswoman for Mr. Voinovich, Marcie Ridgway, said Mr. Voinovich regarded Mr. Bolton as an obstacle to a promise the senator had made to his own children and grandchildren, in deciding to seek re-election to the Senate last year. </p>
<p> Throughout the prolonged confirmation battle, Mr. Bush and his aides have stood fast in defending Mr. Bolton against opponents who have charged, in particular, that he acted improperly in his treatment of subordinates and in seeking to shape intelligence estimates on Cuba, Syria and other issues to reflect his own views. But the White House has dismissed those claims as exaggerated, and has argued that Mr. Bolton's blunt manner will serve him well at the United Nations. </p>
<p>Among Mr. Bolton's supporters, Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, was among those who urged the Senate to cast aside the Democratic objections and vote on Thursday in favor of the nomination. "Elections have consequences," Mr. McCain said. </p>
<p>Among the critics, Senator Christopher Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, warned that Mr. Bolton's confirmation would "send a dreadful, dreadful signal about our credibility to the world." </p>
<p> In addition, Mr. Dodd joined Mr. Biden in urging the Senate to stand firm in insisting that the administration provide it with the information on Syria and the intercepted communications that Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee have sought unsuccessfully for more than a month. </p>
<p>"Aside from how you feel about Mr. Bolton, yes or no," Mr. Dodd said, "it's important, I think, for this institution to stand up for its rights."</p>

<p>The State Department has said that providing the information about the debate on Syria would have a "chilling effect" on future internal debates within the government. As for the intercepted communications, Gen. Michael V. Hayden, the deputy director of national intelligence, briefed the Republican and Democratic leaders of the Senate intelligence committee two weeks ago about the reports from the National Security Agency about which Mr. Bolton had used his power as an under secretary of state to obtain additional highly classified information. </p>
<p> But General Hayden refused, on privacy grounds, to provide those senators with the names of 19 Americans mentioned in those reports, although Mr. Bolton had been able to obtain the names. Mr. Biden said that position was unacceptable, and reflected a mistrust of the Senate. </p>
<p>Mr. Biden and Mr. Dodd had insisted that their effort to prevent a final vote on Mr. Bolton on Thursday would not amount to a filibuster, on the ground that they would be willing to back down from their position if the administration provided the documents. But after the vote, Mr. Frist mocked that position, suggesting that the success of 42 senators in preventing a confirmation vote on Mr. Bolton "looks like a filibuster, sounds like a filibuster" and even "quacks like a filibuster." </p>
<p> Mr. Reid did not quarrel with that assessment, but added, "How can we work together when information is not supplied?"</p>
