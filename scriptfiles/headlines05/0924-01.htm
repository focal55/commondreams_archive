<P>A former American soldier who served in Iraq and filed for conscientious 
  objector status has given an extraordinary insight into the war's 
  dehumanizing effects &shy; an insight that helps explain why the British and 
  American public has turned sharply against the occupation.

</p>

        
        
          
          
            <p>
  On the eve of large anti-war demonstrations in Washington and London, Hart 
  Viges has told how indiscriminate fire from US troops is likely to have 
  killed an untold number of Iraqi civilians. Mr Viges, 29, said he was still 
  haunted by the memories of what he experienced and urged President George 
  Bush to withdraw US troops from Iraq.
</p>
<p>
  "I don't know how many innocents I killed with my mortar rounds," 
  Mr Viges, who served with the 82nd Airborne Division, said during a 
  presentation this week at American University in Washington. "In 
  Baghdad, I had days that I don't want to remember. I try to forget," he 
  added 
</p>
<p>
  The rare insight into the chaos of the combat &shy; including an order to open 
  fire on all taxis in the city of Samawa because it was believed Iraqi forces 
  were using them for transport &shy; comes as US support for the war in Iraq 
  slumps to an all-time low. Polls suggest that 60 per cent now believe the 
  war was wrong. Mr Bush's personal approval ratings are also at a record low.

</p>
<p>
  British attitudes to the Iraq war have shown a nation divided over the 
  decision to invade but by last October the balance had tilted 46 per cent to 
  40 per cent towards an anti-war position, according to an ICM poll published 
  in The Guardian.
</p>
<p>
  Not since August 1968, the high point of the opposition to the war in 
  Vietnam, has there been a majority of people in America who believe that an 
  ongoing conflict was wrong. That historic turning point in public opinion 
  came seven months after North Vietnamese forces launched the devastating Tet 
  Offensive, as the divided Democratic Party Convention in Chicago was 
  choosing Hubert Humphrey rather than Eugene McCarthy as its presidential 
  candidate and 10,000 anti-war protesters fought pitched battles with police 
  in the streets.
</p>
<p>
  Now, in September 2005, campaigners say it has reached the point where 
  opposition to the war in Iraq has become a mainstream issue. "I 
  certainly think this should encourage people to go to Washington and 
  participate in the peace demos," said Kathy Kelly, a veteran campaigner 
  with the group Voices in the Wilderness.
</p>
<p>
  "The politicians are going to counter that these demonstrators just 
  come to Washington for a day and then go back to their normal lives. But I 
  think they are going to have to realize that when people are out in the 
  streets saying 'Bring them home now' they are saying the same thing as what 
  many of the voters think."
</p>

<p>
  She added: "My sense is that people are having a serious 
  disillusionment with any sense of competence with the leaders of this 
  country and that makes many people very afraid."
</p>
<p>
  Mr Bush's response to the falling public support has been a stubborn refusal 
  to accept any error and to vow the US will remain in Iraq and will not "
  abandon the mission". 
</p>
<p>
  He has described the peace demonstrators who want him to withdraw forces as 
  well-intentioned but wrong.
</p>
<p>
  Yesterday, US forces in Iraq announced two more of its troops had been 
  killed west of Baghdad. One was killed by a roadside bomb between the cities 
  of Fallujah and Ramadi, the other by small arms fire in Ramadi.
</p>
<p>

  In Baghdad, a suicide bomber riding on a small public bus set off explosives 
  in a bustling open-air bus terminal, killing at least five people and 
  wounding eight. Also in Baghdad, gunmen killed a member of the commission 
  charged with ensuring that former members of Saddam Hussein's Baathist 
  regime were banned from the Iraqi hierarchy.
</p>

<p>
  Earlier, authorities said a second member of the 323-member Supreme National 
  Commission for de-Baathification had also been killed but the committee's 
  head, Ali al-Lami, said the second member had been abducted on Wednesday by 
  insurgents and was freed on Thursday by the Iraqi army.
</p>
<p>
  The latest casualties add to a total of US deaths in Iraq that stands at 
  more than 1,900. No one knows precisely how many Iraqi civilians have been 
  killed as a result of the war but a report published last year in The Lancet 
  suggested that up to 100,000 may have lost their lives.
</p>
<p>
  Hart Viges' own journey into the chaos and violence of Iraq started on 11 
  September 2001. The day after he watched al- Qa'ida terrorists fly airliners 
  into targets in New York and Washington he quit his job as a waiter in 
  Seattle and signed up for the US Army. 
</p>
<p>
  Deployed to the Middle East in early 2003, he saw action in Baghdad and 
  Fallujah, among other hot spots.

</p>
<p>
  Despite his growing horror with what he was experiencing, it was only when 
  he watched Mel Gibson's film The Passion of the Christ, that he decided to 
  file for conscientious objector status. "I consider myself a Christian 
  and I thought Jesus wasn't talking smack," he told the 
  American-Statesman newspaper, in his current home of Austin, Texas.
</p>
<p>
  Mr Viges visited Washington this week as part of an anti-war protest 
  organised by Cindy Sheehan, the mother who camped outside Mr Bush's ranch at 
  Crawford, Texas, over the summer to protest against the war in which her son 
  was killed.
