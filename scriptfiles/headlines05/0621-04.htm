<p>A key Republican lawmaker declined
to back a plan by Senate Democrats to slow the growth of U.S.
greenhouse gas emissions, casting doubt on whether the Senate
can muster enough votes on Tuesday to approve a climate change
plan.</p>
<p>As part of its debate of a broad domestic energy supply
bill, the Senate is expected also to consider proposals that
would address U.S. industry's emissions of carbon dioxide, a
heat-trapping gas linked to global warming.</p>
<p>Pete Domenici of New Mexico, chairman of the Senate Energy
Committee, last week said he might co-sponsor Democrat Jeff
Bingaman's plan to slow the growth of U.S. carbon emissions
with an emissions trading program beginning in 2010.</p>
<p>But late Monday night, Domenici announced in a brief
statement that he would not support the measure.</p>
<p>"This is just too tough to do quickly," Domenici said,
adding that he believes some action on climate change is
needed.</p>
<p>"I expect we will have a series of hearings and I hope we
can reach some sort of accommodation on all aspects of a
climate proposal. But that will take time," he said.</p>
<p>Domenici refused to break ranks with the White House on
climate change, after meeting with Vice President Dick Cheney
last week and fellow Republican lawmakers on Monday.</p>
<p>The Bush administration opposes any form of carbon dioxide
limits, preferring voluntary measures by utilities,
manufacturing plants and other emitters. President Bush in 2001
pulled the United States out of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, citing
its economic cost.</p>

<p>The plan proposed by Bingaman is based on recommendations
from a bipartisan energy study.</p>
<p>The approach aims to slow the growth of U.S. greenhouse gas
emissions by linking them to U.S. economic growth. It would
create a trading program with a pool of emissions permits that
would shrink about 2.4 percent annually beginning in 2010.</p>
<p>Domenici's support could have changed the calculus for
Senate action on climate change. The chamber is expected to
debate several climate change amendments this week, including
one calling for strict, mandatory limits on emissions.</p>
<p>Before taking up Bingaman's plan, the Senate will consider
a stricter option from Republican John McCain and Democrat
Joseph Lieberman that would require an outright cut in U.S.
carbon dioxide output to 2000 levels by 2010.</p>
<p>The McCain-Lieberman plan, which was defeated in the Senate
nearly two years ago with a 55-43 vote, would also create a
program for companies to buy and sell carbon emission
allowances.</p>
<p>The Senate debate on climate change proposals comes as the
Bush administration prepares to attend a Group of Eight meeting
early next month. British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who will
lead the meeting, said he wants to launch an action plan for
rich nations to fight global warming.</p>
<p>The Senate is on track to approve the broad energy package
this week with some &#36;14 billion in tax incentives over ten
years to encourage more domestic production of oil, natural
gas, coal, nuclear and alternative energy.</p>
<p>The U.S. House earlier this year approved its version of an
energy bill, which does not include any provisions to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions.
