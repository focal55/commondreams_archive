<p> Community activists cheered when the federal government began offering licenses for low-power radio stations five years ago. But now, some are wondering what happened to what they envisioned as an end-around to big media domination of the airwaves.

<P>After years of fighting legal battles for left-leaning "pirate" broadcasters, advocates pictured a sea of under-100-watt stations where low- income folks and communities of color -- "new voices," in government parlance -- could grab a tiny slice of a radio dial now dominated by conglomerates.

<P>Their idea was that these micro stations would be a programming rainbow, where Hawaiian music would lead into debates over the fate of the local landfill -- a type of community-focused format rarely heard on big-city stations.

<P>But something unexpected happened on the way to the dial diversity the left thought it was getting: Low-power frequencies have been gobbled up by Christian organizations. Church groups make up roughly half the 344 applicants licensed by the Federal Communications Commission for stations with a broadcasting range of about five miles.

<P>And with precious few vacant frequencies available in big cities, most of the low-power stations have popped up in far-flung suburbs and small towns -- far from the greatest concentration of communities of color. No licenses have been granted in San Francisco, Oakland or San Jose, for example, but frequencies have been carved out in Davis, Modesto and the tiny El Dorado County town of Georgetown.

<P>"The churches have been much more organized in applying for and getting these stations," said Kai Aiyetoro, chief financial officer with the National Federation of Community Broadcasters in Oakland. "There's no system of state organizations out there encouraging nonprofits and community groups to get their licenses. But the churches, if they hear about a frequency opening up, they spread the word to each other.

<P>"Just think if there were a low-power FM station in East Oakland," Aiyetoro said. "They could be spreading a positive message in the community, one that could lead to less violence. Instead, all they're getting in that neighborhood is booty-call music (on commercial stations)."

<P>A bill introduced this month by Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona and Democratic Sens. Maria Cantwell of Washington and Patrick Leahy of Vermont could make it easier for low-power stations to crack the big-city market by requiring less frequency space on the dial between stations.

<P>Strange bedfellows

<P>The bill is backed by Federal Communications Commission Chairman Michael Powell, but not by the National Association of Broadcasters and National Public Radio -- which maintain that lower-power stations cause interference on bigger stations' frequencies, despite a federally commissioned study that found little evidence of it.

<P>"You've heard of the phrase 'strange bedfellows'? Well that's what we have here,' " said John Broomall of Christian Community Broadcasters, an Atlanta consulting firm, referring to the coalition of religious broadcasters, media diversification advocates and liberal community groups that support the bill.

<P>"The difference isn't between left and right," Broomall said. "It's between low-power and full-power."

<P>Unlike their allies on the left, however, church broadcasters have been largely thriving under the existing rules. Advocates say many Christian- oriented stations have navigated the approval process because they've had a strong support group.

<P>And there's a desire for their brand of programming. A 2002 survey of 1, 000 adults nationwide by the Barna Group -- which partners with Christian groups to promote moral and spiritual transformation in the United States -- found that 52 percent had listened to Christian radio in the previous month.

<P>"There's a lot of people out there who want to turn on the radio in their car with their kids and not listen to it and go, 'Eeeek,' " said James Price, vice president of Sterling Communications, a Georgia consulting firm that escorted 60 Christian stations through the low-power process, charging $1,850 for the guidance. Thirty of those stations are on the air.

<P>"God has put this (low-power) dream in a lot of people's hearts," Price said.

<P>Among them is Scott Burger, assistant pastor of Calvary Chapel in the Humboldt County town of Arcata, who said the church has seen "a slight increase" in its 200-member congregation since it started broadcasting services on its KCHP low-power station a year ago.

<P>To supplement local programming, Burger -- also the station's general manager -- downloads prepackaged religious programming from the Internet.

<P>This month, the Calvary Chapel Radio Ministry of Costa Mesa in Orange County hosted 170 mostly Christian low-power broadcasters, offering them operational tips as well as up to "16 hours per day, seven days a week" of programming beamed in via satellite, according to its Web site. Low-power stations are required by the federal government to broadcast eight hours of locally originated programming a day.

<P>Church network

<P>The loosely affiliated network of Calvary Churches has been one of the leaders in rallying church groups to get low-power licenses. Church officials say 140 Calvary Chapels nationwide either have or are pursuing low-power licenses. Many rely on small donations from their congregations to support low- power stations, which typically cost $15,000 to $20,000 to get started. In 2003, it cost an average of $2.5 million to acquire a commercial station, according to McCain's bill.

<P>"Say a church group has 800 members, so they not only have the financial base to build a station, but they have the listeners, too," said Jeff Dorman, general manager of KWVE-FM, a full-power Christian teaching and music commercial station owned by Calvary Chapel of Costa Mesa.

<P>"Whether it be television or multimedia or radio, Christians have always been looking for new opportunities to spread the word of God," Dorman said. "And they've jumped on this one."

<P>But others worry that some church groups have worked a bit too closely together. Last year, spurred largely by the objections of a Berkeley attorney, Alan Korn, the Federal Communications Commission dismissed low-power applications from two dozen Calvary Church-related groups from around the country. Many are appealing the decision.

<P>The reason, the commission said, was that "there is nothing in their statements of educational purpose to distinguish these applicants from the other Calvary Chapel applicants who filed identical applications for licenses."

<P>Korn said that "the danger is that when you have one organization basically using a network of low-power stations to broadcast the same material, you run the risk of getting the same sort of consolidation that's happening with the (full-power) stations. And then you get the same sort of crap coming out of the radio."

<P>But Dorman doesn't think that will be a problem, judging by the reaction to a church offer of satellite-beamed programming at a recent conference in Murrieta Hot Springs (Riverside County): "The funny thing is, when we offered this programming, the stations said they didn't want it. Most of them really want to do their own shows."

<P>One nonchurch outfit that badly wants to do its own shows on a low-power station is San Francisco Liberation Radio. For 10 years, it broadcast on a pirate basis over a 100-watt station, airing programs on topics ranging from Cantonese music to tenants' rights.

<P>Community activists said it was just what they were looking for from a low-power station. In August 2003, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors lauded it for its diverse programming and urged local and federal officials not to interfere with it.

<P>Equipment confiscated

<P>But two months later, federal agents raided the station's Castro neighborhood studio and confiscated its equipment. In March, lawyers representing the station will appear at a federal court hearing challenging the action.

<P>But even if San Francisco Liberation Radio gets its equipment back, it will face a difficult time returning to the airwaves. The low-power federal regulations ban pirates -- defined as broadcasters who didn't heed federal warnings to not broadcast without a license -- from ever owning stations. Liberation Radio now streams over the Internet.

<P>"It's ironic," said the station's San Francisco attorney, Mark Vermeulen. Even if the current Liberation Radio broadcasters don't get a license, Vermeulen hopes that the case will establish "a procedure that the government will have to go through if they try to shut down low-power stations in the future."

<P>The low-power dream lives on at KFOK, a 2-year-old station in the middle of El Dorado County. It's the picture of the community-based radio that advocates envisioned.

<P>Beaming from Georgetown, about an hour and a half east of Sacramento, the station airs "Democracy Now," a left-leaning public affairs show; Calvary Chapel music on Sundays; a heavy-metal show; and a program called "Hillbilly Humor with Shaun."

<P>It's not that the station's 50 underwriters who foot the station's $10, 000 yearly budget always agree with everything that goes out on the air.

<P>"But what I tell people," said Bruce Hayden, the station's co-founder and one of the underwriters, "is that you don't have to agree with everything that's on there. Most of the people on our station felt that their voice wasn't being heard out there. And that's why they're here."
