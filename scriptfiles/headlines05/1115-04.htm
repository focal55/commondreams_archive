<p> British troops have come under attack in Kabul and Nato forces were targeted in two co-ordinated suicide car bombings in which at least four people died. 
<p>

  The attacks took place as ministers revealed that units are preparing to 
  extend Britain's role in Afghanistan when it takes command of the 
  international peacekeeping operation next year.
</p>
<p>
  John Reid, the Secretary of State for Defence, told Parliament that Britain 
  faced a "prolonged" involvement in the country. But MPs warned 
  last night that British troops faced being mired in a long-term military 
  commitment to a country in the grip of a growing insurgency.
</p>
<p>
  They insisted yesterday's extension of Britain's role in Afghanistan, four 
  years after troops first arrived, also reflected the size of the task facing 
  coalition forces in Iraq.
</p>
<p>
  Fears for Afghanistan's future emerged in the wake of suggestions, by the 
  British and Iraqi governments, that British troops could begin pulling out 
  of Iraq by the end of next year. For British troops, however, yesterday's 
  violence in Kabul was a taste of what they will face next year when they 
  deploy to the turbulent province of Helmand as part of a move by Nato to 
  take over security in the Taliban heartlands.
</p>
<p>
  At least four people were killed in the attacks, including one German 
  soldier and an Afghan child, but the implications of the attacks were far 
  wider. The insurgency that has been worsening while the world's attention 
  has been focused on Iraq has now reached Kabul.

</p>
<p>
  Mr Reid said British troops had to open fire to defend their camp in Kabul 
  against "unauthorised entry". Few further details emerged, but Mr 
  Reid said British troops were not targeted in the car bombings.
</p>
<p>
  A German soldier died when the Nato vehicle he was travelling in was rammed 
  by a Toyota Corolla stuffed with explosives just after 3pm local time. Two 
  German soldiers and three Afghan civilians were wounded.
</p>
<p>
  An hour later, another Nato vehicle was rammed in a near-identical attack on 
  the same road. Three Afghan civilians were killed, including a young boy, 
  and two Greek soldiers were wounded. The Taliban claimed responsibility for 
  the attacks.
</p>
<p>
   "We have plans for more of the same," Mullah Dadullah, a 
  top-ranking Taliban commander, said by satellite phone from an undisclosed 
  location.

</p>
<p>
  The insurgency in Afghanistan has been largely confined to the Pashtun area 
  in the south and east. Until now, British troops have operated in Kabul and 
  the north, where international forces have been largely welcomed by Afghans 
  who suffered persecution under Taliban rule.
</p>
<p>
  But in the south there is widespread support for the insurgency and 
  opposition to any Western presence in Afghanistan. Helmand in particular is 
  notorious even among Afghans for the ferocity of its tribesmen. British 
  troops are moving into the province under a plan for the Nato-led 
  International Security Assistance Force (Isaf) to take over security in the 
  area. And it was no coincidence that yesterday's attacks specifically 
  targeted Isaf troops in Kabul.
</p>
<p>
  The message from the Taliban was clear: this is what is waiting for Isaf in 
  the south. But the message was also that the Taliban can now strike in 
  Kabul, which until now has been an oasis of stability largely unaffected by 
  the insurgency.
</p>
<p>
  Kabul is home to 3,000 foreigners, most working for NGOs, who live in an 
  city that often seems utterly disconnected from the rest of the country. 
  Replete with bars and expensive restaurants that sell alcohol to foreigners, 
  but not Afghans, Kabul even boasts two designer boutiques for women's 
  clothes. Yesterday another Afghanistan came crashing up against that world. 
  Both car bombings came on the Jalalabad Road, which has long been the scene 
  of the most serious attacks in Kabul.
</p>

<p>
  There was a suicide bombing on that road in September, and there have been 
  countless improvised bombs hidden along it - partly it is because there are 
  several Western and Afghan military bases, and the UN's headquarters, on it. 
  The road runs through a Pashtun suburb of Kabul where the Pashtun Taliban 
  can operate freely. The fact that so senior a commander has claimed 
  responsibility for the attacks is a sure sign the Taliban are stepping up 
  their actions. Known as Dadullah-I-Leng, or Dadullah the Lame, he is known 
  for his part in massacres of Hazara Shias, which have been described as 
  attempted genocide.
</p>
<p>
  One of the main failures of the Taliban's insurgency has been its inability 
  to attract support among other ethnic communities.
