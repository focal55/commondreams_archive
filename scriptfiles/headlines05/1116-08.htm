The Pentagon has admitted US forces used white phosphorus as &quot;an 
  incendiary weapon&quot; during the assault last year on Fallujah.
<p>
  A Pentagon spokesman's comments last night appeared to contradict the US 
  ambassador to London who said that American forces did not use white 
  phosphorus as a weapon.

        <!--/endimage/--> Pentagon spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Barry Venable said that white 
  phosphorus - which is normally used to lay smokescreens - was not covered by 
  international conventions on chemical weapons.
</p>
<p>
  But Professor Paul Rodgers of the University of Bradford department of peace 
  studies said it probably would fall into the category of chemical weapons if 
  it was used directly against people.
</p>
<p>
  A recent documentary by the Italian state broadcaster, RAI, claimed that 
  Iraqi civilians, including women and children, had died of burns caused by 
  white phosphorus during the assault on Fallujah.
</p>
<p>
  The report has been strenuously denied by the US, however Col Venable 
  disclosed that it had been used to dislodge enemy fighters from entrenched 
  positions in the city.
</p>

<p>
   "White phosphorus is a conventional munition. It is not a chemical 
  weapon. They are not outlawed or illegal," he said on the BBC Radio 4 
  PM programme.
</p>
<p>
   "We use them primarily as obscurants, for smokescreens or target 
  marking in some cases. However it is an incendiary weapon and may be used 
  against enemy combatants."
</p>
<p>
  Asked directly if it was used as an offensive weapon during the siege of 
  Fallujah, he replied: "Yes, it was used as an incendiary weapon against 
  enemy combatants".
</p>
<p>
  He added: "When you have enemy forces that are in covered positions 
  that your high explosive artillery rounds are not having an impact on and 
  you wish to get them out of those positions, one technique is to fire a 
  white phosphorus round into the position because the combined effects of the 
  fire and smoke - and in some case the terror brought about the explosion on 
  the ground - will drive them out of the holes so that you can kill them with 
  high explosives," he said.
</p>
<p>

  However in a letter yesterday to The Independent, the US ambassador to 
  London, Robert Tuttle, denied that white phosphorus was deployed as a weapon.
</p>
<p>
   "US forces participating in Operation Iraqi Freedom continue to use 
  appropriate lawful conventional weapons against legitimate targets," he 
  said.
</p>
<p>
   "US forces do not use napalm or white phosphorus as weapons."
</p>
<p>
  Col Venable said that a similar denial on the US State Department's website 
  had been entered more than a year ago and was based on "poor information
  ".
</p>
<p>
  Prof Rodgers said white phosphorus would be considered as a chemical weapon 
  under international conventions if it was "deliberately aimed at people 
  to have a chemical effect".

</p>
<p>
  He told PM: "It is not counted under the chemical weapons convention in 
  its normal use but, although it is a matter of legal niceties, it probably 
  does fall into the category of chemical weapons if it is used for this kind 
  of purpose directly against people."
</p>
<p>
  Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman Sir Menzies Campbell said later: "
A vital part of the effort in Iraq is to win the battle for hearts and minds.
</p>
<p>
   "The use of this weapon may technically have been legal, but its 
  effects are such that it will hand a propaganda victory to the insurgency.
</p>
<p>
   "The denial of use followed by the admission will simply convince the 
  doubters that there was something to hide."
</p>

<p>
  The Shadow Foreign Secretary Liam Fox said on today's BBC Radio 4 Today 
  programme: "Clearly there needs to be more openness coming from the Pentagon 
  but the claims at the moment are just claims.
</p>
<p>
  "And I think that, although white phosphorus is a brutal weapon, we need to 
  remember that we were talking about some pretty brutal insurgents. These 
  were the people who were hacking off hostages' heads with knives."
