The murder of Ryan Manelick, 31, came two months after another Ultra Services employee, Kirk von Ackermann, 37, disappeared while driving alone in northern Iraq in 2003, Time magazine said.
 <p>
 

The Army launched a fraud investigation in connection with the mysterious disappearance and subsequent killing, Time said, citing Defense Department officials.
 <p>
 

Manelick and an Iraqi traveling with him by car were shot and killed by gunmen in a sport-utility vehicle.
 <p>

 

Manelick's father claims that his son had told him in an e-mail that he suspected colleagues at Ultra Services were involved in fraudulent activities with US Army contracting officers, according to Time.
 
<p>
 

The Winters, California-based company's website says it has done 14 million dollars worth of business with the Pentagon, Time said.
 <p>
 

The Army's Criminal Investigation Command told Time that Manelick met with its investigators in Iraq, but it refused to say what was discussed.
 <p>
 

But an Army investigator, in an e-mail obtained by the magazine, said Manelick visited her days before he was killed and said he was "fearful for his life."
 <p>
 

On October 9, 2003, two months before Manelick's killing, Von Ackermann disappeared after a flat tired forced him to pull off the road.
 <p>
 

Von Ackermann called Ultra Services' Kirkuk office for help, but a colleague who arrived at the scene did not find him. No blood stains nor bullet holes were in the vehicle, but inside were his computer, satellite phone and a briefcase filled with 40,000 dollars in cash.
 <p>

 

Time said Ultra Services executives could not be reached for comment.
 <p>
 

The investigative command turned the cases over to its Major Procurement Fraud Unit because it suspects that the disappearance and murder were not acts of random violence, the magazine said.
