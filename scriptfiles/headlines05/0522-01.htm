<p> KABUL  - A report of U.S. military abuse of  detainees in Afghanistan is deeply disturbing and those  involved should be punished, the United Nations said on Sunday.
<p> 
			
			The abuse, including details of the deaths of two inmates  at an Afghan detention center, took place in 2002 and emerged  from a nearly 2,000-page file of U.S. Army investigators, The  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/20/international/asia/20abuse.html" target="_new">New York Times said on Friday</a>.
<p> 
			
			Afghan President Hamid Karzai, speaking before leaving on a  U.S. trip, said on Saturday he was shocked and was demanding  action against the culprits as well as custody of Afghan  prisoners and supervision of U.S. military searches.
<p> 
			
			Jean Arnault, special representative of the U.N.  secretary-general in Afghanistan, said the abuse reported in  the New York Times was unacceptable and an affront to  everything the international community stood for.
<p> 
			
			"The gravity of these abuses calls for the punishment of  all those involved in such inexcusable crimes, as demanded by  President Karzai," Arnault said in a statement.
<p> 
			
			Arnault said steps taken since 2002 to eradicate  mistreatment and improve conditions should be made public.  Complaints that continue to be made of arbitrary arrest and  detention without charge should be fully addressed, he said.
<p> 
			
			The United States commands a foreign force in Afghanistan  of about 18,300, most of them American, fighting Taliban  insurgents and hunting militant leaders, including Osama bin  Laden.
<p> 
			
			The United States is holding more than 500 prisoners from  its war on terrorism at the Guantanamo Bay naval base on Cuba.  Many of them were detained in Afghanistan after the Taliban  overthrow in late 2001.
<p> 
			
			U.S. forces are also believed to be holding several hundred  Afghans in Afghanistan.
<p> 
			
			"YOUNG, POORLY TRAINED SOLDIERS"
<p> 
			
			The New York Times said U.S. army report centers on the  death of a 22-year-old taxi driver known only as Dilawar and  that of another detainee, Habibullah, who died at the U.S. base  at Bagram, north of Kabul, in December 2002.
<p> 
			
			According to the report, Dilawar was chained by his wrists  to the top of his cell for several days before he died and his  legs had been pummeled by guards.
<p> 
			
			"The file depicts young, poorly trained soldiers in  repeated incidents of abuse. The harsh treatment, which has  resulted in criminal charges against seven soldiers, went well  beyond the two deaths," the newspaper said.
<p> 
			
			In sworn statements to army investigators, soldiers  described mistreatment ranging from a female interrogator  stepping on a detainee's neck and kicking another in the  genitals to a shackled prisoner being made to kiss the boots of  interrogators, according to the newspaper.
<p> 
			
			U.S. officials have characterized incidents of prisoner  abuse at Bagram in 2002 as isolated problems that were  thoroughly investigated, the newspaper said.
<p> 
			
			Two army interrogators have been reprimanded and seven  soldiers have been charged, it said.
