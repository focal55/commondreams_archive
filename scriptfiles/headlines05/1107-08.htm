<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p>NORTHFIELD, Minnesota - To hear the Rev. Jesse Jackson tell it, from the miseries of the still-ravaged Gulf Coast to the increasingly bloody battlefronts in Iraq, the Bush administration has shown the rest of the world a toxic mix of arrogance, ineptitude and corruption.</p>
<p>"After [Hurricane] Katrina, the president watched people floating face down in the water or stranded on rooftops while the whole world watched," Jackson said Sunday night. "The whole world watched that, too, and it's going to define America for a long time."</p>

<p>In Iraq, "we have fought ourselves into isolation," he said. "Any nations that supported us have slowly stepped away. It's our war. Lives, money and honor are being lost in that war."</p>
<p>Jackson spoke to an overflow crowd of 1,200, mostly students, at St. Olaf College's Boe Memorial Chapel, who accorded him a raucous reception.</p>
<p>Such biting criticisms of the administration weren't surprising, following a pattern of similar comments Jackson has been making for months.</p>
<p>But the messenger seemed less familiar, changed from the fiery stump speaker who has been a mainstay of presidential campaigns (including two of his own) and civil rights rallies for nearly four decades. In his place was a somewhat quieter, graying, professorial speaker of 64 who laid out his indictment in measured cadences. Mostly gone, too, were Jackson's trademark aphorisms ("I AM somebody"), with only a couple tossed in, such as, "in New Orleans, relocation has become dislocation."</p>
<p><b>Fueled by Hurricane Katrina</b></p>
<p>Jackson began hammering the administration's performance in the wake of Hurricane Katrina almost immediately after the storm hit.</p>
<p>He compared the fact that he has visited New Orleans 10 times since then, with what he called Bush's belated response: "They responded two days after the tsunami hit last year and he was at ground zero two days after Sept. 11. It took five days for anything to reach New Orleans." </p>
<p>The nation's deep divides on the basis of race, class and poverty "were all demonstrated by Katrina," Jackson said. "Those who could get away, got away. Poor, black residents were immobilized to an amazing degree."</p>
<p>He was just as critical of the cleanup and reconstruction underway the past two months, saying the administration "has suspended civil rights, the Davis-Bacon Act, environmental laws and affirmative action. They've given no-bid contracts to Halliburton and Bechtel instead of offering low-bid contracts to indigenous businesses. ... The reconstruction has been totally corrupted." </p>

<p>In the long term politically, should a substantial number of black Louisiana residents relocate from the region, it will transform the region, making it more hospitable to Republican candidates. "Their agenda is to change the character of the state's politics," he said.</p>
<p>On the war in Iraq, he said, "it has become more and more apparent this was a war of choice and a war that was not necessary. ... This wasn't World War II, where it was necessary to fight Nazis."</p>
<p>The administration's unilateralism "has made us less trusting of the world, as we're less and less seen as the land of the free, the home of the brave and a source of great generosity," Jackson said.</p>
<p>Referring to the just-concluded Western Hemisphere economic summit, he said the "two-thirds of our neighbors, who are Spanish and poor, no longer trust us."</p>
<p>Doubts about the Iraq war also have eroded military morale, Jackson said.</p>
<p>"Our soldiers were sent there, giving their nation blind loyalty and the benefit of the doubt," he said. "Now they're beginning to doubt. The military is cracking."</p>
<p><b>His bread-and-butter issue</b></p>
<p>Also, he said, the cost of the war has undercut the nation's ability to confront its intractable poverty, long one of Jackson's bread-and-butter issues.</p>
<p>"It has caused job cuts and benefit cuts while they subsidize the rich in every way they possibly can," he said. "The number of poor people continues to grow and the poor are not just black and brown.</p>

<p>"They're white, female and young and they're working every day. And it was the working poor who had been Dr. King's last mission."</p>
<p>Given Bush's record, as laid out by Jackson, he said it should come as no surprise that the president's popularity has plummeted.</p>
<p>"People see no returns of value from the war, feeling we're less secure, not more," he said. "America's image in the world has become embarrassing. All of that comes together."</p>
