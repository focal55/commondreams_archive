The United Nations says it has learned of serious allegations that the US is secretly detaining terrorism suspects, notably on American military ships.

<p>The special rapporteur on torture, Manfred Nowak, said the claims were rumours at this stage, but urged the US to co-operate with an investigation.

<p>He said the UN wants lists of the places of detention and those held.

<p>The comments come five days after the UN accused the US of stalling on their requests to visit Guantanamo Bay.

<p>Investigators have been asking to visit the jail in Cuba to carry out checks into allegations of human rights abuse.

<p>The UN said for over a year there had been no response to its requests, and it would begin an inquiry into alleged abuses with or without US co-operation.

<p>Washington had yet to grant their request, Mr Nowak said.

<p>He told the BBC there were a number of allegations from reliable sources that the US was holding terrorist suspects in secret places of detention, including vessels abroad.

<p>He said that according to the reports, the ships were believed to be in the Indian Ocean.

<p>Mr Nowak said the charges of secret detention camps were very serious, amounting to enforced disappearances. <p align="center">&copy; 2005 BBC News</p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable --></font></td></tr>
