<P>It took $3-a-gallon gasoline, the promise of record home heating bills 
this winter and the White House rolling out a conservation campaign featuring a 
cartoon pig to give environmentalists something they've been craving for years: 

<P>A chance to start a national conversation about America's energy 
problems.

        <!--/endimage/--> The problem for the green movement is that signs of public willingness to 
listen to environmentalists' message haven't translated into political changes 
in Washington, D.C.  
<P>"There is no doubt this is a moment," said David Willet, national 
spokesman for the Sierra Club. "This is definitely a time when we'd like to 
push some of the issues we've been talking about for a long time. 
<P>"But we're still playing a lot of defense here (in Washington)." 
<P>Playing defense is especially frustrating now for environmentalists. They 
feel that the energy crunch and images of the post-Katrina shambles along the 
Gulf Coast give them kitchen-table talking points about issues that long have 
sounded to red-state Americans like carping from wonky Chicken Littles: climate 
change, wetlands destruction, overdependence on petroleum and inappropriate 
coastal development. 
<P>Some environmentalists did take heart from the fact that an energy bill 
they had opposed as overly friendly to industry cleared the House last week 
only after GOP leaders twisted the arms of recalcitrant Republicans. 
<P>"It only passed by two votes," Willet said. "There were obviously a lot of 
people that are feeling differently about what the right direction is for 
America's energy future." 
<P>The challenge for environmentalists, though, is that Republicans and their 
supporters see the same cultural factors as a "moment" as well. And they have a 
different set of solutions  --  and the votes to implement them.  
<P>"Some people think the government works better than the market, as if 
Washington should simply write a law and shove every driver into a car that 
gets 50 miles per gallon whether they like it or not," said Lisa Miller, a 
spokeswoman for the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. "This is the 
we-know-what's-good-for-you-so-take-your-medicine-and-shut-up policy, and it 
doesn't work." 

<P>Given Republican control of the Congress and the White House, change is 
unlikely to happen soon in Washington, said Kevin Curtis, a senior vice 
president of the National Environmental Trust.  
<P>"We (Democrats) still don't have the votes," Curtis said. "It's not the 
fault of the environmental movement." 
<P align="left">But El Cerrito resident Michael Shellenberger thinks it is. He shocked the 
green movement last year with the critique he co-wrote with Oakland resident 
Ted Nordhaus, titled "<i><a href="http://www.grist.org/news/maindish/2005/01/13/doe-reprint/" target="_new">The Death of Environmentalism</a></i>," which argued that 
environmentalists were too focused on policy minutiae to capture people's 
imagination. 
<P>Instead of rehashing the same proposals doomed to fail in a Republican 
Congress, Shellenberger would rather see Democrats offer "something big and 
bold now"  --  even if it's a political loser in the short term. 
<P>"We  --  Democrats and environmentalists  --  just keep waiting for 
Republicans to fall down, but we don't offer any alternative solution," 
Shellenberger said. "We can't just play defense." 
<P>One idea that Nordhaus and Shellenberger helped create has been dubbed 
"health care for hybrids." It would involve the federal government picking up 
part of the cost of retirees' benefits for U.S. automakers, a financial burden 
that car companies say is preventing them from investing more in technology 
that could improve gas mileage.  
<P>Roughly $1,500 of the price of a new General Motors car is devoted to 
paying the company's health care costs, company spokesman Christopher Preuss 
said. An additional $3,000 goes to pension costs. (Toyota spokesman Xavier 
Dominicis said the Japanese carmaker's costs are substantially below that but 
declined to release specific figures.) 
<P>In exchange for the government's help, automakers would invest half the 
savings in gas-electric hybrid vehicles, and Congress would raise 
fuel-efficiency standards 3 percent a year for the next 15 years. Sen. Barack 
Obama, D-Ill., hopes to craft a bill on the plan by the end of the year, a 
spokesman said. The plan would be paid for by closing shelter loopholes for 
wealthy taxpayers. 
<P>Others think new ideas will come from outside Washington as Americans show 
signs that they're changing their energy-guzzling lifestyles.  
<P>In September, sales of full-size SUVs were down 51 percent from the year 
before, J.D. Power and Associates said. Ford Motor Co., which has been targeted 
by activist groups such as Jumpstart Ford of San Francisco for lagging behind 
Japanese carmakers in production of hybrid cars, said two weeks ago that it 
would be able to make 250,000 hybrids by 2010. Toyota said it wants to sell 
600,000 hybrids in the United States by then. 
<P>"What Ford is doing is a start," said Jennifer Krill, director of the Zero 
Emissions Campaign for the Rainforest Action Network, based in San Francisco. 
"Changes are going to have to come from corporate accountability campaigns, 
because they're not coming from the government." 
<P>But Preuss said environmental groups' efforts to link hybrid production to 
the overall health of the auto industry are "too simplistic." Hybrids make up 
roughly 1 percent of the market. 
<P>Cultural acceptance of environmental ideas could be gaining ground outside 
auto showrooms. Last week, the green movement got a boost from the White House 
when the Bush administration rolled out its Energy Hog mascot to launch its 
energy conservation campaign.  
<P>Some environmentalists could hardly believe a conservation plan was coming 
from the same administration whose energy policy is influenced by Vice 
President Dick Cheney, who said in 2001 that "conservation may be a sign of 
personal virtue, but it is not a sufficient basis all by itself for sound, 
comprehensive energy policy." 
<P>"All those issues we've been talking about for years are happening," said 
Bracken Hendricks, a senior fellow with the Center for American Progress, a 
liberal think tank.  "There's been this massive shift in the thinking about 
climate change. Whether people totally believe the science or not, it's no 
longer just an abstract issue." 
<P>Polls point to other signs that voters may be ready for new ideas about 
energy.  
<P>A recent post-Katrina analysis of the attitudes of 1,000 registered voters 
by Democratic pollster Stan Greenberg's firm found that 73 percent strongly 
supported higher fuel-efficiency standards, tax credits for hybrid cars and 
more efforts to develop renewable energy.  

<P>Translating such sentiments into action could be a challenge, however. 
While 79 percent of respondents last month to a Duke University survey of 800 
registered voters said they supported stronger environmental standards, only 22 
percent said green concerns had played a major role in determining whom they 
vote for. 
<P>Why: Eighty-seven percent of the Duke survey respondents believed it was 
"at least somewhat likely" that stronger national environmental standards will 
mean higher taxes, and 56 percent thought it would hurt the economy.  
<P>Even though the landscape might be changing, Greenberg believes 
environmentalists need to make a stronger appeal if they want to seize their 
green moment now.  
<P>"We are still working on the broad themes and narratives for this moment," 
the pollster said, "when the country is looking for a new direction."
