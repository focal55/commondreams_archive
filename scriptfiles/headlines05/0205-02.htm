<p>SAN FRANCISCO  - 

A <a href="http://www.gefreesonoma.org/" target="_new">measure to ban genetically
modified crops</a> in the heart of California's wine country has
qualified for a local ballot, officials said on Friday.

      Hard work by hundreds of volunteers put the <a href="http://www.gefreesonoma.org/">GE-Free Sonoma</a> initiative on the ballot with 45,387 signatures - the most in county history! <br>

The measure, which would impose a 10-year moratorium on
raising genetically engineered crops and livestock, is now
eligible for the Sonoma County ballot, said Gregory Conko,
director of food safety policy at the Competitive Enterprise
Institute.
 
<p>
 "It's an important symbolic victory for biotech's
skeptics," Conko said. "It certainly is something that should
make supporters of biotechnology, including myself, a little
bit nervous."
 
<p>

 Activists gathered 38,000 valid signatures -- more than needed to
qualify the measure -- which county supervisors now may enact
or put to voters in a special election as soon as May or June.
If the measure is approved, Sonoma would become the fourth
California county to ban raising genetically engineered foods.
 
<p>
 Genetically modified wine grapes are not grown in Sonoma
County but farmers are interested in using genetic engineering
to develop products to replace pesticides, said Ben Drake,
chairman of the California Association of Winegrape Growers.
 
<p>
 Without biotechology, Sonoma County's world famous wine
industry could be disadvantaged, said Henry Miller, a Hoover
Institution fellow and past director of the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration's office of biotechnology.
 
<p>
 "A ban could remove important technological tools for
combating significant economic problems such as Pierce's
disease," said Miller, author of the "The Frankenfood Myth: How
Protest and Politics Threaten the Biotech Revolution."
 
<p>
 The vine-killing disease is spread by the glassy-winged
sharpshooter insect. Several colonies of the pest were
discovered last spring in northern California.
 
<p>
 Activists claim the value of biotech crops is outweighed by
unknown health and environmental effects, a message they expect
will resonate in Sonoma County as in neighboring counties.
 
<p>

 "We talk about healthy farms and healthy organic foods for
our counties, that's our trademark," said Frank Egger, a
northern California environmental activist. "Stopping
genetically engineered crops is an enhancement and a protection
for today's farmers."
 
<p>
 Voters in neighboring Marin County, an affluent area north
of San Francisco, approved a ban in November. Last March voters
in Mendocino County north of Sonoma County <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines04/0303-02.htm">passed the nation's
first county-level ban</a> on genetically engineered crops.
 
<p>
 By contrast, voters in three other California counties
rejected similar measures in November, providing some relief to
companies and farmers who stand to benefit from the
fast-growing business of genetically modified foods.
