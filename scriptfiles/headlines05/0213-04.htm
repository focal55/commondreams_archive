<p> TEHRAN   - Iran warned the United States on Sunday  not to attack its nuclear facilities and said talks with Europe  might produce a deal to defuse the dispute over its alleged  covert ambitions to build atomic weapons.<p> 
			
			"They know our capabilities. We have clearly told the  Europeans to tell the Americans not to play with fire," Iranian  spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi told a news briefing in Tehran,  referring to Washington's refusal to rule out the use of force.<p> 
			
			Germany, however, warned that Iran could be referred to the  U.N. Security Council for its nuclear activities -- a  toughening of the European line that narrows a rift between  Europe and Washington which Iran has tried for months to  exploit.<p> 
			
			An American newspaper, meanwhile, reported that U.S.  military bases had been flying pilotless drone aircraft into  Iran to hunt for tell-tale traces of nuclear weapons programs.<p> 
			
			Asefi said Iran was determined to continue its nuclear  program which it says is solely for peaceful power generation.<p> 
			
			But Washington accuses Tehran of secretly pursuing atomic  weapons under cover of the civil program and says it does not  rule out any option to stop it acquiring them.<p> 
			
			France, Britain and Germany have been trying to persuade  Iran to scrap potentially weapons-related activities in return  for economic incentives.<p> 
			
			Iran has said repeatedly it will not give up plans to build  a heavy-water reactor, which can be used to make weapons-grade  material, in exchange for a light-water reactor offered by the  Europeans, which is less useful for a weapons program.<p> 
			
			"We will not under any circumstances replace our  heavy-water research reactor," Asefi said on Sunday. "We will  continue building our heavy-water reactor."<p> 
			
			But Asefi said there was a chance of a deal with the  Europeans, describing the latest round of Iran-EU talks, which  took place in Geneva on Friday, as "deeper and more  professional."<p> 
			
			TOUGHER LINE FROM GERMANY<p> 
			
			German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer however signaled a  tougher tone on Iran on Sunday.<p> 
			
			"If Iran were to behave unreasonably, against its own  interests, if it for example restarted (uranium) enrichment ...  then that would lead to the Security Council. That would be  then the right church, so to speak," he told a conference in  Munich.<p> 
			
			Iran suspended uranium enrichment in November as a goodwill  gesture in the run-up to the talks with EU nations, but said  the suspension would be last months rather than years. Enriched  uranium can be used in both weapons and power stations.<p> 
			
			Fischer did not say what action could ensue from a referral  to the Security Council, noting there was resistance to U.S.  calls for sanctions against Tehran. Diplomats say permanent,  veto-holding Council members Russia and China would oppose  them.<p> 
			
			Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said last week Tehran  must accept terms offered by the European Union or be referred  to the U.N. Security Council for possible sanctions.<p> 
			
			"I think if the United States were to engage positively --  and I'm aware of the difficulties of doing that -- that it  would substantially strengthen the EU drive," Fischer said.<p> 
			
			Mohammad Saeedi, director-general for international affairs  at Iran's Atomic Energy Organization, on Sunday said Iran's  parliament could force the government to resume uranium  enrichment.<p> 
			
			"Parliament is preparing a bill which will oblige the  organization to produce part of the fuel needed for our nuclear  reactors," Saeedi told the official IRNA news agency.<p> 
			
			The Russian-built 1,000-megawatt Bushehr nuclear reactor,  Iran's only nuclear power plant, will begin operating in late  2005 and reach full capacity in 2006.<p> 
			
			Hardline lawmakers, accusing President Mohammad Khatami's  government of making too many concessions in its nuclear talks  with European countries, last year obliged the government by  law to press ahead with a nuclear energy program.<p> 
			
			The Washington Post said the U.S. military had been flying  pilotless planes into Iran from bases in Iraq using radar,  photography and air filters to detect nuclear activity.<p> 
			
			Iran denies U.S. accusations it is building bombs under  cover of the civil program. But Asefi said it would never  permanently end its disputed nuclear activities.<p> 
			
			"Iran strongly insists on its views and we will not give up  our people's legitimate right," he declared.
