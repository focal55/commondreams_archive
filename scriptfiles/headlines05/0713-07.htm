WASHINGTON -- President Bush said Wednesday that he will not comment on Karl Rove's role in leaking the identity of a CIA operative while the investigation is ongoing. "This is a serious investigation," Bush said at the end of a meeting with his Cabinet, with Rove sitting just behind him. "I will be more than happy to comment on this matter once this investigation is complete. <p>"I also will not prejudge the investigation based on media reports," he said. <p>Bush's comments follow the disclosure that Rove talked about the officer in a July 11, 2003, conversation with Time magazine reporter Matthew Cooper. Coper wrote an article in 2003 in which he identified the officer as Valerie Plame, although Rove did not discuss her by name. <p>Bush said last year he would fire anyone found to have leaked Plame's identity. <p>Earlier, first lady Laura Bush, talking to reporters while traveling in Africa, called Rove "a very good friend" but said she did not want to talk about the investigation.
