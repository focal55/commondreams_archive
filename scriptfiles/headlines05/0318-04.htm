<p> The Rev. John Bennison scheduled a peace vigil Saturday in his small church in the Contra Costa town of Clayton because he hadn't heard of anything happening nearby to mark the second anniversary of the Iraq war.

<P>There isn't much to hear about. The antiwar movement's failure to take root in the suburbs is one reason the movement is struggling to redefine itself and gain political power 2 1/2 years after hundreds of thousands of demonstrators took to city streets in the run-up to the U.S. invasion.

<P>Antiwar leaders point to a number of reasons for the movement's lack of buzz outside politically "blue" communities. They get little support from the Democratic Party, which is far from unified on whether the United States should pull out of Iraq. Activists wish they had more online backing from MoveOn.org, the Internet hub that galvanized antiwar support in 2003 but has since taken up other issues.

<P>And the White House has blunted criticism by pointing to recent democratic uprisings in the Middle East as evidence that the underpinnings for the U.S. invasion were on the mark.

<P>Although peace events will be held in more than 700 cities and towns this weekend -- double the total for last year's first anniversary of the March 19, 2003, invasion -- experts and insiders doubt the movement can generate enough clout in Washington to demand a troop pullout without more long-term support in "red" communities such as Clayton, where Bennison presides over a flock of 350 at St. John's Episcopal Church.

<P>The town of 10,000 people, tucked behind Mount Diablo, boasts on its Web site that it has "the lowest crime rate in the Bay Area," and it has more registered Republicans than Democrats. While Contra Costa voters preferred Democrat John Kerry for president in November, a majority of Clayton voters backed President Bush.

<P>"We are in the suburbs, and we hold the war at arm's length here, as if we're living parallel lives," said Bennison, the rector at St. John's. "The position a lot of people here take is, even if we are wrong (for invading Iraq), now we're in it and we have to stay and fix it. It's almost like some people are saying if we stay, we can redeem that mistake."

<P>Clayton City Councilman Pete Laurence, a former Green Beret who served in Vietnam, won't be at Saturday's event. But he will be at a dinner Sunday in Concord sponsored by the Blue Star Moms, a support group of parents with children serving in the military.

<P>"That's the people we should be honoring," he said.

<P>During the Vietnam War, Laurence said, Clayton was a town of 600 residents, and three households had family members in the service. Today, there are 28 Clayton households with a family member in the military, "and we're going to make sure to support them," he said. "Clayton has a long, proud military history.

<P>"What's it mean to be 'antiwar' anyway? Everybody is antiwar," Laurence said. "People here are smart enough to know that you are antiwar by showing strength, not by running around protesting."

<P>Hoping to depoliticize Saturday's event, Bennison is billing it as a "community vigil for peace" instead of an antiwar protest.

<P>"There are people here who, because maybe they have a child who is of military age or because they're old enough to remember Vietnam, are ready to hear this message," he said.

<P>But the peace movement has found it challenging to broadcast its message into other Claytons. Last year's presidential campaign sucked energy from the peace effort when "a lot of people started working against Bush's re-election, " said AiMara Lin, national coordinator for the antiwar group Not in Our Name.

<P>"People so wanted 'Anybody but Bush' to win the election," Lin said. "And when that didn't happen, they just got burned out."

<P>Antiwar fund-raising suffered. Earlier this month, Not in Our Name sent an e-mail to supporters saying if it didn't raise $10,000 by the end of March, it would have to close its national office in New York. Lin said the group is struggling to find money to send into communities where potential antiwar support hasn't been tapped.

<P>"Our challenge is to take the someone who is grumbling about the way things are going and put that feeling into action," said Bill Hackwell, an organizer with International ANSWER (Act Now to Stop War & End Racism), which is coordinating what is expected to be one of the nation's largest antiwar demonstrations beginning at 11 a.m. Saturday in San Francisco's Dolores Park.

<P>It's clear there isn't a lot of support in Washington for the peace movement's major goal, a U.S. withdrawal from Iraq. A resolution demanding an end to the occupation introduced in January by Rep. Lynn Woolsey, D-Petaluma, still has only 28 co-sponsors -- none of them Republicans.

<P>Even MoveOn.org, the Berkeley-birthed online hub that fueled anti-Bush sentiment before the invasion and now boasts 3 million members, has moved on. Critics on the left complain that it is spending too much energy on such issues as Social Security reform and Bush's judicial appointments, and not enough on opposing the occupation.

<P>MoveOn.org Executive Director Eli Pariser <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views05/0310-35.htm">told</a> liberal-leaning media critic Norman Solomon recently that the group "is seeing a broad difference of opinion among our members on how quickly the U.S. should get out of Iraq. As a grassroots-directed organization, we won't be taking any opinion which a large portion of our members disagree with."

<P><a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views05/0310-35.htm">Solomon wrote</a> that "when a large progressive organization takes the easy way and makes peace with war, the abdication of responsibility creates a vacuum."

<P>Woolsey said, "It would be great if MoveOn.org would start that discussion (about ending the occupation)," because its support could influence her congressional colleagues. "They fear if they sign on (to her resolution) that they'll be branded as being against the troops."

<P>And now comes the possibility that Bush may have been onto something when he said that overthrowing Saddam Hussein would spur democratic uprisings across the Middle East. Iraq managed to pull off elections in January, and tentative steps toward change are happening in Lebanon and Egypt and among Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied territories.

<P>"(The movement) was on the verge of taking off again a couple of months ago around the inauguration, but then the Iraqi elections confused the picture, " said Stephen Zunes, a political science professor at the University of San Francisco and an expert on both social movements and Middle Eastern politics. "It is pretty moribund now."

<P>The argument that the administration got it right has faced little Democratic opposition, peace organizers say. Even one of the administration's sharpest critics, Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass, said this month that Bush deserves some credit. "It's a reflection the president has been involved," Kennedy said.

<P>The assertion frustrates peace activists, who point to more than 1,500 dead U.S. troops, tens of thousands of dead Iraqis and a $300 billion war tab.

<P>"The violence is continuing in Iraq, the suffering is continuing,'' said Amy Quinn, an analyst with the Institute for Policy Studies and steering committee member with United for Peace and Justice, the umbrella for 1,000 organizations that will be coordinating many of this weekend's peace events. "Until the occupation ends, I don't think anyone can claim any sort of victory. "

<P>The withdrawal issue is a tough one for many.

<P>"What's going on with MoveOn is what's going on with the country right now: People don't want to have a debate about the war," said Judith Ross, a San Francisco resident who recently helped start a chapter of Military Families Speak Out, an antiwar organization that will participate in Saturday's San Francisco rally. "But we need more debate in this country about our foreign policy."

<P>Starting that debate in new venues will be challenging, Zunes said. College campuses haven't been as active as they were during the Vietnam War, when a draft was in effect, and relatively few of the war's casualties have been from middle-class families.

<P>"People haven't been affected on a daily basis by the war," Ross said. "That's what we're up against."
