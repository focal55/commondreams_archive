It's a week when the need for tightening may become more apparent, as European negotiators try to salvage talks with Iran over suspending its nuclear program, which has bombmaking potential, and as North Korea considers its next move in the slow-motion international showdown over its weapons plans.

<P>For almost three weeks, the U.N. conference to review the <a href="http://www.state.gov/t/np/trty/16281.htm" target="_new">Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty</a>, a twice-a-decade event, was bogged down in bickering over the agenda. That backroom squabble left delegations little time for substantive negotiation before Friday's closing session.

<P>"It's an opportunity we cannot afford to squander," said disarmament advocate Daryl Kimball, of the Washington-based Arms Control Association. But at a gathering where agreement must be unanimous, the gaps between nations looked too wide to produce major arms-control initiatives.

<P>Under the 1970 treaty, 183 nations renounce nuclear arms forever, in exchange for a pledge by five states - the United States, Russia, Britain, France and China - to move toward nuclear disarmament. Nonweapon states, meanwhile, are guaranteed access to peaceful nuclear technology.

<P>North Korea announced its withdrawal from the treaty in 2003 and claims to have built nuclear bombs - all without penalty under the nonproliferation pact. Many here want the conference to endorse measures making it more difficult to exit the treaty and threatening sanctions against any who do.

<P>Many delegations also favor action to prevent future Irans. The Tehran government, saying it's pursuing civilian nuclear energy, obtained uranium-enrichment equipment that can produce both fuel for power plants and material for atom bombs. Washington contends the Iranians have weapons plans.

<P>Experts now propose limiting access to such fuel technology, despite the treaty guarantee, and possibly bringing all such production under international control.

<P>Consensus on these proposals is unlikely, however, without concessions by nuclear powers - particularly the United States and France - on the other treaty "pillar," disarmament.

<P>Those without the doomsday arms contend that those with them are moving too slowly toward eliminating the weapons, and point to Bush administration proposals for modernizing the U.S. nuclear arsenal. A congressional committee last week approved $29 million to study new nuclear warheads.

<P>Even allies, such as South Korea, question the American moves and want the conference to press the nuclear powers.

<P>"We expect deeper cuts and further engagements by nuclear-weapon states," Seoul's delegate In-kook Park told a conference committee on Thursday.

<P>But the Americans showed no sign of bending, insisting that Iran and North Korea must be the priority here.

<P>Linking action on such cases with greater progress toward disarmament is "dangerous in the extreme," because it tends to excuse nuclear proliferation, U.S. Ambassador Jackie Sanders told the same committee the following day.

<P>Arms-control advocates here saw opportunities slipping away.

<P>"The big fear is that if this review ends in a shambles - with no clear signal on one hand to North Korea and Iran, and on the other to nuclear-weapon states to honor treaty obligations - you will have confidence in the treaty eroding across the board," said Rebecca Johnson, editor of the journal Disarmament Diplomacy.

<P>More governments might then, for their own security, decide to pursue nuclear arms, the advocates say.
