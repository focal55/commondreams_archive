<p>Reporter Kevin Pina opened his family home to me last month in Port au Prince, Haiti when violence closed the orphanage where I usually stay to do human rights work. Tonight, Kevin sleeps in a jail cell like those I visited in Cap Haitian just weeks ago. He has become part of the story he risks his life daily to tell. 

<p>He was arrested September 9th while covering the ransacking of Father Jean-Juste's church, the humanitarian priest who routinely served 600 hungry and impoverished children the only meal they often got before he became yet another of the hundreds of political prisoners held by the government that came out of the US-sponsored Coup d'État of February 29, 2004 that overthrew democratically elected President Aristide.

<p>The first time I met Father Gerard Jean-Juste it was with Kevin Pina, inside St. Claire's Church in the Delmas district. This is the same church the masked police were tearing apart yesterday as Kevin went to cover the story. Now, Kevin Pina with fellow journalist and photographer, Jean Ristil are also held in custody for trying to get the truth out to us. They are appearing before a judge today. They deny any wrongdoing. Kevin Pina reports from his cell to human rights workers that the charges against him are changing even as fast as sympathetic phone calls come pouring in calling for their release. 

<p>Kevin Pina is known for his searing documentary work that often includes graphic portrayals of violence against the poor in Haiti. He has been persistent in speaking out on behalf of political prisoners, such as Father Jean-Juste. A native of the San Francisco Bay Area, Pina donated time to speak at Sacramento State University last year addressing the student body as a visiting scholar. He is an editor for the Black Commentator, founder of Haiti Information Project, an international news correspondent for Flashpoints at KPFA and a well-known documentary filmmaker. He just released some amazing footage from his new film exposé on Haiti. Now he believes his life is very much at risk. For the work he does, he stands behind bars...and stand he probably will. 

<p>When I visited the prison in August I had to turn away several times to control my emotions. The small cells sometime detain as many as 29-34 men. There is one twin bunk bed and a few mats in the limited floor space of each small cell. They take turns sleeping if they could keep the rats off themselves, while the others stand.

<p>Time out of the cell is limited to 10 minutes a day that includes the only opportunity to use the toilet, a few minutes to shower and then to carry back some water to the cell. One plate of rice with a few beans is the only food. Some men who had been there for months told me they had not yet seen a judge, been charged or sentenced. One tall wide-eyes young man was only 15 years old. Many were there as political prisoners. Now Kevin Pina joins them. His voice cried out for those same prisoners, now his voice joins their from prison.

<p>Last month Kevin and I climbed up on top of his home in Haiti because he wanted me to see the neighborhood where shots had rung out the night before as we slept. He spread his arm out to the city, "Poor, all you can see is the poor any where you look." he said, and shook his head heading back down the stairs. "We need to speak for the poor, not only in the country, but in each city and town. We need to speak for the poor here in Port au Prince." 

<p>Now, he speaks out from behind bars. Our concern is not only for Kevin Pina, Jean Ristil and Father Jean-Juste and the other political prisoners; our concern is also for Merlande, the wife Kevin leaves at home with their infant son. Paulo was born in Haiti while his father paced the floor of the hospital, now his father paces the floor of a prison cell. While we remember those who where killed by terrorists on 9/11, let us not forget those who are victims of political terrorism, especially victims of terrorism that is endorsed by our own government.

<p>Leisa Faulkner of Sacramento, California is co-founder of Coalition 4 Democracy In Haiti, serves on the National Spokes council board of Progressive Democrats of America, serves as a delegate to the National Writers Union, and will do another speaking tour this spring with Father Roy Bourgeois - founder of School of the Americas Watch.
