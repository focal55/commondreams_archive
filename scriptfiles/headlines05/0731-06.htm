<p>The motto of Justin Krebs and his friends pulls no punches: promoting democracy one pint at a time. It is a fine sentiment and, judging by the amount of beer put away in Rudy's Bar, democracy is in good shape.</p>
<p>Welcome to <a href="http://drinkingliberally.org/">Drinking Liberally</a>, a social club for Democrats which Krebs began in New York's Hell's Kitchen and has spread across the US. Faced with a George W Bush second term, a Republican-run Senate and Congress and a shift rightward in the balance of the Supreme Court, Democrats are reacting in the only way possible: pouring a very stiff drink.</p>
<p>It is not easy being a Democrat in Bush's America. It is not even easy being a Democrat in the Democratic party as it rushes to the right to woo Republican states. So every Thursday night Krebs and friends gather to seek solace.</p>
<p>Rudy's is a dark bar, stripped of comfort except for free hot dogs. It began as a speakeasy and, despite going legit in 1934, still feels slightly furtive. It is a bar you can hide in: a perfect spot for those most endangered of American political animals - the liberals - to gather in safety. In a country where liberal is practically a four-letter word, Rudy's offers refuge.</p>
<p>Krebs founded Drinking Liberally with a handful of friends in 2003. As America prepared to invade Iraq amid patriotism and false claims about WMD, he needed a sanctuary. 'It was insane,' he said. 'We needed a place to vent.'</p>
<p>For the first few months, sometimes only a handful of people turned up. The beer flowed, and so did the politics, but Rudy's was a lone outpost. Then one of the regulars moved to San Francisco and set up a chapter there. Drinking Liberally suddenly had a twin. Houston and Oakland quickly followed. Then, as the Republican convention was held in New York last summer, a phone call came from Boise, Idaho, a Bush heartland. A liberal wanted to start a chapter there. 'That was a breakthrough moment,' Krebs said. By the end of the convention, as Republicans slouched home, Drinking Liberally boasted 12 new chapters.</p>
<p>It didn't stop the defeat of John Kerry last November. Drinking to victory was no strategy. But Democrats drowning their sorrows worked better, and - at the last count - Drinking Liberally was present in 86 cities in 37 states. Its newest chapter is in Utah, the most Republican state and largely dry because normal bars are illegal. Little, though, can stop liberals quenching their thirst.</p>
<p>It's not all drinking. The clubs act as an informal network, and present an excuse to meet members of the opposite sex.</p>
<p>Away from the flirting, political contacts are made. Campaigns are talked about, job offers made and causes recruited for. Rudy's is now a regular stop on the campaign trail for aspiring politicians. They are forbidden to deliver speeches. Instead, they are handed a pitcher of beer and told to mingle.</p>
<p>The mood in Rudy's is a heady mix of despair and wild optimism that reflects the whole Democratic party. The merits and demerits of Hillary Clinton are debated. Karl Rove is eviscerated. The Iraq war is mourned. The prospects for victory in 2008 are celebrated even as a wary eye is cast on the unexpected 2004 defeat. 'But I thought we would win last time' is a common, usually wild-eyed, refrain. Its gets wilder-eyed as the evening draws on.</p>
<p>Its hard to think of a Republican equivalent. Praying Righteously as opposed to Drinking Liberally? An unattractive idea. Between handing around beer, Krebs spoke in awed terms about the power of the packed churches, of the tightly controlled Republican machine. His trendy T-shirt read 'This is a job for Superman' with a cartoon picture of the Man of Steel.</p>
<p>As the crowd stumbled from Rudy's back into Bush's America, it was clear who was having the most fun. It was even clearer, however, who is still running America.</p>
