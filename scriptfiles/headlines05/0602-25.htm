<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->TOKYO -- Human rights group Amnesty defended its  description of Guantanamo prison as a "gulag" Thursday and  urged the United States to allow independent investigations of  allegations of torture at its detention centers for terrorism  suspects.

<P>
A verbal feud between Amnesty International and Washington  has escalated since Amnesty last week compared the prison at  the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to the brutal  Soviet system of forced labor camps where millions of prisoners  died.
<P>
President Bush dismissed as "absurd" the Amnesty report,  which also said the United States was responsible for an  upsurge in global human rights violations, and Defense  Secretary Donald Rumsfeld called the description  "reprehensible."
<P>
"The administration's response has been that our report is  absurd, that our allegations have no basis, and our answer is  very simple: if that is so, open up these detention centers,  allow us and others to visit them," Amnesty International  Secretary General Irene Zubaida Khan told a news conference.
<P>
"Transparency is the best antidote to misinformation and  incorrect facts," said Khan, who is here to meet with Japanese  officials.
<P>
The United States holds about 520 men at Guantanamo, where  they are denied rights accorded under international law to  prisoners of war.
<P>
Many have been held without charge for more than three  years.
<P>
Khan rejected a suggestion that Amnesty's use of the  emotive term "gulag" had turned the debate into one over  semantics, and distracted attention from the situation in the  detention centers.
<P>
"What we wanted to do was to send a strong message that ...  this sort of network of detention centers that has been created  as part of this war on terrorism is actually undermining human  rights in a dramatic way which can only evoke some of the worst  features of human rights scandals of the past," she said.
<P>

"I don't think people have got off the hook yet."
<P>
Khan also said Japan's bid for a permanent seat on the U.N.  Security Council meant Tokyo should play a bigger role in the  global fight for human rights and improve its own record at  home.
<P>
Japan has stepped up its campaign for a permanent seat as  part of an effort to boost its global clout in security  affairs.
<P>
"Japan, by its strong bid to become a U.N. Security Council  member, is subjecting itself to greater international scrutiny  and that creates an imperative for change," she said.
<P>
Khan urged Japan to abolish the death penalty, improve the  treatment of prisoners, revise a strict stance toward refugees  -- only 15 refugees were accepted last year -- and do more to  prevent and protect victims of human trafficking.
