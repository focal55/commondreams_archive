<p>There is something truly remarkable about the Iraqi human
spirit. Cast around for a comparison of the numbers that might vote
next Sunday and Afghanistan is a good choice.</p>

There, more than 10.5 million signed up last year in a security
environment that made a mockery of the international observance of
fragile polls when only a handful of monitors was brave enough to
set foot in the country - but was not courageous enough to go
beyond the capital.</p>
<p>Iraq does not have the same voter registration process because
Saddam's old food-distribution register is being co-opted for this
fraught experiment.</p>
<p>It suggests that about 15million Iraqis are eligible to vote
amid a savage insurgency that makes Afghanistan look like the
proverbial Sunday school picnic - and with not a single
international observer daring to cross the border from Jordan.</p>
<p>But we know this - more than 3 million Iraqis have ventured from
their homes to go to electoral offices to correct data on Saddam's
old food list and another 1.2 million people have made new
registrations. Given the appalling security conditions on top of
the seething anger at the failure of the US-led effort to rebuild
this country, it would be remarkable if just these 4 million-plus
turned out.</p>
<p>But despite car bombings such as the ones that killed 26 people
on Wednesday - one of which was detonated near the Australian
embassy - the targeted assassination or abduction of candidates and
party officials, electoral and security workers, and the promise of
more intimidation by bombing on polling day, the chances are that
more will probably vote. But they are unlikely to vote in high
enough numbers to legitimize the process.</p>
<p>True to form, the Americans and the puppet regime they have
installed are cooking the books. Senior US officials and interim
Prime Minister Iyad Allawi repeatedly insist that all is well
because insecurity will restrict voting in "only four of Iraq's 18
provinces".</p>
<p>Four out of 18 is a little over 20 per cent and in the
circumstances might be acceptable. But the truth is very different.
Anywhere between 40 and 50 per cent of the population live in those
four provinces. It like insisting on the legitimacy of an
Australian federal election when an army of thousands of gunmen is
setting out to thwart the vote in NSW, Western Australia and
Tasmania.</p>

<p>The Sunni turnout is expected to be as low as 10 to 15 per cent
and because the US-crafted election calls for a national count,
rather than one based on votes for local candidates, the Sunni vote
will be swamped by the 60-plus per cent Shiite majority who are
being instructed that voting is a religious duty.</p>
<p>And wouldn't you know it - the Americans now claim that the
turnout doesn't count.</p>
<p>In the same way that the White House claims the failure to find
Saddam's weapons of mass destruction in no way detracts from the
decision to invade Iraq, the line at a background press briefing
last week was this: "I would really encourage people not to focus
on numbers, which in themselves don't have any meaning, but to look
on the outcome and to look at the government that will be the
product of these elections."</p>
<p>Such is the level of fear that Iraqis still have not been told
where they will be voting or who they will be voting for. The party
names for 111 "slates" of candidates are known, but the names of
19,000 individual candidates for seats in the National Assembly and
for provincial councils are being withheld to prevent them being
targeted by the insurgency.</p>
<p>But coupled with a weak media and the absence of any genuine
policy debate, the likely effect in a tribal and religious society
is the outcome the Americans didn't want - many voters will resort
to religious and tribal edicts, decrees and urgings on how they
should vote, thereby locking in Iraq's sectarian divide and perhaps
setting the scene for the full-blown civil war that some observers
now fear is inevitable.</p>
<p>Over tea and sweets to celebrate the start of the Muslim Eid
al-Adha commemoration in Amman on Wednesday evening, Naseer Al
Obeid, who is a professor of physics and a tribal sheik in the
Sunni city of Ramadi, told me with seeming regret: "It's back to
the old tribal system - this is what happens in the absence of
central government. This election will do nothing - things will
stay bad or get worse."</p>
<p>There is endless debate in the US and in the region about
Washington's Iraq options - press on with or postpone the poll;
stay the distance or exit as soon as it might be done half-decently
afterwards.</p>
<p>But it's too late for such hand-wringing. As a British official
explained to <i>Time</i> magazine this week: "If we delay by two,
three or six months, one month before [the new] election day we
would be in exactly the same position we are now - but with an
extra 1000 people dead and the violence more sophisticated." The
Iraq truth, which should have been considered before it was too
late, is that Washington has no options. The invasion of Iraq was
the start of a sorry, organic mess that now must run its own brutal
course.</p>
