        <!--/endimage/--> Ali Saleh Kahlah al-Marri, a citizen of Qatar, had been studying in Peoria, Illinois, when he was arrested in December 2001 and transferred to military custody in June 2003, according to the watchdog group Human Rights Watch (HRW).</p>
<p>Al-Marri, who also has challenged the legality of his detention, asked a federal district court in South Carolina to declare unconstitutional the most punitive aspects of his treatment at the Consolidated Naval Brig in North Charleston, South Carolina.</p>
<p>His complaint alleged that his jailers:</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Confined him round the clock in a small cell with an opaque window covered with plastic and prevented him from speaking to his wife or five children.<br>
</li>
<li>Forbade him newspapers, magazines, books other than the Koran, radio, television, and personal property.<br>
</li>
<li>Restricted his out-of-cell time to three showers and three short periods of solitary recreation per week--only to frequently deny him this. Al-Marri alleged he once went 60 days without being permitted to leave his cell at all. Indoors, his complaint alleged, he must wear leg irons and handcuffs even to shower. <br>
</li>
<li>Denied him basic hygiene products such as a toothbrush, toothpaste, soap, and toilet paper. HRW said that al-Marri complained that when not provided with toilet paper, he has had to use his hands to clean himself after defecating and it has taken more than an hour before soap was brought to him so that he could wash his hands.</li>
</ul> 
</p>
<p>He also claimed he was denied appropriate care for medical and mental health symptoms developed while in the brig.</p>
<p>HRW backed the father of five.</p>
<p>''It is bad enough that al-Marri has been held indefinitely without charges and incommunicado,'' said Jamie Fellner, director of HRW's U.S. program. ''Now we learn that his life in the brig has also been one of cruelty and petty vindictiveness. Whatever the Bush administration believes he has done or wanted to do, there's no excuse for how they are treating him.''</p>
<p>Al-Marri further stated he had not been formally interrogated for almost one year. For more than a year, he was barred from speaking with non-governmental personnel other than representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross. U.S. authorities granted him access to lawyers in October 2004.</p>
<p>Al-Marri resided lawfully in the United States, having come with his wife and children to obtain a graduate degree at Bradley University, the same university from which he had earned a bachelor's degree 10 years earlier, HRW said.</p>
<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) arrested al-Marri in December 2001 as a material witness in the investigation of the Sep. 11 terrorist attacks and he was subsequently indicted on federal charges of credit card fraud and lying to the agency, according to HRW.</p>
<p>In 2003, President George W. Bush branded al-Marri an enemy combatant and shortly before his criminal trial was to begin, the criminal charges against him were dismissed. Instead, he was sent to the brig.</p>
<p>Thursday's complaint came a month after the South Carolina federal court, ruling against al-Marri, affirmed Bush's authority to detain non-citizens residing in the United States as enemy combatants.</p>
<p>The legal move also came amid signs of a growing split between Bush and the leadership of his Republican Party, on the one side, and many party lawmakers on the other.</p>

<p>U.S. Senators--including a number of prominent Republicans--will again take up their fight to curb the Pentagon's treatment of suspected terrorists in U.S. custody in the autumn, when they reopen debate on a defense spending bill.
<p>
Contention over the treatment of detainees forced Senate Republican leaders to put off a vote before Congress began its summer recess this month.
<p>
Chief proponents of the detainee proposal include Republican heavyweight Senators John McCain of Arizona, a Vietnam War veteran; Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, an Air Force lawyer of 20-odd years, and John Warner of Virginia, a former Secretary of the Navy who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee.
<p>
Also at issue are proposals to close and downsize a number of military bases. Always something of a political cactus, particularly for lawmakers with bases in their districts, base closings have become especially prickly in wartime.
<p>
Bush, confronting the prospect of a rebellion by enough Republicans and Democrats to deny his administration the free hand it has demanded in conducting defense affairs, has threatened to veto any defense bill that emerges from Congress with amendments challenging the Pentagon on detainees or base closings.</p>
