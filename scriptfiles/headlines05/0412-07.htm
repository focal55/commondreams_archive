<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p> BEIRUT, LEBANON -- The bad boy of Iraqi politics is back.

<P>Muqtada al-Sadr, the renegade Shia Muslim cleric who has instigated two rebellions against American forces, is again positioning himself as one of the fiercest opponents of the U.S. military presence in Iraq. At the cleric's urging, tens of thousands of Shias poured into the streets of Baghdad on Saturday - the second anniversary of the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime - to demand a timetable for a U.S. troop withdrawal.

<P>By organizing one of the largest demonstrations since Baghdad's fall, al-Sadr has re-emerged as a political force that could cause new headaches for U.S. troops and the fledging Iraqi government. Last year, al-Sadr's militia twice fought extended battles with U.S. forces in Baghdad and southern Iraq, but it has abided by an informal truce negotiated by senior clerics in August.

<P>"Muqtada is trying to highlight the fact that he has never worked with the Americans," said Sheik Fatih Kashif Ghitta, a prominent Shia cleric and politician in Baghdad. "He is tapping into public anger about the American occupation and its trespasses. Iraqis want to see an end to U.S. raids and checkpoint shootings. That means a clear timetable for a military withdrawal."

<P>Al-Sadr, 32, is most popular among poor, young Shias from Baghdad's slums and southern Iraq. Because Iraq's Shia majority was ruthlessly suppressed by Hussein's Sunni-dominated regime, many had supported the U.S. invasion. But since then, Shias have become disillusioned with the slow pace of reconstruction and the lingering U.S. military presence.

<P>With his latest challenge, al-Sadr could be jockeying for a role in drafting Iraq's new constitution. The process is expected to begin later this month when Iraq's new parliament creates a constitutional committee of lawmakers and outside experts. Al-Sadr's supporters have largely boycotted the U.S.-organized political process, refusing to take part in the Jan. 30 parliamentary elections. But the new constitution will govern Iraq for years to come, and al-Sadr is among those who want it to have a strong Islamic bent.

<P>"He is showing his strength on the streets," said Hazem Shammari, a political science professor at Baghdad University. "He is telling the Iraqi government and the Americans that they have to include him in their political calculations."

<P>At Saturday's protest, some chanted "Death to America" and burned effigies of President George W. Bush alongside those of the former Iraqi dictator. "Force the occupiers out of our country," said one banner. "Yes for Islam, yes for Iraq. No to occupation, no to terrorism," read another.

<P>Many banners were printed in English, and an al-Sadr deputy read a statement on the cleric's behalf over loudspeakers. The message was in both Arabic and English, an indication that the protest was aimed as much at an American audience as it was geared to Iraqis.

<P>In a sign al-Sadr is trying to broaden his appeal outside the Shia community, his deputies urged protesters to wave only Iraqi flags. That is reminiscent of a strategy adopted by the Lebanese opposition in its recent mass protests against the Syrian-backed Lebanese government.

<P>"Al-Sadr's supporters understand that they have to undertake a public relations campaign, and speak to both Iraqi and foreign audiences," Shammari said. "They also realize that al-Sadr has a chance to win Sunni support if he uses nationalist symbols."

<P>In the struggle for power among Iraq's Shia, al-Sadr has two claims to leadership: He is the son of a revered cleric killed by Hussein's Baathist regime, and he never left Iraq to live in comfortable exile. He also has tried to win support by creating a social service network in Shia cities, fiercely criticizing the U.S. occupation and modeling himself after his father's vision of an activist clergy.

<P>But al-Sadr has been hampered by his youth and lack of religious credentials. In the Shia hierarchy, he is a low-level cleric, several ranks and many years away from attaining the title of ayatollah, which would allow him to issue religious rulings.

<P>After the fall of Hussein's regime in April 2003, al-Sadr had a surge of support. His followers took control of hospitals, schools and mosques. He provided social services in the absence of a central government. Posters of al-Sadr and his father lined the walls of Shia neighborhoods. He drew tens of thousands to his rallies and Friday sermons. He created a militia, the Mahdi Army, which was believed to have several thousand fighters.

<P>Last April, after U.S. officials shut down his newspaper and arrested a top aide, al-Sadr started a rebellion calling for an immediate end to the American occupation. The fighting continued for six weeks, until a cease-fire was negotiated by senior clerics. In August, al-Sadr's militia again clashed with U.S. forces, and a three-week siege of the holy city of Najaf ensued. The fighting ended with a truce arranged by Iraq's most revered Shia cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani.

<P>"If al-Sadr does not get the political clout he wants," Shammari said, "his supporters are willing to take up arms again."
