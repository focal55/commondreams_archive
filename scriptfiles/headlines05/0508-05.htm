<p>WASHINGTON - 
Elderly people with low incomes may lose some of their food stamps 
if they sign up for the new Medicare prescription drug benefit, the Bush 
administration said Saturday.
<P>When Medicare begins covering drugs in January, older Americans will 
spend less of their own money on drugs and will therefore have more to spend 
on food, reducing their need for food stamps, officials said.
<P>The new reading of the Medicare law, set forth in a document sent to 
congressional offices last week, comes just as federal officials begin a 
nationwide campaign to persuade low-income people to apply for the drug 
benefit.
<P>The document, addressed to elderly and disabled people who receive food 
stamps, says, "You may qualify for extra help paying for your Medicare 
prescription drug costs." But it adds, "If you qualify for extra help, your 
food stamp benefits may decline."
<P>Mark McClellan, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid 
Services, defended the policy. "Medicare beneficiaries will get comprehensive 
help with their drug costs and will have significantly more resources for all 
their other basic necessities, including food," he said. The savings on 
prescription drugs will more than offset any loss of food stamps, so "low-
income seniors will be better off," he said.
<P>In debate on the prescription drug bill in 2003, members of Congress said 
the high cost of drugs was forcing many older Americans to choose between food 
and medicine.
<P>The document, prepared by the Health and Human Services Department, tells 
Medicare beneficiaries: "With the Medicare prescription drug coverage, you may 
see your food stamp benefits go down as you spend less on drugs. Using the new 
Medicare benefit means you will have more cash to spend on food that you used 
to spend on prescription drugs."
<P>Subsidies will be available to an individual with monthly income of $1,
197 or less and a married couple with income of $1,604 or less.
<P>The guide gives this example of how the new law would affect a 
hypothetical Medicare beneficiary: Mrs. Smith receives $798 a month in Social 
Security. She does not receive Medicaid. She now pays $147 a month for medical 
expenses, including $51 for three prescription drugs. Her monthly rent is $421.
<P>Under the Medicare drug plan, Mrs. Smith will not have to pay a monthly 
premium or a deductible. She will have a $3 co-payment on each drug, for $9 a 
month. Her medical spending will decline to $105 a month, from $147, for a 
saving of $42.
<P>But Mrs. Smith's monthly food stamp allotment, $27, will be reduced to 
$10 a month, because her "out-of-pocket medical costs have gone down." The 
administration says she will come out ahead because "she still has $25 more 
cash in her pocket  --  $42 medical savings, less the $17 decrease in food 
stamps."
