<p>MADRID  - A Spanish judge wants to question three  U.S. soldiers as suspects in the death of a Spanish cameraman  who was killed when a U.S. tank fired on a hotel housing  foreign journalists during the 2003 assault on Baghdad.

   Spanish journalists stand behind their cameras as they stage a protest April 9, 2003, in front of Madrid's U.S. embassy against the killing of Spanish cameraman Jose Couso, 37, from Spain's Telecinco television network. A U.S. tank fired on a Baghdad hotel packed with foreign journalists, killing two cameramen, and prompting an outcry from media watchdog groups demanding an investigation. Cameramen from Reuters and Spanish television died and three other Reuters staff were wounded in the shelling on Tuesday, soon after a journalist from al-Jazeera was killed in what the Arab television channel called a U.S. air strike on its office.

The Pentagon has found no fault with the soldiers, but High  Court Judge Santiago Pedraz wants to question the three men who  were in the tank, a court official said on Tuesday.
<P>
Telecinco cameraman Jose Couso and Reuters cameraman Taras  Protsiuk died and several other people were injured by a shell  fired on the Palestine Hotel in the Iraqi capital on April 8,  2003, in the U.S.-led war to topple Saddam Hussein.
<P>
The Spanish court would only have jurisdiction in the death  of the Spanish citizen.
<P>
The soldiers would be questioned as suspects for murder and  for crimes against the international community, which carry  sentences of 15 to years in jail and 10 to 15 years  respectively.
<P>
Pedraz on Tuesday agreed to send a request for U.S.  cooperation in the investigation, but he is still only in the  initial stages of the criminal investigation and several steps  away from bringing charges.
<P>
Pedraz's investigation stems from a complaint brought by  the Couso family.
<P>
Legal sources say the U.S. Army is unlikely to grant access  to the soldiers, and if the case ever got far enough to warrant  arrests the soldiers could only be arrested in Spain.
<P>
The judge is willing to travel to the United States to take  their statements, the court official said.
<P>

A Pentagon report on the incident concluded U.S.-led forces  bore "no fault or negligence."
<P>
The Pentagon released a brief summary of the report in  August 2003, which ruled that American forces acted "in an  appropriate manner" when they fired into the hotel, but the  full report was classified.
<P>
The New York-based <a href="http://www.cpj.org/" target="_new">Committee to Protect Journalists</a>  obtained the 52-page report under the U.S. Freedom of  Information Act and said it strengthened its own finding that  the hotel shelling could have been avoided.
<P>
A U.S. Embassy spokesman had no immediate comment.<p align="center">&copy; 2005 Reuters Ltd.</p>
