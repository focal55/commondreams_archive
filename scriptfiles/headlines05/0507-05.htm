<p>AUSTIN - Note to hecklers at the University of Texas: When jeering, keep it clean or face possible arrest.</P>
<P>Ajai Raj, a 19-year-old English major, thought he was exercising his right to free speech when he quizzed conservative pundit Ann Coulter on her definition of marriage after a lecture she delivered at the LBJ Library.</P>

<P>Trouble was, he used profanity and then made obscene gestures while walking away from a microphone set up for the question-and-answer portion of Tuesday's event.</P>
<P>Moments later, university police were inside the library's auditorium, handcuffing Raj.</P>
<P>He first thought they were there to tell him to leave, Raj said. Instead, he was told he was under arrest.</P>
<P>"That's the scary part of it ... I asked them what for?" he said Friday. "I kind of recoiled a little bit. They said they didn't know actually. They were just following orders from I don't know who. They were just following orders."</P>
<P>University police say they were following the state's disorderly conduct statute, a Class C misdemeanor that prohibits abusive, profane and vulgar language and obscene gestures in public areas. But some question if Raj's behavior really violated the law.</P>
<P>
<b>The chief's explanation</b>
<P>UT Police Department interim Chief Terry McMahan said typically when people protest at events, and they stay on the subject matter, police don't get involved. But Raj didn't do that, he said. 

<P>"That's what this college is all about, being able to have that freedom of speech," McMahan said. "But when it goes beyond an issue of speech, and it meets the elements of a criminal law violation, we step in."</P>
<P>Robert Jensen, a UT journalism professor, said he wasn't at the speech, but he said nothing he has heard or read constitutes disorderly conduct.</P>

<P>"If the sole basis for the charge is that he used profanity and used gestures people found offensive, then there's no charge," Jensen said. "Because cussing in public is not a criminal offense. His speech may have been juvenile, and I think it was ... but at least from what I can tell, nothing rose to the level of criminal offense."</P>
<P>Jensen said it sounds like it may have been a pre-emptive arrest to get Raj out of the room.</P>
<P>Paul McGreal, a professor at Houston's South Texas College of Law, also is not convinced that the profanity and gestures should have led to an arrest.</P>
<P>While laws allow government to control forums such as the one at UT, and government entities can ban obscenity because it is not a protected class of speech, it's not that simple an issue, McGreal said.</P>
<P>"The graphic depiction of ... a sex act ... has to be done to serve a prurient interest," McGreal said. Accounts of Raj's actions seem to indicate that his actions were more of a political nature, not a prurient one.</P>
<P>Raj, who is from Plano, said he made the decision to attend Coulter's speech at the last minute after a friend suggested they go.</P>
<P>"It's being construed as a liberal protest and things like that," said Raj. "I'm not necessarily liberal or conservative, really. I just did that more to point out how ludicrous the whole thing was.</P>
<P>"Like everyone there knew where they stood already on Ann Coulter. It was kind of pointless," Raj said. "No one there's going to change their mind on anything."</P>
<P>Raj was arrested about 9 p.m. Tuesday and first taken to university police offices and then the Travis County Jail, where he was booked on the misdemeanor charge. He was released about 2:45 a.m. Wednesday.</P>

<P>Raj is scheduled to appear before a justice of the peace on May 20. If convicted, he faces a maximum fine of $500.</P>
<P>The incident was not a first for Coulter.</P>
<P>Last March, Coulter called for help when hecklers refused to be silent during her speech at the University of Kansas. But in that instance, authorities escorted the jeering protesters out of the building.</P>
<P>Last fall, two men at the University of Arizona threw custard pies at her.</P>
<P>In an interview on Wednesday on Fox Television's <EM>Hannity &amp; Colmes</EM> show, Coulter dismissed the UT incident.</P>
<P>"Oh, it's a lot of fun," she told Sean Hannity after she was asked about the heckling aspect of her college appearances. "A good time is had by all."</P>

<P>While the University Democrats did not formally protest the event, Emily Cadik, a spokeswoman for the group, attended and said the audience seemed stunned after Raj spoke.</P>
<P>The questioner before him had asked Coulter to define her view of marriage and she indicated that it was a union between a man and a woman, Raj said.</P>
<P><b>Raj's turn at the mike</b>
<P>When Raj took to the microphone, he confronted her about that view, lacing his question with profanity. 

<P>"They went on to the next question pretty quickly," said Cadik, a junior. "As (Raj) walked out, a lot of protesters walked out with him, they were clapping."</P>
<P>Cadik doesn't think Raj should have been arrested because "using expletives on campus is not a crime and he wasn't posing a threat."</P>
<P>People overlook the fact that Coulter's speech was offensive, too, Cadik said.</P>
<P>"She makes comments that I think she knows people will respond to," she said. "But she got away with it, and he got arrested."</P>
