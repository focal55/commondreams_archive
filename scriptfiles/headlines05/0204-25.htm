<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->BAGHDAD -- Partial results from Sunday's election suggest that U.S.-backed 
Prime Minister Ayad Allawi's coalition is being roundly defeated by a list 
with the backing of Iraq's senior Shiite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-
Sistani, diminishing Allawi's chances of retaining his post in the next 
government.
<P>Sharif Ali bin Hussein, head of the Constitutional Monarchy Party, 
likened the vote outcome to a "Sistani tsunami" that would shake the nation. 
<P>"Americans are in for a shock," he said, adding that one day they would 
realize, "We've got 150,000 troops here protecting a country that's extremely 
friendly to Iran, and training their troops."
<P>The partial totals so far show the Iraqi List headed by Allawi, a secular 
Shiite and onetime CIA protege, trailed far behind with only 18 percent of the 
votes, despite an aggressive television ad campaign waged with U.S. aid. A 
lopsided majority of votes, 72 percent, went to the United Iraqi Alliance list,
topped by a Shiite cleric who lived in Iran for many years and whose Sciri 
party has close ties to Iran's clerical regime. More than a third of the 
alliance's vote came from Baghdad, the cosmopolitan capital where Allawi had 
been expected to fare well.
<P>Although the results are only from Baghdad and five southern provinces 
where the Shiite parties were expected to score strongly, and from only 10 
percent of the country's 5,216 polling stations, the scale of the alliance's 
vote underscored the probability of a historic shift in the Shiites' favor 
from decades of Sunni minority rule in Iraq. 
<P>Safwat Rashid, a member of Iraq's Independent Election Commission, and 
international election officials warned observers not to read too much into 
the early numbers, which did not include tallies in the country's Sunni or 
Kurdish provinces. 
<P>Rashid said the Baghdad numbers came from "mixed"  --  meaning Sunni and 
Shiite  --  neighborhoods in the city where Allawi was expected to perform 
well. Hussein said Allawi had also performed poorly in Babil province, a 
relatively urbanized, mixed Shiite-Sunni area south of Baghdad.
<P>He said the vote total and the total turnout numbers wouldn't be known 
for another 10 days.
<P>Already, Western officials in Baghdad appeared to be downplaying worries 
about the possible victory by the alliance, topped by Abdel Aziz al-Hakim, a 
cleric who spent years exiled in Iran. 
<P>The alliance "is a very diverse group of people, from Westernized 
independents to Sunni sheikhs to people who really believe in an Islamic state,
" one Western diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity said of the alliance 
on Wednesday. "It will be hard to maintain unity."
<P>The election commission also released final vote tallies from overseas 
voters in eight countries, the United States, Britain, France, Iran, Syria, 
Jordan, the United Arab Emirates and Australia. The alliance won of 44 percent 
of the 170,000 votes cast in those countries, the Kurds 18 percent and 
Allawi's list 12 percent. In U.S. voting, Allawi garnered just 5 percent of 
the vote, less than the Communist Party total. 
<P>Some Sunni leaders said the Shiite coalition's strong showing to date did 
little more than validate the deep sense of alienation felt by Iraq's Sunnis, 
most of whom did not cast ballots Sunday.
<P>"The Shia were determined and encouraged their supporters to vote and to 
register, and the Sunnis didn't care that much, either out of fear or apathy," 
said Adnan Pachachi, a foreign minister in the years before Saddam Hussein who 
is a prominent Sunni leader. "This is the story, really."
<P>But signs also have emerged that some Sunni leaders are ready to involve 
themselves at least in a limited way in the country's political debate. The 
leaders of 13 mostly Sunni political parties that stayed out of the election 
agreed earlier this week that they would take part in writing a permanent 
constitution for Iraq.
<P>When the vote count is final, the 275 seats in the National Assembly will 
be divided up among the 111 parties, individuals and coalitions that ran in 
the election, with each ticket getting seats according to its proportion of 
the vote. Each list that receives one-275th or more of the vote total gets at 
least a seat. 

<P>A two-thirds majority of the parliament must approve a president and two 
deputy presidents, who will be in charge of naming a Cabinet. The new assembly 
is also responsible for writing the constitution, a process that could be 
adjusted in order to include Sunni representatives.
<P>Presuming the constitution is approved by referendum next autumn, new 
elections for a permanent government will be held by year's end.
<P>None of the votes announced Thursday came from the Kurdish north, where 
heavy turnout is sure to guarantee a strong Kurdish presence in the assembly. 
<P>Kurdish political leader Jalal Talabani said he would seek the office of 
either president or prime minister when the legislature convenes. "We, as 
Kurds, want one of those two posts, and we will not give it up," Talabani, 
head of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan and a candidate on the unified 
Kurdish list of candidates, told reporters.
<P>Now that the election is over, Pentagon authorities have decided to start 
reducing the level of U.S. forces in Iraq next month by about 15,000 troops, 
down to about 135,000, Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz told Congress 
Thursday. "I think we'll be able to come down to the level that was projected 
before this election," he said.
<P>Gen. Richard Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, testified that 
about 40,000 of Iraq's best forces "can go anywhere in the country and take on 
almost any threat." But he acknowledged that more than two-thirds of the 136,
000 members of Iraqi security forces that the United States and its allies 
have trained and equipped were unready to tackle the insurgency.
<P>That uprising began rattling the nation anew Thursday as at least 26 
Iraqis and three U.S. Marines died in an uptick of violence following days of 
post-election calm.
<P>Insurgents stopped a minibus south of Kirkuk, ordered army recruits off 
the vehicle and killed 12 of them. Gunmen fired on a vehicle carrying Iraqi 
contractors to jobs at a U.S. military base in Baquba, killing two. 
<P>A suicide bomber struck a foreign convoy escorted by military humvees on 
Baghdad's airport road. Rebels attacked Iraqi police Thursday in the Baghdad 
suburb of Abu Ghraib, killing one policeman and wounding five, the Interior 
Ministry said.
<P>One U.S. Marine was killed Thursday in Babil province, the U.S. command 
said. Two other Marines were killed in action Wednesday night in Anbar 
province.
