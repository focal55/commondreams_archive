deepened ethnic and sectarian rifts and is likely to worsen the
insurgency and hasten the country's violent break-up, the
International Crisis Group (ICG) said on Monday.</p>

More than 1,000 people marched to protest against the constitution, which they say will divide Iraq along sectarian lines by giving too much autonomy to Kurds in the north and pro-Iranian Shi'ites in the south.<br>

"The constitution is likely to fuel rather than dampen
insurgency," said Robert Malley, head of the think-tank's
Middle East and North Africa program, introducing an ICG
report.</p>
<p>"A compact based on compromise and broad consent could have
been a first step in a healing process. Instead it is proving
yet another step in a process of depressing decline."</p>
<p>Iraqis are to vote on October 15 in a constitutional
referendum on what the ICG calls a weak document that lacks
consensus.</p>
<p>Its report says the draft, endorsed by Shi'ite Muslim
cleric Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, as well as Shi'ite and Kurdish
parties, is likely to pass despite fierce Sunni Arab
opposition.</p>
<p>The Sunnis, it says, are unlikely to muster the two thirds
of votes in three provinces required to block its passage.</p>
<p>"Such a result would leave Iraq divided, an easy prey to
both insurgents and sectarian tensions that have dramatically
increased over the past year," the ICG says.</p>
<p>To avert this outcome, it urges the United States to broker
a last-minute political deal among Sunnis, Shi'ites and Kurds,
before October 15 that would assuage Sunni fears of a Shi'ite
"super-region" emerging in the south and of
"de-Baathification."</p>
<p>The parties would commit themselves to acting after
December elections to limit to four the number of governorates
that can fuse into an autonomous region, and not to bar Iraqis
from office just because of past membership in the Baath party.</p>

<p>"There is strong reason to doubt whether such a strategy
can succeed," the report says, citing polarized communal
positions. "But given the stakes, the U.S. cannot afford not to
try."</p>
<p>SUNNI ARABS LEFT OUT</p>
<p>The draft constitution drawn up since June bears the
imprint of the Shi'ite and Kurdish parties that dominate the
parliament elected in January polls largely boycotted by Sunni
Arabs.</p>
<p>Fifteen Sunni Arab politicians were added to the drafting
committee in an effort at inclusiveness, but the ICG says they
felt increasingly marginalized after the August 1 decision not
to seek a six-month extension of the drafting deadline.</p>
<p>Negotiations then took place informally among Shi'ite and
Kurdish politicians. The Sunnis refused to sign their drafts.</p>
<p>The ICG report argues that U.S. pressure to stick to an
arbitrary deadline reflected the Bush administration's apparent
desire to prepare for a significant military drawdown in 2006.</p>
<p>"As a result the constitution-making process became a new
stake in the political battle rather than an instrument to
resolve it," the report says.</p>
<p>Sunni Arabs reject the draft mainly because they believe
its provisions on federalism could lead to Iraq's break-up,
leaving them in a landlocked heartland without oil resources.</p>
<p>The proposed constitution is also vague and ambiguous on
decentralization and powers of taxation, the ICG says, with
many other questions left for future legislation -- in
parliaments where majority Shi'ites are likely to have the
upper hand.

<p>
"The United States has repeatedly stated that it has a
strategic interest in Iraq's territorial integrity, but today
the situation appears to be heading toward de facto partition
and full-scale civil war," the report says.
