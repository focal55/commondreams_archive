<p>The devastating accusations have been made by Admiral Stansfield Turner who labelled Dick Cheney &quot;a vice president for torture&quot;.</p>

<p>He said: &quot;We have crossed the line into dangerous territory&quot;.</p>

</font>The American Senate says torture should be banned - whatever the justification. But President Bush has threatened to veto their ruling.</p>

<p>The former spymaster claims President Bush is not telling the truth when he says that torture is not a method used by the US.</p>

<p>Speaking of Bush's claims that the US does not use torture, Admiral Turner, who ran the CIA from 1977 to 1981, said: &quot;I do not believe him&quot;.</p>

<p>On Dick Cheney he said &quot;I'm embarrassed the United States has a vice president for torture.</p>

<p>&quot;He condones torture, what else is he?&quot;.</p>

<p>Admiral Turner claims the secret CIA prisons used for torture are known as 'black sites', terror suspects are picked up in places like Afghanistan and Pakistan.</p>

<p>They are flown by CIA-controlled private aircraft to countries where there are secret interrogation centres, operating outside any country's jurisdiction.</p>

<p>No one will confirm their locations, but there are several possibilities: The Mihail-Kogalniceanu military airbase in Romania is believed by many to be one such facility.</p>

<p>Admiral Turner's remarks were echoed by Republican Senator John McCain, himself a victim of torture in Vietnam.</p>

<p>He said torturing to get information was immoral, was not effective and encouraged potential enemies to do the same to Americans.</p>

<p>Both Mr Bush and Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice have repeatedly stated that torture by US forces is not condoned.</p>
