        <!--/endimage/--> The article, &#8220;An Inconvenient Patriot,&#8221; by British writer David 
  Rose, reports that Edmonds was asked to listen to wiretaps as part of what appeared 
  to be an FBI public corruption probe into bribes paid to members of Congress 
  &#8211; both Democrat and Republican.</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
Rose, citing &#8220;some of the wiretaps,&#8221; reports that &#8220;the FBI&#8217;s 
  targets had arranged for tens of thousands of dollars to be paid to Hastert&#8217;s 
  campaign funds in small checks.&#8221;</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
The article notes that under Federal Election Commission rules, &#8220;donations 
  of less than $200 are not required to be itemized in public filings.&#8221;</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
The article reports that Edmonds has given confidential testimony on several 
  occasions &#8211; to congressional staffers, to the Inspector General, and to 
  staff from the 9/11 commission.</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
&#8220;Edmonds reportedly added that the recordings also contained repeated 
  references to Hastert&#8217;s flip-flop, in the fall of 2000&quot; to &#8220;the 
  continuing campaign to have Congress designate the killings of Armenians in 
  Turkey between 1915 and 1923 as genocide.&#8221;</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  According to the <em>Vanity Fair </em>article, the resolution never went anywhere 
  until August 2000 when Hastert announced he was supporting it &#8211; in an 
  effort to win over his district&#8217;s large Armenian community.</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
According to the article, the resolution passed the House International Relations 
  Committee by a large majority &#8220;thanks to Hastert.&#8221;</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
&#8220;Then, on October 19, minutes before the full House vote, Hastert withdrew 
  it,&#8221; the article reports.</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  Hastert said at the time that he withdrew it because of a letter he received 
  from President Bill Clinton that the bill would harm U.S. interests.</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  And while the <em>Vanity Fair</em> article reports that &#8220;there is no evidence 
  that any payment was ever made to Hastert or to his campaigns,&#8221; it also 
  reports that &#8220;a senior official at the Turkish Consulate is said to have 
  claimed in one recording that the price for Hastert to withdraw the resolution 
  would have been at least $500,000.&#8221;</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
The article reports that Edmonds testified that she heard about the payments 
  when listening to &#8220;Turkish wiretap targets.&#8221;</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  In one wiretapped conversation, a Turkish official spoke to a State Department 
  staffer.</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
&#8220;They agreed that the State Department staffer would send a representative 
  at an appointed time to the American-Turkish Council office, at 1111 14th Street, 
  N.W. where he would be given $7,000 in cash,&#8221; the article reports.</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
Another call Edmonds heard allegedly discussed a payment to a Pentagon official &#8220;who seemed to be involved in weapons-procurement negotiations,&#8221; according to the article.</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0;"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
Hastert&#8217;s spokesman could not be reached for comment. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But 
  he told <em>Vanity Fair </em>that Hastert is &#8220;unaware of Turkish interests 
  making donations&#8221; and his staff has &#8220;not seen any pattern of donors 
with foreign names.</font>
