<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p>MONTPELIER, VT -- Former Gov. Howard Dean, now the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said Tuesday night he is hoping that U.S. Rep. Bernie Sanders can help persuade potential Progressive Party candidates to stay out of next year’s races for the U.S. House and lieutenant governor.

<P>“We all recognize that Bernie does not have the power to tell anybody who can and cannot run for office,” said Dean. “But if we are going to work together, we should work together across the board.”

<P>Dean’s comments came in a telephone interview in which the former governor made it clear he has not yet endorsed Sanders’ bid for the U.S. Senate.

<P>“Bernie is going to be an extremely strong candidate, but I think it is a little premature for me to endorse him right this minute,” said Dean.

<P>There have been conflicting reports about whether Democratic leaders have endorsed Sanders. Dean said those reports stem from the differing perspectives of Democrats in Washington and those in Vermont regarding Sanders.

<P>“Here’s the problem,” said Dean. “From the national perspective, of which I am now a part of, Bernie is a very strong candidate who votes with Democrats. From a Vermont perspective, there are still some issues to work out to make sure the Vermont folks are comfortable with all this.”

<P>Those issues involve whether Democrats and Progressives are going to run in the races for the U.S. Senate, U.S. House, governor and lieutenant governor.

<P>Dean and some state Democrats believe that if the Democrats agree not to run a big-name candidate for the U.S. Senate - and thus avoid splitting the vote with Sanders - that the Progressives - a party that Sanders helped to form but is not a member of - should stay out of some of the other races.

<P>Dean’s comment came on a day in which Progressives indicated they were interested in running for the U.S. House and lieutenant governor.

<P>Dean said Democrats and Progressives were able to work things out last year in the gubernatorial race, in which former Progressive Peter Clavelle was the Democratic nominee.

<P>“We were able to work out things (in the gubernatorial race), but the presence of a third-party candidate in the lieutenant governor’s race made it essentially impossible to win for Democrats,” he said.

<P>Noting that Anthony Pollina is interested in running as a Progressive for lieutenant governor next year, Dean noted that Pollina lost his last race for that office. “Anthony’s candidacy has proven he is not going to win - and the result will be to elect a Republican - and I don’t think that’s helpful,” said Dean.

<P>“I think the same could happen in the congressional race. It is not in anybody’s interest - either the Progressives or Democrats - to have Republicans elected to the Congress, given what President Bush and Tom Delay are doing to this country.”

<P>Dean said he hopes to sit down with Sanders to discuss the potential problems of running Progressive and Democratic candidates in the same contests.

<P>“I know Bernie does not control the Progressive Party but if we are going to work together we are going to work together across the spectrum, not just in one race or another race,” he said.
