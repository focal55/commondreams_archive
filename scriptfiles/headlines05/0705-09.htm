<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->If the Congressional Progressive Caucus, which is probably the 
closest thing Bay Area liberal Democrats have to a government in waiting, were 
to take over in Washington, these would become national policy:
<P>Access to affordable, high-quality health care would be universal. Social 
Security benefits would be protected, along with private pensions. The minimum 
wage would be raised, and workers' rights to form unions would be protected. 
Expiring sections of the Patriot Act wouldn't be renewed, and Congress would 
fight media consolidation.
<P>U.S. troops would be brought home from Iraq "as soon as possible,'' and 
the government would work to "restore international respect for American power 
and influence.''
<P>All these points are part of the "Progressive Promise,'' an effort by the 
59-member caucus of liberal House Democrats and one independent to 
reinvigorate the 15-year-old organization and make it more of a player in a 
capital city where conservative Republicans are solidly in charge. The effort 
also includes hiring the caucus' first full-time staff member, veteran 
congressional aide Bill Goold, and reaching out to a variety of groups for 
support.
<P>Behind the attempt to revitalize the organization is the feeling, also 
reflected in the election of the outspoken former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean as 
Democratic national chairman, that the party must provide a sharp alternative 
to President Bush and the Republican Congress.
<P>"This is a reinvigoration. It shows our understanding of where the 
country is," said one of the caucus' two co-chairs, Rep. Lynn Woolsey, D-
Petaluma. "Democrats are hungry to hear their voice.''
<P>Her co-chair, Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Oakland, said the "Progressive Promise,
" which consists of three main themes and about 20 specific pledges, is a 
serious document. "It is a blueprint for a progressive governing majority, and 
a vision for what a progressive America can and will accomplish," she said.
<P>"Never have I seen our caucus so united," Lee said. "It gives us the 
space to be as prominent as any other caucus."
<P>The document was made public last week in a sweltering, jammed basement 
meeting room in the Rayburn House Office Building. A few hundred people picked 
at trays of cheese, crackers and melon, sipping wine and soft drinks as they 
listened to a long list of speakers lay out the caucus' issues and lambaste 
the Republicans.

<P>The event was sponsored by a swarm of liberal groups eager to take on 
conservatives. They included MoveOn.org, the Nation magazine, the American 
Civil Liberties Union, Rainbow/PUSH Coalition, Americans for Democratic Action,
the Human Rights Campaign, Peace Action and Hip Hop Caucus, and a host of 
others. 
<P>It was clear they are all hungry for action. "We like it when someone 
says no to George Bush,'' John Nichols, the Nation's Washington correspondent, 
told the throng. "Caucuses are beginnings. ... Caucuses can change the country,
'' he said.
<P>The Progressive Caucus began trying to change things when it was founded 
in 1990 by Rep. Bernie Sanders, the independent from Vermont. It says it's the 
largest single caucus among House Democrats, who now number 202 in the 109th 
Congress, and is one of dozens of caucuses boosting all kinds of causes and 
concerns, from wine and hunting to the Balkans and African Americans.
<P>In addition to Woolsey and Lee, Bay Area members of the caucus include 
Democratic Reps. Sam Farr of Carmel, Tom Lantos of San Mateo, George Miller of 
Martinez and Pete Stark of Fremont. 
<P>The House Democratic leader, Rep. Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco, has been 
a longtime caucus member. But as leader of all House Democrats, she has a 
policy of not belonging to any individual caucuses. Rather, she says she is 
concentrating on unifying Democrats of all stripes in their effort to take 
back the House, which Republicans won in 1994. 
<P>Other Bay Area Democrats affiliate with different caucuses. Rep. Mike 
Thompson D-St. Helena, and Rep. Ellen Tauscher, D-Walnut Creek, belong to the 
Blue Dog Coalition, a group of 35 moderate to conservative Democrats.
<P>The progressives are way behind their conservative rivals and even other 
liberal caucuses in terms of organization.
<P>Goold works out of Woolsey's office and is paid from funds kicked in by 
caucus members' office budgets. He said that after just three weeks on the job,
he's swamped. "I can't answer all the calls and e-mails I get each day,'' 
Goold said.
<P>The group's Web site, which like other congressional caucus pages is 
reachable only through members' Web sites, hasn't been updated in about four 
years. "We need to address basic communication functions,'' Goold said.
<P>In contrast, the big caucus of more than 100 conservative House 
Republicans, called the Republican Study Committee, maintains an elaborate Web 
site, has long had a paid executive director, and provides a center for 
members to issue press releases and statements on issues.
<P>The group also reports about Congress' actions in supporting conservative 
values on such issues as abortion, same-sex marriage, gambling and abstinence. 
<P>The progressives also lag behind the all-Democratic Congressional Black 
Caucus, which has maintained a foundation that conducts research on issues of 
concern to members since 1976. Goold said creation of a similar foundation 
might be a long-term goal for the progressives.
<P>Woolsey said the progressives will make a small number of issues their 
immediate priorities.
<P>"We are working on progressive responses to the Patriot Act, the budget 
and trade deficits, media consolidation and the war. ... That's a plateful,'' 
she said.
