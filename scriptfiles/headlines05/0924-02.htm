        <!--/endimage/-->       Three streams of marchers carrying banners, chanting and  blowing horns set off from various parts of London aiming to  pass parliament and converge on Hyde Park to hear anti-war  speeches.</p>
<p>          There was a large police presence and barricades were placed  around key government buildings in case of violence.</p>
<p>          Protesters carried banners with slogans such as &quot;Blair  Liar&quot;, &quot;Bush world No. 1 terrorist&quot;, &quot;No war, no nukes&quot; and  &quot;Blair's taking liberties, troops home now&quot;.</p>
<p>          The U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 has never been popular  in Britain and Blair's personal rating slumped after charges  that his government had exaggerated the case for war.</p>
<p>          The march took place on the eve of the annual conference of  Blair's ruling Labour Party, which is divided over the invasion  and occupation of Iraq.</p>
<p>          Britain has 8,500 soldiers in Iraq and Blair says they will  be withdrawn only when stability has been restored, the Iraqi  army is capable of maintaining order and a democratically  elected Iraqi government says the time is right.</p>
<p>          The insurgency in the central part of the country in an  around Baghdad and the rising number of British deaths in  southern Iraq -- now standing at 95 -- has further eroded public  support.</p>
<p>          The marches, organised by the Stop The War campaign, took  place less than a week after British troops stormed a police  station in the southern city of Basra to free two undercover  soldiers who had been detained by Iaqi police.</p>
<p>          The British say the two had been handed over to a militia  group and their lives were in danger, but the Iraqis deny his  was the case and have demanded an apology and compensation.</p>
<p>          In a further blow to relations in the British theatre of  operations in the south, an Iraqi judge on Saturday issued an  arrest warrant for the two men.</p>
<p>          Britain's Ministry of Defence said the warrants had no legal  basis.</p>
<p>          &quot;All British troops in Iraq come under the jurisdiction of  Britain,&quot; a defence spokesman said in London.</p>
<p>          In the United States, the anti-war group United for Peace  and Justice organised a march on Washington in protest against  the war in Iraq.</p>
<p>          The organizers said march was part of a three-day protest  that would include non-violent acts of civil disobedience at the  White House and an interfaith religious service.
