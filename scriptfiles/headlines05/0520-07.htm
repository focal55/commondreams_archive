<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p>Luis Posada, the ageing anti-Castro militant wanted in Venezuela and Cuba over an airliner bombing 30 years ago, was yesterday charged with illegally entering the US, in a case that has led to claims of double standards by Washington in the war on terror.

<P>Mr Posada, 77, who worked for the CIA during its war against leftwing radicals in Latin America, was arrested on Tuesday after spending more than two months living in Miami.

<P>Officials said yesterday that the Cuban exile, who admits entering the country illegally through Mexico in mid-March this year, would be held without bail until he appears before an immigration judge at a hearing scheduled for June 13. The decision leaves open the possibility that he could be deported to a third country other than Venezuela or Cuba.

<P>The case has become an embarrassment for the Bush administration, which has been trying to reconcile the feelings of the large Cuban exile population in Florida - where the president's brother, Jeb Bush, is state governor - with its tough post-9/11 stance against terrorism suspects.

<P>It has also provided ammunition for America's more vehement international critics. Last night, the Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez denounced the US approach as "two-faced". "He is a self-confessed terrorist," Mr Chávez said. "The US has a choice: either send him to Venezuela or be seen by the world as protecting terrorism."

<P>Mr Posada, who applied for political asylum after arriving in the US, was detained by immigration officials after he surfaced publicly for the first time to give a news conference in a Florida warehouse.

<P>Hours earlier, the Cuban president, Fidel Castro, had led a crowd reportedly numbering hundreds of thousands past the US mission in the capital, Havana, and made a speech castigating Washington for hypocrisy over its handling of the case.

<P>US authorities say Mr Posada has withdrawn his request for political asylum. But his lawyer, Eduardo Soto, said yesterday that his client claims he never lost permanent US legal residency, which he obtained in 1962, and should be given asylum.

<P>He said Mr Posada, who claims he would face persecution in Cuba and Venezuela, would "vigorously oppose" deportation and would seek bail.

<P>Mr Posada is being held at a detention facility in Texas, and Mr Soto said he would ask for the proceedings to be moved to Miami, where his client's wife and his 29-year-old son live. He left open the possibility that he would agree to move to a third country if an acceptable friendly state could be found. US law does not allow extradition to Cuba or to countries believed to be acting on its behalf.

<P>Mr Posada was involved in numerous attempts to overthrow Mr Castro since fleeing the country in 1961, just in time to sign up with the CIA for the abortive Bay of Pigs operation.

<P>In 1963 he joined the agency's officer candidate school, where he is said to have learned to build bombs, gather intelligence and spread propaganda.

<P>In 1967 he moved to Venezuela, becoming a citizen and rising to lead the government's counter-intelligence service, a job he left in 1974.

<P>When a Cubana Airlines aircraft blew up off the coast of Barbados on October 6 1976, killing all 73 people on board, suspicion immediately fell on Mr Posada. He was arrested and acquitted twice, but was held in custody pending appeals. Dressed as a priest, he escaped in 1985, apparently after bribing guards.

<P>A state department intelligence brief issued after the aircraft bombing and made public on Wednesday revealed that Mr Posada told an informant weeks before the attack: "We are going to hit a Cuban airliner."

<P>Venezuela formally requested his extradition earlier this month after officials under Mr Chávez reopened the case, seeking to try him for murder and treason. But US officials initially said they were not looking for Mr Posada because he was not wanted for a crime there.

<P>The Venezuelan vice-president said yesterday his country was not seeking Mr Posada's extradition "for reasons of vengeance", or because of Venezuela's close ties with Cuba. "It's about the exercise of justice on the part of the Venezuelan state," he said, urging the US government to be "coherent" on the issue of terrorism. "There cannot be a good terrorism and a bad terrorism," he said.

<P>Mr Posada, who survived an assassination attempt in Honduras in 1990 that scarred his face, has also been implicated in a string of bombings in Cuba in 1997. He was pardoned last year by the Panamanian president for his role in an alleged assassination plot against Mr Castro.
