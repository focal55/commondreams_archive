<p>WASHINGTON — Advocates for the homeless already are seeing veterans from the 
war on terror living on the street, and say the government must do more to ease 
their transition from military to civilian life.</p>
<p>Linda Boone, executive director of the National Coalition for Homeless 
Veterans, said about 70 homeless veterans who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan 
contacted her group’s facilities in 2004, and another 125 homeless veterans from 
those conflicts last year petitioned the Department of Veterans Affairs for 
assistance.</p>
<p>“It’s not a big wave, but it’s an indicator that we still haven’t done our 
job,” she said. “I think that our nation would be very embarrassed if they knew 
that.”</p>
<p>The group, founded in 1990, is a national network of charitable organizations 
designed to provide resources and aid for homeless veterans.</p>
<p>Veterans Affairs officials estimate that about 250,000 veterans are homeless 
on any given night, and another 250,000 experience homelessness at some point.</p>
<p>Boone said the reasons behind the veterans’ housing problems are varied: Some 
have emotional and mental issues from their combat experience, some have trouble 
finding work after leaving the military, some have health care bills which 
result in financial distress.</p>
<p>George Basher, director of the New York State Department of Veterans Affairs, 
said he believes guardsmen and reservists are particularly at risk because they 
often bypass resources like the Transition Assistance Program when they return 
home.</p>
<p>“Those are the ones most likely to have private health insurance, so they’re 
likely to show up at an HMO looking for treatment and not a VA hospital,” he 
said. “There’s no central place for treatment.”</p>

<p>Still, Pete Dougherty, coordinator for the Veterans’ Affairs Department's 
homeless programs, said veterans today have more options — outpatient 
facilities, counselors, job training programs — than the troops returning from 
the Vietnam War.</p>
<p>“Most of the folks we’re seeing now are worried about losing their homes and 
think they won’t be able to afford to stay in them,” he said. “Before, the vets 
were out there but were unseen and unnoticed. Now we can reach out and make a 
difference sooner.”</p>
<p>But Boone added that most veterans don’t seek help for mental and emotional 
problems for years after their return from combat, meaning the problem of 
homelessness among war on terror veterans will likely grow.</p>
<p>“We’re still going to have homeless veterans because we haven’t tackled how 
to deal with the separation issue,” she said.</p>
