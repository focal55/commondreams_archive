<p>WASHINGTON  - President Bush will nominate one of his closest confidantes, Karen P. Hughes, to lead an effort at the State Department to repair the image of the United States overseas, particularly in the Arab world, administration officials said Friday.</p>

She will also be a leader in publicizing the president's campaign for democracy in the Middle East.
<p>Ms. Hughes, 48, is to be named next week as Mr. Bush's choice to be under secretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs, a position that requires Senate confirmation. Ms. Hughes, who has been a major influence in producing the message Mr. Bush presents to the public, will now tackle what administration officials say is the extremely  difficult job of selling the United States and its policies to the world after the anger over the American-led invasion of Iraq.</p>

<p>Two previous under secretaries for public diplomacy have resigned, and the job has been vacant  since last summer. A series of reports by government experts, including the independent commission on the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, and by outside foundations have harshly criticized the administration's attempts to improve America's image overseas.  </p>
<p>The new secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, has said that public diplomacy  -  a term that encompasses press and public relations, cultural exchanges and information programs  -  is an urgent concern. </p>
<p>Ms. Hughes, the former counselor to the president who left the White House in the summer of 2002 to move her homesick family back to Texas, is a former Texas television reporter who is not known for her expertise in foreign affairs. But she is personally close to Ms. Rice, has the full confidence of Mr. Bush, and was the driving force behind an American  campaign during the war in Afghanistan that publicized the plight of Afghan women. </p>
<p>That campaign was part of her larger responsibility at the time as the coordinator of wartime public relations, an assignment Mr. Bush gave her 24 hours after the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001. "When he called me that morning, he told me that this will be an ongoing process of educating the public," Ms. Hughes said in an interview in November 2001. "He said, 'O.K., go for it.' "</p>
<p>Since then, Ms. Hughes has made several trips to Afghanistan to highlight American assistance to Afghan women, who were kept out of schools, offices and public life under the rule of the Taliban. "A society cannot be peaceful and harmonious if one-half of its members are imprisoned in their homes," Ms. Hughes said in another interview in November 2001, in comments that reflected the thrust of her information campaign.</p>
<p>Ms. Hughes, who  has continued to advise Mr. Bush on speechwriting and communications from her home in Austin, Tex., declined  Friday to comment on her nomination. </p>
<p>In leaving the White House in 2002, Ms. Hughes cited the unhappiness of her son, Robert,  in Washington as a major reason. But Robert is to enter Stanford University this fall.</p>
<p>Still, friends say, she will not give up her home in Austin, where she lives with her husband, Jerry, and she has plans to commute to Washington.</p>
<p>Ms. Hughes, a tall, commanding presence who is known for putting a positive spin on the most dire events,   will have an onerous task ahead of her at the State Department.</p>

<p>Although spreading demands for self-determination and elections in Iraq, the Palestinian territories and Afghanistan have appeared to bolster Mr. Bush's calls for democracy in the Middle East, Ms. Hughes will still face changing the perceptions of a region where many view the United States with contempt. She is also expected to revamp many of the public relations efforts  that were criticized in Mr. Bush's first term.</p>
<p>In the fall of 2003, for example, a special report prepared by a panel led by Edward P. Djerejian, a former ambassador to Syria and now director of the James A. Baker III Institute for  Public Policy at Rice University in Houston,  urged a complete overhaul of American public relations efforts in the Muslim and Arab worlds.</p>
<p>"Hostility toward America has reached shocking levels," the report said. "What is required is not merely tactical adaptation but strategic and radical transformation."</p>
<p>Last September, a Defense Science Board task force reporting to Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld came to a similar conclusion and called for a "swift and sustained presidential direction" to solve the problem.</p>
<p>But some senior State Department officials say that the problem is American policy, not inadequate public relations, and that no amount of marketing will changes minds in the Muslim world about the war in Iraq or American support of Israel.</p>
