The claim by Lester Friedlander, a former USDA inspector fired in 1995, came as the Canadian Broadcasting Company (CBC) aired video Wednesday of a cow stricken by the deadly illness that they say belonged to a US herd and was taken in 1997.

<P>US officials have denied all the charges.

<P>Three cases of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) have been discovered in Canada since 2003, prompting the United States, Japan and a number of other nations to ban or restrict imports of Canadian beef products and cattle.

<P>The scare cost Canadian beef farmers billions of dollars.

<P>Canada in turn banned certain meats and livestock from the United States in December 2003 following the discovery of a US case of mad cow disease.

<P>Friedlander testified in Parliament on Tuesday that USDA veterinarians sent samples of brain tissue of cattle suspected of being stricken with mad cow disease to private laboratories.

<P>He claims the labs confirmed the illness, but that USDA officials ran their own tests on the same samples and said they came back negative.

<P>Friedlander said he was fired while employed as a chief inspector at a meat packing plant in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for criticizing what he describes as the USDA's "unsafe practices."

<P>He said he was willing to take a lie detector test to help confirm his testimony.

<P>On Monday, Canadian cattle ranchers filed a class action lawsuit against Canadian authorities worth seven billion dollars (5.74 billion US dollars) charging negligence and incompetence in controlling the mad cow outbreak.
