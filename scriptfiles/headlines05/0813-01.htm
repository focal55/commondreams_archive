<p>JERUSALEM - President Bush said on Israeli 
television he could consider using force as a last resort to 
press Iran to give up its nuclear programme.</p><p>

"All options are on the table," Bush, speaking at his ranch 
in Crawford, Texas, said in the interview broadcast on 
Saturday.</p><p>
Asked if that included the use of force, Bush replied: "As 
I say, all options are on the table. The use of force is the 
last option for any president and you know, we've used force in 
the recent past to secure our country."</p><p>
Iran angered the European Union and the United States by 
resuming uranium conversion at the Isfahan plant last Monday 
after rejecting an EU offer of political and economic 
incentives in return for giving up its nuclear programme.</p><p>
Tehran says it aims only to produce electricity and denies 
Western accusations it is seeking a nuclear bomb.</p><p>
Bush made clear he still hoped for a diplomatic solution, 
noting that EU powers Britain, Germany and France had taken the 
lead in dealing with Iran.</p><p>
Washington last week expressed a willingness to give 
negotiations on Iran's suspected nuclear weapons program more 
time before getting tougher with the country.</p><p>
"In all these instances we want diplomacy to work and so 
we're working feverishly on the diplomatic route and we'll see 
if we're successful or not," Bush told state-owned Israel 
Channel One television.</p><p>
Bush has also previously said that the United States has 
not ruled out the possibility of military strikes. But U.S. 
officials have played down media speculation earlier this year 
they were planning military action against Iran.</p><p>
French Foreign Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy said on 
Friday that negotiations were still possible with Iran on 
condition the Iranians suspend their nuclear activities.</p><p>
The governing board of the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA) unanimously called on Iran on Thursday to halt 
sensitive atomic work.</p><p>
Douste-Blazy said the next step would be on September 3 
when IAEA chief Mohamed ElBaradei reports on Iran's activities.</p><p>
If Iran continues to defy global demands, another IAEA 
meeting will likely be held, where both Europe and Washington 
will push for a referral to the U.N. Security Council for 
possible sanctions.</p><center>
