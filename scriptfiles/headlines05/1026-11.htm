</table>U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald met with grand jurors for
about three hours at the federal courthouse in Washington. He made
no statement as he left and refused to respond when reporters
asked if he is seeking an extension of the grand jury term, which
expires in two days.          </p>
       <p> The grand jury was empanelled to investigate whether anyone
in President George W. Bush&#39;s administration disclosed the
identity of covert operative Valerie Plame after her husband,
former ambassador Joseph Wilson, publicly questioned whether the
administration twisted intelligence to make the case for invading
Iraq.          </p>

       <p> Fitzgerald has been focusing on the actions of longtime Bush
adviser Karl Rove and I. Lewis Libby, Vice President Dick Cheney&#39;s
chief of staff, people familiar with the case have said.          </p>
       <p> White House spokesman Scott McClellan repeated past refusals
to comment on the case. ``Everybody&#39;s focused on the priorities of
the American people,&#39;&#39; McClellan told reporters today. He added,
though, that White House aides ``are following developments in the
news.&#39;&#39;          </p>
       <p> The investigation may be nearing an end after two years.          </p>

       <p> <b>`11th Hour&#39; </b> </p>
       <p> ``We are now in the 11th minute of the 11th hour,&#39;&#39; said
criminal defense lawyer J. Bradley Bennett, who has no direct
involvement in the case. ``All the indications are that we will
still hear something by Friday.&#39;&#39;          </p>
       <p> Bennett, a partner at the Baker Botts law firm in Washington,
said Fitzgerald still has several options, including extending the
grand jury, empanelling a new one or bringing indictments and
filing them under seal.          </p>
       <p> Fitzgerald met with Thomas Hogan, chief judge for the federal
district courts in Washington, for about 45 minutes around midday,
said court spokesman Sheldon Snook. While Snook declined to say
what they discussed, Fitzgerald would need Hogan&#39;s approval to
extend the grand jury.          </p>

       <p> Federal Bureau of Investigation agents were conducting
interviews in the case as late as two days ago, the Washington
Post reported today. The agents sought out Plame&#39;s neighbors in
Washington to ask whether they knew she worked at the Central
Intelligence Agency. That suggests the prosecutor may be seeking
to show Plame&#39;s employment was covert, the newspaper said.          </p>
       <p> The investigation also has ensnared Cheney. Libby&#39;s notes
show he learned about Plame&#39;s CIA connection a month before she
was publicly identified by syndicated columnist Robert Novak on
July 14, 2003, the New York Times reported Oct. 24.          </p>
       <p> <b>Questioning </b> </p>
       <p> Bush and Cheney have been questioned by investigators in
sessions held in their offices. Rove has made four appearances
before the grand jury and Libby has testified twice.          </p>

       <p> As many as two dozen current or former administration
officials also have been questioned, either by investigators
working for Fitzgerald or before the grand jury, according to
lawyers familiar with the case and published reports. Among them
were former White House spokesman Ari Fleischer and Bush adviser
Karen Hughes. In addition, Fitzgerald has sought information from
at least a half dozen reporters, including NBC&#39;s Tim Russert,
Matthew Cooper of Time magazine and Judith Miller of the New York
Times.          </p>
       <p> <b>Triggering the Probe </b> </p>
       <p> The investigation was triggered when the CIA asked the
Justice Department to look into the matter after Novak&#39;s column
was published. A 1982 law makes it illegal for a person with
access to classified information to knowingly reveal the identity
of a covert agent. Fitzgerald, the U.S. attorney in Chicago, was
appointed as special counsel in December 2003 to avoid potential
conflicts of interest between political appointees in Justice and
the White House.          </p>
       <p> Democrats sought to increase pressure on the Bush
administration, which would face a disruption of its agenda if any
White House aides are indicted.          </p>

       <p> Senator Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat, said he sent a
letter to the White House yesterday calling on President George W.
Bush to declare, before Fitzgerald announces any action, that he
will suspend any aides who may be charged.          </p>
       <p> ``I believe the president should set a standard should
indictments be issued by prosecutor Fitzgerald,&#39;&#39; Schumer said.
 He said the White House has not responded to his suggestion.          </p>
       <p> Bush said in July he would fire any member of his
administration who ``committed a crime.&#39;&#39;          </p>
