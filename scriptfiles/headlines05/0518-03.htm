<p>The owner of Hardin County&#039;s two movie theaters is refusing to show the nation&#039;s top-grossing movie.</p>
<p>Like many veterans, Ike Boutwell has an issue with &quot;Monster-in-Law&quot; star Jane Fonda. On the ticket window at the Elizabethtown Movie Palace is a sign that tells movie goers the cinema will not show the film because of what she did in Vietnam. Below the message are pictures of Fonda clapping with a North Vietnamese anti-aircraft crew in 1972.</p>

   Ike Boutwell, owner of Movie Palace in Elizabethtown and Showtime Cinemas in Radcliff, explains to Mike Carwile why he is refusing to show Jane Fonda's lastest movie, &quot;Monster in-Law,&quot; at his theaters. Boutwell posted signs saying Fonda's Vietnam War-era activities led to his decision. (N-E Photo/Forrest Berkshire) <br>

The sign on the marquee outside Showtime Cinemas in Radcliff reads: &quot;No Jane Fonda movie in this theater.&quot;</p>
<p>More than 30 years after the war&#039;s end, Boutwell still bears a grudge.</p>
<p>&quot;I trained a lot of pilots during the Vietnam conflict,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Some of his students died from rounds fired from guns like the one Fonda visited during her anti-war trip.</p>
<p>&quot;I think when people do something, they need to be held responsible for their actions,&quot; he said. &quot;When you give the enemy aid, it makes the war last longer.&quot;</p>
<p>He also refused to show Michael Moore&#039;s controversial &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; and has banned Fonda movies from his theater in the past. Fonda&#039;s last movie was 1990&#039;s &quot;Stanley & Iris.&quot;</p>
<p>Boutwell&#039;s stance against her latest movie means he&#039;s taking a financial hit. &quot;Monster-in-Law&quot; was last weekend&#039;s top-grossing movie, bringing in more than &#036;23 million at 3,424 locations nationwide, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. and Nielsen EDI Inc.</p>
<p>The film is a romantic comedy about a mom who tries to wreck her son&#039;s relationship.</p>
<p>Amy Haire, who works the ticket booth of the Elizabethtown theater, has received mixed reaction to Boutwell&#039;s decision.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of the older gentlemen thought it was great,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>She got bad looks, though, from some girls and young women who wanted to see the film. She would point to the pictures and tell them it&#039;s the owner&#039;s discretion not to show it.</p>
<p>Joe Kinney, of Radcliff, said the theater should show the movie and let customers make up their minds about whether to see it. However, he said he isn&#039;t a fan of Fonda for political reasons.</p>
<p>Despite a few negative comments, Boutwell received mostly positive feedback.</p>
<p>One Elizabethtown man made a special trip to the theater Monday to thank him.</p>
<p>&quot;I think Vietnam veterans appreciate this,&quot; said Sal Mancuso, who fought in the Mekong Delta during the Vietnam war. He thinks Fonda should be in prison for treason.</p>
<p>Asked about her belated apology for posing in the anti-aircraft pictures, Mancuso laughed. &quot;There is no defense for what she did,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Spc. Mike Carwile, who is with a National Guard medical detachment, said he wasn&#039;t even a twinkle in his father&#039;s eye when Fonda visited Vietnam.</p>
<p>The 22-year-old learned about her Vietnam War-era activities when he saw the notice outside the theater Monday. He supported Boutwell&#039;s decision.</p>
<p>&quot;I think everyone&#039;s responsible for what they do,&quot; he said.</p>
