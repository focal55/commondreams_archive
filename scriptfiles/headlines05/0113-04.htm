      <P>WASHINGTON -- Twenty-two gay and lesbian rights groups, smarting in the 
        aftermath of the November election and bracing for President Bush's second 
        inaugural, issued a unity statement Wednesday insisting they are not backing 
        off marriage equality but will simultaneously push for other "common priorities." 
      <P>These include hate crimes legislation, employment protection, immigration rights for gays and lesbian partners, overturning the ban on gays in the military and continuing battle against constitutional bans on same-sex marriage in states and Congress.

<P>The voting in the fall recorded a sweep of same-sex marriage bans in 11 states and the election of Bush, who supports a federal constitutional ban.

<P>The stunning setbacks to gay rights led to considerable soul-searching and disarray among the advocacy groups, including the exit of Cheryl Jacques as president of the nation's most prominent gay rights organization, the Human Rights Campaign.

<P>Several leaders of the groups called the statement unprecedented, given the back-biting and cross purposes that have often characterized their past relations.

<P>"We recognize that to get this on course and get the bulk of the work done over the next 10 to 15 years -- and not stretch it out over the next 50 -- we need greater teamwork," said Patrick Guerriero, executive director of the Log Cabin Republicans, one of the groups that joined the statement.

<P>Kate Kendell, executive director of the National Center for Lesbian Rights in San Francisco, agreed.

<P>"We all understand that this is a particularly perilous but also enormously exhilarating time," Kendell said, "and in order to lessen the peril and capitalize on the opportunities, there has to be some cohesion, a sense of shared purpose and a commitment to a strategy moving forward that really has as its core full justice and end to oppression of lesbians and gay men in this country."

<P>With values emerging as a concern among voters in exit polls -- the methodology later produced skepticism about the result -- many in the movement questioned whether the push for marriage equality came too fast, and whether more attention should be paid to votes in the "red states" dominated by Republican election victories.

<P>The statement -- signed by Lambda Legal, Gay and Lesbian Advocates and Defenders, the Human Rights Campaign, the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, Log Cabin Republicans, Stonewall Democrats, the National Center for Lesbian Rights and others -- maintains that American civil rights movements have historically proceeded through a "complex interweaving of legal victories, political progress and advances in public opinion."

<P>Noting that only 18 months have elapsed since the U.S. Supreme Court decriminalized homosexuality, a little more than a year since the Massachusetts high court created the nation's first same-sex marriage rights, and weeks since California passed a sweeping domestic partnership law, the groups said, "We have every reason to be optimistic."

<P>The statement includes an excerpt from a People magazine interview with the president and Laura Bush, in which Bush said gay couples joined in a civil union "of course" are as much a family as his own.

<P>Still, the renewed focus on more practical matters after a year in which marriage equality grabbed the national spotlight and became a central focus of a presidential election campaign, indicates a retrenchment, said University of Pennsylvania analyst Nathaniel Persily.

<P>"It is quite clear that most Americans attach a certain significance to the word marriage, such that it eclipsed some of their otherwise egalitarian feelings toward gays," Persily said.

<P>Hospital visitation and inheritance rights, by contrast, do not seem to be eclipsed. "The decision to move one step at a time and focus on other areas is a smart strategic choice on their part," Persily said. "We find on most questions of equal rights, Americans are willing to make sure that gays are treated equally with heterosexuals, but when it comes to marriage, people just have an emotional, visceral reaction."

<P>Matt Foreman, executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, said lesbians and gays face as many as 15 new state constitutional amendments, as well as a renewed push for an amendment in the U.S. Constitution to ban same-sex marriage.

<P>An effort last year failed to get even a Senate majority, though it requires two-thirds approval, but advocates say they'll renew their effort. Religious conservatives said the Federal Marriage Amendment remains a priority.

<P>Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, a conservative group leading the fight against same-sex marriage, said, "I certainly would agree with their assessment that not all is lost for them. That's why it remains critical to get an amendment to the U.S. Constitution. They are certainly holding out great hopes that it is just a matter of time before a federal judge overturns a state constitutional amendment or the federal Defense of Marriage Act."

<P>Perkins said gay activists "realize that their initiatives are out of sync with the American people, so they're going to try to put a different spin on their approach." <p align="center">Copyright &copy; 2005 San Francisco Chronicle</p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable --></font></td></tr>
