<p>CARL'S CORNER, TX  -   Musician Willie Nelson spent the Independence Day weekend expanding his chain of biodiesel fueling stations to the truck stop Carl's Corner along Interstate 35.

<p>Carl's Corner now offers “BioWillie,” the singer’s unique brand of B20, a fuel made of 20 percent biodiesel and 80 percent petroleum diesel. It is supplied to filling stations by Willie Nelson Biodiesel, founded by the musician.

<p>In Texas, Carl’s Corner is not only the name of the city, but also the truck stop of the July 3 biodiesel celebration, which included amusements such as a chili cook-off and concert by Nelson.<p>

“The response from my trucker customers so far has been phenomenal,” said Carl Cornelius, co-owner Carl’s Corner. “Almost everybody who’s used it has been totally satisfied. I’m learning from truckers they find better mileage, smoother performance, more power. They’re pretty excited. Everybody ought to get on this bandwagon.”

<p>During the Texas event, the National Biodiesel Board presented Cornelius with the Biodiesel Pioneer Award for his commitment to bringing biodiesel to truckers.<p>

Nelson intends to establish a chain of BioWillie stations throughout the southeastern United States. "Biodiesel is the future,” he said.

<p>Company representatives say future plans include truck stops carrying the B20 along the east coast from Miami, Florida up to Rochester, New York.

<p>Nelson and Peter Bell, of biodiesel supplier Distribution Drive formed Willie Nelson Biodiesel with three other partners in December 2004.
