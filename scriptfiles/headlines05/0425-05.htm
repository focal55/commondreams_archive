<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p>Hundreds of thousands of Mexicans marched in silence yesterday in support of their mayor, who may be prevented from running for president by a court case that many see as politically motivated.

<P>Mexico City's leftwing mayor, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, is accused by the attorney general's office of failing to comply with a court order to halt the construction of a slip road. The case has been held up by a legal hitch but prosecutors say they are pressing ahead with it.

<P>Indictment of Mr López Obrador, the frontrunner in next year's presidential poll, would prohibit him from running for office for the duration of the trial, expected to last at least a year. His Party of the Democratic Revolution has no electable alternative candidate.

<P>The threatened elimination of the most popular politician from the presidential race on a legal technicality - the road was not built - has created the biggest political crisis in Mexico since the collapse of one-party rule five years ago.

<P>President Vicente Fox - who defeated the old regime in the first fully fair elections in 2000 - and his National Action party have allied themselves with their former foes, the once almighty Party of the Institutional Revolution, to pursue the case against the mayor.

<P>Earlier this month the two parties voted in parliament to strip him of his immunity from prosecution. Since then, the case has descended into legal confusion with snatches of farce. Last week, members of Mr Fox's party made a £100 bail payment for Mr López Obrador, who responded furiously and filed an appeal, insisting he wanted to fight his legal and political battles from behind bars. The government would like to avoid such television coverage.

<P>Mr López Obrador's opponents insist they are trying to uphold the principle that nobody should be above the law. But few are convinced by this line of reasoning.

<P>Mexico is awash with current and former politicians at no apparent risk of prosecution despite being associated with corruption, drug trafficking and a dirty war against leftists in the 1970s.

<P>Most Mexicans view the legal action as a way of taking the popular mayor off the presidential ballot. Many also see it as an attack on the credibility of Mexico's new democracy.

<P>"This is a very dangerous time. Transitions to democracy are always at risk early on and this is happening here," said a political analyst, Lorenzo Meyer.

<P>Yesterday's "march of silence" recalled a 1968 student demonstration of the same name which took place a few weeks before a massacre of students which crushed the pro-democracy movement.

<P>Mr López Obrador's critics call him an economically irresponsible populist akin to the rabble-rousing president of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez.

<P>However, he is the first Mexican leftist to look like a winner for many years, and his rise in popularity has come at a time when Latin America as a whole is moving leftwards.
