<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p> They are getting restless at Fort Hood. The flight from Iraq should have arrived mid-afternoon, but there is a delay and it is now getting dark.

<P>But they have already waited for a year - they can stretch it out for another few hours.

<P>Then the moment that every soldier, and every family dreams of - the return from war unharmed.

<P>But it is the injuries you cannot see that are beginning to worry the Pentagon.

<P>"My nightmares are so intense I woke up one night with my hands round my fiancee's throat," says Lt Julian Goodrum.

<P><b><i>'A suicidal wreck'
</i></b>
<P>"Another night she woke me up. I was really kicking and really getting violent in my sleep.

<P>"So now I sleep on the couch until I can get my sleep, my nightmares, more under control."

<P>Lt Goodrum is a veteran of two Gulf wars. He returned from the first a hero, from the second a suicidal wreck.

<P>He suffers from <a href="http://www.mentalhealth.com/dis/p20-an06.html" target="_new">Post-Traumatic Stress disorder</a> (PTSD) and he is not alone.

<P>More than 10,000 returnees from the Iraq war have sought help for a condition in which the mundane becomes a menace.

<P>"The smell of diesel takes me back to Iraq," Lt Goodrum says.

<P>"I am getting better with crowds, but still if it is a very confined space and I am totally surrounded I have issues with that.

<P>"When I am in crowds I tend to watch people's hands."

<P><b><i>Unseen consequences</i></b>

<P>It is the nature of Iraq's insurgency of unseen snipers and roadside bombers which has fuelled the trauma.

<P>And so the Pentagon has gone to an unlikely source for help: video games, designed in Atlanta to recall the streets of Falluja and thus exorcise the ghost of war.

<P>Ken Grapp, CEO of Virtually Better - a company that creates virtual reality environments to help treat anxiety disorders, says: "It can be totally debilitating to where a person would rather choose suicide than choose to live.

<P>"Persons with PTSD may go back to the streets of Falluja every day in their own minds.

<P>"We are just providing a shared experience where therapists can work with the person and have a better understanding of where they were, and help them process that information."

<P>The Pentagon says it is taking PTSD seriously.

<P>But Lt Goodrum and many other veterans disagree bitterly. It is the epidemic that dare not speak its name.

<P>"For the majority of people - especially military - it is easier to accept and understand a physical injury than a psychological one," Lt Goodrum said.

<P>These are the unseen consequences of a war that will change lives long after the last bullet has been fired and the last soldier has returned home.
