<p>PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti   - Authorities have again arrested a fiery priest whose sermons on social justice electrify worshippers who see him as Haiti's future president, supporters and the lawyer of the Rev. Gerard Jean-Juste said Friday.
<P>
They said the priest, a supporter of ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, was arrested Friday at Port-au-Prince airport as he returned home from Miami, where he led a protest against the interim government and U.N. peacekeeping force installed after Aristide fled a rebellion in February 2004.
<P>
Local radio stations interrupted nighttime music programs to report on the alleged detention of the Roman Catholic priest, though there were scant details.
<P>
"I don't know if he was arrested," Cabinet chief Michel Brunache told The Associated Press.
<P>
Police refused to confirm or deny that they were holding Jean-Juste.
<P>

The priest's American lawyer, Bill Quigley, said in an electronic message that parishioners had called to say they went to Port-au-Prince airport to meet Jean-Juste "but he never came out of the airport.
<P>
"They waited and waited, but were just told that Fr. Gerry was taken to a police station - they do not know where just yet," said Quigley's message.
<P>
It said the detention might be connected to a broadcast from Miami's anti-Aristide Radio Madoken, which it said on Friday broadcast a report claiming Jean-Juste was returning to Haiti armed with a suitcase full of money provided by Aristide for him to buy weapons and mercenaries. The radio station allegedly urged Haitian authorities to arrest the priest and "exercise a tight control ... as Gerard Jean-Juste is entering, is coming with that money from United States, as he'll enter Port-au-Prince, to lay paw on him."
<P>
Haiti's interim government earlier this year accused Jean-Juste of inciting violence and hiding pro-Aristide gunmen and jailed him for weeks before freeing him amid an international outcry that he be released if authorities could not produce evidence.
<P>
Hundreds of other Aristide militants and officials remain in detention for months, without charge or trial.
<P>
Quigley and other supporters urged "pro-democracy activists" to demand U.N. peacekeepers "safeguard the life and liberty" of Jean-Juste, saying he is in danger from Haitian police, especially some former soldiers from the rebellion who have been integrated into the police force.
<P>
The U.N. mission in Haiti could not immediately be reached for comment.
<P>
Jean-Juste and other Aristide supporters say they will not contest elections unless their leader is returned from exile in South Africa, but Jean-Juste admits countless admirers are urging him to run for president in November elections.
