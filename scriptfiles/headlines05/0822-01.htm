<p>PLACHIMADA, India  - In the end it was the 'generosity' of 
Coca-Cola in distributing cadmium-laden waste sludge as 'free 
fertilizer' to the tribal aborigines who live near the beverage giant's 
bottling plant in this remote Kerala village that proved to be its 
undoing. 
<br>
<br>
<b></b>
  On Friday, the Kerala State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) ordered the 
plant shut down to the jubilation of tribal leaders and green activists 
who had focused more on the 'water mining' activities of the plant 
rather than its production of toxic cadmium sludge.

''One way or another, this plant should be shut down and the management 
made to pay compensation for destroying our paddy fields, fooling us 
with fake fertilizer and drying out our wells,'' Paru Amma, an 
aboriginal woman who lives in this once lush, water-abundant area, told 
IPS. 
<br>
<br>
Chairman of the KSPCB, G. Rajmohan, said the closure was ordered because 
the plant ''does not have adequate waste treatment systems and toxic 
products from the plant were affecting drinking water in nearby 
villages'' and that the plant ''has also not provided drinking water in 
a satisfying manner to local residents''. 
<br>
<br>
Apparently, the generosity of the Coca-Cola plant was limited to 
distributing sludge and waste water free and did not extend to providing 
drinking water to people seriously affected by its operations. 

<br>
<br>
In a statement Saturday, Coca-Cola said it was ''reviewing the order 
passed by the chairman of the Pollution Control Board, Kerala state,'' 
and that ''going forward, we are in the process of evaluating future 
steps, including a judicial review''. 
<br>
<br>
The KSPCB closure order is only the latest episode in a see-saw battle 
between Coca-Cola and the impoverished but plucky local residents ever 
since the Atlanta-based company began operating its 25 million-dollar 
bottling plant in this village, located in the state's fertile Palakkad 
district, in 2001. 
<br>
<br>
Along the way, pollution control authorities, political parties, the 
judiciary and global environmental groups, starting with Greenpeace 
International, became involved in the dispute and Plachimada grew into a 
global symbol of resistance by local people to powerful trans-national 
corporations trying to snatch away their water rights. 
<br>
<br>
Although the local people had begun protesting against their wells 
running dry months after the plant began operations, serious trouble for 
the company began a little more than two years ago when a local doctor 
declared the water still available in the wells unfit for consumption. 
<br>
<br>
In July 2003, a BBC Radio-4 report, after carrying out tests at the 
University of Exeter in Britain, pronounced the sludge as dangerously 
laden with heavy metals, especially cadmium and lead and already 
contaminating the food chain. The sludge also had no value as 
fertilizer, the report said. 
<br>
<br>
Cadmium is a known carcinogen which causes kidney damage while exposure 
to lead can lead to mental derangement and death and is particularly 
dangerous for children causing them severe anemia and mental 
retardation. 
<br>
<br>
The BBC report quoted Prof. John Henry, leading toxic expert and 
consultant at St Mary's Hospital in London, warn of ''devastating 
consequences for those living near areas where this waste has been 
dumped and for the thousands who depend on crops produced in these 
(paddy) fields''. 
<br>
<br>
In August 2003, the KSPCB, ordered the plant to stop distributing sludge 
to farmers, but then its official, K.V. Indulal, charged with carrying 
out investigations, unexpectedly announced that he found contamination 
levels ''not beyond tolerable limits''. 
<br>
<br>

Allegations of bribery and corruption by Coca-Cola followed and the 
official Indulal is presently under investigation by the state's Anti-
corruption Bureau which carried out raids on his residence and 
properties spread across three Kerala cities earlier this month. 
<br>
<br>
The Kerala High Court initially supported the Plachimada villagers and 
in a Dec.16, 2003 ruling, ordered Coca-Cola not to mine water through 
its deep bore wells but allowed the plant to draw water in amounts 
comparable to that normally used for agricultural or domestic purposes 
in the area. 
<br>
<br>
Coca-Cola approached the court after the panchayat (elected local body) 
cancelled the plant's operating licence for mining water and a single 
judge ruled that the state government had no right to allow a private 
party to extract large quantities of ground water which it 
deemed ''property held by it (the government) in trust''. 
<br>
<br>
But on Apr. 7 this year, a High Court bench allowed the plant to extract 
up to 500,000 liters of water a day saying that existing laws on water 
ownership were inadequate. The ruling angered activists and triggered 
off a series of clashes outside the gates of the plant between agitating 
local people and police. 
<br>
<br>
''The High Court ruling is a great disappointment to everyone concerned 
with Coke's abusive practices around the world,'' said Corporate 
Accountability International's executive director Kathryn Mulvey in a 
statement. 
<br>
<br>
Mulvey predicted that resistance to Coke's practices in Plachimada and 
throughout India would only grow. ''We join with community leaders and 
allies around the world in calling on Coke to close the Plachimada 
facility permanently, and to pay back the community for the damage it 
has caused,'' she said. 
<br>
<br>
Nevertheless, on the strength of the court ruling, the plant resumed 
what were described as 'trial operations' on Aug. 8 after the 561,000-
liter capacity plant that manufactures such brands as Coca-Cola, Limca 
and Fanta had lain shut for 17 months. 
<br>
<br>
Barely ten days later, on Friday, the KSPCB stepped in with its closure 
order for inability to explain the high cadmium levels and for failing 
to provide piped drinking water to people, whose wells had become 
contaminated, as required by the body. 
<br>
<br>
Internationally-known environmental scientist and activist, Vandana 
Shiva, who leads the New Delhi-based, Research Foundation for Science, 
Technology and Ecology, has alleged that after Coca-Cola was restrained 
from dumping sludge or distributing it as fertilizer, it had begun 
injecting waste into dry boreholes and contaminating deep-water 
aquifers. 

<br>
<br>
It has not helped Coca-Cola that the discovery of heavy metal in the 
sludge in 2003 followed findings by the Center for Science and 
Environment (CSE), another well-known, New Delhi-based non-governmental 
organization, that nearly all colas and 'mineral water' produced in 
India contained unacceptably large doses of commonly-used pesticides. 
<br>
<br>
The CSE findings seriously dented the image of Coke and its rival Pepsi, 
both of which were banned by nationalist governments for decades in 
India and allowed to return only when this country began a process of 
economic reforms following a serious balance of payments crisis in 1991. 
<br>
<br>
Said Veerendrakumar, member of parliament and editor of the 
influential 'Mathrubhumi' newspaper: ''The fact of the matter is that 
that water from underground sources is being pumped out free, bottled 
and sold to our people to make millions for cola companies while 
destroying the environment and damaging public health''. 
<br>
<br>
''We welcome the order shutting the factory down,'' said R. Ajayan of 
the Plachimada Solidarity Committee, which was largely responsible for 
approaching the KSPCB. ''We have to continue to work with the state 
government to ensure that Coca-Cola abides by the order and that there 
are no more violations''. 
<br>
<br>
Coca-Cola is already in deep trouble in India, its sales having dropped 
14 percent in the last quarter (April-June), and the company is 
presently undergoing major reorganization and changing its top 
leadership in an effort to stem plummeting popularity. 
<br>
<br>
The state government has announced that it will also challenge in the 
Supreme Court Coca-Cola's claim to extract water taking advantage of the 
fact that existing laws on who owns groundwater are vague. 
<br>
<br>
''We welcome the actions by the state agencies in Kerala to stop the 
arrogance and criminal activities of the Coca-Cola company,'' said Amit 
Srivastava of the India Resource Center, an international 
campaigner. ''These actions are major victories for the community of 
Plachimada, which has all along been demanding that the state do what it 
is supposed to do - safeguard the interests of the community''. 
<br>
<br>
Sunita Narain, who led the CSE's high-profile investigation and exposure 
of the presence of pesticides in colas manufactured in India, said the 
real value of the Plachimada struggle lies in the fact that it has 
highlighted the role that local communities can have in protecting 
groundwater resources. 
<br>
<br>

In January 2004, the agitating villagers received a boost when global 
activists converged on Plachimada for a three-day World Water Conference 
and joined in demonstrations in front of the main gate of the Coca-Cola 
plant, one of the largest in its chain of 27 plants in India. 
<br>
<br>
Jose Bove, who leads 'Confederation Paysanne' (a left-leaning union of 
peasants and farmers in France), declared that the struggle at 
Plachimada was '' part of the worldwide struggle against trans-national 
companies that exploit natural resources like water''. 
<br>
<br>
Bove was joined by Maude Barlow, the Ottawa-based author of 'Blue Gold', 
a book on corporate theft of water resources, in pledging to turn 
Plachimada into another Cochabamba -- the city in Bolivia where people- 
power thwarted plans to turn the water supply system over to the U.S. 
transnational Bechtel five years ago. 
<br>
<br>
The question of toxic materials in the sludge distributed to farmers by 
the Coca-Cola factory as fertilizer was also highlighted, among others, 
by Inger Schorling, a delegate from Sweden and a green member of the 
European Parliament. 
<br>
<br>
A 'Plachimada Declaration' adopted at the end of the conference asserted 
that people everywhere should ''resist all criminal attempts to market, 
privatize and corporatize water''.
