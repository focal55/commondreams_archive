<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->ST. PAUL - A year after Mayor Randy Kelly publicly backed President Bush for re-election, voters here showed they hadn't forgotten - and weren't in a forgiving mood.
<p>Residents of this heavily Democratic city ousted Kelly, electing fellow Democrat and former Council member Chris Coleman by a 70 percent to 30 percent margin.
<p>Kelly conceded a half-hour after polls closed, acknowledging later that his decision to back the Republican president led to his defeat.
<p>"I assumed people would have taken a look at our record," Kelly said in an interview. He added that the outcome "certainly does not encourage any politician to be courageous and look to work across party lines."
<p>No sitting St. Paul mayor had lost a campaign since 1972. Kelly had a personal election streak that spanned nearly as long, covering his quarter-century in the Legislature and single term as mayor.
<p>Kelly found it impossible to change the topic in the campaign's final weeks. He tried to tout his record of adding affordable housing while keeping property taxes steady, and the mayor sought to paint Coleman as a tax-raiser beholden to public employee unions.
<p>"It may sound silly, but Kelly was for Bush and I'm not," said retiree Audrey Guith after casting her vote for Coleman.
<p>Though Coleman had seized on the endorsement in his campaign, he downplayed its role in the victory. "This race has never been about George Bush," he told cheering supporters.
<p>He was just as jubilant.
<p>"I just can't even tell you how good winning feels," he said. "We Democrats forget that every once in a while."
<p>Minneapolis also chose a mayor, with incumbent R.T. Rybak cruising to a second term _ by a 61 percent to 37 percent margin _ over Hennepin County Commissioner Peter McLaughlin, a fellow Democrat.
<p>Like Minneapolis, St. Paul's bigger and better-known neighbor, Democrats largely outnumber Republicans and control all aspects of city government even though the offices are technically nonpartisan.
<p>Political experts were astounded by how prominently the 2004 election figured into this fall's race. Most other issues took a backseat; a Star Tribune of Minneapolis poll released Sunday showed that nearly two-thirds of voters considered the endorsement important in their decision.
<p>It drove plumber Daniel Doyle to pick Coleman over Kelly, whom he supported in 2001. Doyle said he was happy with the direction of the city, but not the mayor.
<p>"That weighed me down when he was backing the president. He lost my vote," Doyle said. "I don't know whether he is going to sway to the Republican side."
<p>McRae Anderson, a city resident for 36 years, stuck with Kelly. He said the Bush endorsement didn't bother him because he voted for Bush himself. Anderson said he was disappointed that so many other people were influenced by that one event.
<p>"He's done a good job. They ought to see what he's done for the city," he said.
