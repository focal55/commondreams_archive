        <!--/endimage/-->The man, who asked to simply go by the name Elvis, said this is his fourth weekend standing on  street corners. He spent two weekends on the corner of Garland Avenue and North Street. </p><p> "Usually," he said, "we have a lot more people come out." </p>

<p>But numbers aren’t the important thing, according to Dick Bennett, president of the <a href="http://www.omnicenter.org/" target="_new">OMNI Center for Peace, Justice, and Ecology</a>. The  OMNI Center is sponsoring the anti-war protests each Sunday.  "It’s our position that’s important," Bennett said.  "We support getting out of Iraq in a careful way," he said. "Terrorism arrives almost entirely by those people’s desire to get us out of their countries." </p>

<p>Retired University of Arkansas Physics Professor Art Hobson comes to protest every Sunday.  "I think we’ve made the  wrong decision," he said. "It was foolish to go in there, it made terrorism worse and it made Iraq worse." </p>

<p>Hobson said he was protesting the decision to go to war before the U.S. went in to Iraq. At that time, he said, about 50 percent of people were on our side and 50 percent were very unfriendly.  "They’re all friendly this time," he said. "The polls show it, so it’s not surprising, but you can see it on the street, the reaction is that we  ought to get our troops out of there." </p>

<p>Hobson and Bennett, also a retired University of Arkansas professor, both protested against the Vietnam war and agree that the same language is being used in support of the Iraq war.  "They’re saying the same things: ‘We will be victorious if we just maintain our resolve,’ and ‘There is a light at the end of the tunnel,’ but the slaughter continues," Bennett said. "It took us 10  years to get out of that war."  "Elvis," who has committed to standing on the corner with his sign for one hour, each Sunday, said he believes there are a lot of questions that need to be answered. "Like why we even went in the first place," he said. "I hope to talk with people passing by in a civil manner." </p>

<p>He said he chose the Elvis persona in order to get people’s attention.  "To get your message  across, you have to find something like I’m doing," he said. "I think people appreciate my attempt to entertain them." </p>

<p>If honking horns are a sign of appreciation, then Elvis is right. Every fourth or fifth car sounds their horn, some give a thumbs up, and everybody looks to see what his sign says.  "Asking this question is important," he said. "I’m not preaching, I’m asking people to think for themselves." </p>
