<p>Thinking of parading on Fifth Avenue to celebrate Puerto Rican Day? No problem. Columbus Day? Step right up. What about the Norwegian-American 17th of May Parade? You're good to go.

<P>But if you want to organize a march that is entirely new - to celebrate, say, Iraqi independence or protest the war in that country - the city says you are not welcome anywhere on New York City's most famous parade venue.

<P>That is because the Police Department is enforcing a little-known regulation adopted four years ago that bans any parades on Fifth Avenue that were not permitted prior to July 2001.

<P>The regulation, which was adopted so quietly that even its advocates say they were unaware of it, states that future applications for parades will be denied "unless the parade was held at that location prior to the promulgation of these rules."

<P>The regulation surfaced in a lawsuit filed against the city by a group of antiwar demonstrators earlier this month. The group argues the ban violates its First Amendment right to be heard and seen along the same venerable route that over the years has accommodated abolitionists, suffragettes and Vietnam War protesters.

<P>The lawsuit, filed March 16 in United States District Court in Lower Manhattan, asks a judge to declare the rule unconstitutional.

<P>Jeffrey E. Fogel, a lawyer with the Center for Constitutional Rights, a civil rights advocacy group that is representing the protesters, said he had never heard of the regulation before the city invoked it to deny the protesters' request for a March 19 march down Fifth Avenue. The march, in opposition to the war in Iraq, was allowed to take place on a different route.

<P>"You can't just take a free-speech zone out of commission, as it were," Mr. Fogel said. "It's one thing to impose reasonable restrictions. It's another thing to say, from this day forward, nobody can march on Fifth Avenue."

<P>The city has yet to respond in court to the lawsuit. But Bloomberg administration officials defended the Fifth Avenue prohibition as a reasonable exercise of power that does not discriminate among future applicants (because it bans them all) and allows them to march elsewhere in Manhattan, sometimes just blocks away from their first venue choice.

<P>Gabriel Taussig, chief of administrative law for the city's Law Department, said the reason for the ban on any additional Fifth Avenue parades "is a pretty straightforward and simple one." "Fifth Avenue is the desired route for all sorts of parades, and during parade season it sees more than its fair share," he said. "The decision was made that it had reached the saturation point."

<P>Mr. Taussig said the Police Department was required to hold a public hearing prior to adopting the one-sentence prohibition in 2001, but it could not be determined yesterday when it was held or who, if anyone, showed up.

<P>That the regulation existed at all came as news to some Fifth Avenue business owners, who had long argued that crowds along the parade route kept customers away and sometimes led to increased litter, vandalism and other problems.

<P>Told of the regulation, Tom Cusick, president of the Fifth Avenue Business Improvement District, said that he was "a little surprised by it, frankly" but that he liked the idea of putting the brakes on any more parade permits. "We had had a long history of trying to curtail the number of parades on Fifth Avenue," he said. "Everybody wants to be on Fifth Avenue. If there was no end to it, and they just kept coming and coming and coming, we would have a serious financial problem."

<P>The change allows traditional cultural and civic celebrations that were in place before July 2001, like the Veterans Day, St. Patrick's Day and Hare Krishna parades, while derailing all subsequent plans for new marches. The latest applicant to be denied access to Fifth Avenue is the International Action Center, an antiwar group that filed the lawsuit.

<P>The center, founded by Ramsey Clark, the former United States attorney general, had applied for a permit to march from 110th Street to 102nd Street, where protesters would rally in Central Park before resuming their walk down Fifth Avenue to 79th Street. Citing the Fifth Avenue ban, the city forced them to move east to Park Avenue.

<P>In its lawsuit, the center said it planned to continue organizing protests in New York and would again "seek the use of part of Fifth Avenue for one or more of its marches."
