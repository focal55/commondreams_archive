<p>Israel describes it as a vital security barrier, while the UN says it's illegal. But as far as the guerrilla graffiti artist Banksy is concerned, the 425-mile long barrier that separates Israel from the Palestinian territories is a vast concrete canvas too tempting to resist.

The subversive dauber, who has terrorized galleries on both sides of the Atlantic and who last year installed a very sexed-up bronze spoof of the Old Bailey's statue of Justice in central London, has ventured further afield for his latest project.
<p>Packing his stencils and spray cans, he went to the Middle East to share his vision with those living on the Palestinian side. His visit is recorded in the nine stenciled pictures, some surreal, some poignant, he left on the gigantic barrier. His latest work was on his website yesterday, labeled "holiday snaps".
<p>Although the paintings themselves are not overtly political, his feelings about the wall are apparent from his statement: "The Israeli government is building a wall surrounding the occupied Palestinian territories. It stands three times the height of the Berlin Wall and will eventually run for over 700km - the distance from London to Zurich. The wall is illegal under international law and essentially turns Palestine into the world's largest open prison."
<p>But he concedes: "It also makes it the ultimate activity holiday destination for graffiti writers."
<p>One of the pictures shows two gleeful children with bucket and spade standing beneath a hole in the wall that opens on to a vista of a tropical paradise. In another, he has transformed the wall into a cosy sitting room complete with two enormous armchairs and a window that frames an alpine landscape.
<p>Other pictures show a little boy kneeling at the foot of a rope ladder that snakes to the top of the wall and the silhouette of a girl rising through the air clutching balloons.
<p>The barrier, which is made of concrete walls and razor-wire fences, has been cited as illegal by the UN, which has ordered it dismantled, though Israel says the wall protects it against suicide bombers.
<p>Jo Brooks, his spokeswoman, said there had been some hairy moments at the barrier. "The Israeli security forces did shoot in the air threateningly and there were quite a few guns pointed at him."
<p>Banksy also records on his website how an old Palestinian man said his painting made the wall look beautiful. Banksy thanked him, only to be told: "We don't want it to be beautiful, we hate this wall. Go home."
