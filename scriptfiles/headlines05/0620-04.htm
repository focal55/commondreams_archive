<p>In the wake of the failed EU summit in Brussels, Prime Minister Tony Blair was reported to be drafting a speech to the European parliament that aims to placate fears he favors US-style capitalism.</p>
<p>Before delivering his speech in Brussels on Thursday, Blair will address the House of Commons at 3:30 p.m. (1430 GMT) explaining the stand he took at the summit that collapsed in acrimony on Saturday.</p>
<p>The speech in Brussels aims to outline his vision for Europe before he takes over the six-month rotating presidency of the European Union from Luxembourg, which chaired the summit.</p>
<p>"Blair recognizes that he is caricatured in Europe as being free market. He will take on this idea that you have to choose between a social Europe and a market Europe," a senior Downing Street figure told the Financial Times (FT) on Monday.</p>
<p>He will refer to the minimum wage introduced in Britain, as well as plans to extend maternity and paternity leave as examples of how the two models can co-exist, the source told the FT.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Jean Claude Juncker of Luxembourg touched a chord when he spoke of two irreconcilable visions of Europe at the summit.</p>
<p>"There are those who, in fact without saying it, want the big market and nothing but the big market, a high-level free trade zone, and those that want a politically integrated Europe," he said. "I have felt for a long time this debate would blow up one day."</p>
<p>The two-day summit broke down when having rolled back the deadline to ratify the moribund EU constitution, EU leaders failed to agree the bloc's budget for 2007-13.</p>

<p>Many in Europe blamed Blair for the collapse over his refusal to give up Britain's long-cherished EU rebate without an iron-clad guarantee of a thorough re-think of the way the European Union spends its taxpayers' money.</p>
<p>Blair had taken aim at France's "own rebate," the subsidies contained in the Common Agriculture Policy that benefit French farmers the most.</p>
<p>The Guardian newspaper also quoted a source in Blair's Downing Street office as saying: "The prime minister will challenge the idea that Britain is some Dickensian society with no social protection."</p>
<p>Blair, in his speech in Brussels will make clear it is a "false choice" to promote a "market Europe" versus a "social Europe," according to the Downing Street source who spoke to the Guardian.</p>
<p>"We need an effective Europe, we need a social approach which boosts the economic approach. They work together," the source said.</p>
<p>In an interview with the Guardian, Peter Mandelson, British EU trade commissioner, said "Europe is faced with a fundamental choice. One way, we sink into economic decline, losing the means to pay for our preferred way of life.</p>
<p>"The other way, we press ahead with painful economic reforms that can make us competitive once again in world markets," said Mandelson, who is a Blair ally.</p>
<p>"A new consensus can be found in Europe. You don't have to know much about the political situation in France and Germany to realize that". </p>
