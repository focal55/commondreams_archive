<p>Behind the CIA leak scandal lies a bizarre trail of forged documents, an 
embassy break-in and international deception that helped propel the United

        </table>While American public attention focuses on special counsel Patrick 
Fitzgerald's investigation into the leak, U.S. and Italian lawmakers are 
probing a series of bogus claims of Iraqi uranium purchases in Africa that were 
the opening chapters in a saga that resulted in the disclosure of the identity 
of CIA officer Valerie Plame. 
<P>In the past week, the respected, left-of-center Italian daily La 
Repubblica published a three-part series of investigative articles claiming 
that documents purporting to prove that Saddam Hussein was seeking yellowcake 
uranium in Niger had been forged by an Italian freelance spy and then were fed 
by the Italian intelligence agency to eager officials in Washington and London. 
<P>On Capitol Hill, Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., the Senate Democratic leader, 
and Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., are asking for public hearings into the 
forgeries and their role in Bush administration claims that Hussein was 
developing nuclear weapons. 
<P>The Italian Parliament is scheduled to hold hearings about the La 
Repubblica allegations on Thursday, with intelligence chief Nicolo Pollari 
expected to come under heavy grilling. 
<P>The articles relied heavily on sources in the Italian spy agency, the 
Military Information and Security Service, known as SISMI. They provide a 
tantalizing account  --  credible to some observers, baseless speculation to 
others  --  of how President Bush and Prime Minister Tony Blair were snookered 
by fabricated intelligence about Hussein's alleged nuclear program. 
<P>The allegations in La Repubblica's articles lead far into the murky depths 
of Italy's intelligence agencies, a realm of conspiracy claims and 
counterclaims. In Italy this netherworld is called dietrologia  --  a word that 
loosely translates as the widespread belief that political, security and 
criminal forces are constantly engaged in secret plots and maneuvers, noted 
Henry Farrell, a professor of international affairs at George Washington 
University in Washington and a blogger on the Crooked Timber Web log, which has 
dissected the Italian angle to Plamegate.  
<P>"It's hard to say if (the La Repubblica information) is the truth, truth 
with some distortion, or misinformation from the officials who are leaking 
this," Farrell said. "But it certainly raises some very troubling questions." 
<P>Farrell noted that during the Cold War, the U.S. and Italian spy agencies 
cooperated closely on undercover work. Bush and Italian Prime Minister Silvio 
Berlusconi are close allies, and Berlusconi has strongly supported Bush's Iraq 
policy, stationing 3,000 Italian troops south of Baghdad. 
<P>SISMI has long been accused of involvement in rightist conspiracies, 
including work in collaboration with Propaganda Due, or P-2, a Masonic secret 
society, and the Armed Falange, a neo-fascist terrorist group. 
<P>SISMI "does not have an immaculate history at all," said Gianfranco 
Pasquino, a political science professor at the Bologna, Italy, campus of the 
School of Advanced and International Studies of Johns Hopkins University. "It 
has been purged and reorganized very often." 

<P>Pasquino called SISMI "friendly to the right wing and willing to offer its 
services for right-wing purposes." 
<P>According to La Repubblica, the forged documents were originally produced 
in 2000 by Rocco Martino, a former member of the Carabinieri paramilitary 
police who then became a freelance agent for both SISMI and French 
intelligence. SISMI combined these fakes with real documents from the 1980s 
showing Hussein's yellowcake purchases from Niger during that period  --  in 
the process, conducting a break-in at the Niger Embassy in Rome to steal 
letterhead and seals. 
<P>Soon afterward, La Repubblica reported, Italian operatives passed news of 
their scoop to the CIA and the British intelligence agency, MI6. When the CIA 
expressed doubt about the veracity of the claims, SISMI began seeking to peddle 
it directly to the most pro-war faction of the Bush administration.  
<P>SISMI chief Pollari met in Rome with Michael Ledeen, an influential 
Washington neoconservative who has long been reputed to play a back-channel 
role between U.S. and Italian spy agencies. Pollari also met in Washington with 
Stephen Hadley, deputy national security adviser, to discuss the new 
information, La Repubblica reported. On Thursday, a National Security Council 
spokesman confirmed that the Hadley-Pollari meeting had taken place but was 
only "a courtesy call" with no documents exchanged.  
<P>In early 2002, CIA officials sent Wilson, who had served as a diplomat in 
Africa, to Niger to investigate the matter. Wilson reported back to CIA 
headquarters that the claims were unfounded.  
<P>Meanwhile, however, MI6 recycled the information and, without disclosing 
the source, reported it to the White House  --  which interpreted this British 
echo chamber as independent confirmation of the Italian claims. 
<P>The elaborate hoax finally succeeded. In late September 2002, Secretary of 
State Colin Powell cited Iraq's alleged Niger dealings as proof of Hussein's 
nuclear ambitions. In his February 2003 State of the Union address, Bush 
declared that British intelligence had "learned" Saddam Hussein had been 
seeking to buy nuclear material in Africa. Throughout the period, Blair made 
similar claims. 
<P>British officials have insisted that they had other evidence in addition 
to the forged documents that confirmed Iraqi uranium purchases in Niger. The 
British have declined to show this evidence, however.  
<P>La Repubblica quoted a SISMI official as saying of this alleged 
corroborating evidence, "If it ever were brought forward it would be 
discovered, with red faces, that it was Italian intelligence collected by SISMI 
at the end of the 1980s and shared with our friend Hamilton McMillan"  --  the 
top MI6 counter-terrorism official during that period. 
<P>After war was initiated in 2003 and invading U.S. troops found no evidence 
of an Iraqi nuclear program, Wilson began to tell reporters about his 
fact-finding trip and his report to Washington that the Niger uranium claims 
were bogus. Wilson's maneuvering came at a politically sensitive moment, as the 
administration's war rationale appeared to be crumbling. According to the 
indictment released Friday, it was during this period when Lewis Libby, 
Cheney's chief of staff, began to organize a counterattack against Wilson and 
Valerie Plame, leaking her identity as a CIA agent and suggesting that he may 
have been sent to Niger merely because of nepotism.  
<P>On Friday, the New York Times reported that the FBI has been investigating 
the forged uranium documents for two years but has not reached any conclusions 
about who fabricated them or how they were funneled to U.S. and British 
officials. 
<P>On Wednesday, Berlusconi's office "categorically" rejected La Repubblica's 
claims. "The facts that are narrated ... do not correspond to the truth," the 
prime minister's office said in a statement in which it reiterated denials that 
the government had any "direct or indirect involvement in the packaging and 
delivery of the 'false dossier on Niger's uranium.' " 
<P>But Farrell said that many Italians view the matter as yet another dark 
conspiracy. 
<P>"Italian politics is incredibly byzantine and incredibly nontransparent, 
especially on security issues," Farrell said. "There is a pervasive (public) 
belief of dietrologia carried out behind the scenes by powerful, shadowy 
figures, all more or less incomprehensible except to a few insiders in Rome.  
<P>"This case will be interpreted as more of the same."
