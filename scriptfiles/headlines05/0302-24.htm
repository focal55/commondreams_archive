<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p>As we approach this awesome anniversary, marking the
collision of presupposition and preemption, I listen
keenly to the progressive dialogue re-emerging in the
wake of our stunned mourning, and hear renewed urgency
in the tone of activists  "Stop the War!"<p>I am struck by the implication in that definite
article - the.

<p>Iraq. Today, even Bush Cabinet hawks are looking for a
way out, a face saving scheme to salvage the shreds of
their investment, to staunch the flow of life's blood
in uniform, to back-step from, by now all too
uncertain footing, to quell the chorus of dissidence,
silence the growing number of detractors, the
increasing throng of those as yet unconvinced
regarding justifiable necessity, all demanding truth
and belated accountability.

<p>While offstage, the architects of war labor over a
plan for strategic retreat, new incursions are on the
drawing board in the Persian Gulf. The undertones in
most recent overtures abroad awaken in many a sense of
alarm, as Mr. Bush and Ms. Rice, protesting too much
in their fashion, challenge our credulity concerning
their intentions in regard to Iran.  Rich in oil, geopolitically pivotal, potential platform for yet another grab for resource under the mantle of security, any crisis with Iran will be linked to our obsession to fuel the American lifestyle.  How much oil is squandered in the struggle to secure it - the diminishing cache of that which has propelled our civilization into its self-destructive stance?

<p>More than short sightedness, the dark blindness in the trajectory of our foreign policy jeopardizes any remaining stability in the Middle East and threatens to rob us, America, of a critical opportunity to resolutely address the sustainable energy futures that alone can halt this rush to the nightmare that lies in waiting beyond the event, the phenomenon, known as peak oil. 

<p>Will we, citizens of these United States and of these
many nations, in time acknowledge and embrace our
shared circumstance as a single species engaged in
endangering our own survival?  Sanity and the
expectation of succession lie only in our taking the
full measure of the climate crisis condition which
militarism fully exacerbates.  The only redemptive
attitude is one that honestly assesses the hour, the
moment.

<p>As geologic seconds tick loudly, it is solely by
apprehending and embracing, with humility and wisdom,
the truth of the obvious, that we as individuals and
as a human collective derive our lives from one
singular and precious planet, that we can begin to
pull out of this mad nose dive. 

<p>May we awaken from our denial and delusion to speak
with one voice to Mr. Bush, and his willing team. 
Now. Out of Iraq, take pen to Kyoto, rejoin the world
community at this turning point and shoulder the role
of leadership in a world that cries for reason and
justice and aches for human hearted.<p>Drop the article.
