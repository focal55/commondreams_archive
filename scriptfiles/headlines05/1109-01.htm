California voters were rejecting Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's special 
election agenda Tuesday, handing the governor a humbling loss after he gambled 
on a high-stakes plan to reshape state government.

</table>With more than three-quarters of the votes counted, the four initiatives 
that Schwarzenegger said were needed to reform California were all losing.  
<P>The centerpiece of the governor's agenda, Proposition 76, which would 
limit state spending, was trailing badly. Proposition 77, which would strip 
lawmakers of the ability to draw political voting districts; Proposition 74, 
which would lengthen the time it takes for public school teachers to get 
tenure; and Proposition 75, aimed at curbing public employee unions' political 
spending, were also losing. 
<P>Four other ballot measures appeared on the special election ballot, and 
early returns showed two rival measures to lower the price of prescription 
drugs for uninsured Californians failing. A measure that would have made 
changes to the state's electricity market was failing, while an initiative that 
would require girls 18 or under to notify their parents before getting an 
abortion was losing narrowly. 
<P>The election results appeared to be a major setback for Schwarzenegger, 
who called for the vote but never succeeded in convincing Californians that it 
was needed. The election sparked a political brawl that invigorated Democrats 
and labor unions, who mounted a relentless, yearlong attack that showed that 
even a governor who once appeared invincible is no match for nurses, teachers 
and firefighters. 
<P>Two years after an angry electorate looking for a new voice in Sacramento 
thrust Schwarzenegger into office, voters appear to have turned their anger 
back on  him. 
<P>The governor clearly recognized that Tuesday night. Taking the stage in a 
huge ballroom at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills, Schwarzenegger did 
not concede. But he did reach out to his opponents  --  thanking Californians 
for participating in the election and thanking those "who were so passionately 
vocal against us.'' 

<P>The governor insisted Californians still want big changes, but seemed to 
acknowledge his "Year of Reform'' focused on the wrong things. 
<P>"We need more nurses, teachers, firefighters and police officers,'' said 
the governor, singling out the groups that had targeted him. "We need more 
affordable housing, more energy and more water. We need more of everything, and 
I recognize that we also need more bipartisan cooperation. I promise I will 
deliver that.'' 
<P>"The people of California are sick and tired of all the fighting,'' he 
added. 
<P>In contrast to the somber mood in Schwarzenegger's camp, his opponents 
were jubilant. 
<P>Lou Paulson, president of the California Professional Firefighters, raised 
a broom over his head as it became clear all four of Schwarzenegger's 
initiatives would fail, leading a party in a Sacramento hotel in chants of 
"Sweep!'' 
<P>Democratic lawmakers were less strident. 
<P>While declaring that Schwarzenegger "took a wrong turn in January and we 
wasted a year,'' Senate President Pro Tem Don Perata, D-Oakland, pledged to 
work with Schwarzenegger next year. 
<P>"Win or lose, we have to put this behind us," he said. "I don't think 
anybody should be taking a victory lap." 
<P>Tuesday marked the end of a bitter and costly brawl that Schwarzenegger 
sparked in January, with a combative State of the State speech in which he 
predicted a "big political fight.'' 
<P>The election became the costliest in state history, and Schwarzenegger 
sank more than $7 million of his own money into his losing effort. 
<P>The anti-Schwarzenegger coalition raised and spent more than $100 million 
against him. Both Prop. 75 and 76 were, to labor leaders, direct assaults aimed 
at tilting the balance of power in Sacramento. 
<P>Schwarzenegger campaigned for his initiatives by saying the election was a 
sequel to the recall. Labor and Democrats characterized the election as 
unnecessary and polarizing. 
<P>The anti-Schwarzenegger coalition was a vast, sophisticated political 
machine that played on public sympathies. 
<P>"You don't win many fights with nurses,'' noted Jack Pitney, a political 
scientist at Claremont McKenna College. 
<P>The California Teachers Association ran commercials complaining about his 
education budget. The California Nurses Association protested his appearances  
--  union leaders bragged this week that they have had a presence at more than 
100 of Schwarzenegger's public events this year. Fittingly, the union staged a 
party in the same hotel as Schwarzenegger on Tuesday night.  
<P>The attacks seemed to work, cutting Schwarzenegger's approval rating among 
voters in half by June, according to statewide Field Polls. Only about a third 
of voters polled said they approve of the governor. 
<P>Schwarzenegger largely ignored the assault, something supporters say was a 
mistake. 

<P>"There are a lot of us who wanted him to fight back much earlier,'' said 
Mike Spence, president of the California Republican Assembly, a conservative 
group. 
<P>Other stumbles also cost the governor. 
<P>Two of the four issues Schwarzenegger first promoted in January  --  
capping state expenses for public pensions and paying teachers based on merit 
instead of tenure  --  were dropped. 
<P>And by spending much of the year raising money from corporate donors, and 
then running a campaign that featured mostly controlled events among GOP 
supporters, some political observers believe Schwarzenegger made it easier for 
foes to portray him as pushing a Republican agenda. 
<P>Issues like redistricting and teacher performance aren't necessarily 
partisan issues, noted Republican political consultant Kevin Spillane, but the 
governor's opponents were able to paint Schwarzenegger's entire agenda as a 
Republican power grab.  
<P>"His team seems to have played right into the hands of the opponents,'' 
said Spillane. 
<P>Ironically, observers said, the man who ousted former Gov. Gray Davis, who 
was the ultimate political insider, ran a sheltered campaign that never 
connected with the people Schwarzenegger claimed to represent. 
<P>"He's been hidden, and he's been packaged, and he clearly didn't learn the 
lesson of Gray Davis, which is you need to be out there talking to real 
people," said Darry Sragow, a longtime Democratic strategist. 
<P>Schwarzenegger stormed up and down the state in the last few weeks arguing 
that the special election was a sequel to the recall and that his initiatives 
were the tools he needed to fix a broken system. He also railed against "union 
bosses'' that he characterized as controlling the Capitol, saying yesterday 
"the government is no longer accountable to the people.'' 
<P>Many political observers say Schwarzenegger tried to do too much. 
<P>"Too many issues and too many enemies,'' said Phil Trounstine, a former 
communications director for Davis and now director of the Survey and Policy 
Research Institute at San Jose State University.
