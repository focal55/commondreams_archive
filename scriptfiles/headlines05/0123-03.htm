<p>CHICAGO  - 

Church-going Americans have grown
increasingly intolerant in the past four years of politicians
making compromises on such hot issues as abortion and gay
rights, according to a survey released on Saturday.

<p>
 At the same time, those polled said they were growing
bolder about pushing their beliefs on others -- even at the
risk of offending someone.
 <p>
 The trends could indicate that religion has become "more
prominent in American discourse ... more salient," according to
Ruth Wooden, president of Public Agenda, a nonpartisan research
organization which released the survey.
 <p>

 It could also indicate "more polarized political thinking.
There do not seem to be very many voices arguing for compromise
today," she said in an interview. "It could be that more
religious voices feel under siege, pinned against the wall by
cultural developments. They may feel more emboldened as a
result."
 
<p>
 The November U.S. election saw voters in a number of states
back gay marriage bans, and President Bush  won re-election with
heavy support from fellow religious conservatives.
 <p>
 The findings came from a telephone survey of 1,507 adults
made in 2000 and a second similar survey of 1,004 adults done
during the summer of 2004 that tracked the same issues. It had
a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
 <p>
 Those surveyed were nearly all Christians, not by design
but because the sample reflected the makeup of the population,
the group said. A 2002 Pew Research Council survey found that
82 percent of the U.S. populace considered itself to be
Christian, while 10 percent identified with no religious group.
 <p>
 On the question of whether elected officials should set
their convictions aside to get results in government, 84
percent agreed in 2000. However, four years later that had
dropped to 74 percent. There was a sharper decline on the same
question among weekly church-goers from 82 percent in the first
survey to 63 percent in the second.
 <p>
 About 40 percent of Americans claim to be weekly
church-goers, according to Corwin Smidt, director of the Henry
Institute for the Study of Christianity and Politics at Calvin
College in Michigan. Some surveys have placed the figure at 25
percent.
 <p>

 In the survey, 32 percent of those who attended church once
a week said they were willing to compromise on abortion issues
-- a 19-point drop in four years. Among the same group the
question of compromising beliefs on gay rights was acceptable
to only 39 percent, down 18 points from 2000.
 <p>
 The poll also found that 37 percent overall felt that
deeply religious people should be careful not to offend anyone
when they "spread the word of God," a decline from 46 percent
four years earlier.
 <p>
 The number of those who felt that committed faithful should
spread the word "whenever they can" rose to 41 percent, up 6
points.
 <p>
 On another issue, the survey found little change in opinion
on whether the U.S. political system can handle greater
interaction between religion and politics. Asked if there was a
threat if religious leaders and groups got a lot more involved
in politics, 63 percent in 2000 and 61 percent in 2004 said the
system could "easily handle" it. But the remainder continue to
believe the system would be threatened.</p>
