<p>BAGHDAD  - American soldiers tortured Iraqi  prisoners at a military base in Mosul but nobody was court  martialed over the abuse, U.S. army documents say.
<p> 
			
			The documents show that mistreatment of Iraqi prisoners was  not confined to the Abu Ghraib jail, where abuse and sexual  humiliation of inmates caused worldwide outrage last year.
<p> 
			
			An investigation by a U.S. officer after an Iraqi  prisoner's jaw was broken at the base in Mosul found that  "detainees were being systematically and intentionally  mistreated" in late 2003.

              The United States has committed 'grave violations of human rights' against prisoners in Guantanamo Bay, Afghanistan and Iraq, the Foreign Affairs Committee of Britain's parliament said in a report on March 24, 2005. The report also called on the British government to make clear whether it uses intelligence passed on by other countries that may have been gathered by torturing suspects.

Inmates were hit with water bottles, forced to do  exhausting physical exercises until they collapsed, deprived of  sleep and subjected to deafening noise, the investigation  report found.
<p> 
			
			One prisoner died in December 2003 after four days of  repeatedly having to do physical exercises as a punishment,  according to the documents, obtained by the American Civil  Liberties Union under the Freedom of Information Act.
<p> 
			
			The Mosul investigation began after 20-year-old Salah Salih  Jassim had his jaw broken in detention. He was not suspected of  any crime but had been arrested along with his father, an  officer in Saddam Hussein's Fedayeen militia.
<p> 
			
			"All night they were throwing water on us and making us  stand and squat. From the night to the next day ... they were  beating us," Jassim said in testimony to investigators.
<p> 
			
			"IT SMELLED BAD"
<p> 
			
			The investigation report said Jassim was held in a  detention room with around 70 other prisoners. Deafening heavy  metal music was played, and guards threw cold water onto hooded  prisoners and sounded bullhorns beside their heads.
<p> 
			
			"It smelled bad. I saw one guy banging his head against the  wall, all on his own," one of the U.S. guards testified.  Another said several guards had lost their voices from yelling.
<p> 
			
			"The guards in the room were roaming among the detainees  pounding on metal doors, shouting at the detainees to perform  exercises, and physically grabbing detainees if they were slow  getting to their feet," the report said.
<p> 
			
			"The detainees had sandbags over their heads that were  marked with different crimes, leading the guards to believe  that the particular detainee committed that particular crime."
<p> 
			
			The report said the bag on Jassim's head was marked 'IED'  -- the acronym for Improvised Explosive Device, roadside bombs  that have killed and maimed hundreds of soldiers.
<p> 
			
			Planting IEDs is "a particularly hated crime by infantry  soldiers patrolling the streets," the report noted.
<p> 
			
			Soldiers who were in the room when Jassim's jaw was broken  all said they did not see the incident. The investigation  concluded that Jassim was most probably hit in the face, or  that he may have fallen on his face as a result of exhaustion.
<p> 
			
			Soldiers questioned for the investigation revealed a  culture of prisoner abuse at the base. One said that troops  "always harassed the hell out of detainees." Another said that  at times "the detainees would get so scared they would piss  themselves."
<p> 
			
			The investigation was unable to determine which guards were  at fault, so none were punished. But the investigating officer  said many of his recommendations for improvements were  implemented, including ceasing physical harassment of prisoners  and putting the detention room under military police control.
<p> 
			
			The Pentagon says abuse of prisoners in Iraq was carried  out only by a few rogue soldiers, and that all accusations of  abuse are thoroughly and promptly investigated. The U.S.  government says it has never authorized the use of torture.
<p> 
			
			U.S. military documents released under the Freedom of  Information Act show that scores of accusations of abuse have  been investigated in Iraq, Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay.
<p> 
			
			Earlier this month, the Pentagon said it would not reopen  an investigation into allegations by three Iraqis working for  Reuters that they were subjected to beatings, sexual  humiliation, sleep deprivation, white noise and exhausting  physical exercises at a U.S. base near Falluja in January 2004.
<p> 
			
			Reuters says the investigation, for which none of the  Iraqis was interviewed, was inadequate and should be reopened.
