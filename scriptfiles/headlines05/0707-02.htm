<p>AUSTIN &#8211; A company indicted in a Texas campaign fundraising case says it 
      was told that by giving a Tom DeLay political committee $25,000, company 
      officials would get access to the U.S. House majority leader to 
influence legislation.</p>
    <p>
      In court documents, Westar Energy of Kansas says that to meet with Mr. 
      DeLay in 2002, company officials &quot;were told they needed to write a check 
for $25,000&quot; to Texans for a Republican Majority, known as TRMPAC.</p>

    <p>
      It's the first time a company has said it donated to the Texas committee 
      created by Mr. DeLay in exchange for a meeting and legislative help.
    </p>
    <p>
      An aide to Mr. DeLay denied that he was swayed by the donation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;Anyone who has worked with Majority Leader DeLay knows that his 
      legislative efforts are based on sound public policy alone,&quot; spokeswoman 
      Shannon Flaherty said.
    </p>

    <p>
      Westar attorney Martha Dickie declared in April in an Austin court that 
      company officials hoped to win Mr. DeLay's help on pending energy 
      legislation, according to transcripts in a lawsuit challenging the use 
      of corporate money in Texas elections.
    </p>
    <div class="dwssubhead">
      <b>Seeking an exemption
    </b> </div>
    <p>
      &quot;They absolutely wanted an exemption to continue operating the business 
      and to be grandfathered out of this federal legislation,&quot; she said in 
      the hearing. &quot;And maybe they were dumb about the way they went about 
      getting it.&quot;

    </p>
    <p>
      As a result of the contribution, two Westar executives attended a June 
      2002 golf outing with Mr. DeLay and two top aides at The Homestead 
      resort in Hot Springs, Va.
    </p>
    <p>
      The provision sought by Westar was included in a House bill with Mr. 
      DeLay's support but was ultimately withdrawn after a grand jury in 
      Austin began investigating corporate fundraising in 2002 Texas 
      legislative races.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRMPAC raised $1.6 million for Republican statehouse candidates in 2002, 
      including at least $600,000 from corporations.
    </p>

    <p>
      Those funds helped Republicans complete their grasp on political power 
      statewide, with the GOP taking a majority in the Texas House for the 
      first time in more than a century. In turn, the Legislature redrew 
      congressional districts to create several Republican seats, adding to 
      Mr. DeLay's majority in the U.S. House.
    </p>
    <p>
      Westar spokeswoman Karla Olsen said Wednesday that the company made the 
      contribution &quot;to tell our side of the story&quot; without any guarantee that 
      the law would be changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;We understood we were only having discussions,&quot; she said.
    </p>

    <p>
      Company lawyers wrote that the contributions were &quot;solicited,&quot; though 
      they did not specify how exactly the request occurred. Federal law 
      prohibits the promise of legislative favors in return for political 
      donations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The House ethics committee admonished Mr. DeLay last year, saying the 
      golf outing &quot;created an appearance that donors were being provided 
      special access.&quot; But the committee said it had no evidence that Mr. 
      DeLay had improperly solicited contributions from Westar or had broken 
      the law.
    </p>
    <div class="dwssubhead">

      <b>Grand jury indictments
    </b> </div>
    <p>
      A Travis County grand jury has indicted three DeLay associates and eight 
      companies, including Westar, on charges of violating Texas law that 
      forbids the use of corporate money to elect political candidates. All of 
      the companies denied wrongdoing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prosecutors have since dismissed felony indictments against four of the 
      corporations in exchange for their agreement to fund programs examining 
      the use of corporate money in politics.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to the grand jury probe, Democrats defeated in the 2002 
      legislative races have filed civil suits, claiming TRMPAC improperly 
      funded their Republican opponents with corporate money. Westar is among 
      the companies named in those lawsuits.
    </p>

    <p>
      In a filing in district court in Austin, Westar attorneys said the 
      company's goal in sending $25,000 to TRMPAC was to talk with Mr. DeLay 
      about getting an exemption in federal law, not to affect legislative 
      elections in Texas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;Westar sent its check to the national capital to pay for attendance at 
      an event to meet a prominent Republican federal official from Texas. The 
      meeting sought to influence high-profile federal energy legislation,&quot; 
      the company said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;Westar had received what it wanted from the transaction when it met 
      with Congressman DeLay in Virginia,&quot; the brief said.
    </p>

    <p>
      According to Westar officials and e-mails that were part of the House 
      ethics inquiry on Mr. DeLay last fall, the $25,000 solicitation for the 
      golf outing stemmed from conversations between Drew Maloney, a former 
      DeLay aide who organized the event, and Westar lobbyist Richard 
      Bornemann.
    </p>
    <p>
      The House ethics committee report said Mr. Bornemann asked Mr. Maloney 
      about political contributions and Mr. Maloney proposed the DeLay golf 
      outing with the check going to TRMPAC. Mr. Maloney confirmed the 
      report's account.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Maloney said Mr. DeLay's staff did not require that donations be 
      given in exchange for access to the majority leader.
    </p>
    <p>

      &quot;Westar's position is evolving as their legal proceedings continue,&quot; he 
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bornemann could not be reached for comment. Westar officials said 
      that Mr. Bornemann no longer lobbies for the company.

      KANSAS COMPANY, TEXAS RACES</strong></a>
    </div>
<p>
      How a Kansas energy company came to donate to a Texas political 
committee:</p>
    <p>
      <b>March 2002:</b> Drew Maloney leaves Tom DeLay's staff and becomes a 
lobbyist, assisting with DeLay fundraising.</p>

    <p>
      <b>April 2002:</b> Westar seeks a meeting with Mr. DeLay to argue for an 
      exemption to a federal energy law. Mr. Maloney tells Westar lobbyist 
      Richard Bornemann that a $25,000 contribution would get access to Mr. 
DeLay at a golf outing.</p>
    <p>
      <b>May 2002:</b> Mr. Bornemann says in a memo to Westar executives that 
      the $25,000 contribution is part of an effort &quot;to get a seat at the 
table&quot; in negotiations over federal energy legislation.</p>

    <p>
      <b>June 2002:</b> Two Westar officials join other energy executives for 
      a two-day golf outing with Mr. DeLay at The Homestead resort in 
      Virginia. DeLay energy aide Jack Victory and office counsel Carl Thorsen 
are also in attendance.</p>
    <p>
      <b>September 2002:</b> Mr. DeLay and Republicans oppose efforts by 
      Democrats to delete the Westar exemption from federal legislation. The 
      provision dies after word of the Austin grand jury investigation into 
      corporate contributions. &quot;Things are grim in DC,&quot; Westar vice president 
Doug Lawrence says in an e-mail to a company official.</p>
