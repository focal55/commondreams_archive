<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p>WASHINGTON, D.C.  - A leading rights watchdog is urging that alleged war criminals holding top posts in Afghanistan's government be brought to justice, and that steps be taken to bar human rights abusers from official positions.
<p> 
Many high-level officials and advisors in Afghanistan's current government are implicated in major war crimes and human rights abuses that took place in the early 1990s, Human Rights Watch said in a new report to be released in Kabul Thursday.
<p> 
The organization said it based its 133-page report, ''Blood-Stained Hands: Past Atrocities in Kabul and Afghanistan's Legacy of Impunity,'' on extensive research over the past two years. This included more than 150 interviews with witnesses, survivors, government officials, and combatants.
<p> 
It documents war crimes and human rights abuses during a particularly bloody year in Afghanistan's civil war, from April 1992 to March 1993, following the collapse in Kabul of the Soviet-backed government of Mohammad Najibullah Ahmadzai.
<p> 
Some of the perpetrators are dead or currently in hiding, Human Rights Watch said, but many leaders implicated in the abuses now serve as officials in Afghanistan's defense and interior ministries or are advisors to President Hamid Karzai.
<p> 
Some are running for office in parliamentary and local elections scheduled for September 2005. Others operate as warlords or regional strongmen, directing subordinates in official positions, the report said.
<p> 
''This report isn't just a history lesson,'' said Brad Adams, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Asia division. ''These atrocities were among some of the gravest in Afghanistan's history, yet today many of the perpetrators still wield power.''

<p> 
The period covered in the report, the Afghan year 1371, saw intense fighting between different mujahedeen and former government factions vying for power in the wake of the Najibullah government's collapse. As the year began, Kabul was largely unscathed by serious military conflict but as hostilities progressed, whole sections of the capital city were reduced to rubble, tens of thousands of civilians were killed and wounded, and at least half a million people were displaced.
<p> 
Rival armed factions committed extensive human rights abuses and violations of the laws of war, illegally shelling and rocketing civilian areas, abducting and murdering civilians, and pillaging civilian areas, the report said.
<p> 
The abuses were neither inevitable consequences of war nor unavoidable mistakes, it added. Rather, they were the results of illegal acts and omissions by factional leaders and commanders. Many commanders may be criminally culpable for their behavior during this period, according to Human Rights Watch.
<p> 
The watchdog urged the Afghan government and international community to create a special court to try the alleged offenders. Independence and international fair trial standards could be ensured were the court to be made up of Afghan and international judges, with an international majority, and with an international prosecutor.
<p> 
''Perpetrators of past abuses who go unpunished are more likely to commit new abuses and use violence to get their way,'' said Adams. ''They pose a continuing threat to Afghanistan's future.''
<p> 

The report comes as the Karzai government struggles to extend its authority and to bring some sense of national purpose and unity to the country's disparate provinces, rival warlords, and intensely antagonistic political factions.
<p> 
Dozens of mid-level officials from the Taliban, which eventually filled the post-Najibullah vacuum and ruled from 1996 until being ousted by U.S.-led troops in 2001, have agreed to cooperate with government programs to rebuild the war-ravaged country.
<p> 
Despite such gains, however, the past three months have seen a marked upswing in Taliban attacks and U.S. retaliation across southern Afghanistan. More than 700 people on all sides have been killed in suicide bombings, assassinations, and extensive battles, according to U.S. and Afghan official estimates.
<p> 
Even so, Karzai and other senior officials have continued to voice hope that dialogue can diminish, if not dismantle, Afghanistan's insurgency.
<p> 
For its part the U.S. military, anxious to free troops for Iraq duty and to reduce its $10 billion annual bill in Afghanistan, supports the initiative and advocates pursuing 100 senior Taliban leaders while allowing lower ranks to return home under an amnesty, the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> reported from Afghanistan.
<p> 
Adams, at Human Rights Watch, said national reconciliation should not come at the cost of justice.
<p> 
''In Afghanistan today, alleged war criminals--Taliban, mujahedeen, communist--enjoy total impunity in the name of national reconciliation,'' he said. ''This is an insult to victims and an affront to justice.''
<p> 
Human Rights Watch, in its report, said many Afghans still have terrible memories of the fighting in the early 1990s. These include incidents in which warring factions targeted women and children.
<p> 
''Hundreds of people were wounded when they fought--every time they fought,'' the report quoted an Afghan nurse as saying. ''The hospital would be full of patients, overwhelmed. We couldn't treat everyone who was brought there. People were dying in the halls.''
