<p></p> Signs of global warming fed by greenhouse gases produced by  human activity, or just summertime oddities?<p></p> In the United States, some warblers are flying north to  Canada. In Costa Rica, toucans are moving higher up into the  mountains, apparently because of rising temperatures.<p></p> In July, a Norwegian man fishing in a fjord had a shock when  he landed a John Dory, a fish more usually found in temperate  waters off southern Europe or Africa.<p></p> &quot;There's a long list of migratory species ending up further  north. It's certainly a sign of warmer temperatures,&quot; said Steve  Sawyer, climate policy director at the Greenpeace environmental  group.<p></p> He said salmon had been swimming through the Bering Strait  between Alaska and Russia into the Chukchi Sea, apparently  because the frigid water had warmed up.<p></p> Such shifts could have vast long-term implications for  farmers and fishing fleets.<p></p> However, some experts are sceptical that unusual sightings  of everything from bears to butterflies support theories that  temperatures are rising because of a build-up of heat-trapping  gases emitted by cars, factories and power plants.<p></p> &quot;If you want to measure temperatures, you use a thermometer,  not a bird,&quot; said Fred Singer, who heads the U.S. Science and  Environmental Policy Project. &quot;Birds have all sorts of reasons  for moving north, south, sideways or whatever.&quot;<p></p> Singer says people and creatures have adapted to unexplained  changes in temperature, linked to natural variation, throughout  history. Some species simply move in unexpected directions or  unwittingly stow away on trucks, planes or ships.<p></p> 
<strong>ROBINS IN ARCTIC</strong>
<p></p> However, U.N. data show that the warmest year since records  began in the 1860s was 1998, followed by 2002, 2003 and 2004.  Most scientists link the rise in temperatures to human emissions  of carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels, rather than   natural change.<p></p> The panel that advises the United Nations says that rising  temperatures may drive thousands of species to extinction and  cause more storms, floods and deserts while raising sea levels,  perhaps by one metre (three feet) by 2100.<p></p> Inuit peoples have noted southerly species of wildlife  reaching the Arctic in summertime in recent years, including  robins, hornets and barn owls.<p></p> Anecdotal evidence from further south is piling up. <p></p> Two yellow, green and brown bee-eater birds, usually found  in southern Europe, have nested in a hedge in southern England  -- the fourth time a bee-eater nest has been found in Britain.<p></p> &quot;It looks as if it's linked to climate change,&quot; John  Lanchbery, head of climate policy at Britain's Royal Society for  the Protection of Birds, said of a general shift northwards of  birds in Europe.<p></p> Growing seasons have extended and seas have become warmer,  he said.<p></p> However, some examples are misleading.<p></p> In the Piedmont region of northern Italy this summer,  residents were surprised by swarms of locusts, suspecting they  had flown over from Africa.<p></p> Insect experts said they were an Italian species and did not  migrate over long distances. Still, an exceptionally hot summer  in 2003 has meant more parched ground, ideal conditions for the  pests to lay their eggs.<p></p> &quot;Global warming could also be a reason,&quot; said Vincenzo  Girolami, an entomologist at Padua University. If there were  more hotter, drier summers, there were likely to be more swarms  of locusts in Italy, he said.<p></p> 
<strong>HEADACHE FOR RANGERS</strong>
<p></p> In the United States, birds such as the Cape May warbler and  Blackburnian warbler are moving north into Canada, causing a  headache for forest rangers.<p></p> If the birds leave, spruce forests in the United States  could be vulnerable to attacks by spruce budworm caterpillars,  normally eaten by the birds. If the caterpillars are left to  thrive they will eat, and dry out, the trees.<p></p> &quot;The trees could be more stressed which could lead to more  fires,&quot; said Terry Root, a professor at Stanford University in  the United States. &quot;We could really have a difficult situation.&quot;<p></p> In Costa Rica's Monteverde cloud forest, toucans, with their  brightly-coloured, banana-shaped bills, are threatening another  species, the spectacular green quetzal, by moving to higher  altitudes where the quetzals nest, she said.<p></p>
