<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p> BEIJING  -- Japan and China held talks in Beijing Monday but failed to halt a free fall in ties after a third weekend of demonstrations in China against what many see as Japan's inability to face up to its wartime past.

<P>There was little sign of headway after the violent protests which, along with disputes over territory, a Japanese history textbook and Tokyo's bid for a permanent U.N. Security Council seat, have dragged relations to their lowest point in decades.

<P>Japanese Foreign Minister Nobutaka Machimura met State Councillor Tang Jiaxuan, a former foreign minister with broad responsibility for diplomatic issues, who noted that Machimura was visiting "under very difficult circumstances in Sino-Japanese relations," which were established in 1972.

<P>Thus far, the two sides have appeared to be talking past each other in discussions on a high-stakes economic partnership that brings $178 billion in annual trade and which Tang has described as "at a crossroads."

<P>The row has already affected financial markets in Tokyo, with the Nikkei share average tumbling 3.8 percent and the yen slipping against the dollar.

<P>Tang sidestepped a request by Machimura for an apology, Japan's Kyodo news agency reported. Japan's envoy said "one word of apology would have the power to turn Japanese people's feelings in a good direction," Kyodo said.

<P>Tang replied he had heard the issue had been dealt with in earlier talks, Kyodo said.

<P>Some impact is being felt. Japan predicted Monday that the number of tourists heading for China would fall sharply by 10,000 over the next three months and that Japanese expatriates in the country were growing nervous.

<P>Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Wu Dawei blamed the trouble on Japan for failing to handle historical issues correctly, saying the current period was the "most difficult of the difficult."

<P>Japan's Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi sought to move beyond the current "exchange of criticism," saying a possible bilateral summit with China's President Hu Jintao at a conference in Indonesia later this week should look to the future.

<P>EXCHANGING BARBS

<P>More than 20,000 protesters marched on Japan's consulate in Shanghai Saturday, breaking windows at Japanese restaurants and pelting the diplomatic compound with rocks and bottles.

<P>The demonstrators were angry over a revised Japanese school textbook they say whitewashes atrocities during Japan's 1931-45 invasion and occupation of much of China. Tensions also edged up after Tokyo announced it had begun procedures to allocate rights for test-drilling in a disputed area of the East China Sea.

<P>Chinese Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing told Machimura on Sunday China had nothing to apologize for over the demonstrations, staged in at least 10 Chinese cities from Shanghai in the east and Shenyang in the northeast to Xiamen in the southeast and Guangzhou in the south.

<P>A Japanese government spokesman said in Tokyo Monday it was regrettable that China had not apologized, that Japan would continue to pursue an apology and that violence should not be condoned under any circumstances.

<P>China has described the protests -- which have taken place each weekend in April across China -- as spontaneous. But they have been criticized for appearing orchestrated and Japanese newspapers have blamed the Chinese government for not doing enough to stop them.

<P>China has denied deliberately allowing the unrest to spiral, but has shown it can halt street protests easily if it wishes.

<P>Even as a violent demonstration raged in Shanghai, authorities headed off protests in Beijing, where thousands of demonstrators had hurled rocks and bottles at the Japanese embassy and ambassador's residence only a week earlier.

<P>Japanese newspaper editorials blamed China for inaction.

<P>"The reason that the anti-Japanese demonstrations have expanded to this point is that the Chinese government is avoiding responsibility for such violent destructive behavior," the Nihon Keizai business daily said.

<P>Some are also growing unhappy with Koizumi. A newspaper poll showed three out of four Japanese voters believed he was not doing enough to improve relations with China and South Korea, which was also occupied by Japan early in the 20th Century.

<P>According to the Mainichi Shimbun poll, 45 percent of voters said Koizumi should stop visiting Tokyo's Yasukuni shrine, where convicted war criminals are honored along with Japan's 2.5 million war dead. On the other side of the issue, 42 percent said he should continue to visit the shrine.

<P>Saturday Tang cited Japanese leaders' visits to the shrine as the cause of tension.
