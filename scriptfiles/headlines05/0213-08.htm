<p> SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK  - 

Since ancient times
poets have revered the power of the seas. Now energy companies
and coastal cities like New York and San Francisco are aiming
to tap ocean waves and tidal currents as abundant sources of
electricity.

  <p>
 Whether captured by big buoys bobbing on sea swells, or by
submerged turbines spinning with the ebb and flow of the tides,
the energy potential of moving water, or marine power, is
beginning to turn heads in the energy world.
 
<p>
 "I'm pretty bullish on the technology," said Robert
Thresher, a wind power researcher at the Department of Energy's
National Renewable Energy Laboratory.
 <p>

 Thresher said water power has several advantages over wind
power, including having a lower profile. One day marine power
could catch on like wind power, currently the fastest growing
alternative energy, he said.
 <p>
 "It doesn't have the visibility of a wind turbine device,"
he said. Some critics, famously Massachusetts Democratic Sen.
Ted Kennedy, have fought offshore wind farms because they say a
forest of tall turbines spoils views of the horizon.
 <p>
 Another advantage, Thresher said, is that water currents
are more energy-dense than wind currents --- about 1,000 times
more.
 <p>
 "My wind power brethren say their turbines generate more
power when it's humid," said Trey Taylor, president of
Washington-based Verdant Power, which makes underwater
turbines. "I like to say, 'You can't get any more humid than
water."'
 <p>
 Marine power is in its infancy. But an experimental wave
project run last summer by Ocean Power Delivery Ltd in the
Scottish Orkneys successfully provided power to 500 homes
through Scottish Power (SPW.L).
 <p>
 Marine power research has received millions of dollars
worth of government subsidies in Scotland, but the United
States currently has no federal program.
 <p>
 Still, the potential is high for U.S. waters, even at many
of the nation's thousands of dams and rivers. "Just below the
Niagara Falls is a fantastic source of energy," Taylor said.
 <p>

 The technology is so young that fish protectors Trout
Unlimited have not formed an opinion on wave power. But marine
conservation group Surfrider Foundation is "guardedly
optimistic" about a system of buoys planned by New Jersey-based
Ocean Power Technologies, said spokesman Matt McClain.
 <p>
 EAST RIVER, THE GOLDEN GATE, AND THE GULF STREAM
 <p>
 This May, Verdant Power is scheduled to place as many as
six underwater turbines on the bottom of New York City's East
River to supply power to a food market on Roosevelt Island in
the river, which separates Manhattan from the boroughs of
Brooklyn and Queens.
 <p>
 Environmental regulators are examining the plans and
weighing possible problems for fish and other marine life.
 <p>
 Verdant says turbines are unlikely to harm animals because
their blades are dull, widely spaced, and turn slowly. The
company is seeking the go-ahead to install as many as 200 to
300 turbines in the East River.
 <p>
 River debris also is a concern, but crews could change the
turbines frequently, according to Taylor.
 <p>
 The expanded project would produce five to 10 megawatts of
electricity at an initial cost of &#36;20 million, but New York
state as a whole, Taylor said, could produce about 1,000
megawatts, or power for about 1 million homes. The fuel source
is free.

   <p>
 Roger Bedard of think tank Electric Power Research
Institute in Palo Alto, California, said the amount of wave
energy available off the coasts of the United States is nine to
10 times the energy currently generated by the country's
hydroelectric dams.
<p>
The city of San Francisco is studying harnessing the power
of offshore waves as well as ocean tides that surge beneath the
Golden Gate Bridge. It's looking at clean power as an option to
replace two old power stations fired by natural gas.
<p>
"The city has an advantage because we sit at the tip of a
peninsula with water on three sides," said Jared Blumenfeld,
director of San Francisco's Environment Department. "We can do
what makes sense for our geography."

<p>
The city is working on a demonstration project with
Scotland's Ocean Power. The company's Orkney project uses a
floating steel cylindrical device, about the length of four
train cars, with sections connected by hinged joints.
<p>
Rolling waves move against the sections to pump
high-pressure oil through hydraulic motors that generate
electricity which is sent through a cable to the grid.
<p>
San Francisco also wants to test a wave energy converter to
power pumps at a large water treatment plant.
<p>
Sites offshore Oahu, Hawaii, WellFleet, Massachusetts, and
Gardiner, Oregon, are also candidates for pilot studies.
<p>
Wave power advocates also eye the Gulf Stream off the East
Coast as a potential powerhouse generator, where one day the
electricity could be used to make hydrogen supplies for fuel
cells.
<p>
Other companies working on wave energy converters are
TeamWorks of the Netherlands, Energetechs of Australia, and
WaveDragon of Denmark.
