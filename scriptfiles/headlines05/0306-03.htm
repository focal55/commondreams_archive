LONDON  - 

Highly radioactive waste has been dumped in Britain's seas and washed ashore, and nuclear research station workers covered up the pollution.

  <p>

 


The Sunday Times reported that the owner of the Dounreay nuclear plant in Caithness, Scotland, faced a criminal prosecution over a series of leaks, which have sent more than 50 radioactive particles onto a nearby public beach.
 <p>
 

Herbie Lyalls, a health physics surveyor at the plant from 1960 to 1989, gave the paper a dossier that describes high-level radioactive waste washed down drains intended for low-level waste, and later flushed out into the sea.
 <p>
 

It also claimed that radioactive materials were handled inappropriately, and may have led to at least two deaths from cancer.
 <p>
 

The Sunday Times said Lyalls had spoken out about the pollution despite facing prosecution under the Official Secrets Act.
 <p>
 

"There have been so many lies told to con the public about Dounreay that I feel I must put the record straight," said Lyall.
 <p>
 

He said he was part of a survey team in 1984 that covered up health risks on a local beach where a highly radioactive particle was found.
 <p>
 
Tourists continued to visit the beach for 13 years after that, until new concerns were raised.
 <p>

 

The UK Atomic Energy Authority, which owns the plant, said safety standards were not as stringent previously as they are now.
 <p>
 

Sandy McWhirter, a project manager at Dounreay, said he could not confirm Lyall's claims but added that the former surveyor "may not have been in a position to fully understand" proceedings there.
 <p>
 

The UK Atomic Energy Authority has admitted that "at least several hundreds of thousands" of particles of plutonium and uranium, about the size of a grain of sand, had been released from Dounreay, the paper said.
