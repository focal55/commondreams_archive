<p>WOODLAND HILLS -- A doctored poster of
 President George W. Bush -- sporting Groucho Marx's dark eyebrows, mustache
and stogie -- was supposed to promote a high school play.<P>
 But for award-winning drama students at El Camino Real High School, it
 turned out to be a stark lesson in free speech. The poster was close, but no
 cigar.<P>

</font>After one student complained last week, school officials ordered a
 hundred of the posters ripped from the Woodland Hills campus on grounds they
 promoted smoking and political preference.<P>
 "There's an issue in the first (poster) regarding the smoking and
 endorsing one ideology over another," said Principal Kenny Lee, who had the
 posters removed. "That's our take on the student speech and conduct."<P>
 The controversy began when students of the theater department created the
 poster, paid for by the school, to promote their new play, "<i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0881451487/commondreams-20/ref=nosim" target="_new">The Complete
 History of America (Abridged)</a></i>," a zany spoof on the last 500 years.
<P>
 Because the jacket of the original play depicts George Washington with a
 Groucho treatment, students thought their production promo deserved a fresh
 look.<P>
 So on Dubya's sleepy-eyed mug they dabbed black bushy brows, a thick
 mustache and a lit Macanudo cigar. Dubya stood for politics; Groucho for
 satire. Perfect twin symbols of their play, they reasoned.<P>
 All went well until a high school senior and Bush supporter wrote a
 letter of complaint to the administration last week for the way the
 president was depicted, according to teachers and students. The complaining
 student added that Bush was also made to look "like an Israeli."<P>
 "We had one student who was very upset," Lee said. "So much turmoil
 within himself, he was distraught. The older generation understood the
 message. I don't think the younger one did.<P>
 "If something is bothering a student on campus, we're going to address
 it. We're not going to sweep it under the table."<P>

 Lee said that he forwarded the complaint to the Los Angeles Unified
 School District attorney and local district officials, then decided to pull
 the posters because they represented a school-sponsored event.<P>
 Many students are incensed at the ban.<P>
 "It taught us that the First Amendment certainly does not guarantee the
 right of free speech," said Jes Shah, 16, of West Hills, a junior enrolled
 in the school drama program.<P>
 "Instead, we have more restrictions on what we can say."<P>
 It took two hours for school administrators to tear down the offending
 posters. Lee then asked students to go back to the drawing board.<P>
 The result: six new play promotion broadsheets with a silhouette of Bush
 and a burning cigar, including such inscriptions as: "Free Expression for
 All (unless you are in high school)." "What First Amendment?" "LAUSD
 (heart symbol) Censorship." "Support Our Troops."<P>

 And "ECR Drama Hates Smoking."<P>
 "They're good," Lee said. "I like the follow-ups."<P>
 The drama department, voted No. 1 in the nation by the American High
 School Theatre Festival, is raising money to perform "The Laramie
 Project," a controversial play about the death of a young gay man in
 Wyoming, at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in Scotland this August<P>
 Drama teacher Sue Freitag said she didn't think the Los Angeles Unified
 School District understood the meaning of political satire -- a humorous
 spoof on government -- and that obviously some Republican didn't like George
 Bush looking like Groucho Marx.<P>
 "You have to know, all of this goes together perfectly with our play,"
 said Freitag, a 1988 graduate of El Camino Real who enjoys the support of
 the principal. "It's kind of playful. We don't need to attack anyone over
 this. It's great publicity for our play."<P>
 A spokesman for the White House did not return calls.<P>

 LAUSD's rules on political speech cite California laws that guarantee
 freedom of the press for all official school publications distributed to the
 student body.<P>
 The exceptions: obscene, libelous or slanderous materials; or when such
 publications incite students to violence, unlawful behavior or disruptions
 of school operations.<P>
 But because the speech was made by a school-sponsored poster and not a
 school journalist or writer, said one First Amendment attorney, the poster
 ban was not a violation of free speech.<P>
 "This is institutional speech as opposed to any student speech," said
 Doug Mirell, a First Amendment attorney at Loeb & Loeb LLP who has taught
 free speech law at the University of Southern California and Loyola Law
 School.<P>
 "It's unfortunate that such censorship has occurred and that people
 can't take a joke. But this doesn't appear to rise to the level of a First
 Amendment issue."<P>
 Human rights advocates didn't think it was an anti-Semitic one, either.<P>

 "It would be very different if someone were saying (the students) were
 trying to make Bush look like a Jew," said Alison Mayersohn, the
 Anti-Defamation League's associate director of the Pacific Southwest Region,
 who hadn't seen the poster.<P>
 "As far as a stereotype of an Israeli, I would say there is no
 stereotypical Israeli."<P>
 The original poster, say students, was created by none other than a high
 school native of Israel.<P>
 "We're a bunch of crazy, light-hearted drama kids," said Joan Hurwit,
 17, of Canoga Park, a four-year veteran of the drama department. "We never
 intended to promote such controversy, to mock any political group, or our
 president.<P>
 "We're just trying to promote our play and get to Scotland."
