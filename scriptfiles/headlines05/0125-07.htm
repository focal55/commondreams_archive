<p>GENEVA - Less than 25 percent of eligible Iraqi expatriates have signed up to vote in Sunday's elections, officials said Tuesday, the last day for overseas registration.

<P>In the United States, registration is running at about 10 percent.

<P>International figures from the first eight days of registration - excluding Tuesday - showed that more than 255,600 Iraqis signed up for the vote, according to the International Organization for Migration. The Geneva-based body is handling voter registration outside Iraq.

<P>"You have to see the positive side," IOM spokesman Jean-Philippe Chauzy told The Associated Press. "More than a quarter of a million have made the effort to go and register to vote."

<P>The U.N.-affiliated IOM said it expected registration numbers to increase as the deadline approaches.

<P>An estimated 1.2 million Iraqi exiles can vote in 14 countries, including the United States, over a three-day period starting Friday.

<P>Final registration figures will be released Wednesday.

<P>"It's important to bear in mind that there is still a full day's registration ahead," Chauzy said. "People will turn up for the last day of registration."

<P>Registration was originally scheduled to end Sunday but was extended until Tuesday evening because of low turnout during the first five days.

<P>In Baghdad, the Iraqi Electoral Commission said Tuesday that registration totaled 255,611 so far. That included 53,145 in Iran; 29,301 in Sweden; 29,121 in Britain; 24,825 in Germany; and 23,915 in the United States.

<P>An estimated 234,000 Iraqi expatriates can register at sites in five U.S. cities: Chicago; Detroit; Los Angeles; Nashville, Tenn.; and Washington.

<P>Commission spokesman Farid Ayar said the IOM figures were skewed because the organization was using estimates for the numbers of expatriates.

<P>"Many Iraqis left the country during the previous regime and we did not have time to gain very accurate numbers regarding the Iraqis abroad," Ayar said.

<P>Another reason for low registration was that some countries, notably Turkey, had demanded that Iraqis present permanent residence papers "and some Iraqis do not have such documents," he said.

<P>To register, Iraqis have to document their identity, Iraqi nationality and birth on or before Dec. 31, 1986. Registrants must return to the same location to vote.

<P>Iraq's 14 million eligible voters will cast ballots at 5,220 polling centers, choosing a 275-member National Assembly and provincial legislatures. The National Assembly will then appoint a new government. <p align="center"> &copy; 2005 The Associated Press</p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable --></font></td></tr>
