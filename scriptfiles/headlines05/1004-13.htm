<p>  As political activists rush to mine Supreme Court nominee Harriet Miers' slender public record, a former campaign manager says she opposed abortion rights while running for Dallas City Council in 1989.

<p> "She is on the extreme end of the anti-choice movement," said Lorlee Bartos, who managed Ms. Miers' first and only political campaign and said they discussed abortion once during the race.

<p> "I think Harriet's belief was pretty strongly felt," Ms. Bartos said Monday. "I suspect she is of the same cloth as the president." White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said she couldn't comment on Ms.        Bartos' recollection but added that President Bush &quot;does not have a        litmus test for his judicial nominees.&quot;     
<p>       Ms. Miers, a corporate lawyer who served on the City Council from 1989        to 1991, is something of a cipher as a judicial candidate, having never        served on the bench or compiled extensive legal writings. That lack of a        paper trail proved more vexing Monday to social conservatives, while        many Democrats and liberal activists held their fire.     </p>     <p>       Ms. Bartos said Ms. Miers was supportive of abortion rights in her        youth. She said Ms. Miers then underwent &quot;a born-again, profound        experience&quot; that caused her to oppose abortion.     </p>     <p>       Beyond their exchange in 1989, Ms. Bartos said she has no other insight        into Ms. Miers' views on abortion.     </p>     <p>       With the Bush loyalist's stance on abortion publicly unknown,        conservatives and liberals are voicing trepidation about the woman        tapped to replace Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, a moderate        abortion-rights supporter.     </p>     <p>       Some conservatives drew some comfort from Ms. Miers' effort in 1993,        while Texas State Bar president, to persuade the American Bar        Association to abandon its abortion-rights stance in favor of a neutral        position.     </p>     <p>       &quot;The ABA is a place where there was an awful lot of liberal activism, so        it took some courage for a woman to take the position she did,&quot; said        Leonard Leo of the conservative Federalist Society.     </p>     <p>       &quot;Conservatives should be very happy with this selection,&quot; he said.      </p>     <p>       A friend who worked with Ms. Miers on the unsuccessful ABA fight said he        did not know her view on abortion.     </p>     <p>       &quot;Harriet's position was strictly about the appropriateness of any bar        association taking a position on something like that,&quot; said Dallas        lawyer Darrell Jordan. &quot;It had nothing to do whether she was pro-choice        or pro-life. That was irrelevant to the issue.&quot;     </p>     <p>       In 1989, Ms. Miers donated $150 to the Texans for Life Coalition.     </p>     <p>       &quot;Does this alone tell me she has a strong philosophical pro-life        commitment? No,&quot; the group's president, Kyleen Wright, said. &quot;Opinions        can change.&quot;     </p>     <p>       Though the majority of her campaign contributions have gone to        Republicans, Ms. Miers contributed to Democrat Al Gore's presidential        campaign in 1988 and to the Democratic National Committee.     </p>     <p>       Ron Key, who has been Ms. Miers' pastor since the early 1980s, said his        church is anti-abortion. Mr. Key, who recently left Valley View        Christian Church to found a new church with Ms. Miers and others,        stopped short, however, of saying that those beliefs would color her        approach to the law.     </p>     <p>       &quot;The Constitution would be her major influence, I'm sure,&quot; he said.      </p>     <p>       Ms. Miers' sister-in-law, state appellate Justice Elizabeth Lang-Miers        of the 5th Court of Appeals in Dallas, was circumspect in discussing Ms.        Miers' views on abortion or Roe vs. Wade, the ruling that legalized        abortion. &quot;I think her judicial philosophy will be to apply the law,&quot;        Justice Lang-Miers said.     </p>     <p>       Colleen Parro, a Dallas resident and executive director of the        Republican National Coalition for Life, said she agrees that a single        donation to an anti-abortion group indicates little about Ms. Miers'        philosophy.     </p>     <p>       &quot;That was a long time ago. It's pretty hard to know where she is today.        It's a blank slate, and I don't know what to expect now,&quot; Ms. Parro        said. &quot;We would have hoped the president would have chosen one of the        many strong candidates out there, and he didn't.&quot;     </p>     <p>       Operation Rescue, an anti-abortion group, urged rejection of Ms. Miers'        candidacy, calling her insufficiently conservative.     </p>     <p>       Abortion-rights groups expressed concern but stopped short of opposing        Ms. Miers.     </p>     <p>       &quot;The burden is on the Bush administration and Harriet Miers to prove to        the American people that she will respect and protect our fundamental        freedoms, including a woman's right to choose,&quot; said Nancy Keenan,        president of NARAL Pro-Choice America.     </p>     <p>       Ms. Miers is sure to be questioned on abortion by senators from both        parties at her confirmation hearing.     </p>     <p>       Kansas Republican Sen. Sam Brownback, a strong foe of abortion,        pointedly declined to issue a statement responding to the nomination.        And officials said state and local Republican leaders peppered the White        House with questions during a conference call, raising concerns about a        lack of a documented Miers record on abortion and about her overall        qualifications for the court.</p>
