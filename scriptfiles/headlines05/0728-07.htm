Opponents of President Bush launched a protest drive Wednesday urging court authorities to keep him from attending a November summit in Argentina, saying his presence would raise security concerns. <br><br>Lia Mendez, a candidate in Argentina's upcoming congressional elections, rallied with other members of the small Humanist Party outside the court complex where they sought a court order barring Bush from the Summit of the Americas. <br><br>Although analysts said the opposition drive had little chance of success, the protesters gained attention by handing out leaflets on the courthouse steps. <br><br>"Bush puts our lives in danger," said the leaflets. "Ask the courts to keep him out." <br><br>Mendez said she was afraid potential copies of the terrorist attacks in New York, London, Madrid and elsewhere would make it too dangerous to have Bush here. <br><br>Some 34 heads of state, including Bush, are expected for the fourth Summit of the Americas at the South Atlantic beach resort of Mar Del Plata, about 250 miles southwest of Buenos Aires. <br><br>Security plans for the summit are in the making, according to Jorge Taiana, a vice minister at the Foreign Ministry, who scoffed at the petition as "not very serious."
