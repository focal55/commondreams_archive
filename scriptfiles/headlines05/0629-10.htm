<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p>A Muslim extremist who spent nearly three years imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay was acquitted Wednesday of all terrorism-related charges by a court in Kuwait.<p>Nasser al-Mutairi, who was released in January only to face trial at home, was acquitted of joining foreign military forces without permission, harming Kuwait by serving the interest of a "foreign country" and undergoing illegal weapons training.<p>The charges do not name any particular country or force.<p>"The lawyer always told me I am innocent, and I expected to be acquitted," said al-Mutairi, 27, who had been free on bail.<p>Eleven other Kuwaitis are still being held at Guantanamo Bay, along with hundreds of others from more than 40 countries. Al-Mutairi said the court's decision would be "good news" for them and they too deserved to be acquitted.<p>Al-Mutairi's lawyer, Mubarak al-Shimmiri, had previously argued that Kuwait lacked jurisdiction to try the Kuwaiti national.<p>"He was acquitted because nothing could be proven against him," al-Shimmiri, told The Associated Press. The case against al-Mutairi was drawn fully from U.S. investigations, he added.<p>Al-Shimmiri praised Kuwait's judiciary for not being influenced by the "political" side of the case.<p>When his trial began in April, Al-Mutairi said he went to Afghanistan for charity work in 2000, before the U.S.-led war began in that country.<p>None of the alleged crimes took place in Kuwait and they were not punishable in Afghanistan at the time they were allegedly committed, according to al-Shimmiri.<p>This small oil-rich state in the Gulf has been a major U.S. ally since the American-led 1991 Gulf War that liberated it from a seven-month Iraqi occupation.<p>But some Muslim fundamentalist Kuwaitis oppose the U.S. military presence in the country. Militants have attacked Americans in Kuwait several times since 2002, killing on U.S. Marine and a civilian contracted to the military.<p>Scores of young Kuwaitis have fought alongside Muslim militants in Afghanistan, Bosnia, Chechnya and Iraq.</p><p align="center">&copy; 2005 Associated Press</p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable --></font></td></tr>
