<p> Tomorrow at 8.15am, a minute's silence will reverberate around the world. The people of Japan will commemorate the victims of the first atomic bomb, which was dropped by an American B-29 on Hiroshima on 6 August 1945. </p>

Half a world away, in Tehran, the new hard man of Iranian politics, 
  President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, will take the oath of office before the 
  country's parliament. His presidency heralds a new era of uncertainty in 
  Iran's fraught relations with the West over its nuclear ambitions.
</p>
<p>
  In Beijing, urgent talks on curbing North Korea's nuclear weapons program 
  are close to collapse. And in Pakistan, efforts are still being made to roll 
  up the world's biggest nuclear proliferation scandal. Sixty years after 
  Hiroshima, whose single bomb killed 237,062 people, a new nuclear arms race 
  has begun.
</p>
<p>
  A crisis is deepening with Iran over its suspected nuclear weapons 
  activities. Tehran is threatening to resume uranium conversion next week, 
  prompting an emergency meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency 
  which could result in Iran being referred to the UN Security Council for 
  possible sanctions.
</p>
<p>
  At the six-party talks in Beijing, North Korea is refusing to abandon a 
  nuclear weapons program that could lead to another mushroom cloud over 
  Asia.
</p>

<p>
  International investigators are struggling to wrap up the lucrative black 
  market that spread a web of proliferation across at least two continents 
  thanks to the greed of one man: the father of Pakistan's nuclear bomb.
</p>
<p>
  The scientist A Q Khan, who sold nuclear secrets to Iran, Libya, and 
  possibly others, is now under house arrest.
</p>
<p>
  Al-Qa'ida has still not been vanquished in its hideouts, while there are 
  still fears that the terrorists could be working on the production of a "
dirty" bomb that would spread radiation and panic in major cities.
</p>
<p>
  In the light of the war on Iraq, which did not have nuclear weapons, 
  second-tier nations have judged that North Korea was spared invasion because 
  of its nuclear deterrent, and drawn their own strategic conclusions.
</p>
<p>

  International attempts to renew a global pact banning the proliferation of 
  nuclear weapons have foundered. In short, the system of safeguards aimed at 
  preventing a repeat of the horrors of Hiroshima is in disarray.
</p>
<p>
  The review of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) by 189 states 
  collapsed two months ago amid recriminations and accusations that the 
  nuclear five had no intention of living up to their treaty commitments to 
  pursue nuclear disarmament.
</p>
<p>
  All signs are that the treaty intended to protect the world from nuclear 
  peril is dead. Pyongyang has pulled out, boasting that it now has nuclear 
  weapons, and other members such as Iran, Egypt and South Korea have been 
  caught cheating.
</p>
<p>
  But the regime had already been seriously undermined by states that remained 
  outside the NPT and became nuclear powers: Israel, India and Pakistan. The 
  NPT review at the UN in the spring provided a timely opportunity to tighten 
  nuclear safeguards. Instead, the month-long conference turned into a bitter 
  slanging match in which the US administration ignored its own record and 
  turned up the heat on Iran and North Korea.
</p>
<p>
  At the heart of the four-decades-old NPT is a "grand bargain". The 
  five nuclear powers - US, Britain, France, Russia and China - agreed to work 
  towards nuclear disarmament. In return, the non-nuclear states gave up any 
  ambition to develop nuclear weapons; they agreed to open up all their 
  facilities to inspection; and in return they were guaranteed the benefits of 
  peaceful nuclear technology.

</p>
<p>
  The big five have always been open to the charge of hypocrisy. Behind the 
  rhetoric of disarmament, they have tried everything in their power to 

  prevent second-tier powers from obtaining nuclear arms, while clinging on to 
  their own nuclear arsenals despite strategic cuts. Both the US and Britain 
  are upgrading: the Bush administration is developing nuclear "bunker 
  busters" that can strike deep underground, while Britain has ordered a 
  new generation of Trident missiles.
</p>
<p>
  With the NPT seriously weakened, the challenge now is to keep the genie in 
  the bottle, as regional rivalries in the Middle East and Asia risk going 
  nuclear.
</p>
<p>
  For the Bush administration, openly hostile to a UN solution, the answer has 
  been talk or bomb: negotiate with states that already have a weapon (such as 
  North Korea), or to take preemptive strikes against those that do not (such 
  as Iraq). US officials say acting outside the treaty has produced results: 
  it brought Libya back into the fold in 2003, when Colonel Muammar Gaddafi 
  decided to scrap his weapons of mass destruction.
</p>
<p>
  Yet this approach contains the risk of opening the path to nuclear 
  blackmail, which is how North Korea has coaxed the West into compensating 
  the hermit state in return for concessions on its nuclear program</p>

<p>
  As with Iran, negotiations have stalled on the North Korean insistence that 
  it has the right to a civilian program, if it renounces nuclear weapons.
</p>
<p>
  Iran, an NPT member which insists on its treaty right to pursue nuclear 
  power, has been infuriated by US co-operation with India, a non-member of 
  the NPT, which blasted its way into the nuclear "club" in 
  tit-for-tat tests with Pakistan in 1998.
</p>
<p>
  In a world no longer guided by a universally accepted regime, countries are 
  weighing the nuclear option. Arab states consider nuclear-armed Israel, and 
  are drawing their own conclusions. Iran is hemmed in by hostile neighbors 
  such as Israel and Pakistan. A nuclear test by North Korea could prompt 
  Taiwan and Japan to follow down that road.
</p>
<p>
  Preoccupied with Iraq, the US has decided to follow a diplomatic route in 
  dealing with Iran. But if the Security Council fails to reach agreement on 
  punishment for Tehran's infringement, the military option would loom again.
</p>
<p>

  Israel has made no secret of its intention to halt militarily the Iranian 
  nuclear weapons program, as it did when it struck Iraq's Osiraq reactor in 
  1981, delaying but not ending Saddam Hussein's nuclear quest. But if Israel 
  did strike, the Iranians could hit back anywhere in the region. Its nuclear 
  program would go underground, and the hand of the hardliners in Tehran 
  would be reinforced. As one expert put it, an Israeli attack would be "
  a free pass for the mullahs".
</p>
<p>
  The question now is whether nuclear deterrence works. The threat of American 
  nuclear attack, albeit veiled, did not deter Saddam Hussein from invading 
  Kuwait. On the other hand, North Korea's boasting of a nuclear arsenal saved 
  it from invasion. And nuclear weapons have not - yet - been used on the 
  battlefield.
</p>
<p>
  Today, the "official" nuclear powers could annihilate the world 
  many times over. And 40 other countries have the know-how to join their 
  club. Sixty years after Hiroshima, who can say with confidence: "Never 
  again"?
</p>
