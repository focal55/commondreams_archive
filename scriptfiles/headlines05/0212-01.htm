<p> CONCORD, New Hampshire - Leave it to Granny D to have the last word.
<P>   After undergoing throat surgery last week, there was concern the 95-year-old former U.S. Senate candidate might not speak again.

              Political activist Dorris Granny D Haddock, who ran for U.S. Senate last year, underwent throat surgery last week prompting concern that she would lose her voice. As of Thursday, the 95-year old was speaking again.<br>

But Doris ‘Granny D’ Haddock has no intention of losing her famous voice.
<P>   "I’m feeling very, very optimistic," she said from Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center. "I think I can lick this thing and I’m certainly going to try."
<P>   Haddock’s voice is raspy and she has difficulty speaking because of a breathing tube in her throat, but her genteel New England tones were still apparent in a brief interview Friday with The Associated Press.

<P>   "Four days ago she didn’t speak at all, three days ago it was like a real ugly Darth Vader and yesterday she started articulating enough so that you could understand everything she said," said her son, Jim Haddock.
<P>   The great-grandmother is in the habit of defying expectations. She jumped into the Senate race last year to try to unseat Judd Gregg, one of New Hampshire’s most popular and well-connected politicians, and came away with 34 percent of the vote. She campaigned on an anti-war, anti-corporate platform, refusing PAC donations and traveling across the state in a multicolored camper.
<P>   "If you want something done right today, you have to run for Congress yourself - or at least send your grandmother," she said at the time; her offbeat campaign caught the eye of the late photographer Richard Avedon, who photographed her for The New Yorker in one of his last projects.
<P>   Haddock became an activist for democracy late in life. At 89, she embarked on a cross-country walk to promote campaign finance reform. It took her 14 months to walk 3,200 miles from California to Washington, D.C.; she traveled as a pilgrim and took no food or shelter unless it was offered for free, she said. "And I never went without a meal, and I never went without a bed," she said.
<P>   Jim Haddock says his mother’s latest comeback is a relief.
<P>   "We call it ‘Granny D luck’ - it would always seem that Granny D luck plays into it one way or another," said her son, Jim Haddock. "I was terribly afraid that she wouldn’t dodge the bullet this time but she seemed to do it again."
