<p>With the final words "God bless everybody in here", Kenneth Boyd became the 1,000th prisoner to be put to death in the United States since capital punishment was reinstated nearly 30 years ago. Campaigners against the death penalty said his execution in North Carolina in the early hours of yesterday marked a macabre milestone. </p>

<p>There are signs, however, that public opinion on the issue is shifting. The 
  most recent polls suggest public support for the death penalty is falling 
  sharply. A Gallup poll in October, suggests that 64 per cent of Americans 
  support the death penalty - down from 80 per cent in 1994. But the figure of 
  64 per cent falls to just 50 per cent when the alternative of life without 
  parole is presented.
</p>
<p>
  "I think there are a number of reasons for it," said Brenda Soder, 
  of the <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/" target="_new">Death Penalty Information Center</a> in Washington. "Juries are more 
  reluctant to impose death penalties, partly because almost every state now 
  has the option of life without parole ... There have also been 122 cases of 
  prisoners [on death row] being shown to be innocent."
</p>
<p>
  The death penalty was reinstated by the Supreme Court in 1976 after a 
  10-year moratorium. The first execution was carried out the following year 
  when Gary Gilmore was put to death by a firing squad in Utah.
</p>
<p>
  In recent years the Supreme Court has tightened the application of capital 
  punishment and has ruled that both the mentally retarded and prisoners who 
  were minors when they committed the crime for which they were sentenced 
  should not be put to death.
</p>
<p>
  In an interview this week, Kenneth Boyd, 57, who was sentenced to death for 
  the 1988 murders of his estranged wife and her father, said he did not want 
  to be remembered as the 1,000th person to be put to death. He told the 
  Associated Press news agency: "I'd hate to be remembered as that. I 
  don't like the idea of being picked as a number."

</p>
<p>
  Boyd was pronounced dead at 2.15am. His execution took place after both the 
  Supreme Court and the Governor of North Carolina declined to intervene.
</p>
<p>
  After the execution by lethal injection, Boyd's lawyer, Thomas Maher, said: "
The execution of Kenneth Boyd has not made this a better or safer world. If 
  this 1,000th execution is a milestone, it's a milestone we should all be 
  ashamed of."
</p>
<p>
  During the 1988 shootings, Boyd's son Christopher was pinned under his 
  mother's body as Boyd shot her with a .357-calibre Magnum. The boy was able 
  to push his way under a bed to escape and another son grabbed the gun while 
  Boyd tried to reload.
</p>
<p>
  The prosecutor, Belinda Foster, said the evidence of the crime supported a 
  death sentence. "He went out and reloaded and came back and called 911 
  and said 'I've shot my wife and her father, come on and get me'," she 
  said. "And then we heard more gunshots. It was on the 911 tape."
</p>

<p>
  Sam Page, the Rockingham County Sheriff, was among the witnesses who watched 
  Boyd die. Afterwards, he said: "Tonight, justice has been served for Mr 
  Kenneth Boyd. What I would ask you to do is not forget the victims of this 
  crime, Ms Boyd, Mr Curry, their family, their kids, their grandkids. Pray 
  for them. Pray for them and their healing."
</p>
<p>
  Attention on Boyd and his distinction of being the 1,000 prisoner to be 
  executed is already moving on. Execution number 1,001 was scheduled to take 
  place last night in South Carolina where Shawn Humphries was to be put to 
  death for the murder of a store worker in 1994.
</p>
<p>
  Amnesty International says executions were carried out in 25 countries last 
  year, with 97 per cent of all death sentences being imposed out in just four 
  - China, Iran, Vietnam and the US. The majority were carried out in China.
</p>
<p>
  Amnesty said capital punishment was prohibited in 86 countries and rarely 
  imposed in another 25 countries. It is still used in 85 countries, although 
  in 11 of those nations it is limited to "exceptional crimes" such 
  as war crimes.

  <b>High-profile inmates</b>
</p>
<p>
  * KENNY RICHEY
</p>
<p>
  Richey, a Briton whose death sentence was overturned earlier this year, 
  could return to death row after the Supreme Court ruled that a lower court 
  had erred when it declared that the 41-year-old had not received a fair 
  trial. Richey, born in Scotland and convicted of an arson attack in Ohio 
  which killed a young girl, has always maintained his innocence.
</p>
<p>
  * 'TOOKIE' WILLIAMS 
</p>
<p>

  Stanley "Tookie" Williams, the founder of the Crips street gang in 
  Los Angeles, has spent 24 years on death row. He was convicted of the 
  murders of three people in 1979 and is due to be executed on 13 December.
</p>
<p>
  * ROBIN LOVITT
</p>
<p>
  Lovitt was to have been the 1,000th prisoner put to death but the Governor 
  of Virginia commuted his sentence this week to life without parole. Lovitt 
  was convicted in 2000 of murdering a pool hall employee during a robbery. 
  Clemency was granted because evidence from the trial was "improperly 
  destroyed".
</p>
<p>
  * DARYL ATKINS
</p>
<p>
  In June 2002 the Supreme Court ended the death penalty for the mentally 
  retarded. The issue focused on the case of a convicted killer, Daryl Atkins. 
  But this August a court ruled that Atkins was not mentally retarded and a 
  judge set an execution date.
