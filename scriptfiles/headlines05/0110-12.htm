<p>Holding up homemade protest signs, their noses running and shifting from foot-to-foot to keep warm, a small group of people huddled on the downtown Stevens Point street corner of Strongs Avenue and Main Street as they do every Friday.

<P>Holding a cardboard sign with water-smudged greenish black letters that reads "Bring the troops home immediately," Jim Missey, 69, is a fixture of the protest that has gone on for almost two years since the war in Iraq.

<P>From 3:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. on almost every Friday, Missey has stood on the street corner, with whoever chooses to join him in opposition of the war in Iraq.

<P>"I do it to make clear where I stand," he said. "If others want to join - that's great. If others want to protest the protesters, I'll listen to them."
Richard Kovac, 60, of Stevens Point was at Missey's side Friday afternoon as well as vacationing college students Evan Weitz, 19, of Plover and Adam Vannieuwenhoven, 19, of Whiting.

<P>Though Kovac has protested with Missey on the Iraq war and other causes, the two students joined the protest after they passed Missey the week before.

<P>Weitz joined the protest because he feels people don't speak out on the war and he wanted to stop and lend his support.

<P>"If nothing else, they're at least making their opinion known," Weitz said of his fellow protesters.

<P>At it's strongest, about 20 to 30 people have protested on the corner, but on some days, it's just Missey.

<P>Much of the feedback to the protesters comes in the form of thumbs up, horn honking, two fingers for peace and people who simply say they agree.

<P>"Thank you, thank you, thank you," James Ramsden, 68, of Stevens Point said as he passed.

<P>Stephen Larsen, 18, who recently moved to Stevens Point stopped by the protesters and agreed the United States shouldn't be in Iraq, but should be in Afghanistan. Larsen even wants to join the Armed Forces to fight Al Qaeda in Afghanistan.

<P>"It's a little payback issue," he said.

<P>On Sept. 11, 2001, Larsen's great aunt was killed serving coffee on the 73rd floor of the north tower of the World Trade Center.

<P>Though the protesters see most people who respond to them show signs of support, about one in five vehemently disagrees with them.

<P>About two months ago, Missey recalls a man who argued with the protesters for 45 minutes and said soldiers are fighting the Iraq war for the rights of people in the United States. After the argument, Missey suggested everybody shake hands, the man agreed to and apologized for yelling at them.

<P>Missey, a former University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point English professor, has been a pacifist since he was a freshman in college.
In his time as a protester, he has been taken to jail four times for charges like trespassing. When he sat on the steps of the local Armed Forces recruiting office in the 1980s to protest U.S. involvement in Central America, he went to jail for two days.

<P>"I looked at it as an opportunity to get into my cell and do some reading," he said.

<P>A self-professed semi-hermit, Missey said the inmates around him started talking to him and he couldn't get much reading done.

<P>In addition to his regular protests, for about a year and a half Missey has refused to pay federal taxes on his phone bill and every month with his payment check - minus what would go toward taxes - he encloses a letter explaining why he chooses not to.

<P>He also gives as much money as he can afford to charity so he can deduct it from his income tax payments.

<P>Missey believes war in all forms violates a universal rule that human beings should not kill each other and the use of non-violent resistance is a better way to end conflicts.

<P>That's far more powerful than the use of violence," he said.

<P>Whether the protesters change the minds of others, Missey stands on the street corner with his sign simply to say he won't acquiesce to the war.

<P>Especially on days when the weather is below freezing and then some, Missey believes pacifists should brave the adverse weather because people in the military have to experience greater hardships.<p align="center">Copyright &copy; 2005 Wisconsin Rapids Daily Tribune</p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable --></font></td></tr>
