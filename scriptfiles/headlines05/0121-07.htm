<P> WASHINGTON  - Federal Communications Commission Chairman Michael Powell said on Friday he plans to resign after four years of mixed success in pushing a deregulatory approach to the telecommunications and media industries.

<P>Powell, the son of retiring Secretary of State Colin Powell, failed to relax ownership restrictions on media conglomerates, but eventually was able to ease telephone network sharing rules. He was also pushed by his fellow commissioners to crack down on indecent antics on television and radio.

<P>But the 41-year-old Republican persuaded the FCC to avoid regulating new services like high-speed Internet, or broadband; pushed through requirements aimed at accelerating the transition to digital television and backed allowing consumers to take their phone numbers with them when they switch carriers.

<P>Powell told Reuters that he would leave after the FCC's March 10 meeting and was satisfied he had largely completed the agenda he set when he became chairman.

<P>"I'm a big believer that you ought to set a mission for yourself and when you complete it, you should move on to other challenges," said Powell.

<P>He said he has no immediate plans for the future and might someday run for political office. Some speculate Powell may become president of his alma mater, the College of William & Mary, in Williamsburg, Virginia.

<P>Possible successors at the FCC could include current Republican Commissioner Kevin Martin, former Texas Public Utility Commission Chair Becky Klein, Earl Comstock, an aide to former Sen. Ted Stevens, and Michael Gallagher, the head of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, according to analysts and others.

<P>"Whoever his replacement, we do not expect fundamental changes in FCC policy that has generally been moving in a deregulatory direction," said brokerage firm Legg Mason in a research note.

<P>LOOSE ENDS

<P>Before he leaves, Powell said he planned to tie up some loose ends on the transition to digital television and answer lingering questions about what regulations apply to new services like Internet telephone service.

<P>The FCC chairman has received praise from most companies for his approach. But consumer groups have criticized him for attempting to allow media conglomerates to grow bigger and reducing competition among wireless providers.

<P>He expressed some regret that he was unable to finish new media ownership rules. An appeals court put on hold his attempt to allow media companies to own more television stations as well as own a newspaper, television station and radio outlets in a single market.

<P>He was also undermined by Martin's 2003 vote against his plan to ease local telephone network sharing rules. A federal court struck down stricter rules that had been enacted, and the agency recently approved new regulations that Powell said tracked his earlier effort.

<P>"At the end of the day, while we lost a little time, we got it done," he said.

<P>Powell emphasized his efforts to clear hurdles for new technologies like broadband over powerlines and wireless high-speed Internet, as well as finding more airwaves for commercial wireless services.

<P>"It is the single driving focus of our agenda, getting the law right to stimulate innovative technologies and put more power in the hands of consumers," he said.

<P>Lately, the FCC was perhaps best known for cracking down on indecent antics on television and radio, levying a record $550,000 fine on CBS stations that aired pop singer Janet Jackson exposing her breast during last year's Super Bowl football game.

<P>Powell had planned on following his father's military career, entering the U.S. Army. But a jeep accident in Germany in 1987 almost killed him, requiring 18 units of blood during extensive surgery.

<P>After a long rehabilitation, he went to law school, clerked for a federal judge, became chief of staff at the Justice Department's antitrust division, and was appointed in 1997 as a FCC commissioner by then-President Bill Clinton.
