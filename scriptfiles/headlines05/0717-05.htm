<p>PESHAWAR, Pakistan  --
During three years in Guantanamo Bay, Abdul Rahim Muslim Dost says 
that poetry kept him from losing his sanity. By the time of his release this 
spring, he had written more than 25,000 lines in his Cuban prison cell.
<P>During the first year of his imprisonment, the 44-year-old Afghan 
prisoner didn't even have paper or a pen. Instead, he scratched lines of verse 
with his fingernail into Styrofoam cups. 
<P>One poem reads: "Just as the heart beats in the darkness of the body, so 
I, despite this cage, continue to beat with life. Those who have no courage or 
honor consider themselves free, but they are slaves. I am flying on the wings 
of thought, and so, even in this cage, I know a greater freedom." 
<P>"Poetry was our support and psychological uplift," said his brother and 
fellow Guantanamo inmate, Badruzamman Badr, in an interview at the family home 
in the Pakistani city of Peshawar, where they have lived as expatriates since 
1975. "Many people have lost their minds there. I know 40 or 50 prisoners who 
are mad. But we took refuge in our minds." 
<P>Dost was already a respected religious scholar, poet, journalist and 
author of 19 published books before his arrest about a month after the Sept. 
11 attacks. His prison writings would significantly increase that number, he 
said.
<P>Along with thousands of poems in his native Pashto, he completed a book 
intended for future poets with an alphabetical list of all the rhymes in the 
Pashto language. He also wrote a book of Islamic jurisprudence in verse form 
and translated Arabic poetry into Pashto.
<P>Both brothers deny that they ever supported al Qaeda. They admit they 
felt initial enthusiasm for the Taliban but say they became disillusioned with 
the unworldly attitudes of the movement, particularly its opposition to the 
education of women.
<P>Instead, they say, their arrest by Pakistani intelligence officers on Nov.
17, 2001, was an attempt by their political enemies to frame them. Both are 
proponents of Pashtun nationalism, a movement to create an independent state 
for ethnic Pashtun tribes on both sides of the Afghan-Pakistan border, and 
wrote for three magazines that promoted the cause. 

<P>After their arrest, they were held for three months in Peshawar, then 
transferred to U.S. custody at Bagram Air Base outside Kabul and to a 
detention facility in Kandahar, in southeastern Afghanistan, before being 
flown to the U.S. Naval base lockup at Guantanamo Bay on May 1, 2002.
<P>U.S. authorities in Pakistan declined to comment about the case, but 
Pakistan Embassy spokesman Zafar Ali Khan said: "In late 2001, the Pakistani 
authorities had good reason to be suspicious of them. The authorities were 
receiving guidelines on people that the Americans wished to question. Many 
Afghans who had been involved in terrorist activities in Afghanistan had moved 
to Peshawar at that time. These two men were arrested and passed to the 
Americans. The U.S. has subsequently questioned them and established during 
the past three long years that they were, in fact, innocent.'' 
<P>So far, 234 suspected "enemy combatants" have been freed from Guantanamo 
and 520 remain imprisoned, said Maj. Susan Idziak, a spokesperson for the 
detention facility.
<P>Although Dost, who was freed in April, is happy to be home with his wife 
and eight children, he frets about the whereabouts of his poems. To date, he 
has received about 2,500 lines from the U.S. military.
<P>His concern that his poems and other writings may never be returned is 
not surprising, since he took particular pleasure in composing satirical 
verses at the expense of his captors. In one 14-line poem, he compared 
Guantanamo to the monotonous bowls of boiled rice and black beans that made up 
the prison diet.
<P>"He said that the food was like the prisoners. Black and white, good and 
bad mixed up together without distinction, without verification. It was 
expressed in a very comic way," said his brother. "Many prisoners learned this 
poem. We whispered the lines to each other." 
<P>In another poem popular with his fellow prisoners, he satirized what the 
prisoners saw as the sexless appearance of their male and female guards. Short-
haired women and clean-shaven men in their identical fatigues often seemed 
indistinguishable to Muslim prisoners, used to men with long beards and fully 
cloaked women, Badr said.
<P>The last line of the poem read: "They may have weapons and missiles, but 
we can find no sign of manhood in this army."
<P>U.S. Army linguists read all the poetry found in Dost's cell, Badr said. 
<P>"In interrogation, the Americans often said to him, 'We understand the 
allusions in your poetry.' "
<P>Capt. Jeffrey Weir, a Guantanamo spokesman, said he could not comment on 
when Dost's writings would be returned to him but said documents are subject 
to "intelligence screening." Petty Officer Chris Sherwood, a spokesman for 
Southern Command in Miami, which oversees Guantanamo, said "inmates' mail is 
translated, and any information considered sensitive for security reasons is 
blacked out before it is sent.''
<P>Dost says he was interrogated more than 100 times at Guantanamo but was 
never subjected to physical torture in Cuba. Although he never witnessed 
desecration of the Quran at Guantanamo, he said an Arab prisoner had told him 
interrogators threw a Quran on the floor and stepped on it.
<P>Both brothers say they suffered harsher treatment at detention facilities 
in Afghanistan, including intimidation with dogs and sleep deprivation. There 
and on three occasions, they say, they were photographed naked and had their 
beards and hair shaved. They also saw guards there kick the Quran. Such 
treatment was in contrast to the latter stages of their time in Guantanamo, 
when they say conditions improved steadily.
<P>"The Americans gave me books toward the end,'' said Badr, who speaks 
English fluently. ''I read Ernest Hemingway and Charles Dickens." 
<P>He added: "We don't hate the U.S. for being Americans,'' he added. 
"Hating a nation for being a nation is completely wrong. We criticize America 
if we don't agree with their policies."
<P>In his cell, Dost wrote thousands of lines in a strict Pashto form of 
poetry somewhat similar to the sonnet: 14 lines of 14 syllables, rhyming 
alternately after an opening couplet. A year after his imprisonment, when the 
detainees began receiving paper and pencils from the International Committee 
of the Red Cross, he was able to accelerate his output.

<P>Other prisoners also composed verse, he said, including Mullah Abdul 
Salaam Zaeef, the former Taliban ambassador to Pakistan, who destroyed all his 
religious poetry before a room search by the prison authorities, fearing it 
might be used in evidence against him. 
<P>For the major Muslim feast of Eid last year, Dost composed a poem written 
from the viewpoint of a child of a Guantanamo inmate. 
<P>Part of it read: "Eid has come, but my father has not. He is not come 
from Cuba. I am eating the bread of Eid with my tears. I have nothing. Why am 
I deprived of the love of my father? Why am I so oppressed?"
<P>When he read it aloud, many of his fellow inmates wept. 
<P>Yet as he received a steady stream of guests in the library of his large 
Peshawar home, Dost was surprisingly magnanimous about his experience in 
Guantanamo.
<P>"The positives have outweighed the negatives," he said. "I was not 
unhappy for being detained because I learned a lot. I wrote from the core of 
my heart in Guantanamo Bay. In the outside world I could not have written such 
things."<p align="center">&copy; Copyright 2005 San Francisco Chronicle</p>
