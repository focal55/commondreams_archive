<p>LOGAR, Afghanistan  - Demonstrations spread in  Afghanistan on Thursday over a report that U.S. interrogators  at Guantanamo Bay had desecrated the Koran, and officials said  three protesters were killed.<p> 
			
			Several hundred students shouting "Death to America" held a  peaceful protest in the capital, Kabul, but elsewhere  demonstrations turned violent, a day after four people were  killed and 70 wounded in riots in the eastern city of  Jalalabad.<p>

Angry villagers in a district southwest of Jalalabad, some  of them armed, tried to march to the city but were blocked by  police, officials and witnesses said.<p> 
			
			Protesters threw stones at police and eventually gunfire  broke out and two protesters were killed, said district chief  Muhammad Omar.<p> 
			
			"The protesters were armed but they didn't fire at police,"  said villager Shair Ali.<p> 
			
			Newsweek magazine said in a recent edition that  investigators probing abuses at the U.S. military prison in  Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, had found interrogators "had placed  Korans on toilets, and in at least one case flushed a holy book  down the toilet."<p> 
			
			Muslims consider the Koran the literal word of God and  treat each book with deep reverence.<p> 
			
			Protests over the report began in Jalalabad on Tuesday. The  following day police fired on crowds after government offices  were set on fire, shops looted and U.N. buildings and  diplomatic missions attacked.<p> 
			
			Elsewhere on Thursday, protesters attacked police and  government offices in Wardak province, southwest of Kabul.<p> 
			
			An ammunition store was torched and exploded, killing one  protester and wounding four, said Interior Ministry spokesman  Lutfullah Mashal.<p> 
			
			Hundreds of protesters in Logar province, 50 km (30 miles)  south of Kabul, blocked the main road and chanted "Death to  Bush" and "Long live Islam."<p> 
			
			Armed with clubs and stones, they damaged police vehicles,  a government office, just opened by President Hamid Karzai last  week, and an office of the CARE aid group, witnesses said.<p> 
			
			Police on rooftops ducked behind walls to avoid stones,  firing into the air to scatter the protesters, who regrouped  and hurled stones again. Several police were hurt.<p> 
			
			U.S. and other foreign troops have not been involved in  policing the protests, leaving that to Afghan authorities.<p> 
			
			
<p> 
			
			"<b>REPUGNANT DESECRATION"</b>
<p> 
			
			The United States has sought to defuse the anger over the  Koran report by emphasising its outrage and promising that the  allegation would be investigated.<p> 
			
			"A desecration of religious texts and objects is repugnant  to common values and anathema to the American people," State  Department spokesman Richard Boucher said in Washington.<p> 
			
			The United States commands a foreign force in Afghanistan  of about 18,300, most of them American, fighting Taliban  insurgents and hunting Taliban and al Qaeda leaders, including  Osama bin Laden, architect of the Sept. 11 attacks on U.S.  cities.<p> 
			
			The United States is holding more than 500 prisoners from  its war on terrorism at the naval base on Cuba. Many of them  were detained in Afghanistan after U.S.-led troops drove the  Taliban from power in 2001.<p> 
			
			Kabul students burned an American flag and shouted slogans  against the United States as well as Karzai and his U.S.-backed  government. They demanded punishment for those they believed  desecrated the Koran.<p> 
			
			Apart from Kabul, protests have flared in predominantly  ethnic Pashtun areas. The Taliban drew most support from  conservative Pashtun clans in the south and east. Pashtuns are  Afghanistan's largest ethnic group.<p> 
			
			An Afghan analyst said Muslim outrage over the desecration  report sparked the protests, not hatred of America.<p> 
			
			"Afghan people don't have anti-American feeling but some  Afghans might be angry with the behavior of American troops,"  said Qasim Akhgar a writer and human rights worker.<p> 
			
			Outside powers might also meddle, he said.
<p> 
			
			The United Nations said preparations for a September  election would not be disrupted.
