 Thousands of demonstrators will march this afternoon to the edge of the site where world leaders will gather for the G8 summit.

<p>Tayside police said the G8 Alternatives march to Gleneagles Hotel would be going ahead, at a time yet to be confirmed. The decision came despite an earlier police decision to cancel the demonstration amid concern for public safety.

<p>But a police spokeswoman said: "We have been in negotiations with G8 Alternatives and have decided that people already in Auchterarder as well as those who have been stuck getting here will be allowed to protest."

<p>Organisers of the march welcomed the change of heart, and said they had threatened to stage a protest in Edinburgh if the ban had not been reversed.

<p>A spokesman for the Stop The War Coalition said: "It would have been an incredibly damaging blow to civil liberties in this country if the march had not been allowed to go ahead. The police created a very dangerous situation."

<p>Tayside police spokeswoman added that police were advising further protesters not to travel to Auchterarder and that police would be turning back traffic attempting to reach the village.

<p>At 1.15pm around 15 buses filled with protesters made their way down the main street in Auchterarder. They were greeted with cheers from the hundreds of people who had already gathered in the nearby park.

<p>A spokesman for protest organisers G8 Alternatives, Aamer Anwar, said: "I want people to get on their mobile phones and tell their friends in the buses and the cars that we, the people, are marching on George Bush, Tony Blair and G8."

<p>Peter Wilson, chief constable of Fife constabulary, told the BBC that giving the go-ahead to the march was a very difficult decision.

<p>"The police view here is to try to allow people to protest peacefully," he said. "But they have to do it in a way that they can also say they took into account the citizens locally as well as the democratic need."

<p>At Auchterarder, Niklas Romersurchen, a protester from Cologne, said: "I'm here for the peaceful barricade".

<p>Mr Romersurchen said he arrived in Scotland on Monday and has spent the last two days at the demonstrations at the Faslane nuclear base and the Dungavel asylum seeker detention centre.

<p>"I think it is important to show not everyone accepts capitalism is the new world order, and that there are alternatives. Money is not the only way in the world."

<p>Earlier police sealed off Auchterarder, the nearest town to Gleneagles, where G8 leaders are meeting, after hundreds of protesters clashed with riot police in Stirling and attacked shops and other businesses ahead of the summit.

<p>Running battles were fought with police as groups of demonstrators smashed cars with iron bars and shattered the windows of a Burger King.

<p>Anarchists dressed in hooded tops with scarves obscuring their faces hurled missiles at police officers and barricaded roads.

<p>The M9, the major road through central Scotland which leads to Gleneagles, was brought to a standstill as protesters staged blockades.

<p>Trouble erupted in Stirling early today as protesters began moving from an "eco-camp" where they had been based for the last week. Masked activists rampaged through residential areas, smashing windows and wrenching satellite dishes from walls. <p align="CENTER">&copy; 2005 Guardian Newspapers, Ltd.<p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable --></font></td></tr>
