<P>WASHINGTON - Many homeless shelters and soup kitchens faced with more requests for emergency services are turning people away because they lack the beds, food and money to meet the demand, says a survey from an advocacy group for low-income Americans.


	 

<P>The report being released Tuesday by the National Student Campaign Against Hunger & Homelessness found a 28 percent rise last year in emergency food assistance requests, and a 27 percent increase in requests for emergency shelter.

<P>The organization surveyed 900 agencies in 32 states and gathered information from urban and rural areas. About one-quarter of the emergency food providers said they had to turn away requests for food because of a lack of resources.

<P>And three-quarters of emergency shelter providers reported turning people away for the same reason.

<P>Kathleen Barr, the report's author, said the Bush administration's 2006 budget proposal hurts many programs aimed at low-income Americans and could set back emergency assistance providers further.

<P>"It's hurting their ability to help folks," said Barr, who added that private donations of time and money weren't enough to keep pace.

<P>Unemployment and wages too low to afford enough food are among the main reasons that people seek help from shelters and soup kitchens, Barr said.

<P>Many people are also hampered by high housing costs that force them to spend more than 30 percent of their income on the rent or mortgage payment, said Susan Ban, executive director for ShelterCare, a Eugene, Ore., organization that provides emergency shelter for families with children who are homeless.

<P>The Housing and Urban Development Department on Monday pointed to a growing thicket of regulatory barriers at the state and local level as a main obstacle for building more affordable housing.

<P>Among the concerns listed by HUD Secretary Alphonso Jackson were slow permitting procedures and complex environmental regulations that can significantly increase the length and cost of home building review and approval processes.

<P>The administration has also proposed a a $200 million increase, to $1.4 billion, for a program which helps move chronically homeless persons into permanent housing with supportive services.

<P>Barr criticized President Bush  for proposing to slash money for community development programs aimed at improving low- and moderate-income areas by about $2 billion, leaving $3.7 billion.

<P>The findings showed a larger increase in demand for food and shelter than results from a separate study by the U.S. Conference of Mayors in December.

<P>That study, based on a survey of 27 large cities, found that requests for food rose 14 percent, while appeals for shelter increased 6 percent. <p align="center"> &copy; 2005 The Associated Press</p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable --></font></td></tr>
