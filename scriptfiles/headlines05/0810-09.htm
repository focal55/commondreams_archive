HAVANA  - Cuba said Wednesday that it was a "happy day" on the island when a U.S. federal appeals court decided to throw out convictions and sentences for five Cuban intelligence agents.

A statement on the front page of the Communist Party daily Granma called the Tuesday ruling "ethical" and urged Cubans to be patient as the men, known locally as the "Five Heroes," prepare for a new trial.
<P>
"The wait has been long ... and there's no doubt that it will continue to be so," the newspaper said. "It is not easy to overcome a wall of prejudice and blasphemy created over 45 years."
<P>
The ruling by a three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta said the men's trial in Miami wasn't fair and impartial because of community prejudice against President Fidel Castro, who assumed power in 1959. The panel ordered a new trial for the five men.
<P>
"Free of the pressures and blackmail of an environment contaminated by the furious hate of an extremist minority, the process can now move ahead with better fortune," the newspaper said.
<P>

Rene Gonzalez, Ramon Labanino, Gerardo Fernandez, Fernando Gonzalez and Antonio Guerrero were convicted in June 2001 of serving as unregistered agents of a foreign government.
<P>
Three were also convicted of espionage conspiracy for efforts to penetrate U.S. military bases even though they received no U.S. secrets.
<P>
One, Gerardo Hernandez, was also found guilty of murder conspiracy in the deaths of four Miami-based pilots whose small, private planes were shot down Feb. 24, 1996, by a Cuban MiG in international waters off Cuba's northern coast.
<P>
All five acknowledge being Cuban agents but said they were spying on "terrorist" exile groups opposed to Castro, not the U.S. government.
<P>
Three men received life sentences, one was sentenced to 19 years in prison and the other got 15 years.
<P>
"We have felt indebted for their generous sacrifices, and for that reason today we hug each other and celebrate," the newspaper statement said.
<P>
Parliament Speaker Ricardo Alarcon earlier embraced the ruling as well, but insisted the men should be released while awaiting a new trial.
<P>
Alarcon said the decision vindicated his government, which has run a high-profile campaign on the island and abroad promoting the five men as victims of anti-Cuban bias in southern Florida.</p><p align="center">&copy; 2005 Associated Press</p>
