<p> WASHINGTON -- The only presidential library under strictly private control, the Richard M. Nixon Library and Birthplace in Yorba Linda, Calif., markets itself as "a family attraction" rather than a research center. The papers and tapes that document the work of the only president to resign his office remain at the National Archives in College Park, Md., as required by a 1974 law aimed at preventing their destruction.

<P>After heavy lobbying by Mr. Nixon's relatives and friends, Congress lifted that requirement last year, opening the way for what was expected to be the transfer of the Nixon materials to Yorba Linda under the professional control of the National Archives.

<P>ut those plans have been put in doubt by a furor over the Nixon Library's cancellation of a scholarly conference on President Nixon and the Vietnam War planned as the first event there to include historians who have written critically of his record.

<P>The dispute over Mr. Nixon's image and legacy echoes past struggles between scholars and relatives over other presidents' records. But all other presidential libraries are now controlled by the National Archives, whose staff members oversee the collections.

<P>"I think the conflict is about trying to grapple with Nixon's legacy in an honest way," said Laura McEnaney, a historian at Whittier College who planned the now-canceled Vietnam conference. "This conference was supposed to announce that the library was becoming a legitimate academic institution."

<P>The American Library Association and 16 historians who had been invited to speak at the April conference wrote to Congressional committees on Thursday to ask that the papers and tapes not be turned over to the Nixon Library unless stronger guarantees of public access are written into law.

<P>Accusing the library of "unprofessional conduct," the historians said Congress should suspend funding for the transfer and hold hearings on the future of the Nixon collection. The letter also proposed that Congress require independent review boards at each presidential library to resolve disputes over researchers' access to records.

<P>"The issue here is not so much the conference itself but the appearance that the Nixon Library is willing to abrogate commitments," wrote Lynne E. Bradley, director of government relations for the library association.

<P>John H. Taylor, executive director of the Nixon Library, denied that any political consideration led to the cancellation, which he attributed solely to the fear of a low turnout and resulting financial loss.

<P>In any case, he said, the Nixon Foundation, which operates the library, "is unwaveringly committed to free, full, total and unmediated access" to all Nixon records transferred to Yorba Linda. "Let the chips fall where they may," he said.

<P>But Thomas S. Blanton, director of the private National Security Archive at George Washington University and a signer of the letter, said the Nixon Library remained a "theme park and propaganda facility" with no interest in objective history.

<P>The library's Web site currently features a birthday celebration for Pat Nixon, the former first lady, who died in 1993, and a remembrance for Rose Mary Woods, Mr. Nixon's longtime secretary.

<P>"Taylor said that with the Vietnam conference, the library was going to turn over a new leaf," Mr. Blanton said. "Well, it turned out to be a fig leaf."

<P>Mr. Blanton said historians still did not have access to about 800 hours of tapes and 50,000 documents withheld by the Nixon estate on the grounds that they deal with personal or political, rather than presidential, matters.

<P>The battle over the image of the 37th president began long before his 1994 death and has at times put Mr. Nixon's daughters at odds, with Tricia Nixon Cox advocating tighter family control of the presidential records and Julie Nixon Eisenhower pushing for more involvement of professional archivists. Court-ordered mediation in 2002 resolved their two-year dispute over how to spend a $20 million bequest to the library from Mr. Nixon's friend Bebe Rebozo.

<P>Dr. McEnaney, who signed the letter to Congress, said Mr. Taylor had proposed the conference last year but appeared to get cold feet last fall after seeing the list of speakers she proposed for the "Nixon as Commander in Chief" conference scheduled for April 28-29.

<P>The invitees were a cross section of respected scholars but included some whose writings were extremely critical of Mr. Nixon, notably Stanley I. Kutler, who sued for access to the Nixon tapes in 1992 and wrote a book about them titled "Abuse of Power."

<P>"Bringing Kutler to the library was going to be like Nixon going to China," Dr. McEnaney said.

<P>Last week, Mr. Taylor canceled the event, saying that 10,000 invitations had resulted in only 7 people who had signed up and paid the $180 fee. Dr. McEnaney said she believed the claimed low turnout was a pretext for the cancellation, saying the library had done little to promote the event.

<P>"Not a single academic historian had received the brochure except the participants," she said.
