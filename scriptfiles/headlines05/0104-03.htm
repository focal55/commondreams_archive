<p>KUWAIT CITY  - Staunch US ally Kuwait uncovered a cell in its army that was plotting to attack American and other foreign forces in the emirate, the defence minister said, amid suspicions the group could be linked to Al-Qaeda.</p>
<p>"It was the coalition forces and certainly the American army targetted because it is the largest," Sheikh Jaber al-Mubarak al-Sabah told AFP.</p>
<p>"The number of those (still) arrested are two to three people," he said, a day after Kuwait announced it was questioning an undisclosed number of soldiers planning to attack "friendly forces" in the country.</p>
<p>Kuwaiti authorities are investigating "suspicions" that the soldiers could be linked to Al-Qaeda, the minister said, declining at this stage to associate the suspects with the terror network.</p>
<p>"As long as it is under investigation, we cannot say this. No, I don't say Al-Qaeda (for sure) as long as there is an interrogation going on," the minister said when asked if the group had links to Al-Qaeda.</p>
<p>Al-Siyassa newspaper, quoting "well-informed sources", reported Tuesday that the arrested soldiers "include a number of officers ... and they belong ideologically to the Al-Qaeda organisation."</p>
<p>US forces and civilians in Kuwait, which served as the main launchpad for the March 2003 invasion of Iraq, have been the target of a number of brazen attacks, two of them fatal.</p>
<p>A US Marine was killed and another wounded in an attack by two Kuwaiti gunmen on Failaka island, east of the capital, in October 2002. The two assailants were subsequently killed.</p>

<p>Two US soldiers travelling on a highway south of Kuwait City in a civilian vehicle the following November were wounded when a Kuwaiti policeman shot them at point blank range.</p>
<p>A Kuwaiti has been sentenced to life in prison for killing an American civilian contractor and wounding another in a highway ambush in January 2003 near a US army camp north of Kuwait City.</p>
<p>Four US soldiers were slightly wounded when shots were fired at their vehicles in December 2003. The assailant was arrested.</p>
<p>Twenty-two members of a group accused of recruiting fighters for Iraq are currently on trial in Kuwait.</p>
<p>Around 25,000 US soldiers are stationed in Kuwait. But the emirate is also the main transit point for the coalition forces travelling to and from Iraq.</p>
<p>British, Polish, Japanese, Hungarian and South Korean soldiers are among coalition troops who are based in desert camps in Kuwait for as long as a week on their way into and out of Iraq.</p>
<p>A Kuwaiti security source told AFP Monday that the soldiers' arrests followed the extradition from Syria of a Kuwaiti who was heading for Iraq to fight American forces there.</p>
<p>Al-Rai Al-Aam newspaper claimed the group was planning to attack US forces during the Muslim Eid al-Adha feast around January 21.</p>
<p>Quoting security sources, it said members of the group had links with former servicemen who fought in Afghanistan and Chechnya and were dismissed from the Kuwaiti army.</p>

<p>In a December 16 audiotape, a voice attributed to terror chief Osama bin Laden called on his fighters to strike oil installations in the Gulf, as well as Iraq.</p>
<p>Kuwait on Friday raised its state of alert almost to the maximum, boosting security around the country in the biggest show of force since the US-led Iraq war in March 2003.</p>
<p>Armoured vehicles, with mounted machine guns, and heavily armed security units stood guard at almost every government building, key installations and potential Western targets.</p>
<p>The US embassy warned December 15 it had "credible information that terrorist groups" were preparing to carry out attacks in the emirate in the near future.</p>
