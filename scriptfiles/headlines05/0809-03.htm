<P>The president-elect of the nation's
largest lawyers group on Monday said some of the federal
government's investigative powers included in the
anti-terrorism Patriot Act are a threat to constitutional
rights.</p>

        <!--/endimage/--> Michael Greco criticized aspects of the act, passed to
bolster security after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, at the
American Bar Association convention, where U.S. Attorney
General Alberto Gonzales urged the U.S. Congress to renew it.</p>
<p>"We support the (Bush) administration in its efforts to
secure the nation but we have taken policy positions, four or
five of them, where we think due process has not been
followed," Greco said in an interview with Reuters.</p>
<p>He criticized exceptions the law makes to the
constitution's privacy protections that give law enforcement
the power to search a home without the homeowner's knowledge
and without a judge-approved search warrant.</p>
<p>"The ABA position is that some of these provisions are so
invasive of individual liberties that there has to be a sunset
provision. They're offensive, I think, to democracy," Greco
said.</p>
<p>Members of a conference committee in Congress seeking to
reconcile competing versions of the law's renewal are debating
whether to include a four-year or 10-year "sunset" clause that
would allow some of those provisions to expire.</p>
<p>In his address, Gonzales insisted the Patriot Act was
essential to fighting terrorism and accused critics of clouding
the debate with "a litany of misstatements and half-truths."</p>
<p>"We are fighting terrorism with the tools and techniques
provided for in the Patriot Act, tools that have long been
available to fight crime," he said. "We are doing this in a
manner that protects individual rights and liberties.</p>
<p>"We are not interested in the reading habits of ordinary
citizens (and) we are subject to the oversight of federal
judges," Gonzales said, citing an oft-ridiculed provision that
gives law enforcement powers to review library records and
bookstore sales.</p>

<p>Although delegates to the group's annual convention did not
single out President Bush, several resolutions appeared aimed
at administration stances.</p>
<p>The group, which represents more than 400,000 attorneys,
judges and law students, passed by unanimous voice vote a
resolution calling for respect for judges.</p>
<p>Bush, for instance, has complained in the past about
"activist judges" whose rulings have allowed gays to marry and
otherwise angered conservatives. An outcry led by House
Majority Leader Tom DeLay also followed judicial rulings in the
right-to-die case involving Terri Schiavo, the brain-dead
Florida woman whose former husband ultimately succeeded in
having her feeding tube removed.</p>
<p>ABA delegates this week were expected to approve a halt to
a perceived erosion of attorney-client privilege and a federal
shield law for reporters seeking to protect their sources.
