      Global greenhouse gas emissions will rise by 52% by 2030, unless the world takes action to reduce energy consumption, a study has warned.

        </table></font>The prediction comes from the latest annual World Energy Outlook report from the International Energy Agency (IEA).

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
It says that under current consumption trends, energy demand will also rise by more than 50% over the next 25 years.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
The IEA adds that oil prices will "substantially" rise unless there is extra investment in oil facilities.

It says the world has seen "years of under-investment" in both oil production and the refinery sector.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />

    	  
  	
    
      
The organisation estimates that the global oil industry now needs to invest $20.3 trillion (£12 trillion) in fresh facilities by 2030, or else the wider global economy could suffer.

"These projected trends have important implications and lead to a future that is not sustainable," said IEA chief Claude Mandil.

    	  
  	

    	  
  	
    
      
"We must change these outcomes and get the planet onto a sustainable energy path."

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
The IEA's warning comes at a time when the Kyoto climate change agreement calls on developed nations to cut their greenhouse gas emissions to 5% below 1990 levels by 2008-12.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
It also cautions that oil producers need to double annual investments in their oil fields or else see another £13 a barrel on the projected price of oil over the next 25 years.

      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      

The IEA says this extra investment is vital to avoid the supply bottlenecks that saw oil prices rise above $70 a barrel in late August.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
"If investments do not come in a timely and sufficient manner, there will be higher oil prices, and global economic growth will suffer," said IEA chief economist Fatih Birol.
<p />
The IEA says the world has enough oil supplies to last until 2030, and that the core issue is instead the need to improve the supply chain.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
Greenpeace said the latest figures from the IEA showed just how important it was for countries to meet their Kyoto targets.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
"The Kyoto protocol doesn't amount to much in terms of emissions reductions but at least it breaks the curve [of rising emissions] among countries that have accepted its targets," said Steve Sawyer, climate policy expert at the environmental pressure group.
<p />
"We have to work out the trick of how to get the US and the rapidly industrialising developing countries to break the curve as well."

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
The IEA is made up of  the 26 main industrialised nations who are the major oil consumers.
