<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->UNITED NATIONS - Officials from around the world who attended a week-long United Nations meeting on curbing the illegal gun trade departed for their home countries last weekend leaving little sign of hope for effective international action in the near future.<p>
							  
”It has been a good meeting,” Chairman Pasi Patokallic told delegates at the end. ”We have considered the state of play with regard to the full range of commitments assumed by member states under the Program of Action.”
<p>
The meeting, which is held every two years, was part of the follow-up process of the ”U.N. Program me of Action” to fight the illicit trade in small arms, an international instrument adopted by a U.N. Conference in July 2001.
<p>
In his statement, Patokallic acknowledged non-governmental organizations' concern that international efforts to crack down on the illegal business in guns could fail in the absence of a legally binding treaty.
<p>
”The fact that the international instrument to enable states to identify and trace illicit small arms is not legally binding is widely regretted,” he said, but added: ”The instrument, nevertheless, represent important progress.”
<p>
However, in a joint statement on the U.N. meeting on small arms, the London-based <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/" target="_new">Amnesty International</a>, <a href="http://www.oxfam.org/" target="_new">Oxfam</a>, and <a href="http://www.iansa.org/">International Action Network on Small Arms</a> (IANSA) said last week that the U.N. agreement on a system to track small arms was ”toothless and riddled with loopholes.”
<p>

The campaigners warned that the failure to agree on a legally binding system to track weapons means that unscrupulous arms dealers will continue to sell guns to serious human right abusers and war criminals without being identified.
<p>
They called the outcome of the four-year-long U.N. small arms process ”a worrying precedent.”
<p>
At the U.N. meeting, most delegates had backed the idea of a legally binding treaty, which covered ammunition as well as weapons, but the opposition of a few nations, including the United States, Iran and Egypt, means that the chance to have a serious impact on the activities of arms dealers has been lost, according to Amnesty and other campaigners.
<p>
The agreement will set up a system to record the serial numbers of small arms when they are sold or transferred between countries. But since it is voluntary and not legally binding, it is less likely to be effective in tracking the weapons as well as bringing those to justice who commit human right abuses.
<p>
”Innocent people in poor countries will pay the price of this failure,” said Anna MacDonald, director of campaigns for Oxfam. ”Countries who already have good record may comply, but for those countries who routinely sell weapons to the world's worst regimes, it will be business as usual.”
<p>
The agreement allows any country to refuse to disclose information about arms sales on the grounds of ”national security.” NGOs fear that this may be used as an excuse by those selling arms to oppressive regimes.
<p>
In a recent report, the London-based <a href="http://www.iansa.org/" target="_new">International Action Network on Small Arms</a> (IANSA) suggested that arms sales to unaccountable and poorly-trained military forces are often used to suppress human rights and exploit natural resources.
<p>
IANSA noted: ”A large number of women and girls are at risk of armed violence, whether they are directly involved in the fighting or dealing with the emotional, social and economic consequences of the loss of male relatives.”
<p>
Groups that closely watch the illegal gun trade and its effects on human rights blame some industrialized nations, including the United States, for blocking international efforts to create a legally binding treaty.

<p>
G8 countries -- the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Canada, Japan, and Russia -- account for more than 80 percent of all worldwide arms supplies, according to Amnesty International. Six of them are in the top 10 arms exporters in a trade valued at about 28 billion dollars a year.
<p>
Despite being disappointed with the role of the U.S. and other governments, NGOs expressed their happiness last week when 13 more governments announced support for the legally binding arms control treaty. They included Benin, Columbia, Germany, Ghana, Guinea, the Netherlands, Norway, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Spain, Turkey, Uganda, and the Vatican.
<p>
”While many governments are still failing to meet their obligations under the Program of Action, it is encouraging that momentum is building towards the agreement of a newly legally binding treaty on export control,” said Brian Wood, arms control manager of Amnesty International.
<p>
”This is a major shift from the last U.N. review meeting two years ago, when export controls were barely on the table,” added Rebecca Peters, director of IANSA. ”
