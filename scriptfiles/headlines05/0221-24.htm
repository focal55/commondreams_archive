<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><P>Iran has begun publicly preparing for a possible U.S. attack, as 
tensions mount between the Bush administration and this country's hard-line 
leaders over Tehran's purported nuclear weapons program.
<P>"Iran would respond within 15 minutes to any attack by the United States 
or any other country," an Iranian official close to the conservative clerics 
who run the country's security and military apparatus said on condition of 
anonymity.
<P>The Tehran government has announced efforts to bolster and mobilize 
recruits in its citizens' militia and is making plans to engage in the type of 
"asymmetrical" warfare that has bogged down U.S. troops in neighboring Iraq, 
officials and analysts say. 
<P>Iran insists it needs nuclear technology to meet its burgeoning domestic 
energy requirements and bolster its scientific community. But the United 
States accuses it of using nuclear energy as a fig leaf for a weapons program.
<P>"Iran remains the world's primary state sponsor of terror, pursuing 
nuclear weapons while depriving its people of the freedom they seek and 
deserve," President Bush said in his State of the Union address earlier this 
month. 
<P>France, Great Britain and Germany, also suspicious of Iran's nuclear 
ambitions, have insisted on strict inspections and have urged Iran to give up 
components of its nuclear program, specifically its effort to establish what 
is called the nuclear fuel cycle, lest it provoke a military attack.
<P>Fuel cycle technology has peaceful applications  --  energy production 
and medicine, for example  --  but it is also viewed as the foundation for 
weapons development. 
<P>The United States has criticized the approach taken by Europe and the 
International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency, as too 
soft on Iran. Generally, however, Bush administration officials insist they 
support European diplomatic efforts, but refuse to rule out military options 
if Iran refuses to acknowledge and give up its alleged pursuit of weapons of 
mass destruction. 
<P>The Pentagon recently revealed that, as a matter of routine preparedness, 
it had upgraded its Iranian war plans, and the Washington Post has reported 
that unmanned U.S. drones have been flying over suspected nuclear sites in 
Iran.
<P>Iranian authorities, too, say they have been getting ready for a possible 
attack. Newspapers have announced efforts to increase the number of the 
country's 7 million-strong "Basiji" volunteer militia, which was deployed in 
human-wave attacks during the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s. Iranian military 
authorities have paraded long-range North Korean-designed Shahab missiles 
before television cameras. 
<P>The Iranian military also is attempting to give the impression that it is 
bolstering its conventional forces. In December, it staged a massive war game  
--  deploying 120,000 troops as well as tanks, helicopters and armored 
vehicles near its western border with Iraq. More recently, Iran's press 
reported that the Iranian air force had received orders to engage any plane 
that violates Iranian airspace, just after the reports emerged of U.S. spy 
planes monitoring Iran's skies. 
<P>One Western military expert based in Tehran said Iran was sharpening its 
abilities to wage a guerrilla war. "Over the last year, they've developed 
their tactics of 'asymmetrical' war, which would aim not at resisting a 
penetration of foreign forces, but to then use them on the ground to all kinds 
of harmful effect," he said, on condition of anonymity.
<P>It remains unclear how much of the recent military activity amounts to a 
mobilization and how much is propaganda. Iranian officials and analysts have 
said they want to highlight the potential costs of an attack on Iran to raise 
the stakes for U.S. officials considering an assault and to frighten a war-
weary American public.
<P>"Right now it's a psychological war," said Nasser Hadian, a University of 
Tehran political science professor who recently returned from a three-year 
stint as a scholar at New York's Columbia University. 
<P>"If America decides to attack, the only ones who could stop it are 
Iranians," he said. "Pressure from other countries and inside America is 
important, but it won't prevent an attack. The only thing that will prevent an 
attack is that if America knows it will pay a heavy price."

<P>Iran's army includes 350,000 active-duty soldiers and 220,000 conscripts. 
Its elite Revolutionary Guards number 120,000, many of them draftees. Its navy 
and air force total 70,000 men. The armed forces have about 2,000 tanks, 300 
combat aircraft, three submarines, hundreds of helicopters and at least a 
dozen Russian-made Scud missile launchers of the type Saddam Hussein used 
against Israel during the 1991 Gulf War. Iran also has an undetermined number 
of Shahab missiles that have a range of more than 1,500 miles.
<P>Yet both outside military experts and Iranians concede that the country's 
antiquated conventional hardware, worn down by years of U.S. and European 
sanctions, would be little match for the high-tech wizardry of the United 
States. 
<P>"Most of Iran's military equipment is aging or second-rate, and much of 
it is worn," Anthony Cordesman, a military expert at the Center for Strategic 
and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington, wrote in a December 2004 
assessment of Iran's military. 
<P>The Western military expert said he spotted 30-year-old American-made 
M113 armored vehicles at recent military demonstration in the northwestern 
city of Qazvin. "Those tanks were able to go a few meters in front of us," he 
said. "But in a combat situation? I don't know."
<P>Despite the state of its equipment, Iran could create myriad troubles for 
the United States and the world.
<P>Its security forces include a number of intelligence agencies with 
extensive overseas experience and assets, experts say. Iran's highly 
classified Quds forces, which answer directly to Iran's spiritual leader, 
Grand Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, are believed to have operations in Lebanon, the 
Palestinian territories, Jordan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Turkey, the 
Persian Gulf region, Central Asia, North Africa, Europe and North America, 
according to a December 2004 report prepared by CSIS.
<P>Within minutes of any attack, Iran's air and sea forces could threaten 
oil shipments in the Persian Gulf as well as the Gulf of Oman. Iran controls 
the northern coast of the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow waterway through which 
oil tankers must navigate, and could sink ships, mine sea routes or bomb oil 
platforms, according to the CSIS report. 
<P>Iran could activate Hezbollah militants in Lebanon, whom it supports, to 
launch attacks on Israel. It could have operatives attack U.S. interests in 
Azerbaijan, Central Asia or Turkey.
<P>"Iran can escalate the war," said Hadian. "It's not going to be all that 
hard to target U.S. forces in these countries."
<P>But most analysts agree that Iran's biggest trump card would be to 
unleash havoc in neighboring Iraq, where Shiites who spent years in Iran as 
exiles are assuming control of the government.
<P>Although the Bush administration charges that Tehran already has been 
interfering in Iraq, many Iranians brush off the low-level infiltration as 
minor compared to the damage it could cause by allowing Iraqi militiamen to 
take heavy weapons into Iran, by backing the most extreme Islamist groups 
instead of the moderates it now supports, or by dispatching operatives across 
the long, porous border between the two countries.
<P>Any Iranian retaliation "would surely start with attempts to mobilize 
Shia partisans in Iraq to try to turn the Iraqi south into an extension of the 
insurgency in the Sunni triangle," Gary Sick, professor of Middle East studies 
at Columbia University and former National Security Council adviser to then 
President Jimmy Carter, told a congressional panel last week.
<P>Iraqi officials, wary of their country becoming a battleground for the 
conflicting ambitions of Tehran and Washington, concede the damage Iran could 
do in their country, which now hosts 150,000 U.S. troops.
<P>"If Iran wanted, it could make Iraq a hell for the United States," Hamid 
al-Bayati, Iraq's deputy foreign minister, said recently.
