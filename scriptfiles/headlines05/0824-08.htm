        <!--/endimage/--> Through much of August, Cindy Sheehan, who lost her son in
Iraq, has stationed herself with other protesters outside
Bush's Crawford ranch, garnering international media coverage
at a time when more than 1,800 U.S. military have died in the
Iraq conflict.</p>
<p>Sue Niederer, who with Sheehan and other families of dead
soldiers founded "Gold Star Families for Peace," on Wednesday
vowed to pursue the president with her anti-war message.</p>
<p>"We are going to be continuously on Mr. Bush and make him
understand we are not going away. We are very, very steadfast
in what we doing," said the 56-year-old housewife, real estate
agent and substitute teacher from Hopewell, New Jersey.</p>
<p>Niederer, whose 24-year-old son Seth Dvorin died in
Iskandariya, Iraq, on February 3, 2004, said she and others
plan to travel to wherever Bush will be speaking.</p>
<p>Anti-war groups kept the pressure on the president this
week as he made speeches in Utah and Idaho, where he promised
that U.S. troops would remain in Iraq to complete their job to
honor those who already died there -- a logic Niederer
disputed.</p>
<p>"You are dishonoring the soldiers, you are not honoring
them," she said of Bush's speech.</p>
<p>"Given the reasons for why we went into this war, why have
their deaths not been in vain?" she asked, referring to Bush's
now disproved pre-war assertion in 2003 that Iraq might have
stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p>Sheehan, the Vacaville, California, mother whose son Casey
was killed in combat in Iraq, has become the center of the
anti-war effort by camping out near Bush's ranch and demanding
to meet face-to-face with the president.</p>

<p>She plans to speak in Brunswick, Maine, in September and in
Brooklyn, New York, in October.</p>
<p>After Bush ends his Crawford stay at the end of August, the
anti-war families are also considering crisscrossing America in
buses in hopes of building a national protest movement similar
to that seen during the Vietnam War, when public sentiment
against the war contributed to the eventual U.S. withdrawal.</p>
<p>"This is Vietnam No. 2. As we are seeing in the polls, the
American people are beginning to realize this war was created
on lies, deceit and deception," Niederer said.</p>
<p>A majority of the U.S. public doubts the United States will
win the war in Iraq and believes the Bush administration
deliberately misled Americans over Iraq's weapons capabilities,
according to a July 27 USA Today/CNN/Gallup Poll.</p>
<p>It was the first poll to find that more than half of
Americans -- 51 percent -- believed the administration was
deliberately misleading when it asserted that Iraq had weapons
of mass destruction.</p>
<p>But creating a Vietnam-style nationwide protest against the
Iraq conflict will be near impossible without a draft to focus
dissent, said Stanford University Political Science Professor
and Hoover Institution Senior Fellow Morris Fiorina.</p>
<p>"If you had a draft, you would affect everybody and break
beyond the usual protesters," Fiorina said.
