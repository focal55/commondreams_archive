<p>Pablo Paredes' name will be invoked by antiwar veterans and 
activists at Memorial Day events in the Bay Area and elsewhere this weekend, 
but not because he was sentenced to three months of hard labor and busted down 
to the Navy's lowest rank for refusing to board a ship bound for the Persian 
Gulf. 
<P>Instead, supporters see a pinprick of hope in the no-jail-time sentence 
that the 23-year-old Paredes received this month  --  hope that the military's 
attitude is softening toward dissenters, or at least that the relatively light 
sentence will encourage other active-duty soldiers to speak out.

Antiwar veterans groups say they have seen an uptick in the number of 
inquiries from active-duty veterans since Paredes was convicted by a military 
judge May 11 in San Diego for refusing to board the Persian Gulf-bound 
amphibious assault ship Bonhomme Richard in December. He has 10 months left in 
his enlistment but is seeking to be discharged as a conscientious objector.
<P>This week, antiwar activists are watching upcoming court-martial at Fort 
Stewart, Ga., of Army Staff Sgt. Kevin Benderman, a 10-year-veteran who 
refused to redeploy to Iraq after his first tour in 2003 and said he was a 
conscientious objector. 
<P>"We've been seeing an extraordinary amount of searching by active duty 
people looking for ways to avoid deployment or redeployment," said Dennis 
O'Neil of the antiwar group Bring Them Home Now. The Paredes case, he said, 
"is planting a seed." 
<P>That was the fear that Navy prosecutor Lt. Brandon Hale expressed in 
court. Paredes "is trying to infect the military with his own brand of 
disobedience," Hale said. "Sailors all over the world will want to know 
whether this will be tolerated. Sailors want to know whether what he did is a 
good way to get out of deployment." 
<P>Other dissenters and legal advocates see the case has having more of a 
cultural impact than legal one.

<P>"I don't think (the sentence) is going to set any sort of legal precedent,
and the military isn't going to let everybody out who says, 'This war sucks, 
and I want to go home,' " said Luke Hiken, an attorney with the Military Law 
Task Force. The San Francisco resident has been advising conscientious 
objectors since 1970. 
<P>"But what you do see is people looking at him as an example, and you see 
the signs of a groundswell of people saying, 'Hey, I could do that, too,' " 
Hiken said. 
<P>Any such development would be welcome news to a shriveled antiwar 
movement. Street demonstrations have dwindled in number and attendance, and 
national organizations such as United for Peace and Justice and Not in Our 
Name have seen financial contributions diminish. 
<P>But antiwar organizers are encouraged by a growing number of smaller 
events headlined by active-duty and recently discharged soldiers. Organizers 
at a 6 p.m. antiwar rally Sunday at King Middle School in Berkeley will 
broadcast a three-minute video message from Paredes as a centerpiece of a 
lineup that includes dissenters, military family members and a former guard at 
Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison. A similar event is being held today  in Los Angeles. 
<P>"We've marched in the streets and told people how bad (the Iraq invasion) 
was going to be," said Jeff Paterson,  an organizer with Not in Our Name who 
served three months in military prison after refusing to be deployed to Iraq 
in the first Gulf War. "But now we're hearing from people who have been there 
and can tell you how bad it is over there.
<P>"And having someone who has served in the military talk about it can 
carry more moral weight with a lot of people than a college kid carrying a 
sign." 
<P>Michael McPhearson, executive director of Veterans for Peace, said 
Paredes was a role model for soldiers who might be reconsidering their 
commitment, not only because of his "heartfelt" position but because his 
working-class background is typical of many in the military. 
<P>Paredes grew up in the Bronx, his mother a Puerto Rican, his father an 
Ecuadoran who put his son through Catholic high school by driving a cab in 
Manhattan.
<P>Paredes enlisted in the Navy soon after high school and rose to the rank 
of third class petty officer. In recent years, he began reading the works of 
MIT linguistics professor and war critic Noam Chomsky and other liberals who 
questioned the Iraq war's legal and moral justification. 
<P>In Dec. 6, 2004, the day he was scheduled to sail to the Persian Gulf, he 
showed up at the pier wearing a T-shirt that read, "Like a cabinet member, I 
resign," then held a press conference.
<P>The Navy charged him with missing ship movement and unauthorized absence 
and sought a punishment of nine months' confinement, a bad conduct discharge 
and reduction in rank to E-1, the Navy's lowest. 
<P>Paredes explained to the military judge, Lt. Cmdr. Bob Klant, that he 
thought the war was "random, unprovoked illegitimate violence," and that "any 
soldier who knowingly participates in a war can find no haven in the fact that 
they were following orders, in the eyes of international law." 
<P>While Klant didn't side with Paredes' legal reasoning, he didn't slap 
nearly as harsh a penalty on the sailor as the Navy had sought. Activists have 
been buzzing about a statement he made from the bench after allowing testimony 
from Marjorie Cohn, a law professor at Thomas Jefferson School of Law in San 
Diego, and an outspoken war critic.
<P>Cohn testified that U.S. involvement in conflicts in Iraq, Afghanistan 
and Yugoslavia had no justification under international law, a position Navy 
prosecutors did not challenge on cross-examination. Afterward, according to 
published accounts, Klant said, "I think that the government has successfully 
proved that any service member has reasonable cause to believe that the wars 
in Yugoslavia, Afghanistan and Iraq were illegal." The Navy has not released a 
trial transcript.
<P>Several people in the courtroom thought the judge was scolding 
prosecutors for not challenging Cohn. Nonetheless, said former Army Staff Sgt. 
Camilo Mejia, who was sentenced to a year in jail and given a bad conduct 
discharge last year for refusing to return to Iraq after a two-week leave, it 
was important to "have an open debate about the immorality and illegality of 
this war."
<P>As for Paredes' sentence, Mejia said, "It's too early to be a trend  --  
it's just one person. But it was a huge moral boost."
