<p>STOCKHOLM - World military spending rose for a  sixth year running in 2004, growing by 5 percent to $1.04  trillion on the back of "massive" U.S. budgetary allocations  for its war on terror, a leading research institute said on  Tuesday.<p>

But world military expenditure was still 6 percent below  all-time highs recorded in 1987-88 toward the end of the Cold  War, <a href="http://www.sipri.org/" target="_new">Stockholm International Peace Research Institute</a> (SIPRI)  said in its <a href="http://yearbook2005.sipri.org/" target="_new">annual yearbook</a>.
<p> 
			
With expenditure of $455 billion, the United States  accounted for almost half the global figure, more than the  combined total of the 32 next most powerful nations, said  SIPRI, which is widely recognized for the reliability of its  data.<p> 
			
			In 2003, U.S. spending stood at $405 billion, SIPRI said.<p> 
			
			"The major determinant of the world trend in military  expenditure is the change in the United States, with its 47  percent of the world total," the Swedish government-funded  institute said.<p> 
			
			U.S. spending "has increased rapidly during the period  2002-2004 as a result of massive budgetary allocations for the  'global war on terrorism', primarily for military operations in  Afghanistan and Iraq," it added.<p> 
			
			U.S. military spending increased to 3.9 percent of gross  domestic product (GDP) last year from 3.0 percent in 1999 but  remained well below its Cold War peak of more than 6 percent,  it said.<p> 
			
			In 2004, the top-15 countries by military expenditure  accounted for 82 percent of the global total, according to the  institute whose database contains officially reported military  spending for 159 countries.<p> 
			
			SIPRI said Myanmar, for which it has no data, would  probably rank among this group of countries.<p> 
			
			The top five -- the United States, Britain, France, Japan  and China -- spent 64 percent of the world total.<p> 
			
			Measured by region military spending grew most last year,  by over 14 percent, in South Asia -- mainly due to "a massive  increase" in India's defense budget to $15 billion.<p> 
			
			Growth in China's military spending slowed to 7 percent --  to $35 billion -- from on average 11.5 percent per year in the  past decade. Russia's 2004 national defense budget increased  almost five percent to $19 billion, SIPRI said.<p> 
			
			Based on data for the past five years, Russia has overtaken  the United States as the world's leading supplier of  conventional weapons. Russia, the United States, Britain,  France and Germany accounted for 81 percent of all conventional  weapons deliveries in 2000-2004.<p> 
			
			China and India were the two main recipients of  conventional arms in 2004, the institute said.
