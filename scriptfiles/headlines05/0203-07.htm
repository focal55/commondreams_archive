<p>WASHINGTON - President Bush  will propose ending federal subsidies for Amtrak's operating expenses for 2006, congressional aides said Wednesday, stirring protests from lawmakers representing the railroad's heavily traveled Northeast corridor.

<P>Bush proposed $900 million for the current budget year, and Congress ended up providing nearly $1.2 billion. In Congress, where Amtrak has wide support, it is considered unlikely that lawmakers would agree to eliminate the operating aid.

<P>The aides, who spoke only on condition of anonymity, said they had been informed of Bush's plan by administration officials.

<P>They also said Bush will propose $360 million for the maintenance costs of local commuter railroads, concentrated mostly in the Northeast, that use Amtrak lines and other equipment. But that money would be available only if Amtrak went bankrupt.

<P>Amtrak supporters were frustrated by Bush's plan.

<P>"President Bush is willing to spend billions to send a couple of people to Mars, but not one dime for Amtrak's 25 million annual travelers who want better rail service to destinations on this planet," said Sen. Frank Lautenberg , D-N.J. The president has expressed a wish to have manned flights to the moon and Mars.

<P>Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., said Bush's proposal was irresponsible and that it would never pass in Congress.

<P>"At a time when gas prices are going up and congestion is getting worse, it makes absolutely no sense to propose eliminating Amtrak as we know it," Carper said. "The economy in the Northeast relies heavily on Amtrak, and the administration's approach will negatively affect businesses and everyday travelers."

<P>Amtrak spokesman Cliff Black said the railroad would not comment.

<P>David Gunn, who took over as Amtrak's president nearly three years ago, has cut costs but not enough to stem the railroad's annual loss of more than $500 million.

<P>Gunn has defended the need for a national passenger railroad system, although some long-distance lines lose more than $100 per rider. He has asked for bigger subsidies — $1.8 billion last year — than Congress has been willing to approve.
