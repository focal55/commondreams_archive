<p>TRENTON, New Jersey   - Six animal rights activists
being tried under a law that equates their activities with
terrorism turned the lives of employees of a British
drug-testing company into a living nightmare, prosecutors said
on Thursday.

It is the first New Jersey trial in which federal
prosecutors are using a law that says aggressive activists who
disrupt a company can be charged as terrorists.
<p>The defendants are accused of disrupting the business of
Huntingdon Life Sciences, or HLS, a UK-based firm with
operations in New Jersey that uses animals to test drugs, with
the aim of driving it out of business.</p>
<p>U.S. Attorney Charles McKenna told the court the defendants
crossed the line on freedom of speech rights and were not
content to get their message across by peaceful and legal
means.</p>
<p>"They wanted results immediately and at whatever costs,"
McKenna told the court.</p>
<p>The activists harassed employees of HLS and other companies
that did business with it, published their names and addresses
on its Web site, threatened their families, and in some cases
overturned their cars, according to the indictment.</p>
<p>They are also accused of using mass e-mail to shut down the
computer systems of some companies.</p>
<p>Prosecutors charged the six and their organization called
<a href="http://www.shac.net/" target="_new">Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty</a>, with violating the Animal
Enterprise Protection Act, which was amended in 2002 to include
the crime of "animal enterprise terrorism."</p>
<p>Animal enterprise terrorism carries a maximum penalty of
three years in prison and a &#36;250,000 fine. The activists also
face charges of conspiracy and interstate stalking, which carry

&#36;250,000 fines each.</p>
<p>Andrew Erba, an attorney for the group, told the court that
the defendants were entitled to express their views however
unpopular they might be.</p>
<p>"In America, dissenting views can be heard," he said. "This
is a referendum on the rights of a political movement to talk
about these things in the open."</p>
<p>Huntingdon says on its Web site that it tests products such
as drugs, food additives, adhesives and clothing dyes on
animals but that the company is, "committed to providing the
highest levels of animal husbandry and welfare."</p>
<p>The defendants are Kevif Kjonaas, 27, president of the
group; Lauren Gazzola, 26, the group's campaign coordinator;
Jacob Conroy, 29; Joshua Harper, 30; Darius Fullmer, 28, and
Andrew Stepanian, 26.</p>
<p>The trial, overseen by U.S. District Judge Mary Cooper,
resumes on Monday.
