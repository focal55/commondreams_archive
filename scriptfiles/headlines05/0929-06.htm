<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->LONDON - The conduct of U.S. troops in  Iraq, including increasing detention and accidental shootings of  journalists, is preventing full coverage of the war reaching the  American public, Reuters said on Wednesday. 
<p></p> In a letter to Virginia Republican Sen. John Warner, head of  the Senate Armed Services Committee, Reuters said U.S. forces  were limiting the ability of independent journalists to operate.   The letter from Reuters Global Managing Editor David  Schlesinger called on Warner to raise widespread media concerns  about the conduct of U.S. troops with Defense Secretary Donald  Rumsfeld, who is due to testify to the committee on Thursday.<p></p> <!--/beginimage/-->

        <!--/endimage/--> Schlesinger referred to &quot;a long parade of disturbing  incidents whereby professional journalists have been killed,  wrongfully detained, and/or illegally abused by U.S. forces in  Iraq.&quot;<p></p> He urged Warner to demand that Rumsfeld resolve these issues  &quot;in a way that best balances the legitimate security interests  of the U.S. forces in Iraq and the equally legitimate rights of  journalists in conflict zones under international law&quot;.<p></p> At least 66 journalists and media workers, most of them  Iraqis, have been killed in the Iraq conflict since March 2003.<p></p> U.S. forces acknowledge killing three Reuters journalists,  most recently soundman Waleed Khaled who was shot by American  soldiers on Aug. 28 while on assignment in Baghdad. But the  military say the soldiers were justified in opening fire.<p></p> Reuters believes a fourth journalist working for the agency,  who died in Ramadi last year, was killed by a U.S. sniper.    &quot;The worsening situation for professional journalists in  Iraq directly limits journalists' abilities to do their jobs  and, more importantly, creates a serious chilling effect on the  media overall,&quot; Schlesinger wrote.<p></p> &quot;By limiting the ability of the media to fully and  independently cover the events in Iraq, the U.S. forces are  unduly preventing U.S. citizens from receiving information...and  undermining the very freedoms the U.S. says it is seeking to  foster every day that it commits U.S. lives and U.S. dollars,&quot;  the letter said. <p></p> &quot;SPIRALING OUT OF CONTROL&quot;<p></p> Schlesinger said the U.S. military had refused to conduct  independent and transparent investigations into the deaths of  the Reuters journalists, relying instead on inquiries by  officers from the units responsible, who had exonerated their  soldiers.<p></p> The U.S. military had failed even to implement  recommendations by its own inquiry into one of the deaths, that  of award-winning Palestinian cameraman Mazen Dana who was shot  dead while filming outside Abu Ghraib prison in August 2003.   Schlesinger said Reuters and other reputable international  news organisations were concerned by the &quot;sizeable and rapidly  increasing number of journalists detained by U.S. forces&quot;.<p></p> 
He said most of these detentions had been prompted by   legitimate journalistic activity such as possessing photographs  and video of insurgents, which U.S. soldiers assumed showed  sympathy with the insurgency.
<p></p> In most cases the journalists were held for long periods at  Abu Ghraib or Camp Bucca prisons before being released without  charge. <p></p> At least four journalists working for international media  are currently being held without charge or legal representation  in Iraq. They include two cameramen working for Reuters and a  freelance reporter who sometimes works for the agency.<p></p> A cameraman working for the U.S. network CBS has been  detained since April despite an Iraqi court saying his case does  not justify prosecution. Iraq's justice minister has criticised  the system of military detentions without charge.<p></p> Schlesinger's letter said: &quot;It appears as though the U.S.  forces in Iraq either completely misunderstand the role of  professional journalists or do not know how to deal with  journalists in a conflict zone, or both.&quot;<p></p> Reuters and other media organisations in Iraq had repeatedly  tried to hold a dialogue with the Pentagon to establish  appropriate guidelines on how to safeguard journalists. These  efforts had failed &quot;and the situation is now spiraling out of  control&quot;, Schlesinger said.<p></p> He asked Warner to question Rumsfeld specifically about the  rules of engagement towards professional journalists, the  failure to hold independent investigations into shooting  incidents and to ask what was the guidance to U.S. forces on how  to distinguish legitimate journalists from insurgents.
