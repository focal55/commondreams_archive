<p>BAGHDAD  - Iraq's ruling Shi'ite Islamists 
prepared to force a constitution through parliament before a 
midnight Monday deadline but minority Sunnis vowed to vote it 
down in a referendum and warned of civil war.</p>
<p> President Bush, himself campaigning to quell growing 
disquiet at home over the costly military occupation of Iraq, 
has pressed hard for the U.S.-sponsored timetable to be 
respected and says it will help sap the Sunni Arab insurgency.</p>

        <!--/endimage/--> With under an hour to the deadline, there was confusion 
over whether Sunni outrage might force parliament to grant a 
second week-long extension to negotiators. One Sunni delegate 
said he expected this when the Assembly convened shortly. But a 
Shi'ite representative said parliament would vote through the 
draft.</p>
<p> The draft prepared by Shi'ites and Kurds, assisted by U.S. 
diplomats but without Sunni involvement, gave ground to some of 
the once dominant minority's fears of Shi'ites and Kurds hiving 
off strong federal regions in the oil-rich north and south.</p>
<p> A text seen by Reuters defined Iraq as a "federal" 
republic. Details on the extent and mechanisms of autonomy 
would be worked out later, delegates involved in drafting the 
text said.</p>
<p> The draft also made Islam "a main source" of law in what 
seemed a compromise between Islamist Shi'ites and secular 
Kurds.</p>
<p> But Sunni Arabs, outraged at what they called a "breach of 
consensus," stood by a demand "federalism" be left out.</p>
<p> "We will campaign ... to tell both Sunnis and Shi'ites to 
reject the constitution, which has elements that will lead to 
the break-up of Iraq and civil war," Soha Allawi, a Sunni Arab 
member of the drafting committee, told Reuters.</p>
<p> "If they pass this constitution, then the rebellion will 
reach its peak," said Sunni delegate Hussein Shukur al-Falluji.</p>
<p> But with parliament, where Shi'ites have a big majority, 
facing dissolution if no draft were adopted by midnight (2000 
GMT), senior Shi'ites said the text would pass comfortably and 
be put to the nation, as scheduled, in a referendum by October 
15.

</p>
<p> SHI'ITE DETERMINATION</p>
<p> "An agreed draft of the constitution will be presented to 
parliament and we expect that it will meet with broad 
acceptance, including from the Sunnis," deputy parliamentary 
speaker Hussain al-Shahristani told Reuters.</p>
<p> Government television broadcast scenes of wild rejoicing at 
the news in the holy city of Najaf and other Shi'ite towns.</p>
<p> "We cannot wait and give them all the time they need to be 
convinced ... If our Sunni Arab brothers don't want to vote for 
federalism then they can reject it," said Jalal-el-Din 
al-Sagheer, a Shi'ite cleric on the constitutional committee.</p>
<p> Interim rules say the charter is rejected if two thirds of 
voters in three of Iraq's 18 provinces vote against it.</p>
<p> Kurdish delegate Abdel Khalek Zangana said the provision on 
federalism satisfied Kurdish demands for guarantees they would 
retain the broad autonomy they already have in the north.</p>
<p> One Sunni leader said the text had dropped wording that 
forbade secession from Iraq; Kurdish leaders say they do not 
want to break away entirely but want to keep the option open.</p>
<p> U.S. diplomats, led by ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad, 
architect of the new Afghan constitution, have been working 
hard to save the deadline. Secular Kurdish delegates had 
complained that he had made concessions to the Shi'ite 
Islamists in allowing for a greater role for Islam in Iraqi 
law.</p>
<p> The draft document, seen in part by Reuters, described Iraq 
as a "republican, parliamentarian, democratic and federal" 
state. It also said, in general terms, that natural resources 
would be controlled jointly by central and local government.</p>
<p> Members of smaller religious and ethnic minorities said 
they were worried they were not mentioned by name as Iraqi 
peoples.

</p>
<p> SUNNI MOBILIZATION</p>
<p> In former rebel strongholds like Falluja and across the 

Sunni heartlands of the north and west, which largely shunned 
the January polls that produced the Shi'ite and Kurd-dominated 
interim legislature, voters have been registering in numbers.</p>
<p> Some Shi'ites, notably supporters of radical cleric Moqtada 
al-Sadr, with a strong following in resource-poor central Iraq, 
also reject federalism and have campaigned for "Iraqi unity."</p>
<p> With discontent spreading at the failure of the present 
government to curb violence or improve living standards, rival 
parties see a chance to embarrass it at the polls.</p>
<p> If the referendum ratifies the constitution, voting in 
December will be for a full-term parliament with full powers.</p>
<p> Though portrayed in Washington as a key test of Iraq's 
cohesion and ability to overcome the threat of civil war, there 
is little sign even clinching a deal will ease the bloodshed.</p>
<p> Gunmen killed 10 people, including eight policemen, driving 
a minivan north of Baghdad on Monday. Two U.S. soldiers were 
killed in a bomb attack near Samarra, north of Baghdad.</p>
<p> But analysts have said a diversion of energies into 
politics among the wider Iraqi Sunni community could weaken the 
local, nationalist insurgency that is pinning down U.S. troops.</p><p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&copy;  2005 Reuters</font></p>
