<p>WASHINGTON  - The federal government has the power  to prevent sick patients from smoking home-grown marijuana that  a doctor recommended to relieve chronic pain, a divided U.S.  Supreme Court ruled on Monday in a setback for the medical  marijuana movement.<p> 
			
			The 6-3 ruling means the federal government can enforce a  federal law prohibiting the cultivation, possession and use of  medical marijuana even where it is legal under state law. At  least nine states allow medical use of marijuana.<p>

        <!--/endimage/-->Justice John Paul Stevens said for the court majority that  the federal law, the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, was a  valid exercise of federal power by the U.S. Congress "even as  applied to the troubling facts of this case" involving two  seriously ill California women.<p> 
			
			Angel Raich has an inoperable brain tumor and other medical  problems while Diane Monson suffers from severe back pain.  Their doctors recommended marijuana for their pain.<p> 
			
			Monson cultivates her own marijuana while two of Raich's  caregivers grow the marijuana and provide it to her free of  charge. In 2002, Drug Enforcement Administration agents  destroyed six cannabis plants seized from Monson's home.<p> 
			
			"Just because we did not win this battle does not mean that  we will not still have the opportunity to win this war," Raich  said in Oakland, California. "If I were to stop using cannabis  unfortunately I would die."<p> 
			
			Stevens called the case difficult in view of the strong  arguments by the two women that they will suffer irreparable  harm because marijuana has a valid therapeutic purpose, despite  a congressional finding to the contrary.<p> 
			
			He said the question before the court was not whether it  was wise to enforce the federal law in these circumstances, but  only whether Congress has the power to adopt such a law.<p> 
			
			Stevens said the democratic process might be more important  than the legal challenges and added that supporters of medical  marijuana "may one day be heard in the halls of Congress."<p> 
			
			The ruling was a victory for the Bush administration, which  appealed to the Supreme Court after a federal appeals court in  California ruled for the two women.<p> 
			
			The administration estimated that as many as 100,000  Californians would use marijuana for medical purposes if the  Supreme Court ruled for the two women.<p> 
			
			A POLITICAL ISSUE<p> 
			
			John Walters, the White House drug czar, said in a  statement, "Today's decision marks the end of medical marijuana  as a political issue."<p> 
			
			Supporters of medical marijuana disagreed.<p> 
			
			"The power of state governments to enact and enforce state  medical marijuana laws is not affected by the Supreme Court's  ruling," said Allen Hopper of the American Civil Liberties  Union's Drug Law Reform Project.<p> 
			
			Dan Abrahamson of the Drug Policy Alliance said, "The  federal government still has a choice -- it can waste taxpayer  dollars by going after sick and dying patients or go after  individuals who pose a real danger to society."<p> 
			
			Government lawyers said it would be difficult to enforce  the nation's drug laws if there was an exception for medical  marijuana.<p> 
			
			Stevens agreed with the government's argument. He said an  exception for medical marijuana would leave a "gaping hole" in  the federal drug law.<p> 
			
			Stevens said the power of Congress to regulate commerce  among the states included the authority to prohibit the local  cultivation and use of marijuana in compliance with California  law.<p> 
			
			Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day  O'Connor and Clarence Thomas dissented.<p> 
			
			"This case exemplifies the role of states as laboratories,"  O'Connor wrote.<p> 
			
			"Relying on Congress' abstract assertions, the court has  endorsed making it a federal crime to grow small amounts of  marijuana in one's own home for one's own medicinal use," she  said. "This overreaching stifles an express choice by some  states ... to regulate medical marijuana differently."
