The loud drone of a gas generator and the buzz of power saws break 
the jungle silence. While a logger strips the bark off a mahogany tree, six 
teenage boys sand boards of Santa Maria, a popular hardwood used in furniture 
making. 
<P>Some of the finished product is destined for a college campus in the East 
Bay and a pool in San Francisco's Sunset District. 
<P>But unlike so much logging that has devastated forests throughout Latin 
America, including other areas of this 5 million acre rain forest in the Maya 
Biosphere Reserve, these workers toil under strict guidelines issued by a 
European organization that encourages responsible management of the world's 
forests. Many of their wood products are shipped to the United States and 
Europe. 
<P>"It's the best model in Latin America," said José Román Carrera, Central 
America forestry coordinator for the New York-based Rainforest Alliance.
<P>The cooperative that works the 130,000-acre concession in the rain forest 
here consists of 56 impoverished families from the jungle village of Carmelita.
It is one of 13 locally managed forest concessions the Guatemalan government 
has given to communities living in the reserve. 
<P>"We started by just selling mahogany logs and boards at the national 
level," said former cooperative president Juan Trujillo, who like other 
Carmelita residents once eked out a living collecting coagulated tree sap used 
to produce chewing gum. "Now we are trying to increase business" by selling 
processed wood abroad. 
<P>The concessions, which range from 125,000 acres to 200,000 acres, are 
logged in accordance with rules laid down by the <a href="http://www.fsc.org/en/" target="_new">Forest Stewardship Council</a>, a 
nonprofit organization based in Bonn, Germany. Under the guidelines, only one 
or two trees per hectare (2.4 acres) can be extracted inside concession areas. 

<P>Environmental organizations credit the approach with reducing 
deforestation, protecting watersheds and wetland areas while providing a 
steady income for local residents. 
<P>"The best preserved places in the reserve are in the concession areas," 
said Liza Grandia, a UC Berkeley anthropologist who has worked with Carmelita 
and other reserve communities. "They have done an incredible job, even though 
many have only a third-grade education."
<P>The Maya Biosphere Reserve is Central America's most biologically diverse 
rain forest, one of the largest jungle areas north of the Amazon. It is home 
to such endangered species as jaguar and scarlet macaw and more than 200 Mayan 
archaeological sites. 
<P>Although 36 percent of the reserve is protected by law, some of its most 
prominent national parks have suffered major destruction in recent years due 
to illegal settlers, ranchers, poachers and drug traffickers. More than half 
of Laguna del Tigre National Park, a vast wetland area, has been burned for 
ranching and farming in the past several years, environmentalists say. 
<P>Yet recent satellite photos by the U.S. Geological Survey show forest 
coverage remains mostly intact in the area under concession to 11 communities 
and two timber companies.
<P>To be sure, these rain forest communities are taking advantage of the 
rapidly expanding green building movement in the United States and increased 
demand for certified wood.
<P>Last year, California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger signed an executive 
order requiring all new or renovated state-owned facilities to be certified by 
the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) program created by 
the U.S. Green Building Council. LEED rates facilities on a range of eco-
friendly standards, including energy and water efficiency, and the use of 
environmentally sound building resources, including certified wood. 
<P>Robin Bass, a member of LEED's steering committee for Northern California,
says an increasing number of private companies have pledged to meet the 
group's eco-standards. "It's good for business ... great for your bottom line,
" she said.
<P>In June, San Francisco became the first U.S. city to enact a law that 
requires city departments to buy products that do as little harm as possible 
to people and the earth. More recently, Mayor Gavin Newsom announced the city 
had become the nation's first to apply high environmental standards to all its 
new affordable housing developments, including the use of solar panels and 
recycled building materials.
<P>San Francisco architects also say they plan to use wood certified by the 
Forest Stewardship Council from the Maya Biosphere Reserve for a construction 
project at Sava Pool in the Sunset District, and similarly certified wood from 
Brazil to be fashioned into benches near the new de Young Museum in Golden 
Gate Park. But Mark Palmer, the green building coordinator for San Francisco's 
Department of the Environment, says both projects are on hold until city 
regulations can be modified. In the early 1990s, San Francisco barred tropical 
hardwood because of unfettered logging. Palmer says a public hearing on 
approving certified wood is scheduled for next month. 
<P>"We want to encourage well-managed forest practices, and this is the way 
we can do it, through purchasing practices," Palmer said. 
<P>Early this year, Oakland's EarthSource Forest Products bought 300,000 
board feet of mahogany and 600,000 board feet of lesser-known tropical 
hardwoods from the reserve. The East Bay company supplies such Bay Area firms 
as San Francisco's MBT Architecture, which is using a reddish Guatemalan 
hardwood known as machiche in the construction of Ohlone College's new 
satellite campus in Newark, according to MBT architect Susan Seastone.
<P>Meanwhile, eight reserve communities  --  including Carmelita  --  are 
hoping to increase their income with recently opened sawmills financed partly 
by Rainforest Alliance and the U.S. Agency for International Development. 
<P>Although logging has brought Carmelita running water and a new primary 
school, villagers hope the new venture will soon bring them electricity and 
other advances.
<P>"There is now more work and more possibilities for our children," said 
Ana Centeno, a member of the Carmelita cooperative.</p>
