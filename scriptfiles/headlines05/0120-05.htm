<p>When President George Bush travels down Pennsylvania Avenue in his black limousine for today's inaugural parade, he may detect a small ripple in the crowd as protesters symbolically turn their backs on his administration.

<P>That would be the stealth protesters of Turn Your Back on Bush, which plans to infiltrate the crowds of cheering Republicans along the parade route.

<P>Protesters will swivel when the president's limousine passes - or any other VIP vehicle for that matter, because identifying Mr Bush's limo may prove difficult. "To be safe, turn your back whenever a motorcade of black limousines and SUVs is in view and continue until they have passed," the protesters' website advised.

<P>Organisers of J-20, as the loose coalition of counter-inaugural protests is known, are hoping to produce many such displays of defiance to serve as angry counterpoints to a city swaddled in red, white and blue and abuzz with festivities expected to cost upwards of $40m (£21m).

<P>Mr Bush's ceremonial reinstallation could produce the biggest mass of protesters since the height of the Vietnam war, when 60,000 descended on Washington to protest at Richard Nixon's inauguration in 1973. More than 30 years later, war remains the engine of this week's protests.

<P>"Just because Bush is back in office doesn't mean that Americans are for the war in Iraq," said Peta Black of the International Answer Coalition.

<P>Answer and other peace groups are looking to today's protests to reinvigorate an anti-war movement that was sidelined during last year's presidential elections, when opposition to the Bush administration was channelled into the Democratic campaign.

<P>"A lot of that energy was siphoned off, and hopefully we can get some of it back into the anti-war movement," said Nati Carrera, 27, who travelled from San Francisco.

<P>The protesters who have descended on Washington owe allegiance to a multitude of causes. The anti-war activists have traced blood-red letters on to banners reading: "Bring the Troops Home Now".

<P>The anarchists have made masks of the left's hate figures: Mr Bush, Vice-President Dick Cheney, the defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, and the rightwing radio host Rush Limbaugh.

<P>Others say they are disturbed that a second term will consolidate Mr Bush's rightwing social agenda. There is also anger at the pricetag for the festivities, with a number of internet blogs demanding that Mr Bush cancel the balls and donate the money for tsunami relief instead.

<P>But it may prove difficult to engage the world's attention on a day when the usual accoutrements of protest have been banned on security grounds. Only Answer has been given a permit to set up seating and a sound system on the parade route. Most prime viewing positions have been reserved for Republican ticket holders. Poles for posters and banners are banned, as are giant papier-mache effigies. <p align="center">Guardian Unlimited &copy; Guardian Newspapers Limited 2005</p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable --></font></td></tr>
