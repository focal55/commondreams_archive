<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->BAGHDAD - A group of Iraqi workers in Baghdad came under fire from US troops who mistook them for insurgents.
<p>


An interior ministry source said US troops fired on a crowd of workers in the central Baghdad neighbourhood of Alawi, while a defence ministry source reported an exchange of fire between suspected rebels and US forces in the area.</p>
<p>

But a number of casualties lying in Al-Yarmouk hospital told AFP that a US helicopter fired at them as they were gathered outside a hotel.</p>
<p>

"The electricity went out at around 0500 (0100 GMT), so we exited the hotel to the street to have breakfast in the fresh air. A helicopter then opened fire into the street," said Ali Mohammad, who sustained neck and leg injuries.</p>
<p>

Makki Hassan, a 50-year-old resident of the neighbourhood, said that a number of people sleeping on the roofs of their houses were also struck by gunfire.</p>
<p>

The US military, contacted by AFP, had no immediate information on the incident.</p>
<p>

Also in Baghdad, two Iraqi policemen were killed and four others injured when gunmen fired on a civil defence centre in the eastern Canal district, the interior ministry source said.</p>
<p>

In other violence Tuesday, an Iraqi working for a local news organisation was killed and his three colleagues wounded when their car hit a roadside bomb south of Baquba, 60 kilometres (37 miles) north of Baghdad.</p>
<p>

Meanwhile, the office of former prime minister Iyad Allawi accused members of the Iraqi National Guard of assaulting his private guards late Monday, wounding two of them.</p>

<p>

"Such attacks backed by the current Iraqi government ... increase (the Iraqi people's) lack of confidence in the leadership of the current government," said a statement issued by Allawi's office.</p>
<p>

Allawi's office told AFP the attack took place in Al-Zaytoon Street, where the office of the ex-premier is located, but declined to give further details.</p>
