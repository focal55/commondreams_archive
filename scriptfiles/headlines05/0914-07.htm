<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->US peace activist Scott Parkin was strongly opposed to political violence and is "baffled" at the reasons for his deportation from Australia, he said today.</p>
Mr Parkin, who has had his visa cancelled on the grounds he poses a national security risk, is expected to be flown out of Melbourne for Los Angeles tomorrow morning.<p>

He will not oppose his removal from Australia, but he has vowed to continue to fight the cancellation of his visa to visit Australia.<p>

The 36-year-old teacher from Houston, Texas, was detained by the Australian Federal Police in Melbourne on Saturday after an "adverse security assessment".<p>

Mr Parkin, who had been in Australia since early June on a six-month visa, has been held in solitary confinement in a Melbourne custody centre since then.<p>

The Federal Government refused to explain why his six-month tourist visa had been cancelled, other than to say it was based on matters relating to "politically motivated violence".<p>

Mr Parkin has participated in rallies against the Forbes chief executives' conference in Sydney, a protest outside the Sydney headquarters of US energy multinational Halliburton and conducted workshops on non-violent protest and trends in grassroots activism.<p>

Justice Minister Chris Ellison said yesterday the visa had been revoked because of Mr Parkin's behaviour while in Australia.<p>

The Opposition has decided not to oppose the deportation after receiving a briefing on the case.<p>

In a short written statement issued tonight through Greenpeace Australia, the Texan disowned political violence.<p>

"I am strongly opposed to any violence and do not believe that violence delivers any political gain, and in fact detracts from positive political engagement," he said.<p>

"I find this entire experience incomprehensible and am still baffled as to why my visa has been cancelled and I have been detained under these circumstances.<p>

"To this date the only information that I have received is that I have been assessed as `a direct or indirect risk to Australian national security'."<p>

Mr Parkin, a member of the Houston Global Awareness Collective which aims to end the US-led occupation of Iraq, said he was overwhelmed by the support he had received during his detention.<p>

He was visited at the custody centre today by three members of his legal team, including prominent human rights lawyer Julian Burnside, QC.<p>

Greenpeace political adviser Helen Oakey, who was also allowed to visit him, said he was in high spirits but keen to go home.<p>

"Greenpeace will continue to support Scott's style of peaceful protest and to fund legal challenges to overturn this gross decision," she said.<p>

Mr Parkin is expected to be flown out of Melbourne under escort on a Qantas flight direct to Los Angeles mid-morning tomorrow. He faces a bill of close to $20,000 for his detention and deportation in Australia.<p>

A Greenpeace spokesman said supporters would attempt to embarrass Mr Howard in New York, where he is due to address the United Nations.
