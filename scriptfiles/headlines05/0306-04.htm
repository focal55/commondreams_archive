<p>WASHINGTON  - Staff Sgt. Richard Guzman is on the  front lines of one of the U.S. Army's toughest battles in  years, and he's not in Iraq.<p> 
			
			He's an Army recruiter trying to coax young men and women  into volunteering to serve at a time when U.S. ground forces  are engaged in a bloody guerrilla war halfway around the world.<p> 
			
			"To me, recruiting used to be easy. Right now, you really  have to hunt for those ones who really want to do it (Army  service)," said Guzman, who recruits in New York City's Harlem  section.<p> 
			
			Nearly two years into an Iraq war that has left more than  1,500 U.S. troops dead and another 11,200 wounded, recruiters  like Guzman are having to work hard as the Army strives to sign  up 80,000 recruits this year to replace soldiers leaving the  service.<p> 
			
			The Army in February, for the first time in nearly five  years, failed to achieve its monthly recruiting goal. It is in  danger of missing its annual recruiting target for the first  time since 1999.<p> 
			
			Recruiting for the Army's reserve component -- the National  Guard and Army Reserve -- is suffering even more as the  Pentagon relies heavily on these part-time soldiers to maintain  troop levels in Iraq. The regular Army is 6 percent behind its  year-to-date recruiting target, the Reserve is 10 percent  behind, and the Guard is 26 percent short.<p> 
			
			The Marine Corps, the other service providing ground forces  in Iraq, has its own difficulties.<p> 
			
			In January and February, the Marines missed their goal for  signing up new recruits -- the first such shortfall in nearly a  decade -- but remained a bit ahead of their target for shipping  recruits into boot camp.<p> 
			
			Iraq marks the first protracted conflict for U.S. forces  since the end of the draft in 1973, which ushered in the era of  the all-volunteer military.<p> 
			
			If the military fails to attract enough recruits and  America maintains a large commitment in Iraq, the nation may  have to consider some form of conscription, said Cato Institute  defense analyst Charles Pena. "This is getting dicey," said  Pena.<p> 
			
			PARENTS, AUNTS AND UNCLES<p> 
			
			Lt. Col. John Gillette, who commands the Army recruiting  battalion in New York City, said young people and their  families are asking questions about the war.<p> 
			
			"Instead of just talking specifically to the applicant,  we're talking to the applicant's parents, and, in some cases,  extended family -- aunts, uncles -- just to answer their  questions and concerns as well," Gillette said.<p> 
			
			Guzman said he reassures families that a recruit will get  the normal nine weeks of basic training and further individual  training and not just be shoved in a uniform and sent into  combat. "They think that after two weeks in basic training,  they will be deployed overseas," Guzman said.<p> 
			
			Army Recruiting Command spokesman Douglas Smith said  recruiters do everything they can to allay the apprehension of  recruits and families. "But there are certain things that we  just can't talk our way through or give a hard answer to, like,  'Will I be deployed?' That's just not something a recruiter can  predict."<p> 
			
			The improving economy and civilian job opportunities also  are factors in recruiting, Smith said.<p> 
			
			Army Secretary Francis Harvey said the active-duty and  reserve components have added 3,000 recruiters since last year  and increased enlistment bonuses to try to lure new soldiers.<p> 
			
			"So we've got a challenge, but we're certainly not going to  give up," Harvey told a congressional panel.<p> 
			
			Defense analyst Loren Thompson of the Lexington Institute  said there has been a migration of recruits away from the  ground forces toward services less likely to be in harm's way  in Iraq -- the Navy and Air Force.<p> 
			
			"There's a bottom line to the recruiting debate. People  don't want to die," Thompson said.<p> 
			
			The problem is even more dire than it appears because the  Army, through "stop-loss" orders, has forced thousands of  soldiers designated for duty in Iraq and Afghanistan to remain  in uniform when their volunteer service commitment ends, thus  keeping recruiting needs artificially low, Pena said.<p> 
			
			Some of these soldiers may remain in the Army involuntarily  for up to 18 months beyond when they were scheduled to leave.<p> 
			
			"The military can hold things together on a relatively  short-term basis through some fairly extreme measures like  'stop-loss' and making much greater use of Reserve and Guard  units to fill the requirements in Iraq," Pena said.
<p> 
			
			"But you cannot do this indefinitely. At some point, you  break the force. And the question is: how close are we to that  breaking point?"
