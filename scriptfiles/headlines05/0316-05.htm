WASHINGTON -- Americans have conflicting views about the costs and benefits of the US-led war on Iraq  nearly two years after its launch, according to a poll released.

<P>Iraq benefits more from the war than the United States, according to those surveyed in the ABC News/Washington Post poll, many of who believed the benefits were not enough to justify the costs.

<P>Seventy percent of those polled said the level of US casualties in Iraq was "unacceptable."

<P>Fifty-three percent believe the war was not worth fighting, compared to 45 percent who believe the war was justified.

<P>Support for the war ran at 70 percent while US troops were engaged in active combat, according to earlier polls.

<P>Americans who believe the war placed the United States in a strong position fell from 52 percent during the war to 28 percent now.

<P>But 44 percent said they believed the Iraq war had improved chances of democracy in the Middle East, compared with nine percent who said it had lessened the odds.

<P>Approval for President George W. Bush  personally was down to 50 percent overall compared with his approval high of 77 percent. On Iraq, he currently has a 39 percent on Iraq in particular, down from a high of 75 percent.

<P>While Americans also have little stomach for battles elsewhere in the world -- nearly three-quarters of those polled both opposed a military confrontation with North Korea  to force it from using nuclear weapons and also saw the Stalinist state as a threat to the United States.

<P>Two-thirds oppose military action against Iran, which is not yet believed to possess nuclear arms.

<P>The ABC News/Washington Post telephone poll was conducted March 10-13 among 1,001 adults nationwide. The poll has a three-point margin of error.
