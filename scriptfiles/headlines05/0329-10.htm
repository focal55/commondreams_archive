Phillips said the department is purchasing a robotic fire engine with an interactive Dalmation dog that explains fire safety, expanding the department’s Risk Watch program.

<P>“Children continue to have the highest occurence of injury during fires,” said Phillips. “Having a four-year-old daughter at home myself, I personally understand the importance of teaching children about fire safety and how to make good decisions during emergencies.”

<P>U.S. Congressman Peter Hoekstra announced the Homeland Security grant awarded to the WLFA for the robotic fire engine.

<P>“Children are among the most vulnerable to the dangers posed by fires,” said Hoekstra in a press release. “Teaching them how to properly respond to fires early on will help them escape injury and keep themselves safe.”

<P>The Risk Watch program developed by NFPA provides teachers and firefighters with the tools to teach children the skills and knowledge to make positive choices and prepare for unexpected events. The program includes visits by firefighters to local elementary schools to distribute coloring books and teach children how to dial 9-1-1 and how to stop, drop and roll.

<P>The program administering Assistance to Firefighters grants is DHS Office for Domestic Preparedness in cooperation with the U.S. Administration. The grants require a 10 percent match from the community.

<P>Phillips said the White Lake Fire Authority is exposed to thousands of children during Fire Prevention week as area preschoolers, as well as school children either visit the fire station or the fire department visits preschools and classrooms.

<P>“We aren’t just active during fire prevention week,” said Phillips. “We have students on field trips visit throughout the year.”
