      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
The fuel will be sold at about 40% below market prices to thousands of homes over the winter months.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
Local congressman William Delahunt described the deal as "an expression of humanitarianism at its very best".

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
Venezuela's President Hugo Chavez is one of the Bush administration's biggest adversaries in Latin America.

He first announced his plan to provide cheap heating oil directly to lower-income Americans while visiting Cuba in August.

<b>'About people'
</b>      
<p />
    	  
  	
    
      
The deal involves shipping some 45m litres of heating oil from Venezuela to Massachusetts at a discounted rate via Citgo Petroleum, a US-based subsidiary of the Venezuelan state-owned oil company.

    	  
  	
    
  <p />At a signing ceremony in Massachusetts, Mr Delahunt - a Democrat who helped broker the deal - rejected suggestions that it was politically motivated.

"This is a gesture about people," the Associated Press news agency quotes him as saying.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
"It has nothing to do, as far as I'm concerned, with anything between the Bush administration and the Chavez administration."

    	  
  	
    
      <p />

    	  
  	
    
      
Talks are under way to agree a similar deal to provide discounted heating oil from Venezuela to low-income residents in New York's Bronx district.
