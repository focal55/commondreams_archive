<p>SAN DIEGO   - A former Navy SEAL says he saw fellow SEALs and CIA officials kick, choke and eye-gouge detainees at a U.S. military base in Iraq.

<p>The former SEAL testified at a military hearing Monday that he saw "interrogation by means of abuse" take place at Camp Jenny Pozzi, the SEAL base at Baghdad International Airport

<p>He said a prisoner under interrogation by the CIA was abused in October 2003 by two or three SEALs. On another occasion a month later, the witness said he watched as SEALs punched, choked and poked their fingers in the eye of Iraqi Manadel al-Jamadi, who also was punched by a CIA official when he didn't answer questions.

<p>Al-Jamadi, a suspect in the bombing of a Red Cross facility in Iraq, died a few hours after he was captured during a joint CIA-special operations mission in November 2003. He died while being interrogated by CIA personnel in the shower room of the Abu Ghraib prison.

<p>The former SEAL, who was not identified, was the government's main witness at Monday's Article 32 hearing.

<p>The hearing, the military equivalent of a civilian grand jury, was for a Navy SEAL lieutenant who is accused of assault, maltreatment and conduct unbecoming an officer for his handling of detainees, including al-Jamadi.

<p>A Navy officer hearing the evidence will make a recommendation whether the lieutenant, who was not identified, should face a court-martial.

<p>Although the lieutenant is not charged with al-Jamadi's death, it could be an aggravating factor that could yield stiffer punishment.

<p>The ex-SEAL who testified Monday, and who also served under the lieutenant in Iraq, was kicked out of the elite unit after he was convicted of stealing a fellow SEAL's bulletproof vest - an act that earned him the nickname "Klepto." The sailor said he saw the lieutenant abuse prisoners, including al-Jamadi, three times.

<p>Defense attorney Matthew Freedus challenged the ex-SEAL's credibility during his two-hour cross examination. <p align="center">&copy; Copyright 2005 Associated Press</p>
