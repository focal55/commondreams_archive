"I was working as a builder's labourer on the dry dock of the south wharf of the Yarra. I'm reading the morning paper in the morning tea break."

<P>The news represented a personal triumph for Mr Noone who was on the moratorium committee, the organising body of the anti-war protest that brought 100,000 protesters on to Melbourne's streets.

      Mr Noone, who now edits Australian-Irish magazine <a href="http://www.tain.net.au/" target="_new">Tain</a> and lectures in Irish history at Melbourne University, recounts: "Our son was born on the 24th of April. The war ended on the 30th and I tossed my job in and we took a couple of weeks holiday to celebrate."

<P>For Mr Noone it was the end of a long journey, first as a theology college student imbued with the Catholic Church's pro-American, anti-communist view of the war; then as a priest clashing with Archbishop Knox over the war; and finally as a lay activist hiding draft dodgers in his home.

<P>It was his work as a parish priest at St Albans with young groups that changed his outlook. "We had farewell parties for young men going to Vietnam . . . I got to know the young men. I got to know there were lots of questions on their minds, as there were on my mind."

<P>Mr Noone will tonight be a speaker at a commemoration of the fall of Saigon at Trades Hall. It is, he believes, a moment worth remembering. "There are not many moments in world history when David brings down Goliath."

<P>Another speaker will be one-time Monash University student leader Michael Hyde. He was living in Williamstown, working as a truck driver when a friend phoned with the news. Elated, he switched on the television and saw the helicopters evacuating people from the American embassy. He remembers thinking it had been all worthwhile.

<P>Mr Hyde had helped organise one of the early anti-war demonstrations in California in 1964 where he was studying. He remembers about 50 people marching as FBI agents took photographs.

<P>Back in Australia, he joined the radical Monash Labour Club, as well as fund-raising in city streets for the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. He recalls he and fellow activists being abused as cowards and traitors. Mr Hyde was also temporarily expelled from university, couldn't teach for many years, had trouble getting a house, and was followed by special branch. "At times," he says, "it seemed like a lonely battle."

<P>Now an author, his book Hey Joe took him to Vietnam to research the impact of the war for a younger generation of Australians. He proudly recounts interviewing the rector of Hanoi University of Foreign Languages three years ago, who told him about having to dodge American B52 bombs.

<P>"When I was explaining to him what . . . we had done, he stood up and solemnly, with tears in his eyes, shook my hand and thanked me because all those protests from across the world (had been) conveyed to them and they took great heart from them," he said. 
<P><i>The International Bookshop's commemoration, compered by Rod Quantock, is being held at Trades Hall, corner of Victoria and Lygon streets, tonight at 7.</i>
