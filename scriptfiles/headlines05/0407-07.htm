<P>But US ambassador William Wood said the soldiers are immune from prosecution.

<P>More than 200 Colombian citizens have been extradited to the US to face trial for drug trafficking, under a bilateral deal between the two countries.

<P>Colombian politicians have asked the government to push for the US to hand over the men, arguing that the extradition agreement works both ways.

<P>"In practical terms, these military personnel committed the alleged crime in Colombia, and according to the extradition treaty, which is bilateral, they should be tried here," legislator Gustavo Petro said.

<P>President Alvaro Uribe, who is visiting China, has said he will review the issue "very carefully".

<P><b>Embarrassment</b>

<P>The US ambassador in Colombia has said the men cannot be extradited because of an agreement between the two countries signed in 1974.

<P>He also argued that the men were working for US embassy staff in Colombia and therefore qualify for diplomatic immunity.

<P>He sought to assure Bogota that the soldiers, who are thought to be in military custody somewhere in the US, would not escape justice.

<P>"We do not tolerate corruption," he said.

<P>The whole affair has been extremely embarrassing for the US, which supplies Colombia with hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to fight drug trafficking, says the BBC's Jeremy McDermott.

<P>However, he adds that the Colombian authorities are unlikely to insist upon the extradition because they depend on the US aid.

<P><b>Aid recipient</b>

<P>Five US soldiers were arrested at a US military base in Texas after they stepped off a flight from Colombia on 29 March.

<P>They are suspected of attempting to smuggle 16kg (35 lb) of cocaine on a US military aircraft.

<P>According to the Associated Press news agency, one of the men was later released.

<P>The agency also reports that three of the five suspects were initially detained on Colombian soil - a point Colombian senators say supports their demands for extradition.

<P>The US has more than 1,000 soldiers and civilian contractors working in Colombia as part of a plan to combat a 40-year-old Marxist insurgency and one of its major revenue sources - the cocaine trade.

<P>Colombia is the third biggest recipient of US aid, after Israel and Egypt.
