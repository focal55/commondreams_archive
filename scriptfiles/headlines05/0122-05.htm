<p>George Bush's speechwriter Michael Gerson suffered a mild heart attack while working on Thursday's inaugural address, and its fire-and-brimstone rhetoric seems to have been aimed at having the same effect on some of the world's leaders.
<p>The declaration of an American mission to spread liberty around the world, combined with the religious rhetoric in which it was couched, gave the speech a scarily messianic flavour to many ears, and not just foreign ones.
<p>In a column headed <i><a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/columnists/pnoonan/?id=110006184" target="_new">Way Too Much God</a></i> in yesterday's Wall Street Journal, Ronald Reagan's former speechwriter Peggy Noonan described the speech as "somewhere between dreamy and disturbing" and suggested that the Bush White House might be suffering from "mission inebriation".  
<p>"It was a God-drenched speech," she wrote. "This president, who has been accused of giving too much attention to religious imagery and religious thought, has not let the criticism enter him. God was invoked relentlessly."   
<p>The main thrust of the speech was that America's founding principle, that all people "bear the image of the maker of heaven and earth" and thus have inalienable rights, should now be extended around the globe with the help of the US.  
<p>The spread of democracy and defeat of tyranny was a calling ordained by "the author of liberty".  
<p>Mr Bush has reportedly told aides and supporters in private that he feels he was chosen by God to lead America in its hour of need, and he raised eyebrows earlier this month with the observation that he did not "see how you can be president without a relationship with the Lord".
<p>Language like this is second nature to the president and Mr Gerson, both born-again Christians. Mr Gerson, 40, was a theology graduate and church volunteer before he started writing speeches for Mr Bush in 1999, and it shows. He finished writing the speech after his mild heart attack.  
<p>Mr Bush would not have picked him if his use of language did not fit his own outlook on the world. Mr Bush carefully shaped his second inaugural address, reportedly telling Mr Gerson in November: "I want this to be the freedom speech" and sending back 21 drafts, no doubt contributing to the writer's poor health.  
<p>Mr Gerson's skill has been to draft speeches that fit the president's tone of voice. But he has denied that the vocabulary is intended as a subtle message to Evangelical Christians that the White House is on their side.  
<p>"I try to explain that they're not code words; they're literary references understood by millions of Americans ... they're our culture," he said at a discussion organised last month by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life.
<p>"I don't believe that any of this is a departure from American history. I don't think it's disturbing because it's new," he added. "President Clinton referred to Jesus or Jesus Christ more than the president does."  
<p>Luis Lugo, the Pew Forum's director, said Mr Bush tended to be more ecumenical in his oratory than his predecessors, careful to mention mosques and synagogues in the same breath as churches. On Thursday he was the first president to mention the Qur'an in an inaugural address.   
<p>"Studies I have seen recently suggest his references to religion are not out of step with Clinton's use of language. Clinton, after all, talked about his 'new covenant'," Mr Lugo said.  
<p>Many other presidents, notably Woodrow Wilson, Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan, have employed religious language. Mr Bush was apparently also impressed by John Kennedy's 1961 inaugural address, which he echoed in his call to America's youth for selfless service, and his use of the phrase "survival of liberty".  
<p>Kennedy's speechwriter Ted Sorensen dismissed the comparison. "I measure the speech not by the beauty of the words but the sincerity of its principles. Is the speaker willing to live up to those ideals?" he said.
<p>"Kennedy was making it clear that he was going to work with others. He referred to the UN as our last best hope. I'm glad to hear President Bush say that we look to our allies for our counsel but I'm sure that's news to the allies.  
<p>"As was said of Lyndon Johnson, it's words that get you into the credibility gap but words can't get you out. It's actions."
