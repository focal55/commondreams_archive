<p>CAIRO  - President Bush  sees Sunday's election in
Iraq  as a beacon for freedom in the Middle East, but Arab
reformers say the poll will set back their cause.

<p>
 Arab human rights activists say the Iraqi election is
deeply flawed and will give democracy a bad name. They say
violence and the prospect of a Sunni Arab boycott will
undermine the poll. Many Arabs, already suspicious of U.S.
intentions in Iraq, are also dismissing the vote's credibility
because of the presence of the 150,000 U.S. troops there.

"The influence of the elections for us as democrats is
disastrous," Syrian human rights activist Haytham Manna told
Reuters from Paris. "When you marginalize wide sections of
society from the political process ... this is not democracy."
<p>
 "With this example, all the Arab extremists will say to us:
'You democrats, go to hell, because you haven't been able to
solve our problems with your democracy and elections'," said
Manna, who left Syria in 1978 as a political exile.
<p>
 Some Iraqi Sunni Arab groups are boycotting the election,
saying it cannot be free and fair because of the U.S. military
presence and daily bloodshed in Sunni heartlands.
<p>

 The prospect that majority Shi'ites and minority Kurds will
dominate Iraq's first parliamentary election since Saddam
Hussein  fell in April 2003 has fueled fears of communal strife.
<p>
 "If the U.S. really sees the Iraqi elections as a step to
usher in democracy, Arabs don't need it because it would be a
leap into more bloodshed and chaos," said Mokhtar Trifi, head
of Tunisia's only independent human rights group.
<p>
 Many Arabs think elections held under U.S. occupation can
only produce a government similar to the U.S.-backed interim
government, which they view as an American puppet.
<p>
 DEMOCRATIC CHARADES
<p>
 "The elections depict democracy as if it is connected to
the idea of submission to the American occupier," said Abdel
Halim Qandil, who is campaigning against an extension of
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's 23-year-old rule.
<p>

 "The idea of democracy will lose its reputation in the Arab
world entirely," Qandil said, comparing the Iraqi election with
20th-century polls held in Egypt under British occupation.
"Democratic charades of this type were going on then," he said.
<p>
 Some Arab dissidents also say violence in Iraq has given
Arab governments an excuse to deflect pressure from the Bush
administration for democratic reform across the Middle East.
<p>
 Egyptian civil rights activist Saadeddin Ibrahim said the
chaos in Iraq had allowed the Egypt government to discredit the
U.S. project at home. Cairo was also warning Washington that
political reform in Egypt might unleash extremism.
<p>
 Rights campaigners say U.S. abuse of Iraqi detainees at the
Abu Ghraib jail near Baghdad had also put back the cause of
human rights in Arab states accused of torturing prisoners.
<p>
 Manaa, spokesman for the Arab Commission for Human Rights,
said cases of torture in Arab jails had increased since the Abu
Ghraib scandal. U.S. soldiers involved have faced court
martial.
<p>
 "Arab governments say: 'This is the reform carried out by
the one who calls on us to reform,"' Manaa said.
<p>
 Saudi academic Madawi al-Rasheed said the Abu Ghraib
scandal coupled with air strikes on Falluja, which the U.S.
military said was a stronghold for Sunni insurgents, had lost
America the support of its natural Arab allies in pushing for
democracy.
<p>
 "The educated, liberal classes, they cannot possibly have
positive views vis-a-vis America when these things are going
on," she told Reuters from London.
<p>
But Rasheed said if democracy did take root in Iraq it
would be an example to other Arabs, a view echoed by Shafiq
Ghabra, president of the American University of Kuwait.
<p>
"Today there are few places in the Arab world where you can
have this dynamic expression of ideas, lists, candidates," he
said.
