The ballots represent about 10% of registered voters, poll officials said.
<P>
Partial results show the United Alliance, backed by Shia cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani, leading with more than one-million votes.  
<P>
The Alliance's nearest rival so far is  the list of candidates led by interim Prime Minister Ayad Allawi, with about 360,000 votes.

<P>
The partial results come from six of Iraq's 18 provinces - Baghdad, Dhi Qar, Muthanna, Qadisiya, Najaf and Karbala.
<P>
Officials also said they had sent a team to the northern city of Mosul to look into allegations of irregularities in Sunday's election. 
<P>
There is no indication about when the final results will be known, but they will not be published until they are double-checked, the officials said.
<P>

Election officials warned that it might take another six days before certified results are announced, and even that timeframe may slip.
<P>
<B>Irregularities</B>
<P>
Threats of violence did not deter large numbers of electors voting on 30 January, but there were complaints about polling stations running short ballot papers in several provinces. 
<P>
A team of three lawyers is being sent to ethnically-mixed Mosul - Iraq's third biggest city - to investigate alleged irregularities.
<P>
"We received some complaints and the legal department in our commission is studying these complaints thoroughly," said  election commission official Safwat Rashid.
<P>
Sunni Arabs in particularly complained about being denied the right to vote around Mosul.
<P>
The United Nations chief envoy in Iraq, Ashraf Qazi, has held talks with the leader of the main Sunni Muslim political party, the Iraqi Islamic Party (IIP). 
<P>
On Wednesday, the main Sunni religious organisation, the Associations of Muslim Scholars, said the election had been illegitimate as so many Sunnis Muslims had not taken part in the vote. 
<P>
Mr Qazi expressed the hope that all sectors of Iraqi society would "participate in drawing up the constitution... and our efforts will continue in this direction".
<P>
IIP leader Muhsin Abdul Hamid said talks had centred on "the next government, the constitution and how to bring about co-operation to sort out Iraq's affairs".
