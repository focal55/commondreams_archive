<p>WASHINGTON --
Wal-Mart Stores Inc., trying to fend off lawsuits claiming it 
illegally fired corporate whistle-blowers, has hired the former chief lawyer 
for the Department of Labor, Eugene Scalia, and has begun to fire back at its 
accusers.
<P>Three former employees claim they were fired for reporting misdeeds 
within the company, including relying on Latin American suppliers who forced 
women to take pregnancy tests and using staff members at a Texas optical 
laboratory to do car repairs for supervisors.
<P>Wal-Mart denies it retaliated against the employees, but the allegations 
challenge a pillar of the company's corporate culture  --  a guarantee that 
its 1.2 million U.S. employees can complain about any supervisor without fear 
of retribution. That promise, known as the "open door policy," could be 
seriously undermined if the employees win their cases, lawyers said.
<P>The company said all three  --  Jared Bowen, a former Wal-Mart vice 
president; James Lynn, a mid-level manager at Wal-Mart who oversaw inspections 
of Wal-Mart suppliers in Central and Latin America; and Rickey Armstrong, a 
quality control auditor at Wal-Mart's optical laboratory in Dallas  --  were 
fired for misconduct, not for sniffing out wrongdoing. Lawyers for the 
employees say the retailer is taking a hardball approach  --  disclosing 
potentially damaging allegations about the workers' conduct early in the legal 
process.
<P>It has accused Lynn of fraternizing with a female subordinate, Armstrong 
of failing to disclose a felony conviction on his job application, and Bowen 
of doctoring a college transcript on a job application.
<P>Mona Williams, a Wal-Mart spokeswoman, said the retailer has become "a 
popular target" for employment lawsuits. "If an associate has been treated 
unfairly, we want to make it right. But we have absolutely no tolerance for 
those who think they can make a quick buck off Wal-Mart by crying wolf loudly 
and often."
<P>Steve Kardell, who is representing two of the former employees, said the 
company's tactics "suggest it is very worried about these cases" and the 
consequences for its image.
<P>Wal-Mart says that for a company of its size, it faces relatively few 
employee lawsuits in the United States  --  318 in 2004, or roughly one 
lawsuit for every 3,773 employees. Of those, it said, 217 were settled, 52 
were dismissed and 37 were won through summary judgment. Of 12 that went to 
trial, Wal-Mart won 10.
<P>Scalia, who was solicitor of the Department of Labor from 2002 to 2003, 
is defending Wal-Mart against two of the lawsuits, those filed by Bowen and 
Armstrong under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which expanded whistle-blower 
protections for employees of public companies. Lynn's case was filed on 
different grounds.
<P>Scalia, son of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, was in charge 
of enforcing the whistle-blower protections of the act after it was approved 
in 2002 and has become one of the nation's leading experts on the statute 
since returning to private practice at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP in 
Washington.

<P>Wal-Mart's decision to retain Scalia has drawn fire from groups critical 
of the chain, such as <a href="http://walmartwatch.com/" target="_new">Wal-Mart Watch</a> and <a href="http://www.wakeupwalmart.com/" target="_new">Wake Up Wal-Mart</a>.
<P>"Only in Wal-Mart's America can they think it's right to hire Eugene 
Scalia to defend them against the same whistle-blower law he was supposed to 
help enforce at the Department of Labor," said Chris Kofinis, a spokesman for 
Wake Up Wal-Mart. The group is closely linked to the United Food and 
Commercial Workers International Union, which has tried to organize Wal-Mart's 
nonunion labor force.
<P>Scalia defended his role, saying, "I don't see anything unusual in a 
company seeking out the expertise of somebody who became familiar with the 
requirements of a new law, while serving as a federal law enforcement official.
