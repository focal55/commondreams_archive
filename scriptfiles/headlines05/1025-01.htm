<p>Two U.S. Marines were killed in Iraq
when their vehicle was hit by a roadside bomb, the military
said on Tuesday, pushing the total U.S. military death toll
since the 2003 invasion to 1,999.</p>
<p>A military statement said the Marines died on Friday near
the town of Amariya outside Falluja, a focus of the Sunni Arab
insurgency against the U.S.-backed Baghdad government.</p>
<p>The statement said the deaths were in addition to two other
military personnel, a Marine and a sailor, who were earlier
reported killed in the incident.</p>
<p>U.S. military casualties are now just one short of the
headline-grabbing 2,000 figure -- which is expected to spur
fresh calls for U.S. President George W. Bush to outline an
exit strategy for the conflict in Iraq.</p>
<p>One U.S. soldier, Sergeant Keith Maupin, is listed as
missing following his capture in an attack on a supply convoy
in April last year. He was shown with armed men in video
released by a militant group shortly afterward. His whereabouts
are unknown, but a later insurgent video said he had been
killed.</p>
<p>Reliable figures for the number of Iraqis killed since the
March 2003 U.S.-led invasion are not available but
non-governmental organizations estimate at least 25,000 have
died.
