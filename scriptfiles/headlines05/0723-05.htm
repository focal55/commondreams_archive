<p>British arms exports fuel international conflicts and undermine efforts to improve the human rights records of some of the world's most-criticized regimes, campaigners say. </p>
<p>The Foreign office released two reports this week, one on British arms exports and the other its annual assessment of human rights violations. And the arms control campaigners say they showed that British weaponry and military equipment was sent to countries criticized by the Foreign Office for their human rights records.</p>
<p>The campaigners criticized the Government for arming countries in some of the world's most volatile regions. Ministers say they are "proud of our record" on licensing arms exports and insist human rights are at the forefront of licensing decisions.</p>
<p>But the campaigners criticized the decision to grant arms export licenses for exports to countries such as China and Nepal. They said that 13 countries receiving arms exports from Britain had been criticized in the Foreign Office's report on human rights. The Foreign Office said Britain "continues to have serious concerns about basic human rights in China" yet Britain authorized exports of goods worth &pound;100m to the country during 2004, amid debate in Europe about whether to lift the arms embargo on China.</p>
<p>Officials pointed to "serious abuses" of human rights in Nepal committed both by security forces and the Maoist insurgents, warning of "grave concern" that the situation would deteriorate further. Yet campaigners said that arms exports worth &pound;1.5m were authorized, including licenses for assault-rifle parts between January and March this year.</p>
<p>Anna MacDonald, director of Campaigns for the aid agency Oxfam, said: "It appears the Government is guilty of deadly double standards. It criticized numerous countries for their worsening human rights records in 2004. But only the day before, the Government's annual report on arms exports showed that weapons sales to several of these countries rose last year. It is time for the Government to come clean. It needs to tell us who arms have been sold to and what they will be used for."</p>
<p>Paul Eavis, the director of the pressure group Saferworld, said yesterday: "It is simply not joined-up government that we can be authorizing some of these exports to the very countries whose human rights performance we are so strongly criticizing. The Government must take greater responsibility for where weapons end up after they leave these shores."</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Campaign Against the Arms Trade added: "The Governments arms exports figures show many of the countries of concern highlighted in the human rights report benefited from substantial arms exports. If the Government is to be serious about putting human rights before profits it must stop selling arms to the world's most repressive regimes." The group also criticized the Government for permitting arms exports to countries such as India and Pakistan in known international hotspots.</p>
<p>The spokesman added: "Even this limited record shows that Britain is openly arming human rights abusers, and fueling tension in some of the world's most unstable conflict zones. Again the Government seems oblivious to the potential misuses of arms exports on which it doesn't keep track, and the documented abuses of exports on which it does."</p>
<p>But in its annual Human Rights Report, the Foreign Office insisted: "human rights concerns are at the forefront of our assessment of all export license applications. The UK will not issue an export license if there is a clear risk that the proposed export might be used for internal repression. We exercise special caution and vigilance in issuing licenses to countries where there are serious violations of human rights."</p>
<p>The report said it was legitimate for governments to use force, as long as it was exercised in accordance with international standards. It added: "In assessing the risk of an export being used for internal repression, we examine the human rights record of the ultimate end-user of the goods and the exact nature of the equipment to be exported."</p>

<p>* INDONESIA 106 export licenses issued, worth &pound;12m. Items included components for combat aircraft and bomb disposal equipment.</p>

<p>* NEPAL Four export licenses issued, worth &pound;1.5m, including components for assault rifles.</p>

<p>* ISRAEL 141 licenses issued, worth &pound;12m, including military aero engines and armored vehicles.</p>
<p>The Foreign Office Human Rights Report expresses "grave concern" at Israel's failure to respect the human rights of Palestinians in the occupied territories, although it says there is cause for "cautious optimism" over the Israeli government's plan to withdraw from Gaza</p>
<p>* SAUDI ARABIA 112 licenses issued, worth &pound;19.5m, including machine guns, assault rifles, ammunition, body armor and armored vehicles.</p>
