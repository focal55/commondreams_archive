WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration has spent millions of dollars in the past two months on its campaign to overhaul Social Security, narrowly skirting laws that prohibit spending of taxpayer funds to indirectly lobby Congress<p>President Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney and more than 20 other administration officials have blanketed the country since early February, delivering more than 100 speeches in 37 states in an effort to rally the public behind Bush's Social Security plans.</p><p>Although no hard figures on costs are available, rough calculations show the White House and other agencies have spent at least $2.2 million on the campaign so far.</p><p>The nonpartisan Government Accountability Office has been asked by Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., to investigate the costs of the pro-privatization effort. Republicans on the House Appropriations Committee have also asked quietly for an accounting, according to the Washington Post.</p><p>Waxman, the top Democrat on the House Government Reform Committee, asked the GAO to determine whether "the Bush administration has crossed the line from education to propaganda."</p><p>Federal law prohibits spending any public funds for publicity or propaganda designed to support or defeat legislation pending in Congress. </p><p>But in practice prosecutors and courts have found it difficult to clearly define what's a legitimate public relations effort and what's illegal propaganda.</p><p>The line is murky. "Informing the public is the president's responsibility," Waxman wrote. "Using taxpayer resources to mount a sophisticated propaganda and lobbying campaign is an abuse of the president's high office."</p><p>Earlier this year, Waxman and other Democrats complained about what they said was an increasingly political tone in public documents produced by the Social Security Administration. </p><p><span class="lb01">Bush making history</span></p><p>Bush's devotion to the cause has few historical precedents.</p><p>Not since Woodrow Wilson fought for the League of Nations with his last ounce of strength has an American president wooed the public so ardently for their support on domestic legislation.</p><p>"There's been nothing remotely like this" in recent decades, said Stephen Hess, a scholar at the Brookings Institution specializing in presidential politics. </p><p>Presidential historians say Bush is attempting a very difficult maneuver, akin to a bank shot in billiards. Typically, a president has success when fanning the public's latent opinions, but not when trying to move a skeptical public to his point of view.</p><p>Polls show the president is making little headway in persuading the public to demand changes in the venerable old age and disability insurance program. Fewer Americans see Social Security as a crucial issue now than did before Bush and his team embarked on their campaign.</p><p>Perhaps more importantly, members of Congress are not flocking to his banner.</p><p>While most recent presidents have used the "bully pulpit" to go directly to the people, no president has expended the kind of effort on a legislative issue that Bush and his administration have on the issue of crafting private investment accounts onto Social Security.</p><p><span class="lb01">60 cities, 60 days</span></p><p>Bush himself has spoken at 25 events in 20 states on the topic since his State of the Union address in early February. According to press reports, Bush's audiences are carefully screened to exclude those expressing disapproval of his plans. </p><p>Twenty-two other administration officials, including Vice President Dick Cheney, Treasury Secretary John Snow, three other Cabinet secretaries and four top officials at the Social Security Administration, have been on the road talking up the need to overhaul Social Security. </p><p>All told, officials in the White House and other executive agencies have delivered 120 speeches in 37 states. The Bush administration is well on its way to its goal of visiting 60 cities in 60 days with the Social Security reform message. <A class="lk001" HREF="http://www.strengtheningsocialsecurity.gov/60stops/">Read more.</A></p><p>At the Treasury Department, four full-time public relations aides have been hired to run the Social Security information center, nicknamed "the war room," that tracks congressional and public opinion.</p><p>The four aides coordinate public events, matching administration officials with congressmen and others who are sponsoring events across the nation. They also maintain a website that serves as a central clearinghouse for the administration's lobbying efforts. <A class="lk001" HREF="http://www.strengtheningsocialsecurity.gov/">See the website.</A>

			</p><p>The Treasury secretary is one of four administration officials who serve on the Social Security board of trustees. The Social Security Administration is an independent agency meant to be nonpartisan.</p><p>Even as the White House has excluded opponents of privatization from even the audience at its events, the administration forced the cancellation of one event on Social Security sponsored by liberal groups at the FDR Library in Hyde Park, N.Y., on the grounds that the speakers were one-sided against Bush.</p><p><span class="lb01">Costs of the lobbying campaign</span></p><p>The administration won't say how much the Social Security campaign has cost.</p><p>A White House spokesman said the costs of the White House's efforts, including travel, are not disclosed to the public. A Treasury Department spokesman said the sums expended by his agency were "minimal." The Social Security Administration said it would look into the costs of sending three officials to 10 states .</p><p>One part of the total cost can be estimated. At an estimated cost of $60,000 per hour for Air Force One, Bush's 18,850 miles of travel to 23 cities and towns to lobby on Social Security have cost the Air Force about $1.8 million so far.</p><p>The White House has estimated in the past that staff costs for out-of-town events run between $22,000 and $59,000 per day. White House staff costs for Bush's 13 days out of town would thus total between $286,000 and $767,000.</p><p>Other costs of a presidential trip can be substantial. Typically, other planes accompany Air Force One, bringing needed security, communications and transportation equipment and personnel. Auditoriums must be rented and outfitted for the presidential visit, including extra security and secure communications.</p><p>Some costs are borne by others.</p><p>For example, a spokeswoman for the Qwest Center in Omaha, Neb., said the city spent about $70,000 on traffic and security arrangements for Bush's Social Security event in early February.</p><p>Cheney has delivered four speeches on Social Security in the past two months. His plane costs the Air Force about $11,000 an hour to operate, with total costs of his trips estimated at about $160,000.</p><p>Treasury Secretary John Snow "flies coach," his spokesman said. One or two aides, plus security, accompany Snow on trips. Snow has delivered 10 speeches on Social Security in five separate trips.</p><p>Four top officials of the Social Security Administration have delivered 42 speeches, sometimes as many as four a day.</p><p><span class="lb01">The laws</span></p><p>Much of the lobbying effort is likely legal under longstanding Justice Department guidelines that exempt the president, his aides and his political appointees from the main anti-lobbying law.</p><p>Lobbying by the executive branch is banned by two separate laws. One law, dating from 1919, prohibits spending any federal money on "any personal service, advertisement, telegram, telephone, letter, printed or written matter, or other device, intended or designed to influence in any manner a Member of Congress...." <A class="lk001" HREF="http://straylight.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode18/usc_sec_18_00001913----000-.html">Read the law.</A></p><p>The statute does have a very large escape clause, however: It allows "any communication whose prohibition by this section might, in the opinion of the Attorney General, violate the Constitution or interfere with the conduct of foreign policy, counter-intelligence, intelligence, or national security activities."</p><p>The Justice Department, under both Republican and Democratic administrations, has ruled that the law does not apply to the president, vice president, presidential aides, or any officer confirmed by the Senate. All but one of the 23 officials who've participated in the public lobbying effort appears to fall under this exception.</p><p>Mike Korbey, a senior adviser to the Social Security Administration, is the sole exception. He's participated in 15 events in the "60 Stops in 60 Days" tour.</p><p>Korbey joined the agency directly from a long stint as the top lobbyist for United Seniors Association, a group that is spending up to $10 million supporting Bush's privatization plan and attacking groups, such as the AARP, that are opposed to privatization.</p><p>The anti-lobbying statute does not apply to any public speech, appearance or publication, the Justice Department has said. Finally, the Justice Department has said the law applies only to "substantial" grassroots lobbying costing more than $50,000.</p><p>No one has ever been prosecuted under this law. The courts have ruled that there is no private right to sue government officials under the statute; only the Justice Department may bring a complaint.</p><p>A second law prohibits lobbying with taxpayer money, with a lower threshold for prosecution.</p><p>The 2005 appropriations bill for most government agencies this year provides that: "No part of any appropriation contained in this Act shall be used, other than for normal and recognized executive-legislative relationships, for publicity or propaganda purposes, for the preparation, distribution, or use of any kit, pamphlet, booklet, publication, radio, television, or video presentation designed to support or defeat legislation pending before the Congress or any State legislature, except in presentation to the Congress or any State legislature itself."  <A class="lk001" HREF="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c108:H.R4818.ENR:">Read the law.</A></p><p>In the past, the Justice Department and the courts have given public officials great discretion to spend money communicating with the public.</p><p>"Yet on the other hand, the statute has to mean something," the GAO has said. "As long as the law exists, there has to be a point beyond which government action violates it." <A class="lk001" HREF="http://www.gao.gov/special.pubs/3rdeditionvol1.pdf">Read the 643-page GAO guide to appropriations law.</A></p><p>Typically, the courts have allowed taxpayer-funded publicity efforts as long as no overt appeal is made for listeners or readers to contact their representatives or senators about a specific bill.</p><p>Bush says his goal is go directly to the people and persuade them to pressure Congress to change Social Security. He explicitly tells his audiences to write their congressman. <A class="lk001" HREF="http://www.whitehouse.gov/infocus/social-security/index.html">Read Bush's speeches.</A></p><p>"My advice to you, everybody else, people watching, is write your senators and write your congresspeople," Bush said in an appearance in Pensacola, Fla. "Let them know you're concerned, let them know you're interested."</p><p>In an appearance in Iowa, Bush said lawmakers who balk should be held accountable. "There's a political price for not getting involved in the process.... There's a political price for saying it's not a problem," Bush said. </p><p>Bush has just begun to campaign.  "My job is to confront problems," Bush said in his March press conference. "And I'll continue to talk about Social Security for the next period of time."</p><p>White House spokeswoman Catherine Martin said Bush will likely continue to travel and speak about Social Security for several more months. </p><p><span class="lb01">Past lobbying efforts</span></p><p>Presidential historians said Bush's lobbying on Social Security is the most intense presidential effort at least since Franklin Delano Roosevelt's fireside chats in the early 1930s helped establish the New Deal (including Social Security), or perhaps since Woodrow Wilson fought unsuccessfully for U.S. entry into the League of Nations in 1919. </p><p>Other presidents have "gone public" in much the same way as Bush is now doing, said Andrew Rudalevige, a political scientist at Dickinson College now on a sabbatical at the Wilson School at Princeton University. Rudalevige said Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton and Bush himself have used their bully pulpit to rally the public to put pressure on Congress.</p><p>The current effort on Social Security is on a different level, however, because of Bush's almost sole dedication to the issue in many of his public comments. </p><p>"He's devoting two days a week to it," said White House spokeswoman Martin. </p><p>Perhaps the closest recent comparison is Clinton's effort to reform health care in 1993 and 1994. Clinton often spoke of his plan at town-hall meetings across the country, along with dozens of other issues. </p><p>But Clinton was easily distracted, scholar Hess said. "He never focused on anything to this extent."</p><p>The White House quickly abandoned its grassroots lobbying and turned to persuading elites.</p><p>Finally, as the health-care plan was moving through Congress, First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton embarked on a national bus tour to campaign for her plan, paid for by private donations. Her tour was a flop, however, as protesters often outnumbered supporters at stops.</p><p>Ultimately, Clinton's plan went down defeat without even a vote in Congress. </p><p>"The fundamental political mistake committed by Bill Clinton and his aides was in grossly overestimating the capacity of a president to win public opinion and to use public support as leverage,&quot; concluded political scientists Lawrence R. Jacobs and Robert Y. Shapiro. <p><i>Rex Nutting is Washington bureau chief of MarketWatch.
