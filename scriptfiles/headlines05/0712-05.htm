<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p>America has banned its 12,000 airforce personnel stationed in the UK from travelling to London to &quot;ensure their safety and security&quot; in the aftermath of last week's bombings in the capital.<p>The directive has led to the staff at air bases having to cancel sight-seeing coach trips and excursions to theatre shows and other events for personnel and their families.<p>UK tourism authorities have pointed out the policy contra dicts police advice that London is open for business and returning to normal.<p>A USAF spokeswoman at Mildenhall in Suffolk said: "The order was made in a battle staff directive from our wing commander.<p>"Military members are not allowed to go to London until further notice. They are not being allowed to go anywhere inside the M25.<p>"Family members who are US civilians and are not subject to orders are also being highly encouraged to stay away from London.<p>"The main reason is because the security of our people is our top concern."<p>A USAF spokesman at nearby Lakenheath, which is home to about 60 F-15 fighters and fighter bombers, defended the ban. He said: "We are taking prudent measures to ensure the security and safety of our airmen, civilians, their families and our resources."<p>Patricia Yates, a spokeswoman for the UK tourism 
 authority VisitBritain, said the US military's behaviour seemed at odds with the attitude of many American visitors.<p>"It is up to the American military to make their own deci sion on these matters - but our information is that American tourists have not been put off coming over from the States," she said.<p>Many people, however, had 
 no choice but to return to the capital yesterday. For many commuters it was the first time they had ventured on to the underground since last Thursday's atrocities.<p>London's mayor, Ken Livingstone, sought to lead the way by turning his normal 35-minute underground journey from north-west London to City Hall into a symbol of the capital's collective defiance.<p>As he entered the station at Willesden Green, he said: "We are going to work. We carry on our lives. We don't let a small group of terrorists change the way we live."<p>Asked if people should try to forget about last week's bomb attack, he said: "We carry on our lives. I don't think we ever stop thinking about last week."<p>In that, the mayor seemed to be reflecting the thoughts of ordinary Londoners. At King's Cross at 8.50am - the time of last Thursday's tube explosions - commuters said just the act of going to work had assumed great significance.<p>Neil Gates, 46, of Stevenage, Hertfordshire, said he had been unable to sleep the night before because he normally catches the Circle line train that was caught in the blast.<p>"The atmosphere on the train coming in was very quiet. I wanted to come in on Friday. I felt like life should continue," he said. "I certainly feel a sense of defiance against those trying to wreck our lives."<p>Kate Adderley, from Market Harborough, said she was determined to be steadfast. "I think everyone is coming together. Just walking from the train, everyone was really quiet around me, but there was a feeling of trying to overcome this disaster and to try and get on with life as usual."<p>Sales of bicycles in London have soared since Thursday's bombings, the capital's biggest cycle retailer said yesterday.<p>Evans Cycles said it was selling double the usual number and that the extra sales were almost all of fold-up models suitable for commuters.<p align="CENTER">&copy; 2005 Guardian Newspapers, Ltd.</P><p align="CENTER">###</p><!-- #EndEditable --></font></td></tr>
