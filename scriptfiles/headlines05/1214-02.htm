<p> Tony Blair and Jack Straw, the Foreign Secretary, were under pressure last night to refute convincingly claims that Britain has been complicit in alleged use of CIA planes to take suspected terrorists for torture in secret camps abroad. 
<p>

  Sir Menzies Campbell, the Liberal Democrat deputy leader, has accused the 
  Government of conducting a "hear no evil, see no evil" policy on 
  renditions, after repeated denials that Britain is colluding in transporting 
  prisoners to countries where torture is reputedly widespread. But there are 
  signs that the Government's attempt to keep free of the controversy are 
  becoming untenable, amid calls from MPs, human rights groups and European 
  bodies for an in-depth investigation.
</p>
<p>
  The Foreign Secretary revealed on Monday for the first time that he had 
  agreed as Home Secretary to rendition for two flights from the UK to the US 
  under the Clinton administration on the grounds that the suspects were to 
  stand trial. He refused a third, he said, because he was not satisfied about 
  the arrangements for sending the suspect to a third country.
</p>
<p>
  Yesterday, under cross-examination by the Foreign Affairs Committee of the 
  Commons about rendition, Mr Straw said there could be a fourth case. He said 
  that the Home Office was still checking the records.
</p>
<p>
  The Foreign Secretary's own integrity is not on the line, but the approach 
  of the Government as a whole has been brought under severe question by the 
  affair. Last week, challenged by Charles Kennedy at Prime Minister's 
  Questions about the CIA flights, Mr Blair said: "I don't know what you 
  are referring to."
</p>
<p>

  Yesterday Mr Straw said: "Unless we all start to believe in conspiracy 
  theories and that the officials are lying, I'm lying and that behind this 
  there is some kind of secret state in league with some dark forces in the 
  US, and we believe Secretary [of State Condoleezza] Rice is lying, there is 
  simply no truth in claims that the UK has been involved in rendition."
</p>
<p>
  But the Government's attempts to minimize the issue are being treated with 
  skepticism. An all-party group of MPs on rendition last night published the 
  legal opinion of James Crawford, Whewell professor of international law at 
  the University of Cambridge, warning the Government that it could not rely 
  on received assurances from the US Secretary of State to avoid it being 
  accused of breaking its international obligations to stop prisoners being 
  sent for torture.
</p>
<p>
  He said Ms Rice's statement that the US "does not transport and has not 
  transported detainees from one country to another for the purpose of 
  interrogation using torture" did "not bring complete assurance 
  that the practice is not occurring". Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative 
  chairman of the group, said: "It is crystal clear the UK must 
  investigate allegations it has been complicit in torture. Checking for 
  instances of the US requesting permission [to land planes in the UK] is 
  simply derisory."
</p>
<p>
  Plane spotters in the UK have provided photographic evidence of CIA flights 
  landing and taking off. Yesterday, a Transport minister told Sir Menzies 
  that they did not take records of civil flights that may stop in the UK for 
  refuelling. The question put by Sir Menzies had specifically identified 
  Gulfstream 5 N379P, a private jet allegedly operated by a CIA front company, 
  which carried, it is claimed, Saad Madni, a suspected terrorist, for 
  questioning. Last night, the Government's critics said the CIA flights were 
  using private jets to avoid international obligations under the Chicago 
  Convention to ask for permission for the flights.
</p>
<p>
  Sir Menzies said it was still possible that rendition flights were still 
  happening. "I am pretty certain it is not enough for the Government to 
  have a kind of hear no evil, see no evil policy."

</p>
<p>
  Europe's leading human rights watchdog said that evidence gathered in an 
  investigation into claims that the US illegally held detainees in several 
  European countries has "reinforced the credibility of the allegations"
. Dick Marty, a Swiss parliamentarian conducting an inquiry for the Council of 
  Europe, said he had unearthed "clues" that Poland and Romania were 
  implicated, perhaps unwittingly. Both countries have denied any involvement. 
  "Based on what I have been able to learn, currently, there are no 
  secret detainees held by the US in Europe," said Mr Marty, speaking in 
  Paris. "To my knowledge, those detainees were moved about a month ago, 
  maybe a little more."
</p>
<p>
  Many observers believe the lack of pressure from European governments shows 
  that several may have been made aware of what was taking place. One diplomat 
  argued: "This row is not being fuelled by the governments in Europe. It 
  is being led by the media and public opinion."
