<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->MULTAN, Pakistan  - Police arrested seven men who allegedly kidnapped and gang-raped a married woman in retaliation for her cousin's affair with one of the suspect's daughter, a police official said Wednesday.

<p>The case is reminiscent of the gang rape of 33-year-old Mukhtar Mai, who last week won a court appeal overturning the acquittals of 13 of her attackers after drawing international attention to her plight by speaking out.

<p>Both cases involve a woman targeted for punishment for the actions of a male relative.

<p>The latest attack occurred last week in the town of Chaniot, about 150 miles northwest of Multan, the main city in Pakistan's eastern Punjab province.

<p>One suspect was angered over a relationship between his 17-year-old daughter and the victim's 24-year-old cousin, so he and his accomplices kidnapped the victim and gang-raped her, police official Mahar Mumtaz said.

<p>The seven suspected rapists were arrested Tuesday after police received a complaint from the 30-year-old victim's family, he said. "The woman has told us that she was kidnapped and raped by seven men last week," he said.

<p>The lead suspect told police his daughter was kidnapped and sexually assaulted by the youth, but an initial police probe showed the woman willingly went with the young man to a nearby city last month, Mumtaz said.

<p>Police plan to question the daughter and the young man to find out "the nature of their relations," he said, adding that officers will "determine who is right and who is wrong" and "send this to a court soon."

<p>Hundreds of women are raped or killed every year in Pakistan in so-called "honor" attacks over behavior deemed inappropriate, including extramarital affairs or marriage without a family's consent. <p align="CENTER">&copy; 2005 AP<p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable --></font></td></tr>
