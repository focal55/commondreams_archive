"I know I am condemned... I'm sure in Washington they are
planning my death," Chavez said in a regular Sunday broadcast.
"If anything happens to me, you can forget about Venezuela's
oil Mr Bush."
 <p>
 Chavez was reacting to recent criticism of his left-wing
government by U.S. officials. He often accuses Washington of
backing opposition attempts to oust or even kill him, a charge
Washington denies.
 <p>

 "If they manage to kill me there will only be one person in
this world to blame: the president of the United States,"
Chavez said. "If you try, you will regret it Comrade Mr Bush."
 <p>
 Diplomatic ties between the United States and Venezuela,
one of its key oil suppliers, have soured since Chavez came to
power nearly six years ago promising to fight poverty.
 
<p>
 U.S. officials have stepped up their criticism of Chavez
since January when Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice branded
him a "negative force" in Latin America.
 
<p>
 A tough-talking former army officer, Chavez presents
himself as alternative to what he sees as U.S. imperialist
policies. He says President Bush's administration backed a 2002
coup against him, which he survived, and then financed a vote
campaign to try and oust him.
 
<p>
 U.S. officials worry about Chavez's close ties with Cuban
leader Fidel Castro and have suggested he also backs insurgent
groups in the region, including Marxist rebels in Colombia.
 <p>
 U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Robert Zoellick last week
said Chavez was part of a trend of creeping authoritarianism
and Washington is concerned that Russian rifles bought by
Venezuela could aid Colombian rebels.
 <p>
 Chavez's accusation on Sunday echoed similar comments by
Castro who said earlier this month that United States would be
responsible if Chavez were assassinated.<p align="CENTER">&copy; 2005 Reuters</p><p align="CENTER">###</p><!-- #EndEditable --></font></td></tr>
