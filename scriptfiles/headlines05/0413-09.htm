<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p>A shipment of nuclear power plant fuel made from weapons-grade plutonium has arrived in the United States nearly three weeks after it was shipped from France, despite protests from activists who said the shipment poses environmental and terrorist threats.

<P>The shipment of mixed-oxide fuel reached Charleston about midnight Tuesday, Duke Power spokeswoman Rose Cummings said. The MOX fuel, a mixture of plutonium oxide and uranium oxide, will be tested at the Catawba Nuclear Station on Lake Wylie, which is about 20 miles south of Charlotte.

<P>The U.S. Energy Department shipped the batch of plutonium to France for conversion into MOX because there isn’t a plant in the United States that can do it. Officials want to build a conversion facility at the Savannah River Site near Aiken, but construction has been delayed.

<P>“The U.S. Department of Energy has taken possession of the MOX fuel and they, that is the Department of Energy, will deliver that fuel to Catawba in time for our routine refueling of our Catawba reactor,” Cummings said.

<P>The testing at Catawba is part of the beginning stages of a U.S.-Russian agreement to convert 34 metric tons of surplus plutonium.

<P>The shipment arrived in Charleston amid a small group of protesters, who tried unsuccessfully to follow a convoy thought to be carrying the fuel.

<P>Tom Clements of Greenpeace International was in Charleston when the heavily guarded shipments arrived. He thought the shipments were headed to Catawba and is concerned the nuclear plant has not met Nuclear Regulatory Commission security requirements. The NRC said last month several conditions still needed to be met.

<P>Clements said it appears the heavily guarded shipments from Charleston were headed to the Savannah River Site, rather than the York County nuclear reactor. Anti-nuclear activists have said the government would have to keep the material in a secure location until the NRC approvals are granted for depositing the MOX at Catawba.

<P>“They never should have sent this stuff over from France without having their ducks in a row, and it’s quite clear that they’re scrambling to meet the conditions of storage,” said Clements. “To me it represents the poor planning for the overall plutonium disposition program, and they’re just trying to make up things as they go along.”

<P>But the National Nuclear Security Administration and Duke Power officials said everything has proceeded as planned without any delays. Both said the nuclear plant will have met the NRC requirements by the time the shipments arrive at Catawba. Cummings would not say Tuesday what the security requirements are or if they have been met.

<P>“The fuel assemblies are secure and have been secure without any significant incidents,” NNSA spokesman Bryan Wilkes said. “Everything is on schedule. It’s been on schedule and according to plan.”

<P>There was at least one minor incident. Clements said he was pulled over by authorities and questioned. He was not given a citation and was let go.

<P>“We were able to get right up near the trucks,” said Clements, who was worried the convoy was easy to spot leaving the Charleston Naval Weapons Station.

<P>“If we can do it, anybody can do it,” Clements said. “To me it was quite obvious if we could identify them with minimal resources then anyone could identify them.”

<P>Wilkes said the Energy Department has a long history of safely transporting nuclear materials.

<P>“We will deliver the MOX fuel assemblies to Catawba at the appropriate time,” Wilkes said.
