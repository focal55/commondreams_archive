<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p>WASHINGTON -- Senior Democrats are increasingly confident that they have blocked Republicans plans for historic breakthroughs in legislation under GOP control of the White House and Congress, declaring that the Democratic strategy of unified opposition to major items on the leadership agenda has succeeded in turning Republicans against themselves.

<P>Democratic leaders say the focus on opposition, rather than on their own legislative proposals, has allowed them to hold up President Bush's plans to remake Social Security. They are honing a message that highlights what they portray as Republican abuses of power, and say their new level of party discipline is forcing Republicans to wrestle with their own divisions over judicial confirmations, foreign affairs, and taxing and spending.

<P>''The Democratic caucus has never been as unified, and you've seen it on Social Security, the budget, and judges," said Senate minority leader Harry Reid of Nevada. ''It took a while for us to realize that we weren't in the majority. I think, though, we have learned the lesson well. And we have also learned that the majority party won't be in the majority forever."

<P>Democrats acknowledge the strategy carries the risk that members will be viewed as obstructionists, focused on what they can stop instead of what they can accomplish. Republicans hope to use Democratic opposition as a weapon in 2006 elections, and Bush still has time in his second term to guide his priorities into law.

<P>Nonetheless, after 10 years as the minority party in Congress, many Democrats who in the past have pushed for the party to offer explicit alternatives are realizing they can more effectively communicate their message by positioning themselves in the ways they oppose Republicans, said Representative Barney Frank, a Newton Democrat.

<P>''The official agenda is entirely in their hands, and it's very hard to get things that are being done unofficially into the public debate. Therefore, it makes sense for us to define what we are doing in terms of the opposition to the official agenda," said Frank, who was first elected to Congress in 1980. ''We do have a positive agenda to get to, but we first have to get everybody's attention by stressing our opposition to what they do."

<P>In previous years, Bush took advantage of Democrats' willingness to cut deals -- and offer specific alternatives to his proposals -- to keep his own majorities on board for his biggest priorities.

<P>On tax cuts, the Medicare prescription drug benefit, and the No Child Left Behind education law, Bush was able to pick off Democratic votes. Bush did not veto a single bill in his first term, and some predicted easier advancement this term, after an election where Republicans picked up four seats in the Senate and two in the House.

<P>But 100 days into the new Congress, Democrats have rarely strayed from the party fold. Senate Democrats for the first time have a communications team that operates out of a ''war room" on the third floor of the Capitol, an innovation that has helped solidify opposition to changing Social Security and to some of Bush's conservative judicial nominees. Democrats have resisted calls to offer a competing proposal to overhaul Social Security, preferring to attack Bush's plan.

<P>In the larger and more unruly House, leaders have also focused on their opposition to Republicans, with town hall meetings across the country held to oppose personal accounts in Social Security. House leaders have supplemented the tradition of offering a detailed Democratic agenda (bills that have virtually no chance of passing in the GOP-controlled Congress) by rolling out a series of ''core values" that draw contrasts with Bush administration policies.

<P>That list includes items such as affordable healthcare, opportunities for children to attend universities, accountability in government, and making sure troops go into combat with the equipment they need -- all areas where Bush and his fellow Republicans have potential political vulnerability.

<P>''I'm very proud of our Democrats, because they know why they are Democrats," said House minority leader Nancy Pelosi of California. ''We have from the start come together as Democrats, focused on our core values which unite us as a party, and then proceeded from there. That consensus is what has kept us -- if you want to use the word 'disciplined,' but a better word in my view is 'united.' "

<P>An Associated Press-Ipsos poll released Friday suggested that Democratic efforts have been effective. The poll indicated that 54 percent of respondents disapprove of Bush's handling of the presidency. The Republican-led Congress received lower marks, with 37 percent expressing a favorable opinion of its work, down from 41 percent in January. The margin of error in the poll of 1,001 people, taken April 4-6, was three percentage points.

<P>Republicans are roiling over how to proceed with Social Security when a united Democratic caucus can block a vote in the Senate. Fifty of the 55 Republicans must vote together to change Senate rules to outlaw filibusters of judicial nominees, and several moderate Republicans are considering joining Democrats in opposing the move.

<P>The nomination of John R. Bolton to become Bush's United Nations ambassador is in doubt because of united Democratic opposition and a single on-the-fence Republican member of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island.

<P>Democrats are hoping the opposition will force Republicans to retreat, particularly in efforts to remake Social Security and confirm conservative judges. Only then, they say, would they work with Republicans to address priorities such as Bush's long-stalled energy bill, tax and spending items, and further education overhauls.

<P>Republicans point out that Bush's second term is still young. They have accomplished a few longstanding priorities, including a bill designed to limit the damages available through class-action lawsuits, and to crack down on personal bankruptcy filers.

<P>Brian Jones, the Republican National Committee's communications director, said Democrats' strategy of obstruction is emblematic of why they have suffered in recent elections. The Democratic Party, he said, has not been able to communicate its vision effectively to voters, and now finds itself declaring victories when it slows or stops Republicans -- not when it achieves things for the American people, Jones said.

<P>''They're mistaking their obstructionism for progress," he said. ''They've become completely reactive, and essentially devoid of new ideas. It may be a cathartic exercise, given their lack of success in recent elections, but ultimately it's going to be a losing strategy."

<P>Bush said Friday he expects that lawmakers will come together to address Social Security this year.

<P>''I'm not surprised people want to avoid this issue," the president said aboard Air Force One, as he returned from the funeral of Pope John Paul II. ''I'm very optimistic that, when it's all said and done, the legislators will understand that the American people recognize there's a problem in Social Security and expect something to be done."

<P>But Democrats say they sense a powerful issue for future campaigns in portraying the Republican Party as ''drunk with power," said Karen Finney, a spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee.

<P>It is a case that the committee chairman, former Vermont governor Howard Dean, is beginning to make in speaking engagements across the country: He is connecting the GOP drive to intervene in the Terri Schiavo case, take control of the judiciary, and privatize a portion of Social Security with the ethics problems swirling around House majority leader Tom DeLay of Texas, Finney said.

<P>Reid, the Senate minority leader, used a national radio address Saturday to rail against Republicans for seeking to jettison the checks and balances that have been in place for more than two centuries.

<P>''Republicans are trying to increase their power even if it means ignoring rules that go back to America's beginnings," Reid said. ''They seem to think that they know better than our Founding Fathers. Somehow, I doubt that's true."
