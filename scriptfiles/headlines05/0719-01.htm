<p>NEW YORK - While Washington continues to spend billions of 
dollars on its global "war on terror," thousands of ordinary people who 
took part in cleaning up the World Trade Center site after the Sep. 11, 
2001 attacks are left wondering if they will ever receive a single penny 
from the government for medical treatment.
<p>
							  "<i><a href="http://www.jonathanlevin.com/NTS.htm" target="_new">Never the Same</a></i>," a recently released documentary, shows how tens of 
thousands of courageous New Yorkers rushed to the Twin Towers -- while 
they were still burning -- to save the lives of their fellow citizens.
<p>
Yet their ailments from exposure to toxic materials like asbestos and 
mercury at the site remain largely unacknowledged by government 
officials and callous politicians.
<p>
Driven by a deep sense of solidarity and compassion for the victims, 
they worked day in and day out among the poisonous clouds of dust and 
the toxic smoke that hovered above the Manhattan skyline for weeks.
<p>
As a result, many are still suffering from physical and emotional 
sicknesses, including severe breathing problems, skin rashes, nausea, 
depression and anxiety.
<p>
Preliminary data released by Manhattan's Mount Sinai Hospital, which was 
given funding to screen workers involved in the clean-up and recovery 
efforts, found that some 80 percent of emergency responders reported at 
least one respiratory symptom attributable to the aftermath of Sep. 11, 
including sore throat, chest tightness, cough and wheezing. Half were 
still having problems a year after the attacks.
<p>

"Despite sacrifices made by those selfless individuals," says Jonathan 
Levin, director of the film, "nothing has been provided by the U.S. 
government for their physical and emotional healthcare, while the 
Workers Compensation system treats them as frauds."
<p>
Workers Compensation is a state-run program that provides medical 
treatment and cash benefits for workers injured on the job -- regardless 
of their legal status. The window of time in which workers must file a 
claim usually expires two years after they first become aware of their 
injury.
<p>
Kevin Mount, a sanitation engineer who worked to clear the rubble, told 
reporters at a press conference in February that his experience with the 
municipal workers compensation board was "one big runaround".
<p>
After being hospitalized in February 2002 and diagnosed with restrictive 
airway disease, hepatitis C, sinusitis, gastric reflux disease and 
depression, Mount had to fight for three years to get assistance.
<p>
"The attorneys for New York disputed each and every one of my injuries," 
he said.
<p>
Spanning nearly half an hour, "Never the Same" is based on interviews 
with doctors and rescue workers who are still suffering from various 
diseases, and footage of testimony by legislators before the U.S. 
Congress.
<p>
In interviews with Levin, doctors at Mount Sinai who have seen and 
treated the rescue workers say that in addition to cancer, many affected 
volunteers may continue to suffer from asthma and other kinds of 
respiratory diseases for years.
<p>
"They should be examined year after year," says Dr. Stephen Levin, the 
director's father, who runs the clinic at Mount Sinai. "They need long-
term medical help."
<p>
Levin and others testify that many of the patients they saw had no such 
diseases before Sep. 11.

<p>
According to one participant in a Congressional hearing held in November 
2003, about 40,000 people took part in the rescue and cleanup operation 
at the World Trade Center site. They included a large number of 
undocumented immigrants, mostly from Latin American countries.
<p>
"I was a healthy father, son and husband before Sep. 11," a rescue 
worker tells U.S. lawmakers in the film. "Now I am a chronically ill man 
and anxious about my ability to support my family."
<p>
"I am no longer able to work. It breaks my heart not to be able to run 
and play with my daughter," he adds.
<p>
Moved by the rescue worker's story, Congressman Jerrold Nadler tells his 
fellow lawmakers: "People who are no longer able to work are being 
fired. They have no health benefits. This is not the way to treat them."
<p>
In the same hearing, Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney voices her concern 
over the official apathy towards the welfare of Sep. 11 heroes. "How in 
the world are other first responders going to respond to disasters if 
they see the first responders to Sep. 11 are not, at the very minimum, 
given health care?
<p>
Many experts in government bodies, according to Dr. Levin, refused to 
accept compensation claims by branding victims as "liars and cheats."
<p>
"It's infuriating that people who have done so much to help others have 
been put to this level of misery. They have been made to feel if they 
filed claims, they were essentially maligners and criminals," he 
says. "This is unacceptable."
<p>
The opening scenes of the movie show Pres. George W. Bush standing next 
to a team of rescue workers at the Trade Center site and a government 
official thanking all "those volunteers who took part in the rescue 
efforts."
<p>

This is contrasted with footage of doctors and volunteers exposing the 
hollowness of the official rhetoric. "I went down there to help," says 
one worker. "Now, it seems like I am one of the victims."
<p>
Rev. Franklin Chandler, a bus operator who rescued many people on Sep. 
11, is genuinely angry. About the official refusal to compensate, he 
says: "It's really a slap in the face."
<p>
Levin says he chose to bring to light the stories of volunteers 
because "not only do they deserve recognition for their remarkable 
efforts, they deserve the healthcare they need to help them heal."</p>
