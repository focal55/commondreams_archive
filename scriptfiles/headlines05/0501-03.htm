<p>Seven months before Sept. 11, 2001, the State Department issued a 
human rights report on Uzbekistan. It was a litany of horrors.

The police repeatedly tortured prisoners, State Department officials 
wrote, noting that the most common techniques were "beating, often with blunt 
weapons, and asphyxiation with a gas mask." Separately, international human 
rights groups had reported that torture in Uzbek jails included boiling of 
body parts, using electroshock on genitals and plucking off fingernails and 
toenails with pliers. Two prisoners were boiled to death, the groups reported. 
The February 2001 State Department report stated bluntly: "Uzbekistan is an 
authoritarian state with limited civil rights."
<P>Immediately after the Sept. 11 attacks, however, the Bush administration 
turned to Uzbekistan as a partner in the global fight against terrorism. The 
nation, a former Soviet republic in Central Asia, granted the United States 
the use of a military base for fighting the Taliban across the border in 
Afghanistan. President Bush welcomed Uzbek President Islam Karimov to the 
White House, and the United States has given Uzbekistan more than $500 million 
for border control and other security measures.
<P>Now there is increasing evidence that the United States has sent terror 
suspects to Uzbekistan for detention and interrogation, even as Uzbekistan's 
treatment of its own prisoners continues to earn it admonishments from around 
the world, including from the State Department.
<P>The so-called rendition program, under which the CIA transfers terror 
suspects to foreign countries to be held and interrogated, has linked the 
United States to other countries with poor human rights records. But the 
turnabout in relations with Uzbekistan is particularly sharp. Before the Sept. 
11 attacks,  there was little high-level contact between Washington and 
Tashkent, the Uzbek capital, beyond the United States' criticism of Uzbekistan.
<P>Uzbekistan's role as a surrogate jailer for the United States has been 
confirmed by a half-dozen current and former intelligence officials working in 
Europe, the Middle East and the United States. The CIA declined to comment on 
the prisoner transfer program, but an intelligence official estimated that the 
number of terrorism suspects sent by the United States to Tashkent is in the 
dozens.
<P>There is other evidence of the United States' reliance on Uzbekistan in 
the program. On Sept. 21, 2003, two American-registered airplanes  --  a 
Gulfstream jet and a Boeing 737  --  landed at the international airport in 
Tashkent, according to flight logs obtained by the New York Times.
<P>Although the precise purpose of those flights is not known, over a span 
of about three years, from late 2001 until early this year, the CIA used those 
two planes to ferry terror suspects in U.S. custody to countries around the 
world for questioning, according to interviews with former and current 
intelligence officials and the planes' flight logs. On the day the planes 
landed in Tashkent, the Gulfstream had taken off from Baghdad, while the 737 
had departed from the Czech Republic, according to the logs. 
<P>The logs show that at least seven flights were made to Uzbekistan by 
those planes from early 2002 to late 2003, but the records are incomplete.
<P>Details of the CIA's prisoner transfer program have emerged in recent 
months from a handful of former detainees who have been released, primarily 
from prisons in Egypt and Afghanistan. In some cases, the prisoners said they 
were beaten and tortured while being held.
<P>The rendition program was created in the mid-1980s as a way for the CIA 
to transfer criminal suspects arrested abroad to their home countries. After 
Sept. 11, the CIA used it to send prisoners suspected of being senior al Qaeda 
leaders to a half-dozen countries for detention. U.S. intelligence officials 
estimate that the United States has transferred 100 to 150 suspected 
terrorists to Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and 
Uzbekistan.
<P>A senior CIA official, speaking on condition of anonymity, would not 
discuss whether the United States has sent prisoners to Uzbekistan, or 
anywhere else. But he said: "The United States does not engage in or condone 
torture. It does not send people anywhere to be tortured. And it does not 
knowingly receive information derived from torture."
<P>Uzbek Foreign Ministry spokesman Ilkhom Zakirov also declined to comment 
on whether Uzbekistan accepted terror suspects from the United States. He 
declined to address the accusations from human rights groups. But human rights 
activists say that because Uzbekistan's record is well known, it raises 
questions about why the CIA would send suspects there.
<P>"If you talk to anyone there, Uzbeks know that torture is used  --  it's 
common even in run-of-the-mill criminal cases," said Allison Gill, a 
researcher for Human Rights Watch who is currently working inside Uzbekistan. 
"Anyone in the United States or Europe who does not know the extent of the 
torture problem in Uzbekistan is being willfully ignorant."
<P>The relationship between Washington and Tashkent was formalized at a 
March 2002 Oval Office meeting between Bush and Karimov. Muhammad Salih, the 
leader of Uzbekistan's pro-democracy Erk Democratic Party, who is living in 
exile in Germany, said the relationship had strengthened Karimov's hand.
<P>"It's been a great opportunity for Karimov," Salih said. "But President 
Bush has to also think about human rights, and democracy. If he wants to have 
a collaboration on anti-terror matters, he should not close his eyes on other 
things that Uzbekistan is doing, like torture."
<P>At a news conference last month, Bush was asked what Uzbekistan could do 
in interrogating a suspect that the United States could not.

<P>"We seek assurances that nobody will be tortured when we render a person 
back to their home country," Bush said.
<P>The State Department and human rights groups have continued to report on 
human rights abuses in Uzbek prisons.
<P>The State Department's latest human rights report on Uzbekistan, issued 
in February, said: "Torture was common in prisons, pretrial facilities, and 
local police and security service precincts." 
<P>Specific cases have been documented. In the summer of 2002, Amnesty 
International reported, Fatima Mukhadirova, a 62-year-old Tashkent shopkeeper, 
was sentenced to six years of hard labor after denouncing the Uzbekistan 
government for the death of her son, Muzafar Avozov, in a Tashkent prison. 
<P>An independent examination of photographs of the body, conducted by the 
University of Glasgow, showed that Avozov died after being immersed in boiling 
water, human rights groups reported. 
<P>Human rights activists pressed for Mukhadirova's release. She was freed 
shortly before a planned visit by Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld in 
February 2004.</p>
