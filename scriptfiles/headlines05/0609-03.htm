<p>WASHINGTON  -  In a sharp setback for the  Bush administration's Latin America policy, the Organization of American States rejected  a United States  plan on Tuesday  to create a committee to monitor the exercise of democracy in the hemisphere.</p>
<p>Instead, the organization agreed, at a meeting in Fort Lauderdale,  Fla., on a declaration that attaches equal or greater emphasis to attacking poverty because of what it calls "the interdependent relationship of democracy and social and economic development." </p>
<p>The organization, which represents 34 states of the Western Hemisphere, voted to approve the resolution at midnight on Tuesday,  but the  language was not completed until Wednesday by staff members who lingered after the formal meeting.  </p>

<p>The United States professed to be satisfied with the final resolution, even though it bears little resemblance to the proposal the State Department introduced  last week. The resolution does not include the element  that Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice insisted it must have, a committee that would  investigate troubled democracies.</p>
<p>On Sunday,  en route to the organization's  meeting of foreign ministers, Ms. Rice  responded to a reporter's question about the growing opposition to the United States plan,  by asking how the organization  could be effective without  a "mechanism that can help at times of crisis?"</p>
<p>Still, on Wednesday afternoon, Sean McCormack,   the State Department spokesman, said that  "we believe that the declaration and its contents will help" Secretary General Jos&#233; Miguel Insulza  "and the organization carry out their important work." </p>
<p>"We believe this is an excellent result," he said. </p>
<p>Several Latin American diplomats at the meeting said one reason they opposed the United States  plan was that they thought it was aimed at Venezuela. The United States  has been at odds with the populist government of President Hugo Ch&#225;vez  of Venezuela for several years, saying it is slowly eroding the  nation's democratic freedoms.</p>
<p>Last week, the Panamanian delegation to the Organization of American States  offered a resolution similar to Washington's,  but it did not  gain any support.</p>
<p> "I think people misunderstand and thought it was about Venezuela," Aristides Royo,  the Panamanian ambassador to the organization, said by way of explanation.</p>

<p>During the three-day  meeting,  Venezuelan officials lobbied heavily against the United States proposal,  to a sympathetic audience. </p>
<p>Foreign ministers and ambassadors also opposed the plan, Mr. Insulza said, because they feared it was a proposal for "some sort of democratic police force."</p>
<p>The original American proposal said governments that do not govern in a democratic way "must be held accountable" by the organization and directed the council "to develop a process, as appropriate," to "make recommendations" on "how the permanent council should address threats to democracy in a timely fashion."</p>
<p>The final declaration says the secretary general will "devise proposals for timely, effective, balanced, gradual initiatives for cooperation, as appropriate, in addressing situations that might affect the workings of the political process of democratic institutions or the legitimate exercise of power" while respecting "the principle of nonintervention and the right of self-determination."</p>
<p>Ms. Rice repeatedly called on the organization to allow citizens groups with concerns about their  country to testify. The American proposal set out a mechanism for that. But Mr. Insulza said "some governments don't want civil societies to feel they are the real representatives of their countries, when they are the ones that have been elected."</p>
<p>The final resolution says only that the organization should "consider, in cooperation with governments, in an ongoing manner," the "contributions of civil society."</p>
