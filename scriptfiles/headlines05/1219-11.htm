And reacting to a deal that came only after a European
Union promise to end agricultural export subsidies in six
years, European farmers declared it "one-sided" and skewed
against them -- and against extremely poor countries.</p>
<p>The accord, reached earlier in the day after 100 hours of
haggling and histrionics by trade ministers from the WTO's 149
member countries, "sentences small farmers, workers and
communities across the developing world to desperate poverty,"
said the British-based <a href="http://www.waronwant.org/" target="_new">War on Want</a>.</p>
<p>The agreement, said aid group <a href="http://www.oxfam.org">Oxfam International</a>, is "a
betrayal of development promises by rich countries, whose
interests have prevailed yet again."</p>
<p>It will "roll back the enjoyment of human rights around the
world" by putting stable food supplies and health services at
risk for the poor, said a coalition of 50 rights groupings.</p>
<p>In a statement issued from its Brussels headquarters, the
<a href="http://www.icftu.org/" target="_new">International Confederation of Free Trade Unions</a> (ICFTU) said
the Hong Kong outcome "is another blow to employment and
sustainable development."</p>
<p>The conference final text, effectively doing little more
than keeping open negotiations into next year for a new global
trade pact in the WTO's Doha Round, "ignores the urgent need to
improve the lives of working people," the ICFTU said.</p>
<p>SMOKE AND MIRRORS</p>
<p>The text included a deadlock-breaking pledge from the EU to
end farm export subsidies -- the top demand of developing
countries -- by 2013. But development campaigners dismissed
this as "smoke and mirrors."</p>

<p>The deal was cooked up by an "unholy alliance" of the
United States, the European Union and WTO head Pascal Lamy, a
former EU trade chief, said the Asia-based <a href="http://www.focusweb.org/" target="_new">Focus on the Global
South</a>.</p>
<p>But the grouping, head by Philippine economist Walden
Bello, also attacked India and Brazil, leaders of the G20
developing country group that emerged at a failed WTO
conference in 2003, for their role in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>"India and Brazil have led the developing countries down
the garden path in exchange for some market access in
agriculture for Brazil, and services outsourcing for India,"
said the grouping's spokesperson Aileen Kwa.</p>
<p>"This text is a recipe for disaster, and many developing
countries will not be able to convince people back home that
they have come back with a good deal," Bello said.</p>
<p>Brazil's Foreign Minister Celso Amorim and India's Trade
Minister Kamal Nath -- who represented the G20 in talks with
the EU and the United States before and during the conference
-- were swapping compliments about what they had achieved "to
cover up the fact that they have agreed to a disaster," he
said.</p>
<p>The main European farmers' grouping, Brussels-based
COPA-COGECA, whose political representatives were under heavy
pressure to end subsidies, said they would fight on for a
better deal for them and "the most needy developing countries."</p>
<p>This was another clear barb at India and Brazil, accused by
some in the EU -- and echoed by the Global South's Bello -- of
primarily pursuing their own interests as large, middle-income
trading powers at the expense of really poor nations.
