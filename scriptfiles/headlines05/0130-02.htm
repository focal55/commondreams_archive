<p>OSLO  - World temperatures could surge in just two  decades to a threshold likely to trigger dangerous disruptions  to the earth's climate, the WWF environmental group said on  Sunday.<p> 
			
			It said the Arctic region was warming fastest, threatening  the livelihoods of indigenous hunters by thawing the polar  ice-cap and driving species like polar bears toward extinction  by the end of the century.<p> 
			
			"If nothing is done, the earth will have warmed by 2.0  Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels by some  time between 2026 and 2060," the WWF said in a report.<p>

            All on the same planet. Global warming is reaching the point-of-no-return, 
            with widespread drought, crop failure and water shortages the likely 
            result, according to a new international report. (AFP/NASA/File)<br>

      <!--/endimage/-->Few scientists have estimated such an early date for a 2.0C  rise, seen by the WWF as a threshold that may spur "dangerous"  warming, raising sea levels and causing more floods, storms or  droughts and driving some species to extinction.<p> 
			
			World temperatures have already risen by about 0.7C since  1750 with most scientists blaming a build-up of heat-trapping  gases like carbon dioxide emitted by burning fossil fuels in  factories, power plants and cars.<p> 
			
			The European Union and many other environmental groups say  that governments should cap emissions of greenhouse gases to  try to prevent a 2.0C temperature rise. The United States has  rejected binding caps under the U.N.'s Kyoto protocol.<p> 
			
			At some point, some scientists fear that rising  temperatures could cause a runaway warming, for instance by  melting permafrost in Siberia that could in turn release  deposits of heat-trapping methane to the atmosphere.<p> 
			
			"Time is running out to avoid a two degree rise," said Mark  New, a climate expert at England's Oxford University who made  the 2026-60 projections in the report commissioned by the WWF.<p> 
			
			TIME BOMB?<p> 
			
			He told Reuters his study was based on a review of climate  models used by the U.N. climate panel in its latest 2001  report. Another international report last week said that rising  temperatures were a ticking time bomb for the climate.<p> 
			
			Others scientists say that such projections are  scaremongering and reckon temperatures will rise far less  sharply, if at all, because of the buildup of greenhouse gases.<p> 
			
			New's study projected that the Arctic would warm by  3.2-6.6C if the globe warmed by 2.0C overall.<p> 
			
			In the Arctic, such a warming could melt polar ice in  summer by 2100, pushing polar bears toward extinction. On land,  forests would grow further north, overrunning tundra that is a  habitat for birds including snow buntings and terns.<p> 
			
			"Global warming threatens to wreak havoc on the traditional  ways of life of Inuit, putting an end to our hunting and food  sharing culture," said Sheila Watt-Cloutier, chair of the Inuit  Circumpolar Conference.<p> 
			
			The Arctic warms faster than the global average because  dark water and land, once uncovered, soaks up more heat than  snow or ice. A report by 250 scientists last year also  projected a fast warming in the Arctic that would also open new  shipping routes and make the region accessible for oil and gas  exploration.<p> 
			
			The WWF report is to be presented at a conference in  Exeter, England, on Feb. 1-3. The talks will focus on a 1992  U.N. convention whose goal is to stabilize greenhouse gases at  levels meant to prevent "dangerous" human interference on the  climate.<p> 
			
			The convention does not define what it means by "dangerous"  climate change.<p> 
			
			The U.N.'s Kyoto protocol, seeking to rein in greenhouse  gas emissions under the convention, will enter into force on  Feb. 16. President Bush pulled out of Kyoto in 2001, saying it  would cost too much and wrongly excludes developing nations.<p>
