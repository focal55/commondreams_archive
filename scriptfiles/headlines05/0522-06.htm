<p> IMMOKALEE, Fla.  - Tejano music bounced off the one-story buildings of this farming town and the smell of tamales filled the air as scores of revelers danced into the night outside the headquarters of the <a href="http://www.ciw-online.org/" target="_new">Coalition of Immokalee Workers</a>.</p>
<p> The celebration marked a hard-fought, unlikely victory by the workers, a coalition of mostly Guatemalan and Mexican tomato pickers, over one of the nation's fast-food giants, Taco Bell.</p>

<p> They led a four-year boycott against the chain until it agreed in March to pay a penny more per pound for Florida tomatoes and to adopt a code of conduct that would allow Taco Bell to sever ties to suppliers who commit abuses against farmworkers.</p>
<p> With that triumph, the farmworkers group is turning to a larger target: the rest of the fast-food industry. The coalition has sent letters to executives at McDonald's, Subway and Burger King asking them to follow Taco Bell's lead.</p>
<p> "When we started this, it was like man going to the moon - nobody thought it was possible," said Lucas Benitez, a leader of the coalition. "With the help of people around the country, we have built a way to go to the moon. Now we must continue moving forward."</p>
<p> Taco Bell, a subsidiary of Yum Brands,  based in Louisville, Ky., estimates it will pay the Florida tomato growers an extra $100,000 a year, a cost that company officials said would not be passed on to customers.</p>
<p> The fast-food chain, which buys 10 million pounds of Florida tomatoes a year, has also agreed to help the farmworkers persuade the other fast-food chains, and eventually supermarket retailers, to increase pay and monitor suppliers to make sure farmworkers are not held against their will, beaten or forced into indentured servitude.</p>
<p> "This is an industrywide approach to get all the growers on board, and then also get all the quick-food restaurants and retail supermarkets to join with us in that effort," said a Taco Bell spokeswoman, Laurie Schalow.</p>

<p>  McDonald's says it already has a code of conduct for suppliers that prohibits forced labor and child labor, and demands that workers receive fair compensation.</p>
<p> A Burger King spokeswoman said the company's chairman had not read the coalition's letter, but she said that the chain also had a code of conduct for suppliers.</p>
<p> A spokeswoman for Subway said on Wednesday that the company could not immediately comment because it had only received the letter the previous day.</p>
<p> The Coalition of Immokalee Workers formed a dozen years ago to help increase the wages of farmworkers, who earn as little as 40 cents for every 32-pound bucket of tomatoes picked, according to the group.</p>
<p> In the late 1990's, the coalition began investigating slavery cases in which farmworkers were being beaten and held against their will by labor contractors.</p>
<p> A coalition member, Romeo Ramirez, went undercover to help the authorities build a case, taking a job with labor contractors suspected of illegally detaining workers.</p>

<p> The coalition has helped investigate five slavery cases that have gone to trial and is in the middle of investigating three new cases in central and north Florida.</p>
<p> Mr. Benitez, Mr. Ramirez and Julia Gabriel, also a coalition member, received the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Award in 2003 for  investigating farmworker slavery.</p>
