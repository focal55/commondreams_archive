   Doctors stand outside Baghdad's Yarmouk Hospital as they go on strike July 19, 2005. In the violence-plagued capital of Iraq, doctors at one of the busiest hospitals have gone on strike in protest at abuse they say was committed against them by Iraqi soldiers. Around 30 doctors walked out of their wards the morning of July 19 after claiming one of their colleagues in the abdominal disease department was verbally and physically abused by an Iraqi soldier.

Physicians said the troubles started when soldiers barged
into a woman's wing at Yarmouk hospital, opened curtains and
conducted searches as patients lay in their beds on Monday.</p><p>A 27-year-old internal medicine specialist said a soldier
began intimidating and abusing him.</p><p>"Before he left he said, 'Why are you looking in
disapproval?' Then he came and punched me lightly on my arm
before sticking his rifle into my stomach and cocking it," the
doctor, who requested anonymity for fear of reprisals, told
Reuters.</p><p>"I stayed quiet but relatives of the patients told him to
calm down before pulling him out of the room. Just then, four
more soldiers came in and pointed a rifle at my head. At that
point I became scared and begged them to leave me alone."</p><p>Ministry of Defense officials were not available for
comment on the incident despite repeated requests.</p><p>GOVERNMENT PROMISES</p><p>Iraq's mayhem has spread even to hospitals, which are
overwhelmed by victims of suicide bombings and shootings whose
blood is mopped up off the floor after every attack.</p><p>The new Shi'ite-led government has promised Iraqis that
security forces will be built up to protect them from
guerrillas, who have killed thousands of people with suicide
and car bombings.</p><p>Iraqis had hoped that January elections would deliver a new
era of democracy, free of the abuses committed by Saddam
Hussein's security forces.</p><p>But some say the country's new security forces are too
aggressive, randomly rounding up suspects and abusing them
during detentions. The government says security forces are
under strict orders to respect human rights.</p><p>About 30 doctors staged the strike, leaving around 100
bewildered patients behind, including a young boy of about 10.</p><p>Suffering from a gunshot wound to his leg, Muhammad Hashim
lay quietly in the back of an ambulance which rushed him to
Yarmouk from a town 30 kilometers southwest of Baghdad. But the
strike forced his angry father to take him to another hospital.</p><p>Yarmouk, a run-down, sparsely equipped building, has
treated many of Baghdad's worst cases. Overcrowded with
patients and staff, it's emergency room hosts a frenzy of
activity every day.</p><p>Nevertheless, doctors said they would press on with a
strike to draw attention to army and security forces, whose
wounded comrades are often treated at Yarmouk and other
hospitals.</p><p>"We know the citizens may be a little upset but we have our
rights too and we can't operate and provide a service to people
if we feel under threat," said Asaad Hindi, standing outside
the hospital with other physicians.</p><p>"One doctor was humiliated and sworn at. Other doctors who
were afraid hid in a room. The last time this happened we
complained to officials at the defense and interior
ministries."</p><p>Relatives of some patients grew frustrated.

<p>
Khalid al-Girtani said he was angry because his 57-year-old
father Mahmoud had been ignored all day.
<p>
"My father has a stroke and no doctor is here to see him,
just look at him! This is ridiculous," he said as his father
lay in bed with breathing tubes in his nostrils.
<p>
Some patients sympathized with the doctors, despite their
medical needs.
<p>
"I'm ill and I haven't seen the doctor all day. All I need
is a signature from him so I can get an X-ray that I need to
see what's wrong with my neck. I think they have every right to
strike though, our doctors shouldn't be abused," said Salman
Thahir, a frail old man sitting on his bed.</p><p align="center">&copy; 2005 Reuters Ltd.</p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable --></font></td></tr>
