Secular Iraqis said on Wednesday a
proposed new constitution left no room for doubt about the
Islamist path the country was heading down two years after a
U.S.-led invasion was supposed to produce greater freedoms.
<p>The document presented to parliament on Monday is suffused
with the language of political Islam in defining the state, and
assigns a primary role to Islam as a source for legislation.</p>
<p>"The draft aborts the democratic process Iraqis hoped for
and is a big victory for political Islam," said writer Adel
Abdel-Amir. "Islamic law, not the people, has become the source
of authority."</p>
<p>The draft says Islam is the official religion of the state
and there can be no law that contradicts the "fixed principles
of its rulings." The preamble says the constitution responds to
"the call of our religious and national leaders and the
insistence of our great religious authorities."</p>
<p>Language guaranteeing "rights and freedoms" is subordinate
to the primary position given to Islam, opponents say.</p>
<p>"Human rights should not be linked to Islamic Sharia law at
all. It should be listed separately in the constitution," said
Safia Souhail, Iraq's ambassador to Egypt.</p>
<p>The prominent women's rights campaigner denounced wording
that grants each religious sect the right to run its own family
courts -- apparently doing away with previous civil codes -- as
an open door to further Islamicise the legal system.</p>
<p>Although in practice, many Iraqis end up having recourse to
religious authorities or informal tribal law, the idea of a
united civil code is central to the modern state, Souhail said.</p>
<p>"This will lead to creating religious courts. But we should
be giving priority to the law," she said.</p>

<p>"When we came back from exile, we thought we were going to
improve rights and the position of women. But look what has
happened -- we have lost all the gains we made over the last 30
years. It's a big disappointment."</p>
<p><strong>UNEVEN CHARTER</strong></p>
<p>Despite the brutality and despotism, the decades of Baath
Party rule under Saddam Hussein left a largely secular legacy,
which included relative freedom for women.</p>
<p>"We had hoped for a secular constitution that would
separate religion from state," said Mirza Dinnayi, leader of
the Yazidi sect viewed by Islamists now running Iraq as devil
worshippers.</p>
<p>"It doesn't even mention some minorities ... A constitution
that can't ensure the rights of its citizens and equality
doesn't deserve to be called a constitution."</p>
<p>The only minorities ensured specific rights are Kurds, who
have a federal region in the north, and speakers of Syriac, who
it says are free to educate their children in the language.</p>
<p>Iraq's state media organs -- the daily paper al-Sabah and
satellite channel al-Iraqiya -- have come out full guns blazing
in favor of the draft, which the Sunni minority favored by
Saddam are mobilizing to bring down in an October referendum.</p>
<p>But the popular Azzaman daily said in a column on Wednesday
that parliament would be better off dissolved than promulgating
a document such as the draft, as expected, later this week.</p>
<p>"It gives with one hand and takes with the other. This
constitution is not close to a modern state," the paper's
managing editor Saad Abbas told Reuters.

<p>
He drew attention to a list of Baath era crimes in the
preamble that gives priority to the suffering of Shi'ites.
<p>
"It mentions some victims and doesn't mention others.
Communists, for example, also suffered. It's fair to the
Islamists but not the non-Islamists," Abbas said.
<p>
Souhail said the United States, a crucial backstage player
keen for a deal that meets U.S.-backed deadlines, had let the
Shi'ite Islamists and Kurds in government do as they wish.
<p>
"We have received news that we were not backed by our
friends including the Americans. They left the Islamists to
come to an agreement with the Kurds," she said.
