 WASHINGTON - As President Bush heads to next
week's Group of Eight summit in Scotland, one of his main tasks
will be to try to mitigate anti-U.S. sentiments in Europe --
but he may also need to look at growing anti-Europeanism in the
United States, political and foreign policy analysts say.<p> "There is a strong strain of anti-Europeanism coming from
sections of the Republican Party, related to and sometimes
encouraged by the White House," said Jan Kubik, director of the
center for comparative European studies at Rutgers University.<p> "Connected to that is the anti-Europeanism of the religious
right, where Europe is seen as a place without God that has
become too secular and lost its values," he said.<p> Many Americans were outraged at the refusal of prominent
European nations, especially France and Germany, to support the
U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003. Now, some analysts fear that
European anti-Americanism and U.S. anti-Europeanism may have
become mutually reinforcing.<p> "Negative opinions about the United States in Europe have
affected attitudes toward those countries here," said pollster
Andrew Kohut of the Pew Research Center.<p> A Pew survey last week found for instance that only 43
percent of French citizens viewed the United States favorably,
while 46 percent of Americans had a favorable view of France.<p> There is nothing new about anti-European sentiment in the
United States. But sour feelings on both sides, largely masked
during the 40 years of the Cold War, have widened into a chasm
in the past three years.<p> "As an American, the characteristic that is particularly
troubling to me is the virulent anti-Americanism I experience
every time I visit the continent," said Sen. Gordon Smith, a
Republican from Oregon who describes himself as a strong
champion of the traditional U.S.-European alliance.

<p> <b>'DEMONIZATION' OF BUSH</b><p> In a speech to the conservative Heritage Foundation on
Tuesday, Smith said he particularly objected to the "gross
anti-American reporting and demonization of President Bush," in
much of the European media.<p> He said that made it difficult for leaders like himself to
champion the continuation of the traditional Atlantic alliance.
"A lot of Americans would like to see that relationship chipped
away at," he said.<p> Among Christian conservatives, who form a powerful bloc in
the Republican Party, criticism of European secularism has
become a standard theme, said University of Akron political
scientist John Green, an expert on Christian fundamentalism.<p> "It's also a useful way for them to attack American
liberals who admire Europe, especially the relative absence of
religion in public affairs. The Christian conservative response
is to say that Europe has become a basically decadent place and
an example of what America would be if liberals had their way,"
he said.<p> Among Republicans, especially in the U.S. House of
Representatives, who travel overseas much less than U.S.
legislators did a generation ago, hostility to things European
has blossomed in recent years, Green said.<p> Republican House Majority Leader Tom DeLay began one speech
to fellow party members last year by saying, "Good afternoon,
or as John Kerry might say, bonjour" -- a contemptuous
reference to the 2004 Democratic presidential challenger's
ability to speak French.<p> Some U.S. commentators, echoing the critique of the late
Pope John Paul II, point to falling European birth rates as a
sign that European societies have given themselves completely
over to the pursuit of pleasure, to the point that they are
committing demographic suicide.<p> On the economic front, the United States has produced
consistently higher growth rates and lower unemployment than
many nations in Europe. Some U.S. commentators blame the
excessive regulations imposed by the European Community. Others
say Europeans are plain lazy.<p> "French voters are trying to preserve a 35-hour workweek in
a world where Indian engineers are ready to work a 35-hour
day," wrote New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman earlier
this month.
