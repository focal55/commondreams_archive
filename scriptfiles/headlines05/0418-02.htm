<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p>A senior Labour activist in Tony Blair's Sedgefield constituency resigned yesterday to support an anti-war candidate hoping to unseat the Prime Minister.
	
<P>Derek Cattell, who spent 10 years as a member of Sedgefield Labour Party's executive committee, said he doubted the "honesty and integrity" of the Prime Minister.

<P>He will support Reg Keys, an independent candidate whose son Tom was one of the six military police "Red Caps" killed by an Iraqi mob in June 2003.

<P>Mr Cattell, a former full-time regional official for the GMB union, said: "I have been a member of the Labour Party for 30 years and this decision has been very hard for me.

<P>"But I have become increasingly concerned by a growing number of issues associated with Tony Blair's leadership, none more so than his decision to go to war with Iraq."

<P>Mr Cattell will give further details at a news conference today alongside Mr Keys and Martin Bell, the former BBC journalist who was elected as an independent in Tatton in 1997.

<P>Mr Bell won his seat after the mainstream parties withdrew their candidates. Mr Keys will appeal to the Tories and the Liberal Democrats to help him in Sedgefield in the same way.

<P>David Shayler, the former MI5 officer who was jailed for revealing official secrets, said yesterday he would not stand against Mr Blair on an anti-war platform because he did not want to damage Mr Keys's chances. The Tories and the Lib Dems have both said they will not withdraw their candidates in Sedgefield.
