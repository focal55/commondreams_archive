      <P>Having taken a beating at the ballot box, the left is redirecting 
its post-election energy at corporate boardrooms. 
<P>Anti-corporate campaigns have been around for decades, but this fight-the-
power generation is going about it with a little more finesse. For one, 
activists shy away from the term "boycott." Too negative. 
      <P>"People are sick of that whiny sort of demeanor," said Craig Minowa, 
        an environmental scientist who helps create campaigns for the <a href="http://www.organicconsumers.org/" target="_new">Organic 
        Consumers Association</a>, a public interest advocacy group. "In the '60s 
        it was down with this, down with that. Now, people want a more positive 
        message." 
            <P>Among the new wave is North Beach resident Raven Brooks, co-founder of 
        <a href="http://www.buyblue.org/" target="_new">BuyBlue.org</a>. He tells 
        consumers which companies are "blue" (Democratic) or "red" (Republican) 
        -- depending on the contributions of its political action committees and 
        top officers -- and then redirects red shoppers to bluer competitors. 
      <P>"We're not telling people to boycott the companies  --  we're just giving 
them information on how to shift their money," Brooks said.
<P>In the coming months, everyone from environmentalists to organic food 
advocates will supplement their political lobbying with a heftier dose of 
consumer outrage funneled through "corporate responsibility campaigns."
<P>In recent history, anti-corporate activism goes back to a 1980s consumer 
boycott of Nestle Corp., which was blamed for encouraging Third World women to 
become dependent on infant formula they couldn't afford. Over the past decade, 
similar efforts bubbled across college campuses, bursting to prominence with 
the World Trade Organization protests in Seattle in 1999. 
<P>Mainstream groups, seeing how many young people took an interest in last 
year's presidential race, are trying to tap that energy.
      <P>Among them: the San Francisco-based <a href="http://www.SierraClub.org" target="_new">Sierra 
        Club</a>. In March, spokesman Brendan Bell said, the club will sic consumers 
        on a "to-be-named" energy company "that's doing bad things to the environment 
        and is being supported by the Bush administration." It is part of the 
        group's opposition to proposed oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife 
        Refuge. 
      <P>"We as progressives need to give people a way to use their power as 
consumers to make their point," said Bell, an energy policy analyst with the 
700,000-member organization. "We may not have as much political power (as 
conservatives). But what we still have are people."
<P>Some organizers say it is easier to focus their faithful on a corporate 
logo than to point them toward political lobbying.
<P>Nancy Murray spent 17 years lobbying Washington and the United Nations to 
protest Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory. In December, the 
organizer with the Boston Coalition for Palestinian Rights turned her sights 
on Peoria, Ill., and the heavy machinery and clothing company Caterpillar Inc.
      <P>She helped start <a href="http://www.bootcat.org/" target="_new">BootCat.org</a>, 
        a Boston version of a national anti-Caterpillar campaign that's been around 
        for years. Activists want Caterpillar to stop allowing one of its bulldozers 
        to be sold to Israel, which the group says is using the vehicles to level 
        Palestinians' homes and agricultural land. 
      <P>By focusing on Caterpillar  --  an iconic symbol of the American 
heartland  --  Murray hopes to bring a Middle Eastern issue home to many 
Americans who might otherwise shrug it off. 
<P>"In campaign terms, it gives us a target," Murray said. "It's not as 
diffuse as rallying people by saying, 'End the occupation.' People say, 'Ahh, 
we've already tried that (tack).' "
      <P>Perhaps no company has come under as fierce an attack as Wal-Mart, the 
        nation's largest private employer. A <a href="http://edworkforce.house.gov/democrats/releases/rel21604.html" target="_new">22-page 
        report</a> last year by Rep. George Miller, D-Martinez, echoed what many 
        critics have said for years: Because nonunionized Wal-Mart pays lower 
        salaries and health benefits, its employees must use subsidized medical 
        care, free school lunches and other taxpayer- supported welfare services. 
      <P>Wal-Mart will be the target of a fresh campaign in the next couple of 
        months, when the Organic Consumers Association will band together with 
        labor and environmental groups to promote a "buy local" crusade. The organization's 
        <a href="http://www.organicconsumers.org/" target="_new">Web site</a> 
        -- which lists several anti-corporate campaigns -- has fielded 3 to 4 
        million hits a weekend since the November election. Before then, the site 
        had that many hits in a month, Minowa said. 
      <P>"Wal-Mart has been a real catalyst for a lot of different kinds of 
progressive groups to work together," said Ryan Zinn, a San Francisco resident 
and organizer for the organics group.
<P>Recognizing this oncoming wave of animosity, Wal-Mart fought back last 
month with a national ad campaign to clear up "misinformation" spread by what 
it called special interest groups  --  which spokeswoman Cynthia Lin defined 
largely as labor unions.
<P>"People have the right to their opinions, but what we object to is when 
they spread misinformation about the salaries and benefits of our employees," 
Lin said. "And it comes as no surprise that labor unions are upset. They've 
had declining enrollment for years."
<P>At the heart of any activist's anti-corporation campaign is an appeal for 
consumers to take their dollars elsewhere  --  which BuyBlue.org makes 
explicit.
<P>With the help of 150 volunteers, the 26-year-old Brooks created his Web 
site in December to rate firms by their blue or red hues. 
      <P>For consumers who no longer want to frequent an online bookseller such 
        as Amazon.com, for example, because the majority of its political action 
        committee's contributions (59 percent) went to Republican candidates last 
        year, <a href="http://www.buyblue.org/" target="_new">BuyBlue.org</a> 
        offers links to blue competitors such as Barnes & Noble or Powell's. 
      <P>By the end of the year, Brooks, a software analyst who has consulted for 
Fortune 500 firms, expects to include information about a company's record on 
the environment, minority hiring and other social barometers in addition to 
its political contributions. 
<P>Amazon spokeswoman Patty Smith said, "I don't think it's fair to say that 
we support Republicans or Democrats. We support issues that are important to 
our customers, and give to politicians of both parties. And we look at our 
customers as customers, not as red or blue ones. If you start doing that, 
you're not going to win over any new customers."
<P>BuyBlue.org's avoidance of the b-word  --  boycott  --  is illustrative 
of how this generation is trying coax change from corporations. 
<P>Animal-rights activist Lauren Ornelas of Davis approached Whole Foods CEO 
John Mackey after a shareholders meeting in 2003, then struck up an online 
conversation with him. Their discussions, in part, not only led to Mackey's 
conversion to veganism, but to the company's promising to change its animal 
welfare standards.
<P>In January, 17 animal rights groups signed a letter applauding Whole 
Foods' "pioneering initiatives." Two weeks ago, the company donated 5 percent 
of its revenue from one day to start the Animal Compassion Foundation.
<P>"The thing to remember is that we worked on that campaign for three years 
before that," said Ornelas, a representative of Viva USA, which signed the 
letter.
<P>Activists agree the biggest challenge to corporate campaigns is keeping 
the troops fired up. Unlike a political campaign, where organizers can point 
to a finish line on election day, corporate campaigns can last for years.
<P>So every anti-corporate campaign craves a victory. No matter the size.
<P>Last month, environmental activists staged a weeklong "car sit" at a Ford 
automobile dealership in Sacramento to protest the company's repossession of 
its remaining electric pickup trucks. Ford plans to concentrate on building 
gas-electric hybrid cars and trucks to achieve state-mandated cuts in 
emissions. 

<P>After a week of watching the sitters  --  and their press coverage  --  
the company abandoned its repo plan.
<P>"To have a major American corporation change its mind  --  oh yeah, 
that's definitely a victory," said Jason Mark, an organizer with Jumpstart 
Ford at Global Exchange.
<P>"We need to have a cathedral builder's mentality when we're doing these 
campaigns," Mark said. "We may not see the building completed in our lifetime, 
but if we finish the foundation, the next generation can build on that."
