SALT LAKE CITY - An outspoken Democrat in one of the most conservative states in the nation, Mayor Ross "Rocky" Anderson rarely has dull days.
<P>
During a visit by President Bush on Monday, he made news by calling for a vigorous protest of the Iraq war, prompting boos at a convention of the Veterans of Foreign Wars. Later that day, he was cheered by about 2,000 anti-war protesters at a city park.
<P>

"There's always going to be controversy when one provides any sort of leadership," said Anderson, who objects to the polarized characterizations of Monday's events. The booing, he said, came just from a handful of conventioneers.
<P>
But the dispute is just the latest example of Anderson's brash style during his seven years at the helm of this city. He has criticized state lawmakers for stringent alcohol laws and for banning same-sex marriages. He tussled with leaders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints over the right to free speech on a church-owned plaza that was once a public street.
<P>
Anderson, 53, has poked at Bush before, too, chiding the president for opting out of the Kyoto treaty to reduce greenhouses gases.
<P>

In Utah, where some Democrats are jokingly referred to as moderate Republicans, Anderson's mere presence makes some wonder how he could even get elected.
<P>
"Anyone who asks that question doesn't understand Salt Lake City," said Democrat county council member Joe Hatch. "The city hasn't elected a conservative since the 1970s."
<P>
Anderson was elected in 2003 to a second term in office with 54 percent of the vote. About 65 percent of the city's 182,000 residents are not members of the Mormon church - predominant in the rest of Utah - and 60 percent are Democrats, according to demographic estimates.
<P>
By contrast, Bush was re-elected with a 71 percent majority in Utah.
<P>
Still, Anderson is far different from some mayors who have preceded him, Hatch said.
<P>
"That's a product of what's been happening in Salt Lake and in the state of Utah as a whole," he said. "Political lines have been sharpening along the lines of the culture wars."
<P>
A twice-divorced father of an adult son, Anderson was raised Mormon in Logan, 75 miles north of Salt City, but later abandoned the faith.
<P>
Hatch believes part of his appeal is the fearless way of saying what he thinks with a sort of "stick 'em in-the-eye" delivery that often rankles Republicans and some Mormons. He has few fans even within the Democratic Party, Hatch said.
<P>
Yet Anderson's supporters are among the "most committed and dedicated" of any in the state, said Kirk Jowers, director of the University of Utah's Hinckley Institute of Politics. Even those who don't care for Anderson's political bent still like him.

<P>
"He's quite eloquent," said Jowers. "Whether you agree with him or disagree with him, he's a very engaging, intelligent guy."
<P>
As if proving Jowers' point, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who hitched a ride to Salt Lake City on Air Force One with Bush, prefaced his criticism of Anderson's protest appearance Monday by telling reporters how much he likes the mayor personally. He then said Anderson's speech could drive away convention business from the state.
<P>
At the rally, Anderson said true patriots are those who "stand up to deceit by our government."
<P>
"The message we want to send is that we are behind our troops, we care very much about our troops. That if their lives are going to be put on the line, they are going to be put in harm's way, that we're told the truth and our nation hasn't been told the truth," Anderson said.
<P>
Longtime Republican political strategist LaVar Webb said the attention brought by the speech might actually be good for Utah because it shows there's diversity and balance to public opinion within the state.
<P>
But State Republican Party Chairman Joe Cannon said he thinks the mayor erred by putting personal politics ahead of a greater responsibility to the city.
<P>
"He is actually an elected official," said Cannon. "You never really give up your First Amendment right, but there is a duty of prudence."
<P>
Anderson seems puzzled by the furor.
<P>

As an attorney handling civil rights cases for more than 20 years, he said he has always fought for what he believed in regardless of political fallout.
<P>
"I think I learned that as a very young boy from my parents and from religious teachings," he said.
