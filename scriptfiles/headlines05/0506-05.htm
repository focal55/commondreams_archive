<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p>BATON ROUGE, LA -- US Senator John F. Kerry said yesterday that he believes it's a mistake for the Massachusetts Democratic Party to include a plank in its official platform in support of same-sex marriage, saying that such a statement does not conform with the broad views of party members.

<P>Kerry, who opposes same-sex marriage but supports civil unions, said in an interview with the Globe that he would prefer that the party not mention gay marriage in its platform, because Democrats continue to disagree on how to handle the issue.

<P>''I'm opposed to it being in a platform. I think it's a mistake," Kerry said shortly after hosting a forum on his universal children's healthcare bill in Baton Rouge. ''I think it's the wrong thing, and I'm not sure it reflects the broad view of the Democratic Party in our state."

<P>Some analysts believe that the same-sex marriage issue contributed to Kerry's loss to President Bush in last year's presidential campaign. Kerry's position puts him at odds with the state Democratic Party chairman and his fellow Bay State senator, Edward M. Kennedy, who is scheduled to address the party convention next weekend.

<P>Kerry said he does not plan to attend this year's state Democratic convention or to lobby against the same-sex marriage plank. He said he has not been closely monitoring debate over the state party platform.

<P>The state party chairman, Philip W. Johnston, said Kerry's opposition will not affect the party's decision to support of same-sex marriage. When the party meets next Saturday in Lowell, he said, the platform is on track to be approved as it stands.

<P>''I have great affection and respect for John, but I disagree on this issue," Johnston said. ''It is important that the state Democratic Party support civil rights. We need to take a stand."

<P>Kennedy said through a spokeswoman that he backs inclusion of a statement in support of same-sex marriage in the platform. Kennedy is up for reelection next year and has strongly supported same-sex marriage, which has been legal in Massachusetts since May 2004, after a Supreme Judicial Court ruling.

<P>Kerry's US Senate seat is up in 2008, and he has also left the door open to a second run for the White House. He wrestled with the same-sex marriage issue through much of his presidential campaign last year, with Republicans making much of the fact that his home state is the only one in the country where same-sex couples can wed.

<P>Kerry came out against the Bush-supported federal constitutional amendment that would ban same-sex marriage, saying that individual states should be allowed to settle the issue on their own. But Kerry has also said that he personally opposes it.

<P>''I'm opposed to gay marriage," Kerry said yesterday, reiterating past statements. ''I support [domestic] partnerships and civil unions."

<P>Party platforms do not bind any candidates to particular policy positions, but they are often cited as guideposts intended to reflect the consensus of party members. The state Democratic Party's platform tends to tilt to the left, a result of the liberal leanings of party activists and convention attendees.

<P>After holding more than two-dozen meetings across the state, the state Democratic Party's platform committee recommended having the Massachusetts party endorse same-sex marriage.

<P>''We affirm our commitment to the Massachusetts constitutional guarantee to same-sex marriage and all of its rights, privileges, and obligations and reject any attempt to weaken or revoke those rights," the plank reads.

<P>The language can be amended by a majority vote of the approximately 3,000 delegates who are slated to convene next weekend at the Paul E. Tsongas Arena in Lowell. Johnston said he does not expect an effort to strip the platform of the same-sex marriage statement.

<P>Johnston said he disagrees with Kerry's assessment of the extent of support same-sex marriage enjoys among Massachusetts Democrats. He cited a March Globe poll that found that 71 percent of Democrats believe that same-sex marriage should be allowed.

<P>The same poll found 35 percent support for same-sex marriage among Republicans, 53 percent support among independents, and a 56 percent approval rating overall. Johnston said that while he realizes the national view of same-sex marriage is substantially different, Massachusetts Democrats can do well at the polls by contrasting their support for gay marriage with Governor Mitt Romney's opposition.

<P>''Most residents of the state view this as a fundamental civil right for gay and lesbian citizens," Johnston said.

<P>Marty Rouse, campaign director for MassEquality, which supports same-sex marriage, expressed disappointment in Kerry's position and said the senator is out of step with the majority in his own state.

<P>''We wish his views better reflected the values of fairness and equality that the people of Massachusetts and the Massachusetts Democratic Party stand for," Rouse said. ''Both in our personal experience and in our recent polling, we know that Massachusetts voters are very comfortable with marriage equality."

<P>Under a deal brokered in part by Democratic leadership in the Senate, the Legislature voted last year to replace same-sex marriage with civil unions. That measure, however, must be approved again by the Legislature and then in a statewide vote next year before it can take effect.
