<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->It is perhaps only a mother, a mother who has lost a son, who could stand vigil in summer Texas heat against the war in Iraq.

<p>
In the post-Sept. 11 era, when criticism of the war often is labeled unpatriotic, observers say only someone who has made the ultimate sacrifice can speak out.</p>
<p>"Mothers seeing their sons die are not only a very powerful and emotional anti-war face but the one group in a position now to lead the opposition," says Dan Carter, history professor at the University of South Carolina, who has studied the differences among anti-war movements.
<p>The ongoing protest by Cindy Sheehan of Vacaville, Calif., at President Bush's Crawford, Texas, ranch has galvanized those on both sides and has spurred an estimated 1,500 nationwide vigils sponsored by MoveOn.org.
<p>Some moms think Sheehan is disrespecting her son and should pack up and go home.
<p>Sheehan's son, 24-year-old Army Spc. Casey Sheehan, was killed in Baghdad last year.
<p>Afterward, Sheehan met with the president but said that was before information came out on faulty intelligence reports about weapons of mass destruction.
<p>She said she was so upset, she didn't get to ask the question she now wants answered: "Why did he kill my son?"
<p>Two Arizona women with children in the military, Sherry Bohlen and Rebecca Bahr, drove to Texas to join Sheehan at the protest that has grown to about 200 people.
<p>Bohlen, an anti-war activist during Vietnam, adopted her son Thor, a war orphan from Vietnam. Now, Thor is an Army mechanic who has been in Iraq for the past two months.
<p>She says that, when she got to Texas, she felt a "hopeful anticipation" that the anti-war movement would take off.
<p>By the time she left, she had done 48 media interviews and is certain her voice was heard.
<p>"Cindy Sheehan is not speaking at a political level," Bohlen says. "She's speaking at a human level, and people are responding. In return, the media is responding."
<p>Sheehan's stand against the war is far from universal among military mothers, however.
<p>"I'm sorry for her loss," says Sandy Watson, whose son, Lance Cpl. Mike Williams, was killed in Iraq in 2003. "If I were to meet her today, I would give her a hug."
<p>But Watson says Sheehan should go home, work with family groups, write her congressman or maybe run for office herself.
<p>"The president said he wouldn't meet with her, so she should leave," Watson says. "It's to the point of being bullying, saying, 'I'll stay here until you talk to me.'
<p>"I don't think her son would approve of it; I know my son wouldn't."
<p>Caryn Gardner, 40, is an Arizona coordinator of Code Pink (codepink4peace.org), a women's peace organization. She attended a Phoenix vigil and says Sheehan brought a face to the suffering and that activists felt the impact.
<p>"Having done this for a while, I am so hopeful that we're actually going to come to peace," she says. "People are really coming out to protest, people who have never come before."
<p>Historically, mothers did not protest, Carter says.
<p>"You didn't have anything like this with Gold Star mothers in World War I or World War II," he says. "Even in Korea, there were no organized resistance mothers.
<p>"We all know where it starts: with Vietnam. Vietnam drew the first substantial opposition to the war. It's significant that it emerged when the women's movement emerged."
<p>In April 1971, a group of mothers whose sons had died in Vietnam lead about 1,100 veterans across Washington, D.C.'s Lincoln Memorial Bridge to Arlington National Cemetery, but during Vietnam, Carter says, most of the protesters were young men who were spurred to action because of opposition to the draft.
<p>Today, with an all-volunteer military, those voices are not there, and so it is a mother who is speaking out.
<p>Political observers disagree on the import of Sheehan's protest but agree Bush should speak to her.
<p>"The best way to handle it would be to walk out there and talk to the woman," says political analyst and pollster Bob Grossfeld. "He's insulting her and the mothers and fathers and husbands and wives and family members of thousands of people who lost their lives, all because he can't give her a simple answer.
<p>"This is how presidencies fall. Either by virtue of them not being electable or, in this case, not being credible."
<p>Carter says presidents have varied in their ability to deal with protests.
<p>"Initially, President Johnson did try to meet with people, but then he became so scared, so torn and conflicted, that he made it a point of very seldom meeting with critics of the war."
<p>Talking about Sheehan's protest stirs the feelings of loss for Watson, who meets regularly with a few Gold Star mothers (www.gold starmoms.com).
<p>"We have one thing in common," she said. "We lost our sons. It's a very strong bond."
<p>They share stories they heard from their sons' buddies, donate to groups sending care packages to those still serving and make squares for quilts sent to families who have lost someone.
<p>Watson says she supports Sheehan's right to protest but disagrees and says she will remember her son her own way.
<p>"I hate like heck that he died. But to my death I will defend what he went over there to do," Watson says.
