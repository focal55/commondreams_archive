<P>Boys and girls not much younger than American soldiers serving in Iraq sat in class and considered the Latin words "Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori," which mean, "It is sweet and right to die for your country."

<P>The subject was the politics of war and when it would be right to die for their country.

<P>The discussion took place last week in a 10th-grade classroom in San Bruno and was prompted by the study of a World War I poem. Talk ranged from Woodrow Wilson to President Bush, from the role of Germany to the Taliban, from the Lusitania to the World Trade Center.

<P>The war in Iraq is being studied in classrooms across the Bay Area, challenging students to research the past to understand the present. Teachers have responded in dramatically different ways, from accompanying students on war protests to carefully presenting opinions from both sides.

<P>And across the country, universities and nonprofit organizations such as Rethinking Schools and the Mercy Corps have responded by creating lesson plans on Iraq for teachers of all grade levels.

<P>"One of the hardest things in teaching is remaining unbiased," said Patty Mears, a social science teacher at Capuchino High School in San Bruno. "When we're talking about this war, I tell my students that every person is entitled to an opinion. I present the facts."

<P>Teachers are left on their own to find academic information on Iraq. Most of the information culled comes from the Internet, newspapers, television and film.

<P>The California Department of Education encourages educators to tie contemporary events to lessons and expects a teacher not to "impose his or her judgments on a class," said John Burns, director of the department's social science programs.

<P>Mears has strong opinions about the war and has participated in war protests. But she keeps her personal views separate from her teaching plans.

<P>Mears' 10th-graders study how the U.S. government has used propaganda to generate support for war. Mears began by asking students the difference between propaganda and advertising.

<P>Jenna Johnson raised her hand and said, "Propaganda is about getting someone to buy an idea rather than a product."

<P>Mears agreed and added, "Propaganda shares much with advertising." She displayed an "I Want You!" poster featuring Uncle Sam. Then she held up a contemporary image showing three young men and the words, "Army of One."

<P>"It makes you want to be a part of that group," said student Kelvin Asaeli.

<P>When student Timmy Green interjected with, "Not that many people support this war," Mears smiled. In 1917, she told her class, President Woodrow Wilson "felt an absence of unity" in terms of support for the war.

<P>"Do you all think there's an absence of unity now?" she asked. Most of the students said they feel there is not strong support for the war. Several said they weren't clear why the United States had gone to war.

<P>The World War I poem, written by Wilfred Owen, left students asking whether it would ever be "sweet and right" to die for your country.

<P>"When a group attacks us, like the attack of Pearl Harbor in World War II, that would be a good reason," said Lute Lautaimi.

<P>Other students said they would die to protect their families and promote democracy. With a number of hands still raised, the bell rang. In a high school classroom in San Mateo, teacher Mike Clardy showed students a documentary called "The Control Room," about the Arab news station Al-Jazeera. Clardy said the video presented American and Arab perspectives. He had rented the movie online.

<P>"I know teachers who say you have to be totally objective," said Clardy, who teaches at San Mateo Middle College High School. "I find that notion ludicrous because everything is informed by experiences and ideas. As a teacher, you're in a constant state of tension. Pushing people to challenge the way they look at the world and also challenge what you may perceive to be some lies out there."

<P>Jose Campos, a senior in Clardy's class, said he found himself discussing and debating the war more at school than at home.

<P>"A lot of us have strong opinions about the war," said Campos. "I've been influenced by the books I've read. My favorite book is 'All Quiet on the Western Front.' It shows how war changes people."

<P>Students at a parochial school in Castro Valley recently finished reading "Soldier's Heart," a novella about how a young soldier survives the Civil War but suffers from its memories.

<P>Barbara Lacy, an eighth-grade teacher at Our Lady of Grace, used the book to show the psychological toll of war. She taught students the names ascribed to mental afflictions, including "soldier's heart," used during the Civil War, and "battle fatigue," used during World War II. Students learned that the term post-traumatic stress disorder came about after the Vietnam War.

<P>"One of the things I'm working on teaching is empathy," Lacy said. "I want my students to realize there are people in this world who are suffering. In the case of war, they may have suffered for you."

<P>Molly Agraviador says she has sympathy for soldiers who were not able to get psychological counseling.

<P>"I think soldiers today have a lot more chances to get help," said Agraviador. Her studies have led her to conclude, "War should be the last resort."

<P>At a charter school in Alameda, students and teachers participated together in antiwar marches.

<P>"Social advocacy is a major focus of our curriculum," said Page Tompkins, principal of the Bay Area School of Enterprise. "In the buildup to the war, about three-quarters of our teachers and students marched in protest. For those who didn't want to march, we expected them to take action as well."

<P>Tompkins, who teaches leadership class, says he tries to pose one news- related question a day. He recently asked, "Was the turnout in the Iraq election higher than you expected, and was the violence lower? And does that affect your opinion of the war?"

<P>Tompkins acknowledged the challenge for teachers. "There's a lot of emotion involved in this," he said. "People shouldn't feel like this is just some academic debate. This is something real that people have strong feelings about." <p align="center">&copy; 2005 San Francisco Chronicle</p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable --></font></td></tr>
