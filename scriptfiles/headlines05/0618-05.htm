<p>Anti-whaling nations were one vote short of blocking Japan's efforts to overturn a 20-year moratorium on commercial whaling, Environment Minister Ian Campbell said yesterday.

Australia stepped up diplomatic efforts to stop Japan from increasing its whale hunt on May 20, 2005, saying up to 35 countries were opposed to the plan. Australian Environment Minister Ian Campbell said he would seek a permanent ban on commercial whaling and an end to Japan's whaling for scientific purposes at a meeting of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) in South Korea in June.

Before flying out to the International Whaling Commission's meeting in South Korea, Senator Campbell told The Sun-Herald that Japan had been engaging in "disturbing" and "alarming" tactics to strong-arm smaller nations into backing its plans.

<p>Senator Campbell refused to reveal his "intelligence" on the Japanese tactics before Wednesday's vote, saying: "They will be revealed in due course, but what we are hearing is very, very disturbing.

<p>"They don't care if they win by one vote. This is their big chance. The intelligence we've got would scare you to bits. It's alarming."

<p>The complicated process that would allow Japan to overturn the moratorium would begin if it won the go-ahead from delegates to introduce a Revised Management Scheme.

<p>Either 62, 63 or 64 countries will vote. Anti-whaling nations such as Australia don't want a revised scheme on the table, fearing that pro-whaling nations would push to reword the scheme to allow the resumption of commercial whaling.
<p>Senator Campbell said that even anti-whaling nations might cave in on a revised scheme - in the mistaken belief that commercial whaling would remain banned or that only limited whaling be allowed.

<p>In the tactical game that has been played since last year's vote was won narrowly by anti-whaling forces, Japan and other pro-whalers argue that a majority vote to revise the management scheme would be a de facto agreement to reintroduce commercial whaling.

<p>Senator Campbell said he was fearful that countries that had declared themselves as anti-whaling could buckle under Japanese pressure.

<p>Senator Campbell would argue against Japan's push for secret ballots at the meeting. Japan said secret ballots were necessary to allow smaller countries to avoid being "bullied".
