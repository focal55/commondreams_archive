<p>NEW ORLEANS -- Heavily armed paramilitary mercenaries from the Blackwater private security firm, infamous for their work in Iraq, are
openly patrolling the streets of New Orleans. Some of the mercenaries say they have been "deputized" by the Louisiana governor;
indeed some are wearing gold Louisiana state law enforcement badges on their chests and Blackwater photo identification cards on
their arms. They say they are on contract with the Department of Homeland Security and have been given the authority to use lethal
force. Several mercenaries we spoke with said they had served in Iraq on the personal security details of the former head of the US
occupation, L. Paul Bremer and the former US ambassador to Iraq, John Negroponte.

"This is a totally new thing to have guys like us working CONUS (Continental United States)," a heavily armed Blackwater mercenary
told us as we stood on Bourbon Street in the French Quarter. "We're much better equipped to deal with the situation in Iraq."

<p>Blackwater mercenaries are some of the most feared professional killers in the world and they are accustomed to operating without
worry of legal consequences. Their presence on the streets of New Orleans should be a cause for serious concern for the remaining
residents of the city and raises alarming questions about why the government would allow men trained to kill with impunity in places
like Iraq and Afghanistan to operate here. Some of the men now patrolling the streets of New Orleans returned from Iraq as recently
as 2 weeks ago.

<p>What is most disturbing is the claim of several Blackwater mercenaries we spoke with that they are here under contract from the
federal and Louisiana state governments.

<p>Blackwater is one of the leading private "security" firms servicing the occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan. It has several US
government contracts and has provided security for many senior US diplomats, foreign dignitaries and corporations. The company rose
to international prominence after 4 of its men were killed in Fallujah and two of their charred bodies were hung from a bridge in
March 2004. Those killings sparked the massive US retaliation against the civilian population of Fallujah that resulted in scores of
deaths and tens of thousands of refugees.

<p>As the threat of forced evictions now looms in New Orleans and the city confiscates even legally registered weapons from civilians,
the private mercenaries of Blackwater patrol the streets openly wielding M-16s and other assault weapons. This despite Police
Commissioner Eddie Compass' claim that "Only law enforcement are allowed to have weapons."

<p>Officially, Blackwater says it forces are in New Orleans to "join the Hurricane Relief Effort." A statement on <a href="http://www.blackwaterusa.com/" target="_new">the company's
website</a>, dated September 1, advertises airlift services, security services and crowd control. The company, according to news
reports, has since begun taking private contracts to guard hotels, businesses and other properties. But what has not been publicly
acknowledged is the claim, made to us by 2 Blackwater mercenaries, that they are actually engaged in general law enforcement
activities including "securing neighborhoods" and "confronting criminals."

<p>That raises a key question: under what authority are Blackwater's men operating? A spokesperson for the Homeland Security
Department, Russ Knocke, told the Washington Post he knows of no federal plans to hire Blackwater or other private security. "We
believe we've got the right mix of personnel in law enforcement for the federal government to meet the demands of public safety." he
said.

<p>But in an hour-long conversation with several Blackwater mercenaries, we heard a different story. The men we spoke with said they
are indeed on contract with the Department of Homeland Security and the Louisiana governor's office and that some of them are
sleeping in camps organized by Homeland Security in New Orleans and Baton Rouge. One of them wore a gold Louisiana state law
enforcement badge and said he had been "deputized" by the governor. They told us they not only had authority to make arrests but
also to use lethal force. We encountered the Blackwater forces as we walked through the streets of the largely deserted French
Quarter. We were talking with 2 New York Police officers when an unmarked car without license plates sped up next to us and stopped.
Inside were 3 men, dressed in khaki uniforms, flak jackets and wielding automatic weapons. "Y'all know where the Blackwater guys
are?" they asked. One of the police officers responded, "There are a bunch of them around here," and pointed down the road.

<p>"Blackwater?" we asked. "The guys who are in Iraq?"

<p>"Yeah," said the officer. "They're all over the place."

<p>A short while later, as we continued down Bourbon Street, we ran into the men from the car. They wore Blackwater ID badges on their
arms.

<p>"When they told me New Orleans, I said, 'What country is that in?,'" said one of the Blackwater men. He was wearing his company ID
around his neck in a carrying case with the phrase "Operation Iraqi Freedom" printed on it. After bragging about how he drives
around Iraq in a "State Department issued level 5, explosion proof BMW," he said he was "just trying to get back to Kirkuk (in the
north of Iraq) where the real action is." Later we overheard him on his cell phone complaining that Blackwater was only paying $350
a day plus per diem. That is much less than the men make serving in more dangerous conditions in Iraq. Two men we spoke with said
they plan on returning to Iraq in October. But, as one mercenary said, they've been told they could be in New Orleans for up to 6
months. "This is a trend," he told us. "You're going to see a lot more guys like us in these situations."

<p>If Blackwater's reputation and record in Iraq are any indication of the kind of "services" the company offers, the people of New
Orleans have much to fear.
