<P>They had come to the first of four congressional town meetings organized by the Independent lawmaker to talk about poverty.

And they came in droves. There were easily 250 people in the room.

<P>"We didn't expect half as many people," a stunned Sanders said.

<P>"This is an incredible turnout. This shows you poverty is a real issue that doesn't get the discussion people want," he said.

<P>But this meeting also had the feeling of both a political rally and a strategy session.

<P>Sanders laid out what could form the first few planks of a political platform aimed at a seat in the U.S. Senate.

<P>Two elderly women sat up front watching the congressman.

<P>"How am I going to get by on my Social Security?" asked one of the women, who asked not to be named.

<P>Her friend provided personal care for a 91-year-old woman as part of one Windsor County health agency.

<P>"The Medicaid was cut off so — sorry — no more job," said the friend, who also wanted to remain anonymous.

<P>Across the table from them, Bob Williamson of South Woodstock looked over the crowded room.

<P>"I'm thinking he's spot on," Williamson said. "There is not a lot of talk about poverty. It's a beautiful Monday evening outside and this place is packed."

<P>Poverty is notably missing from the news, he said.

<P>"I'm not seeing it in the newspapers, and I'm not seeing it on TV. The ladies behind me aren't getting a tax cut. They're not being heard by this administration, that guy (President Bush) is in a bubble. The message doesn't get through to him."

<P>"Where are we headed?" Williamson asked rhetorically, "it feels like over a cliff."

<P>Charlea Baker of Chester said the meeting was an important example of democracy in action.

<P>"Nobody was screened, there is no agenda, no tickets, no loyalty oath to get in," Baker said. "This is democracy. People are here because they know he's (Sanders) going to listen."

<P>And the Congressman had a lot to say.

<P>"Poverty is a major crisis in the nation and in Vermont, but when you go to Washington, D.C., this is an issue that is ignored. What we're going to do tonight is bring it out in the open," he said to applause.

<P>Sanders cited the statistics that support his claim, including that the number of children living below the poverty line in America has reached more than 20 percent.

<P>Sanders called that a disgrace.

<P>"When people are paying 50 percent of their income for housing, how much is left over for health care, food and transportation?" Sanders asked. "Billionaires have seen a 15 percent increase in their wealth in the last year.

<P>"Our goal must be to create an economy with wages that allow people to live with dignity."

<P>"A vast majority of working people are struggling, and I don't want anybody to think they have failed," Sanders said. "The system has failed."

<P>The crowd roared with applause.

<P>Sanders listed his solutions: protect Social Security, create a trade policy that works for working people in the United States, raising the minimum wage to a living wage and rescind tax breaks given to the wealthiest 2 percent of the population.

<P>"We should give that money back to the working people of this country."

<P>Social service professionals backed up the congressman's perspective with insight of their own.

<P>The minimum wage would need to be more than $8.50 an hour if it kept pace with the cost-of-living increase, Steve Geller, executive director of Southeastern Vermont Community Action.

<P>"Instead of spending money on a war based on lies, we should be demanding that we win the war on poverty," Geller said.

<P>"I see a segment of society that's living on the edge," said Earle Niles of Westminster, who has worked with SEVCA's weatherization program for 17 years. "It appears to be getting worse."
