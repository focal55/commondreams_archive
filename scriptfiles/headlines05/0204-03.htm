<p>FARGO, N.D. -- City Commissioner Linda Coates says she was shocked to learn she and her husband were among more than 40 area residents on a list of people barred from attending President Bush's speech here Thursday.</p>
    <p>The list was supplied to workers at the two Fargo distribution sites, along with tickets and other forms citizens were asked to fill out, The Forum reported.</p>
    <p>The list includes critics of Bush or the war in Iraq. It includes two high school students, a librarian, a deputy Democratic campaign manager and a number of university professors.</p>
    <p>Coates said she originally was not planning to attend the president's speech, but got a last-minute ticket Wednesday night from Fargo Mayor Bruce Furness, who offered tickets to all city commissioners.</p>

    <p>White House spokesman Jim Morrell and Don Larson, a spokesman for Gov. John Hoeven's office, said they knew nothing about a list of people barred from the speech.</p>
    <p>&quot;This is the first I'm hearing of it,&quot; Morrell said Wednesday.</p>
    <p>Coates said she had no idea why she would be on a list, other than the fact that she has been outspoken in her political beliefs.</p>
    <p>&quot;I thought that was democracy,&quot; she said.</p>
    <p>&quot;To me, this is very revealing as to what this administration is all about - someone who doesn't want disagreement,&quot; said Coates, whose husband, Mike, is also on the list. &quot;That's not healthy.&quot;</p>

    <p>Also on the list was James Holm, the producer of &quot;The Ed Schultz Show,&quot; and Berrett Gall, the former deputy campaign manager for Democratic gubernatorial candidate Joe Satrom. Holm, a staunch Democrat, said he felt honored.</p>
    <p>The Forum said many on the list are current or former members of the Fargo-Moorhead Democracy for America Meetup Group, a local group working for &quot;socially progressive&quot; candidates.</p>
    <p>Morrell said the White House is not directly involved in the ticket distribution but works with state and local officials to coordinate the process.</p>
    <p>&quot;I'm not aware of any list or of anyone being denied,&quot; he said.</p>

    <p>Larson, Hoeven's spokesman, echoed that statement.</p>
    <p>&quot;I don't know anything about the list,&quot; he said. &quot;No one was denied tickets.&quot;</p><p align="center">###</p>
