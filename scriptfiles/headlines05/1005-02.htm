Four decades after a U.S. president
declared war on poverty, more than 37 million people in the
world's richest country are officially classified as poor and
their number has been on the rise for years.
<p>Last year, according to government statistics, 1.1 million
Americans fell below the poverty line. That equals the entire
population of a major city like Dallas or Prague.</p>
<p>Since 2000, the ranks of the poor have increased year by
year by almost 5.5 million in total. Even optimists see little
prospect that the number will shrink soon despite a renewed
debate on poverty prompted by searing television images which
laid bare a fact of American life rarely exposed to global
view.</p>
<p>The president who made the war declaration was Lyndon
Johnson. "Unfortunately, many Americans live on the outskirts
of hope, some because of their poverty, and some because of
their color, and all too many because of both. This
administration declares unconditional war on poverty in
America."</p>
<p>That was in 1964. Then 19 percent of the U.S. population
lived below the official poverty line. That rate declined over
the next four years and in 1968, it stood at 12.8 percent.</p>
<p>Since then, it has fluctuated little. Last year, it was at
12.7 percent, proof that poverty is a chronic problem.</p>
<p>The state of poverty in the United States is measured once
a year by the Census Bureau, whose statistics-packed 70-plus
page report usually provides fodder for academic studies but
rarely sparks wide public debate, touches emotional buttons, or
features on television. Not so in 2005.</p>
<p>The report coincided with Katrina, a devastating hurricane
which killed more than 1,100 in Louisiana and Mississippi. Live
television coverage with shocking images of the desperate and
the dead in New Orleans showed in brutal close-up what the
spreadsheets of the census bureau cannot convey.</p>
<p>SCENES SHOCKED WORLD, SHAMED AMERICANS</p>

<p>The images shocked the world, shamed many Americans and
prompted comparisons with conditions in developing countries
from Somalia and Angola to Bangladesh. The pictures from New
Orleans showed poor black people begging for help. Most of the
rescuers, when they finally arrived, were white.</p>
<p>The percentage of black Americans living in poverty is
24.7, almost twice as high as the overall rate for all races.</p>
<p>In predominantly black New Orleans, that disparity
translated into those with cars and money, almost all white,
fleeing the flood while more than 100,000 car-less blacks were
trapped in the flooded city.</p>
<p>Some commentators wondered whether the crisis showed that
political segregation, America's version of apartheid which
formally ended with the 1964 Civil Rights Act, had merely been
replaced by economic segregation. Poor black Americans in one
part of a city, affluent whites in the other.</p>
<p>A host of other American cities have such divides,
including Newark, Philadelphia, Detroit, Atlanta, Baltimore,
St. Louis, Oakland, Miami and the U.S. capital itself. It is a
10-minute drive from the White House to the heart of Anacostia,
the city's poorest neighborhood, but they could be in different
worlds.</p>
<p>But the black-equals-poor scenes from New Orleans do not
portray the full picture. There are three times as many poor
whites as blacks in the United States and the poverty rate for
whites has risen faster than that for blacks and Hispanics.</p>
<p>Academic experts also say the government's figures minimize
the true scale of poverty because they are outdated. The
formula for the poverty level was set in 1963 on the assumption
that one third of the average family's budget was spent on
food.</p>
<p>This is no longer true. Housing has become the largest
single expense and tens of thousands of the "working poor," the
label for those who work at or near the minimum wage, are
forced to sleep in cars, trailers, long-term motels or
shelters.</p>
<p>U.S. POVERTY WORST IN INDUSTRIALISED WORLD

<p>
"Every August, we Americans tell ourselves a lie," said
David Brady, a Duke University professor who studies poverty.
<p>
"The poverty rate was designed to undercount because the
government wanted to show progress in the war on poverty.
<p>
"Taking everything into account, the real rate is around 18
percent, or 48 million people. Poverty in the United States is
more widespread, by far, than in any other industrialized
country."
<p>
Poverty is a universal problem, as is inequality. The
world's 500 richest people, according to U.N. statistics, have
as much income as the world's poorest 416 million.
<p>
The post-hurricane poverty scenes were so remarkable for
most of the world because of the perception of the United
States as the rich land of unlimited opportunity.
<p>
No other country spends so much money -- billions of
dollars -- to keep job-hungry foreigners out; no other country
has an annual lottery in which millions of people play for
50,000 permanent resident "green cards," no other country has
as many legal and illegal immigrants, all drawn by dreams of
prosperity.
<p>
For many Americans they remain just that: dreams. While
there are arguments over how poverty is measured --
conservatives say the census overstates it because it does not
take into account food stamps and other subsidies -- there is
consensus on one thing.
<p>
The minimum wage, which rose by 15 cents to &#36;6.35 an hour
on October 1, is not enough to keep you above the poverty line.
Yet minimum wage jobs, without health insurance or vacations,
are the only jobs available to millions of people with only
basic education.

<p>
The well-paid unskilled jobs in heavy industry which once
lifted working-class Americans into the middle class are
largely gone and the decline continues. Since 2001, the United
States has lost more than 2.7 million manufacturing jobs.
Low-paid clerical work is being outsourced to developing
countries.
<p>
Another U.S. president, the late Ronald Reagan, had it
right when he said, in 1988: "The federal government declared
war on poverty, and poverty won."
