<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p>WASHINGTON -- With rank-and-file Republicans showing increasing unease about an impasse paralyzing the House Ethics Committee, the panel's chairman pledged on Wednesday to begin an immediate investigation into the conduct of Rep. Tom DeLay if Democrats dropped their opposition to new ethics rules.

<P>"We are all prepared to vote at the earliest opportunity to impanel an investigation subcommittee to review various allegations concerning travel and other actions by Mr. DeLay," said Rep. Doc Hastings, R-Wash., who was accompanied by three of the four other Republicans on the panel.

<P>Democrats quickly rejected the overture, saying Hastings' personal guarantee of the inquiry and other adjustments to the disputed rules were insufficient. Democratic leaders said the proposed compromise would still leave in place new rules that they say undermine ethics enforcement and allow party-line dismissal of complaints.

<P>"It is a calculated attempt to divert attention from the fact that the Republican majority has neutered the ethics committee in the House by imposing partisan rules that hamstring any meaningful inquiry," said Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland, the No. 2 Democrat in the House.

<P>The exchange illustrated the rising tension in the House over the ethics panel at a time when DeLay, the majority leader, is under scrutiny for overseas travel and other conduct that could fall under the purview of the committee, which admonished him three times last year. But after Republicans replaced some panel members this year and forced through a set of rules changes, Democrats have blocked the committee from organizing itself, effectively suspending any work.

<P>Rep. Alan Mollohan of West Virginia, the senior Democrat on the panel, is pushing a proposal to reverse the rules and said on Wednesday that a third Republican, Walter Jones of North Carolina, had joined Reps. Christopher Shays of Connecticut and Joel Hefley of Colorado in agreeing to back him and all the House Democrats. Other Republicans privately express reservations about the way the rules were enacted and say their leadership is going to have to find a way to break the impasse.

<P>"It is indefensible," one senior Republican, who did not want to be identified for fear of antagonizing the leadership, said about the rules changes.

<P>DeLay has said he would like to appear before the ethics panel to clear up questions about his travel, and he urged a compromise.

<P>"For more than a month I've said I hope for a fair process that will afford me the opportunity to get the facts out and set the record straight," the Texas lawmaker said Wednesday in a statement. "I welcome the opportunity to address this with the committee."

<P>News reports and watchdog groups have raised questions about foreign trips taken by DeLay, asserting that they may have been paid for by a lobbyist, which would be a violation of House rules.

<P>For a second consecutive week, the House leadership sought to hold members behind the ethics changes during a private session of the Republican membership on Wednesday, distributing a memorandum on the rationale for the rules revisions with the title, "The Issue Is Fairness." Rep. Dennis Hastert, the House speaker, whose office drafted the changes at the center of the fight, has said the revisions were devised to protect lawmakers' rights better.

<P>After Hastings made his offer, Hastert accused Democrats of using the ethics dispute as a political weapon. "As long as the Democrats won't let the ethics committee form, they have it both ways," Hastert said during an interview on the radio show of the commentator Sean Hannity. "Tom can't go before them and can't clear himself, and none of their members go before the ethics committee, either." He said there were four or five potential ethics cases involving top-level Democrats.

<P>Under the new rules, ethics complaints could be automatically dismissed if the evenly divided committee did not agree on how to proceed after 45 days. In response to Democratic concerns of potential stonewalling of complaints, Hastings offered on Wednesday to guarantee that any investigation extend at least three months and that no complaint would be dismissed without a vote.

<P>"This should remove any doubt about the true intent of these rules changes," said Hastings, who said he hoped the committee could move forward at a meeting scheduled for today. "They were designed to treat all members more fairly, not to protect any individual member from any action by the committee."

<P>But Mollohan, who is calling for a bipartisan task force to agree on rules changes, said guaranteeing a vote would still create the possibility of a 5-5 deadlock in the 10-member committee. Even with Hastings' commitments, Mollohan said, the new rules "would undermine seriously the ability of the ethics committee to do their job."
