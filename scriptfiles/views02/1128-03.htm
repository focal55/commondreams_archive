<p>Washington is in the midst of its biennial guessing game about what 

legislation will get the green light when the 108th Congress convenes 

next month. Many Committee chairpersons, of course, are just waiting to 

get their marching orders from the White House and their friends among 

the army of lobbyists (aka campaign contributors).



      <p>But at least one new Committee Chairman -- Senator Richard Shelby of 

        Alabama -- is making it very clear that he isn't waiting on instructions 

        from anyone. The votes had hardly been counted from the November 5 election 

        when Senator Shelby announced an agenda for his Banking Committee that 

        sent an early wintry chill through the ranks of big lobbying firms on 

        K Street in Washington. 

      <p>Shelby is talking about "safety and soundness" of financial 

institutions, a phrase that had been all but dropped from the vocabulary 

of most of the members of the House and Senate Banking Committees in the 

rush to meet the demands of the financial industry for more power and 

less regulation. And he is making it clear that federal regulators 

charged with safety and soundness responsibilities meet those 

responsibilities. It sounds like the regulators better be prepared to 

make lots of trips to the Senate next year.



<p>In interviews, the new Chairman has announced plans for hearings on 

whether Congress went too far in the passage of the financial 

modernization legislation (Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act) in 1999 and, in the 

process, jeopardized the safety and soundness of the banking system and 

the taxpayer-backed deposit insurance funds. The key component of the 

legislation was authority for banks, securities firms and insurance 

companies to merge and form giant financial conglomerates.



<p>Now the corporate scandals involved in the collapse of corporations like 

Enron and World Com are raising new questions about the conflicts of 

interest created by the legislation. Are banks making risky loans to 

corporations to assure that their securities affiliates can peddle 

lucrative investment banking services to the same corporation? Are there 

other tying arrangements involving loan and investment products that 

could jeopardize safety and soundness of insured banks? Shelby is giving 

every indication that he intends to explore these questions fully.



<p>His inquiry will add new heat to various investigations of lending and 

securities underwriting relationships already underway involving banks 

such as Citigroup, Suisse First Boston, and J. P. Morgan Chase.



<p>Senator Shelby was assigned to the Senate Banking Committee in the late 

1980s just as the savings and loan industry was collapsing, something 

that undoubtedly influences his concern over the safety and soundness of 

banks and the health of deposit insurance.



<p>"It all goes right back to the insurance funds," he said in an interview 

with the American Banker. "I believe that we have to look at setting 

banking policy from the context of making sure the funds are sound, so 

we will not visit the taxpayers again, like we did in the thrift debacle."



<p>Shelby opposes increasing the current $100,000 insurance limit on 

individual accounts and questions the "free ride" that banks are 

receiving through the 1995 suspension of premiums for deposit insurance 

for all but the most risk-prone banks.



<p>"I never have insurance on any building I have unless I pay the 

premium...I don't know what the premiums should be, but to just let a 

few people pay the bank insurance premium and give everybody 

insurance...that ought to be looked at," Shelby said when asked about 

deposit insurance by a reporter.



<p>Shelby is right. There is no legitimate rationale for the banks to 

escape paying for their own insurance when the taxpayers are on the hook 

for hundreds of billions of dollars for a bailout when the fund is 

depleted. As the Senator points out that is exactly what happened in 

1989 to the savings and loan insurance fund. Although largely overlooked 

at the time and seldom mentioned, the bank insurance fund also fell into 

the red in 1991, forcing Congress to adopt provisions for a $30 billion 

contingency fund for commercial banks which is still on the books.



      <p>But, for all of his concern about safety and soundness and the viability 

        of deposit insurance funds, very high on his agenda is privacy -- the 

        safeguarding of financial, medical and other personal data of individuals. 

      <p>During the consideration of the financial services legislation in 1999, 

he and Representative Ed Markey, Democrat from Massachusetts, fought 

hard to include a strong privacy provision that would have required 

consumers to have agreed in writing before any personal data could be 

released by a bank, credit card company or other financial institution. 

The consumer would have to "opt in" specifically to any data being sold 

or otherwise distributed to any third party under the Shelby-Markey 

provisions.



<p>After strong privacy language failed on the floor of the Senate, Shelby 

renewed the battle

when the House and Senate versions of the bill were being reconciled in 

a joint conference.

<p>Once again, the pro bank forces from both the Senate and House, pushed 

hard by a horde of financial lobbyists, blocked Shelby's efforts and 

adopted a privacy provision that provides no real privacy for the 

personal information of financial consumers.



<p>The weak privacy language was one of the big factors in Shelby casting 

one of only eight votes in the Senate against the adoption of the 

conference report for final passage of the financial services 

modernization bill. Opponents of financial privacy may find the going 

much tougher with Richard Shelby wearing the chairman's hat.



<p>None of this is to suggest that consumers will not have reasons to 

disagree with the Senator from Alabama on issues in coming months, for 

example items like bank redlining and the Community Reinvestment Act. 

But, Senator Shelby does come into the Chairmanship with a solid 

understanding of the Senate Banking Committee's responsibility for 

insisting on the safety and soundness of insured financial institutions, 

tough oversight of regulatory agencies and the protection of citizens' 

privacy. Those are some welcome and big steps forward.</p>
