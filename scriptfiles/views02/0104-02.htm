My children love watching the moon and the stars appear in the night sky during our evening walks. But nothing excites them more than turning off the main road onto our quiet street.

<P>



``Hannah, be quiet!'' insists Jeremy to his 3-year-old twin. ``It's time to hear the crickets.''

<P>



In those moments of listening to the chirping of insects, something feels very right.

<P>



But lately in the real word, not much seems to fit. It is hard to think beyond the noise of war. Questioning the leaders' decisions is considered unpatriotic. This is a time of war, not for softhearted liberal programs. As the roar of the military industrial complex becomes louder, the voices of the poor and vulnerable no longer are being heard.

<P>



It is too easy to be overwhelmed by the plight of malnourished Afghan children who have never seen the inside of a classroom and to consider it whining when parents with children in overcrowded schools in the United States ask for more resources. Cutting budgets for child-protective services seems not too big deal compared to the horrors of navigating through land mines. The struggles of families facing a public-assistance cut off seem to pale in comparison to widows holding infants in their arms.

<P>



It is easy to forget that there is suffering all across our country, although maybe not as immediate and graphic as that in Afghanistan, New York and Washington. According to the Center on Budget Priorities, the administration's $100 billion economic stimulus package is full of multi-year tax cuts for businesses and upper tax brackets, but it does not address the states' current problems in providing services to the vulnerable and unemployed. This failure will result in decreased services in essential education, health and welfare services.

<P>



Florida's recent legislative session was filled with cuts in basic programs. The school budget was cut $639 million and the juvenile justice $61 million. Treating substance abuse in the correction system was cut $13 million and the Senior Prescription Assistance Program $22.5 million.

<P>



The Legislature had the good sense to delay the intangibles tax cut. But what looms ahead is a regular session where more of the paper-and-glue budget fixes of the special session will disappear and even more-drastic cuts to education and health care will be considered.

<P>



As for the unemployed, the federal government is offering them a 50 percent tax credit for health-insurance costs. On the face, this sounds helpful, but what unemployed person can afford half of a $7000 family premium?

<P>



<P><B>HEALTH CARE FOR THE POOR

</B>

<P>



These numbers sound dull and boring. No smart bombs bursting in air, no visuals -- only cold facts: the senior who will have a stroke for lack of blood-pressure medication, the children playing unsupervised when the after-school programs are closed, and the increasing crowds in the emergency room seeking care for flu and respiratory-tract infections. These are the slow viruses of our misplaced priorities. If we don't treat them, they will erupt into the public eye in increased preventable illness, school dropouts and more teenagers entering the adult criminal justice system.

<P>



The noise of war should not redefine patriotism. Question why a tax cut to the rich is patriotic, and why providing health care to the poor is not.

<P>



Supporting our leaders in their war effort does not mean accepting total agendas without question. Rather, it is questioning and debate that will give our nation balance and perspective. For it is not only bombs blasting in our national defense that defines who we are but also the daily work of holding our society together.

<P>



Filtering out the noise of war is hard, but the gift is being able to hear the crickets. And the crickets have something important to say. 

<P>
