</font>Don't lose sleep over it, Osama. We will attack Iraq. Your Islamic world 

will have its jihad. Your Sept. 11 attack wasn't intended just to kill almost 

3,000 people. We know that you meant to change the world and maybe someday control 

it.</p> 

<p>This time it will be so much easier than the gulf war: Al-Jazeera TV - your 

own CNN - will stir up the hatred among all Muslims. They will become enraged 

at seeing the first civilians killed by the godless soldiers from the West. The 

missiles Israel fires in retaliation will Zionize the war. The martial law occupation 

of a Muslim country by America, the Satan of the West, will never be accepted. 

They didn't even try to create a nation out of Afghanistan. The fall of Baghdad 

will lead to chaos. Your terrorist cells will more than triple just as you were 

decentralizing al-Qaeda. What a perfect plan!</p>

<p>The fall of Iraq will not hurt you. Weapons are available in so many other 

places. Just be thankful we consider Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah our 

ally. Saudi Arabia is where you started al-Qaeda after the gulf war. Gifts from 

charitable organizations and from wealthy individuals were helping support your 

cause. A pesky task force, sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations, pointed 

that out. Lucky for you the Bush administration wasn't listening.</p>

<p>Your hometown and your friends are safe, Osama, and the rest of the world will 

be terrorized.</p>

<p>And you will sit back like the chairman of the board, and survey all that you 

have conquered, when they attack Iraq.</p>
