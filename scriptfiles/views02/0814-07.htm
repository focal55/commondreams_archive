<p> GAZA CITY -- There is a bouquet of plastic purple flowers in the center of 

a cheap wooden table. It’s easier to stare at it than into the faces of either 

of the men speaking. The air is suffocatingly hot -- no breeze passes through 

the half-open window. I’m thirsty but won’t drink the orange soda our host passes 

around in paper cups. 

<p>We want to see Israel’s blood. 

<p>Fayiz and Muhammad Shehadeh trade turns almost shouting their anger at the 

lawyer and human rights activists who’ve come to ask for sworn affidavits. Their 

brother, Salah Shehadeh, one of the leaders of the Izz ad-Din al-Qassem brigades, 

the military wing of the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), was the target of 

the July 22nd bombing in which fourteen others died, nine of them children, when 

a two thousand pound bomb obliterated the two-story apartment building in a crowded 

residential area in Gaza City just before midnight. 

<p>I’ve come to hear what these two brothers have to say, though among ourselves—workers 

for the <a href="http://www.mezan.org/" target="_new">Mezan Center for Human Rights</a>—we 

know that their testimony is the least important, despite the high profile of 

their now-dead brother. A war crimes trial must center on the innocent who died 

or whose lives were destroyed in order to be successful, not on the venomous hatred 

of a man and his supporters who knowingly sent boys to blow themselves up in places 

also populated with innocent civilians. 

<p>Muhammad continues his speech. 

<p>We won’t have anything to do with your affidavits. We won’t sign anything. 

We don’t want a trial. We know about European justice. Look at Belgium. Will Sharon 

be tried for his war crimes? Will the victims of Sabra and Shatila ever rest in 

peace? Will the survivors ever see justice done in their names? What about Israel’s 

war against our people every day? Who cares about the United Nations? Count how 

many resolutions have passed against Israel’s criminal behavior. What have they 

accomplished? Who cares? The United States? The US, with its massive arms sales 

to Israel every year? The European Union that sits there and does nothing no matter 

how many pleas for intervention on behalf of our people it receives? Do you think 

your stupid, bureaucratic papers will make one bit of difference to the people 

suffering under Israel’s domination? Do you think they will stop being hungry? 

Do you think it will give them jobs? Do you think their humiliation will end? 

Do you think Israel will stop killing them whenever it wants? You can take your 

papers and your British Colonialist lawyer and get out of here. We know what Israel 

understands. Israel understands blood and power. Nothing else. 

<p>The tirade ends and more cold drinks are offered. No real offense to you guys 

for trying, you see. But we want to make our position clear. 

<p>It’s clear. I hear it today as clearly as I heard it then. The words are still 

ringing in my ears and I want to protest, but I have no grounds. They are the 

angriest, truest words I have heard this summer. When I walked amid the rubble 

of the blasted building and young boys followed me shaking a basket full of missile 

remains and saying, “Made in America” I remember feeling only shame. Is it any 

surprise that so many people have lost all confidence in the international democratic 

legal institutions set up presumably on their behalf? Where is justice each day 

when the sadists of the occupation are stripping another man of his clothes in 

front of his son? When they are daily detaining hundreds sitting in sweltering 

taxis at the Deir al-Balah checkpoint –people trying to get to work or to school, 

or just trying to return home? When their tanks are rolling up the streets of 

Rafah or Beit Lahia firing at anything that moves terrifying children, many of 

whom are malnourished and suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder? When 

their loudspeakers are arrogantly broadcasting yet another 24-hour curfew? “Mamnua 

Tajawwal; Mamnua Tajawwal” (It’s forbidden to go out). 

<p>Should we be proud to know that the F16s and Apache and Blackhawk helicopters 

that fly overhead in Gaza every day terrorizing a population of a million and 

a half prisoners are made in the United States? Is it gratifying that the state-of-the-art 

US military technology for which American taxpayers fork over billions every year 

are used to murder, wound, subjugate, humiliate, ruin, and dispossess people all 

over the world? 

<p>Leaving the home of the Shehadeh brothers, we are assaulted by the hot, desert 

wind again. The sand and dust clings to our faces mingling with our sweat. There 

is little to talk about. I know that the families who lost children, mothers, 

fathers, cousins, on that terrible night in July will never see justice –anymore 

than will the families who lose their sons, fathers, mothers, and daughters at 

the hands of the Occupation Forces every day in the Gaza Strip. Worse, I know 

that nobody cares. 

<p>Just days later more tanks roll into the city to destroy metal workshops, or 

“bomb factories” as the Israeli forces call them. This happens twice while I’m 

living in Gaza City this summer. Never mind that people’s livelihoods have been 

ruined; that more unemployed will line up for international food aid. These places 

contained the materials used for making bombs, so they must be destroyed. No one 

questions this logic. –Like banning lead pencils going into Iraq. Who knows to 

what sinister use a pencil might be put?? 

<p>I have little doubt that some of the materials in those metal workshops did 

indeed end up in the hands of homemade explosives experts. Does this justify destroying 

a man’s entire business? How long do we accept that a regional military superpower 

has the right to smash the lives of the people whose land it occupies each day, 

but that these people have no right to self-defense? I ponder this for a while 

and find myself thinking I’d rather not see both peoples armed. I’d rather see 

them both disarmed. But imagine the outrage, the indignation, the self-righteous 

ire of those whose military toy boxes come under threat. Imagine the look on the 

faces of the beneficiaries of our huge murder corporations when foreign tanks 

roll into Fort Worth, Texas or Mesa, Arizona or Hartford, Ct. to demolish the 

mega-metal workshops called Lockheed Martin or Boeing or United Technologies. 

<p>Sorry, you can’t have any more Blackhawk helicopters, no more F16 fighter jets 

or AGM air-to-ground missiles. No more Hellfire anti-tank missiles or Apache Longbow 

helicopters. Goodbye to the F100-PW-229 aircraft engines, adios low altitude navigation 

targeting infrared night systems. Tanks, don’t forget to stop in Lexington, Mass 

to put an end to Raytheon’s AN-TPQ-37 Firefinder counterbattery radar systems 

and their Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missiles. Move on to Fairfax, Virginia 

to halt the production of ExxonMobil’s JP-8 aviation jet fuel. Move south to Orlando, 

Florida to wipe out PGSUS LLC’s Standoff Attack Missiles, and then backtrack to 

Oshkosh, Wisconsin where the Oshkosh Truck Corporation is producing and selling 

Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Trucks. The list goes on and on. The profits 

and the price tags for these items more jaw dropping than the items themselves. 

<p>The news bulletin might give us pause if worded correctly. “Metal workshops 

throughout the United States fired on and bulldozed this afternoon after it was 

determined that they contained the materials used to produce Weapons of Mass Destruction.” 

<p>I think the rest of the world might sleep more peacefully that night.
