<p>IT was not the most pleasant of tasks, but I am sure there would have been 

no lack of volunteers had the job been advertised. It was a time for any citizen 

concerned about the state of the world to step forward and say: 'Let me through, 

I'm a proctologist.'

<p>I am talking, of course, about the exploration of the presidential colon. Few 

people, I imagine, would want to miss the opportunity to stick a hopefully large 

and shiny surgical implement up George W Bush's rear-end and wiggle it about a 

bit. Or even wiggle it about a lot, saying to the patient lying there without 

the benefit of anaesthetic: 'I'm sorry, Mr President, this will be very painful.'

<p>Every centimetre of progress up the presidential passage would be a small step 

for man but a giant leap for mankind. Every centimetre and every little twist 

could be dedicated to some individual who has suffered at Dubya's hands. A vindictive 

sort of person might accompany each advance of the probe with comments such as: 

'That's for all the Texans you executed so enthusiastically in your time as governor,' 

or, 'This is on behalf of the Afghans blasted to oblivion when the US armed forces 

decided that no wedding is complete without a clutch of 2000lb high explosive 

bombs and a bit of friendly strafing.'

<p>Citizens concerned about Mr Bush's vigilante-style disregard for civil rights 

might like to advance the proctological periscope a swift inch on behalf of the 

individuals incarcerated for having a swarthy skin and an Arab name, a crime in 

post-September 11 America. The green lobby might like to give the scope an enthusiastic 

birl in memory of Bush's abandonment of the Kyoto treaty.

<p>Those who hunger for justice might take the opportunity of making clear to 

the president their distaste for his decision to ignore the International Criminal 

Court of Justice. A few Palestinians with old-fashioned ideas of democratically 

electing their own leaders might like to join the queue.

<p>A great fund-raising opportunity has been missed. Who would not contribute 

to a sponsored probe up Dubya's anal canal at &#163;1 an inch, all proceeds to 

Africa to help bridge the funding gap left by Mr Bush and his fellow G8 leaders? 

Personally I would have pledged a considerable sum for a minute or two at the 

controls of the colonic camera, if only to see if there was any sign of Tony Blair 

up there.</p>
