<p> <i>Example is always more efficacious than precept. </i>Samuel Johnson, Rasselas 

<P>

It was yet another opportunity for the United States to set an example for the world. Last week's exemplars were John Bolton, undersecretary of state for arms control and international security and newly self-anointed minister of disinformation and Tommy Thompson, secretary of health and human services. Mr. Bolton promulgated the Bush administration theory that people who sign things they wish they had not signed can simply wish their signatures away. He succeeded. Mr. Thompson tried to reform agreements long in place. He failed. 

<P>

On May 6 the disappearing signature policy was applied to the agreement creating the International Criminal Court that had been signed by former president Bill Clinton on behalf of the entire country except George Bush. Mr. Bolton wrote a one paragraph letter to Kofi Annan, Secretary General of the United Nations, telling him that the United States had changed its mind. He said: "The United States does not intend to become a party to the treaty. Accordingly, the United States has no legal obligation from its signature on December 31, 2000." That letter not only removed a signature, it also relieved the United States of obligations under the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. That convention, signed in 1969, requires states to refrain from taking steps to undermine treaties they sign, even if they do not ratify them. In one fell swoop Mr. Bolton got rid of two annoying treaties. That was not all he did on May 6. He also promulgated a lie. 

<P>

In a speech to the Heritage Foundation in Washington on that day, Mr. Bolton said that the administration (by which he meant John Bolton) had concluded that Cuba has a limited offensive biological warfare research and development effort. He said that it has "provided dual-use biotechnology to other rogue states." Asked for details, Mr. Bolton's office declined to elaborate. Cuba called his accusations lies, a description confirmed by former president, Jimmy Carter, during his visit. Mr. Carter said that in a number of conversations with highly placed U.S. officials he was told the administration had no evidence that Cuba was doing what Mr. Bolton said. 

<P>

Mr. Bolton's comments were not only remarkable for their glaring deception. They were remarkable when viewed in the context of recent events. In July 2001, 50 countries participated in a meeting, the aim of which was to adopt a protocol to enforce the 1972 biological weapons convention. The protocol had been worked on for seven years and had been described by the Clinton administration as an important tool to stem the spread of biological weapons. At the July meeting the United States pulled out of the talks, saying the protocol was so fundamentally flawed that it could not be repaired, thus leaving in place a system that made it easier for rogue states to do what Mr. Bolton falsely accused Cuba of doing. 

<P>

In a speech in November 2001, to the group that comprised attendees at the July conference, Mr. Bolton said before the participants came up with "new ways to strengthen the Biolgoical Weapons Convention. . . we must first confront the failure of many states to abide by that very document. Too many states are parties to the BWC but have not lived up to their commitments. Any nation ready to violate one agreement is perfectly capable of violating another, denying its actual behavior all the while." His remarks might have been directed at the United States, although Mr. Bolton did not indicate that they were. According to a New York Times report, while assisting in development of the protocol, the United States was engaged in secret research that tested the limits of the treaty. The CIA built and tested a model of a Soviet-designed germ bomb that officials believed was being sold on the international market. The Pentagon assembled a germ factory in Nevada. The Bush administration said these projects were consistent with the BWC. Others said that if another country were engaged in that kind of research, the United States would protest the efforts. 

<P>

While Mr. Bolton was in Geneva, Mr. Thompson was participating in the U.N. General Assembly Special Session on Children, attempting to reopen matters long settled. He was less successful than Mr. Bolton, but his efforts deserve to be acknowledged. 

<P>

Following instructions from the White House Mr. Thompson attempted to exclude abortion from the menu of reproductive health services offered to teenagers. In place of that language he wanted the conference to adopt language that said that that abstinence is "the only sure way of avoiding sexually transmitted disease . . . ." He was oblivious to the fact that the issue had been settled at many earlier conferences in which the United States participated. 

<P>

Commenting on the United States' efforts, Eveline Herfkens, the Dutch development minister said "We are really stuck because one or two governments  &#151;  one of them this country [U.S.]  &#151;  wants to renegotiate commitments we made in previous conferences." In response to her comments an American official was quoted as saying: "We are trying to lead the world." With the kind of leadership Mr. Thompson and Mr. Bolton have demonstrated, they may be leading us to a world where all can, with impunity, discard agreements they dislike. 

<P>

(The United States and Somalia are the only two countries in the world that have not ratified the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child. Somalia signed the treaty in May and reportedly will soon ratify it. The United States has not yet ratified it. One of the reasons is that the convention bans the execution of criminals under 18. Such a ban would violate the sovereignty of the many states in the United States that believe such executions keep delinquents off the streets and out of the prisons.)
