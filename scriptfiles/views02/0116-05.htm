Imagine, if you will, the following scenario: in the early hours of the

morning, a Middle-  

Eastern man aboard a Greyhound bus attacks the driver with a boxcutter and slits his

throat, forcing the bus into oncoming traffic. Six  

people, including the attacker, are killed and 34 people are wounded. Invariably, this man

would be called a terrorist, and the crime  

condemned as an act of terrorism. <p>

This exact scenario did occur early on Oct. 3. However, the attacker was not Arab; he was

Croatian. Perhaps, then, it was no surprise that R. Joe Clark, agent-in-charge of the

Knoxville, TN office of the FBI, described the attack as &#147;not an act of

terrorism.&#148;  <p>

On Nov. 9, FBI officials proclaimed for the first time that they believe the individual

behind the recent anthrax attacks to be a &#147;disturbed American loner along the lines

of Unabomber Theodore Kaczynski.&#148; No mention that this &#147;disturbed

individual&#148; is a terrorist. <p>

           

Clayton Lee Waagner, the man accused of sending hundreds of hoax anthrax letters to

abortion clinics, was not described as a terrorist. Similarly, Irv Rubin of the Jewish

Defense League, caught allegedly planning to bomb a mosque and the office of an

Arab-American member of Congress, was also not described as a terrorist. Why?&nbsp; Was it

because he was not an Arab or a Muslim?  <p>

In fact, several Arab and Muslim Americans were escorted off their respective flights

because either the pilot or the passengers were &#147;uncomfortable&#148; with them on

board the plane. The most recent incident concerned an Arab and Muslim Secret Service

agent. The agent alleges that he was kicked off American Airlines Flight 363 from

Baltimore to Dallas on Dec. 25 because the captain had concerns about his identity, even

though the agent went through the proper procedures for armed security personnel who are

passengers. The agent&#146;s identification was subsequently checked several times by

American personnel and by local police. He even offered to have the Secret Service confirm

his identity. He was kicked off anyway.  <p>

What&#146;s more, when the agent asked to go back on the plane to retrieve his jacket, the

captain allegedly said: &#147;I don&#146;t want him back on that plane.&#148; Further,

according to CNN, witnesses dispute the airline&#146;s claim that the agent acted in an

angry manner.  <p>

This is an abhorrent double standard, and is testament to the still prevalent stereotype

of Arabs and Muslims as terrorists. Not only is this manifested in the statements of

officials, but in the media as well. It seems that whenever we hear or read about

terrorism or violence, the words &#147;Islamic&#148; or &#147;Muslim&#148; do not lag far

behind. Furthermore, whenever terrorism is in the news, Muslims are overwhelmingly more

newsworthy.  <p>

The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), a Washington, DC-based Islamic advocacy

group, analyzed the news coverage of the Millennium terror plots that were foiled nearly

two years ago. The arrest of the Algerian man who allegedly tried to smuggle bomb-making

materials into the United States was covered by 129 stories (113 print, 16 broadcast) on

the day of and the day following the announcement of his arrest. Twenty-one stories ran on

Page 1.  <p>

Yet, the arrest of two suspected militia members accused of plotting to blow up a

California propane plant, which could have killed as many as half the people within a

5-mile radius, received 51 stories (51 print, 0 broadcast) on the day of the arrest and

the following day. Only one of the stories ran on Page 1; many of them ran as news briefs.

 

<p>

Also, the arrest of an American Airlines 

mechanic who was charged with possessing bomb-making materials after potential explosives

and assault rifles were found in his home was covered by just 10 articles. The New York

Times ran the story on Page 20. The Washington Post ran it on page eight. The Algerian

man, of course, was called a terrorist. However, none of the propane plant or American

Airlines stories highlighted the alleged perpetrators&#146; race or religion. They were

not called terrorists.  

<p>

The truth is, all these individuals are terrorists. Yes, there are terrorists who happen

to be Muslim, but terrorists come in all stripes, and terrorism has no religion, no

ethnicity, no national origin. It is time to call a spade a spade and drop the double

standard.
