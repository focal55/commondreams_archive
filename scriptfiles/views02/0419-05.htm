In the spirit of playoff profiles of hockey contenders, I'd like to assess the 

prospects of the United States as the world's sole superpower. A team in a league 

of its own. For the country CNN calls the mightiest force in history, it's been 

a bad week. 

<P><B>The Mideast: </B>Two weeks ago, George W. Bush told Israel to end its invasion 

of Palestinian territory &#34;without delay,&#34; then sent his Secretary of State 

to back it up. Israel ignored and defied him. In response, the U.S. did nothing 

and Colin Powell went home. This is not impressive superpower behaviour. Other 

governments took note. Egypt's president cancelled a meeting with Colin Powell 

and didn't even bother making up an excuse.</P>

<P>It was especially unimpressive since the Mideast is the most resoluble crisis 

in the world. Almost everyone knows the answer: a small but viable state for the 

Palestinians with security guarantees for Israel. It involves one sticky point: 

Israel's illegal settlements must be removed. I know the Israeli government denies 

this would solve the problem, which they claim is the &#34;real&#34; Palestinian 

motive: to destroy Israel. But the point is, the U.S. is among those who feel 

it <I>can</I> be solved this way, yet they failed to press. Just as striking is 

the fact that they could impose this solution without military threats, by sheer 

financial pressure, since Israel is massively dependent on U.S aid. But they didn't 

act.</P>

<P><B>Venezuela: </B>As they say in Latin America, there has never been a coup 

in the U.S. because there's no American embassy there. Last week, the coup happened 

in Venezuela, ousting elected president Hugo Chavez. In previous weeks, &#34;members 

of the country's diverse opposition&#34; had visited the U.S. embassy (The Washington 

Post) and met &#34;senior members of the Bush administration&#34; in Washington 

who sent &#34;informal, subtle signals that we don't like this guy&#34; (The New 

York Times). The Pentagon spokesperson said she was &#34;not aware&#34; if the 

U.S. gave military support to the coup, and Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer suggested 

the President was pleased. There are many reasons they wanted Hugo Chavez out 

-- his social reforms, his opposition to bombing Afghanistan (&#34;fighting terrorism 

with terrorism&#34;). But never mind that, it's all standard, like U.S.-backed 

coups in Guatemala (1954) or Chile (1973) -- down to the pot-banging street protests 

and U.S.-allied labour leaders. They all come from the same coup cookie-cutter. 

What was different is that this time the coup crumbled and Hugo Chavez is back. 

For the first time, the superpower failed in a back-yard coup.</P>

<P><B>Afghanistan: </B>It was a total success, right, except they're still there 

and still haven't accomplished their main objectives: catching Osama bin Laden 

and destroying his network. Overthrowing the government of Afghanistan was never 

more than a means to that end. This week, they said Osama bin Laden probably slipped 

through their fingers in December, and George Bush warned Americans that more 

terror attacks are likely, since &#34;cells&#34; are still out there. He might 

have added that the ranks of recruits to terror will enlarge considerably after 

his own failure to stem the Israeli assault -- among Palestinians and elsewhere. 

This is not a question of good or evil; it's an observable, predictable fact.</P>

<P>Are there signs of unease in the U.S. itself, despite the polls and the bland 

wall of superpatriotism shown on CNN and other public faces of the superpower? 

Well, there are a few straws in the wind. I don't know exactly what to make of 

them, but I'll pass them on. Michael Moore's book, <I>Stupid White Men</I>, is 

in its fifth week atop The New York Times's bestseller list, despite a relative 

media blackout of it, and its attack on everything George Bush's America is about. 

Veteran American critic of U.S. policy Noam Chomsky finds his appearances mobbed 

and applauded. British journalist Robert Fisk says he was shocked at the self-criticism 

and doubt he found during a recent U.S. tour. People in the Midwest told him the 

Bush presidency lacked legitimacy because he hadn't won the election. Of course, 

people go to see speakers they want to hear and dissidents always like to believe 

they're popular. The South African Communist Party had a well-known member called 

Comrade-The-Contradictions-Are-Sharpening, who explained at every meeting that 

the the revolution was about to occur. On the other hand, eventually it did, sort 

of. It seems to me something is happening in the U.S., but I don't know what it 

is.</P>

<P>As for Canada, it makes you think. Do we want our forces folded even further 

into theirs, under the new Northern Command they just announced? And those Canadian 

soldiers killed in Afghanistan -- proving again that the fighting there is far 

from over: Should our government have joined the U.S. contingent as it did, or 

should it have chosen instead to be part of the international peacekeeping force, 

helping to provide at least some counterbalance to the stumbly sole superpower?
