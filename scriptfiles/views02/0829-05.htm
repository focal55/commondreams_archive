<p> One of the good things about the stock

market coming back down to Earth after a

prolonged bubble is that it leads people to

question other misconceptions about the

economy. When stock prices were soaring we

heard all kinds of nonsense about a "new

economy," technological revolutions, and profit

projections that were just too miraculous to be

true.



         <p>The standard litany about the wonders of

globalization could be the next myth that is ripe

for debunking. For decades we have been told that

increasing global trade and investment was great

for everyone, with the exception of some

inevitable "losers" who would hopefully retrain

for new jobs (perhaps in the "new economy.")



         <p>Like the investment advisers who hawked

Enron and WorldCom stocks as they were

heading toward disaster, most of the "experts" on

globalization have long been avoiding the real

numbers.



         <p>For starters: the real median wage in 1973

was $12.45 (measured in 2000 dollars). In 2000 it

was about $12.90. Considering that the US

economy grew by 72 percent (per person) during

that period, somebody got shafted. Since the

median is by definition the middle of the wage

ladder, that somebody includes the majority of

employees in the United States -- not just the

textile or steel workers who have been hit directly

by foreign competition.



         <p>Anyone who is old enough to have lived

through the 1950s, 60s, and 70s knows that it was

not uncommon for a typical wage-earner to buy a

house, support a family, and even put the kids

through college with just one income. That doesn't

happen any more, and these statistics are another

way of expressing America's changed reality.



         <p>Interestingly, almost all of the research by economists shows that our opening up to foreign trade contributed to this massive redistribution of income. The only question is: how much? Even if we take the smaller estimates of how much redistribution was due to increased trade -- not to mention US firms moving production overseas -- it is easy to show that about three-quarters of the US labor force has suffered a net loss due to globalization. This takes into account (as do the above numbers on the real median wage) all the cheap DVD and CD players, clothing, and other consumer goods that we now import from overseas. For the vast majority of Americans, the losses from globalization have outweighed the gains, in strictly economic terms.



         <p>This should not be surprising, since our

political leaders have made it their mission for

more than 30 years to rewrite the rules of global

commerce (for example, in such agreements as

the North American Free Trade Agreement or the

World Trade Organization) in ways that give

corporations more power and workers less.



         <p>What about the developing world?

Unfortunately the official, undisputed numbers

tell a very different story here, too, than the one

we have heard from the cheerleaders on TV. The

growth of income per person in the low and

middle-income countries dropped sharply over the

last 20 years. If we compare the last two decades

(1980-2000) to the previous 20 years (1960-

1980), we find that these economies advanced by

less than half their prior rate of growth.



         <p>As a result of this slower economic

growth, most developing countries also saw

reduced progress over the last 20 years in such

areas as life expectancy, infant and child

mortality, literacy, and education.



         <p>This long experiment in corporate-led

globalization has been a failure, at home and

abroad. As with the end of the "new economy," it

is time to face up to the facts.
