<p>AL GORE, remarkably, has stepped into a leadership vacuum and said several 

things that most congressional Democrats may well believe but have been too fearful 

to utter.

<P>Gore, speaking Monday at the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco, warned that 

unilateral action against Saddam Hussein would ''severely damage'' the more urgent 

war on terrorism and ''weaken our ability to lead the world.'' Gore declared that 

the president has turned the broad reservoir of good will for America ''into a 

deep sense of misgiving and even hostility.'' In a pointed dig at President George 

W. Bush's go-it-alone cowboy rhetoric, he added, ''If you're going after Jesse 

James, you ought to organize the posse first.''</P>

<P>Now this is extremely interesting. </P>

<P>For starters, it is out of character for the cautious and generally hawkish 

former vice president. Gore has lately returned to politics, sort of, but until 

now he has avoided frontally attacking Bush. He has at last chosen to do so, at 

a moment when the president, swaddled in the flag, is widely seen as beyond criticism. 

</P>

<P>Did Gore do his own polling and discover what many members of Congress suspect 

based on their mail - that public support for this war is seemingly broad but 

very shallow? Was he trying to outflank potential rival Senator John Kerry, who 

has won praise for a thoughtful critique of Bush's policy? Did Gore, who often 

made abrupt shifts during the 2000 campaign, just impulsively decide to throw 

a ''Hail Mary'' pass? Or, perhaps, was he seized with an attack of principle?</P>

<P>It almost doesn't matter. The party's standard bearer for 2000 - who got more 

votes than George W. Bush - has now made it safe for Democrats to express serious 

doubts about this reckless war. Gore, perhaps in spite of himself, has actually 

exercised that rarest of qualities in contemporary politics - leadership.</P>

<P>One can accuse Gore of many things, but being soft on defense is not one of 

them. He was one of a handful of Senate Democrats to support George Bush senior 

on the Gulf War in 1991. The fact is, public opinion is still fluid on Iraq. And 

if other Democrats follow Gore's lead, this could be a turning point.</P>

<P>Jim Dyke, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee, declared, rather 

lamely, that to him, Gore sounded more like ''a political hack than a presidential 

candidate.'' But that just won't wash. Serious questions about the wisdom of Bush's 

Iraq policy are being raised publicly by most of our allies and privately by many 

of our generals and even by some Republicans. Bush's Iraq strategy is cynically 

designed to change the subject - actually two subjects: terrorism and the economy. 

It immediately takes the spotlight off our less than stellar antiterrorism crusade 

and our shaky success in Afghanistan, and it makes it almost impossible for Democrats 

to wage the 2002 midterm election on pocketbook issues.</P>

<P>The strategy has deftly whipsawed Democrats. Some, such as the House Democratic 

leader, Dick Gephardt, and the Senate majority leader, Tom Daschle, want to get 

a quick, slightly toned down resolution of support for the president behind them 

and then go back to talking about the economy (if anyone will listen). That way 

Bush can't pillory them for being unpatriotic. </P>

<P>But others see the nation pursuing a disastrous course. Many Democrats in Congress 

say privately (and a few publicly) that they've heard nothing in the confidential 

intelligence briefings to indicate that Saddam Hussein is more of a threat now 

than in years past. Congressional Democrats got a closed-door briefing from a 

worried and extremely skeptical Zbigniew Brzezinski, President Carter's hawkish 

national security adviser. This morning Democrats are scheduled to have a another 

confidential briefing from one of the party's foreign policy eminences, Richard 

Holbrooke, who is said to harbor grave doubts.</P>

<P>If the Democrats can work up their nerve to schedule some hearings before a 

resolution of war is gaveled through, they and the American public will hear more.</P>

<P>I've never been a great fan of Gore. He kept changing his mind so often in 

the campaign that he lost a race for the presidency that he should have won. He 

was oddly AWOL last year when Bush was claiming a mandate for extremist policies 

that he never earned. Gore is often described as one of the most ambitious, calculating, 

and poll-driven people in American politics. </P>

<P>But even if he did the right thing partly for the wrong reasons, this has to 

be one of Gore's finest moments. Now let's see if his party follows his brave 

lead.</P>
