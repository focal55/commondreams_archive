<p> President Bush's announcement last week of his intention to privatize up to 

half the federal workforce came with the usual confident talk that it will reduce 

government costs and improve services.</p>

<p>Market ideologues may believe that, but there is no reason citizens should 

be so gullible. Instead, we might ask critical questions about the likely consequences 

of large-scale privatization and why the Bush gang is so keen on it.</p>

<p>Research suggests that where there is real market competition for relatively 

simple goods and services, governments can save money and ensure quality through 

privatization. Contracting out tasks such as office cleaning may save taxpayers 

money in some cases (though often at the cost of lower wages and reduced benefits 

for workers).</p>

<p>But that's not the majority of cases. Often short-term savings evaporate quickly 

once competitors drop out. Contractors who underbid to win a contract are free 

to raise rates later, often leaving governments with little choice but to accept. 

For complex contracts, oversight costs are high, or inadequate oversight leads 

to corruption. State and local experience suggests that in services such as vehicle 

and highway maintenance, privatization may end up costing taxpayers more.</p>

<p>So, the cautious (dare we say "conservative"?) position would be that when 

the complexity of the job or the nature of the market argues against privatization, 

we should go forward only after careful study. But the Bush proposal suggests 

just the opposite: an assumption in favor of privatizing at breakneck speed, which 

means careful study will be overridden by ideology and good-old-boy politicking.</p>

<p>If research and experience on privatization don't support Bush's enthusiasm, 

why is he pressing for such wholesale change?</p>

<p>One potentially relevant fact: Last year 37.4 percent of government workers 

were unionized, compared with 9 percent of private-sector employees. Since organized 

labor consistently supports the Democratic Party, it's plausible that Bush simply 

wants to reduce the number of workers in a more unionized sector.</p>

<p>Even if short-term political payback is part of it, there may be a more fundamental 

goal, in not only contracting out union jobs but also the push to privatize programs 

such as Social Security: Undercut any organization that might increase the political 

power of working people. Eliminate any program that might lead people to work 

for common interests. Destroy any ideas people might have about solidarity.</p>

<p>Even though most unions in the United States years ago accepted a role subordinate 

to big business, they are a target of the right wing. Why? Because they remain 

a latent threat. Even if not engaged in radical political activity today, unions 

are a place where ordinary people can come together politically and wield power, 

and hence they must be eliminated.</p>

<p>Social Security is another obvious target. While hardly a complete solution 

to poverty among the elderly, it's a successful program. That's why right-wing 

pundits and politicians have worked so hard to scare the public into believing 

Social Security is on the brink of collapse. The immediate goal is to allow Wall 

Street to get its hands on more money through private retirement funds, but the 

long-term goal is to privatize not just these programs but people's minds, to 

try to eliminate any sense that we have common bonds and obligations to each other.</p>

<p>In Bush's 2003 budget, this "competitive sourcing initiative" to eliminate 

federal government jobs is explained as part of the pursuit of "a market-based 

government unafraid of competition, innovation, and choice."</p>

<p>I am not afraid of competition, innovation or choice. But I am deathly afraid 

of a market-based government, in which the values of corporate capitalism - the 

pursuit of profit to the exclusion of all other considerations - will overwhelm 

the values of democracy - equality and liberty.</p>
