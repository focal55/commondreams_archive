<p>You may recall that George W. Bush promised, among other things, to change 

the tone in Washington. He made good on that promise: the tone has certainly changed. 

</p>

<P> As far as I know, in the past it wasn't considered appropriate for the occupant 

of the White House to declare that members of the opposition party weren't interested 

in the nation's security. And it certainly wasn't usual to compare anyone who 

wants to tax the rich — or even anyone who estimates the share of last year's 

tax cut that went to the wealthy — to Adolf Hitler.</p>

<P> O.K., maybe we should discount remarks by Senator Phil Gramm. When Mr. Gramm 

declared that a proposal to impose a one-time capital gains levy on people who 

renounce U.S. citizenship in order to avoid paying taxes was "right out of Nazi 

Germany," even the ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, Charles 

Grassley, objected to the comparison.</p>

<P> But Mr. Grassley must have thought better of his objection, since just a few 

weeks later he decided to use the Hitler analogy himself: "I am sure voters will 

get their fill of statistics claiming that the Bush tax cut hands out 40 percent 

of its benefits to the top 1 percent of taxpayers. This is not merely misleading, 

it is outright false. Some folks must be under the impression that as long as 

something is repeated often enough, it will become true. That was how Adolf Hitler 

got to the top." </p>

<P> For the record, Robert McIntyre of Citizens for Tax Justice — the original 

source of that 40 percent estimate — is no Adolf Hitler. The amazing thing is 

that Mr. Grassley is sometimes described as a moderate. His remarks are just one 

more indicator that we have entered an era of extreme partisanship — one that 

leaves no room for the acknowledgment of politically inconvenient facts. For the 

claim that Mr. Grassley describes as "outright false" is, in fact, almost certainly 

true; in a rational world it wouldn't even be a matter for argument.</p>

<P> You might imagine that Mr. Grassley has in hand an alternative answer to the 

question "How much of the tax cut will go to the top 1 percent?" — that the administration 

has, at some point, produced a number showing that the wealthy aren't getting 

a big share of the benefits. In fact, however, administration officials have never 

answered that question. When pressed, they have always insisted on answering some 

other question. </p>

<P> But last year the Treasury Department did release a table showing, somewhat 

inadvertently, that more than 25 percent of the income tax cut will go to people 

making more than $200,000 per year. This number doesn't include the effects of 

estate tax repeal; in 1999 only 2 percent of estates paid any tax, and half of 

that tax was paid by only 0.16 percent of estates. The number also probably doesn't 

take account of the alternative minimum tax, which will snatch away most of the 

income tax cut for upper-middle-class families, but won't affect the rich. </p>

<P> Put all this together and it becomes clear that, sure enough, something like 

40 percent of the tax cut — it could be a bit less, but probably it's considerably 

more — will go to 1 percent of the population. And the administration's systematic 

evasiveness on the question of who benefits from the tax cut amounts to a plea 

of nolo contendere. </p>

<P> Which brings us back to the new tone in Washington.</p>

<P> When Ronald Reagan cut taxes on rich people, he didn't deny that that was 

what he was doing. You could agree or disagree with the supply-side economic theory 

he used to justify his actions, but he didn't pretend that he was increasing the 

progressivity of the tax system. </p>

<P> The strategy used to sell the Bush tax cut was simply to deny the facts — 

and to lash out at anyone who tried to point them out. And it's a strategy that, 

having worked there, is now being applied across the board.</p>

<P> Michael Kinsley recently wrote that "The Bush campaign for war against Iraq 

has been insulting to American citizens, not just because it has been dishonest, 

but because it has been unserious. A lie is insulting; an obvious lie is doubly 

insulting." All I can say is, now he notices? It's been like that all along on 

economic policy. </p>

<P> You see, some folks must be under the impression that as long as something 

is repeated often enough, it will become true. That was how George W. Bush got 

to the top. </p>
