            The art of the deal is a media dream: Savvy achievers get to the

top.

Guile and artifice -- even outright deception -- may well be part of the

game, but there's nothing like success. One way or another, money and

centralized power end up calling the tunes. Or so the media script often

goes.



<p>From its beginnings a half-century ago, the Pacifica radio network

set out to be quite different. Listeners tuned in for something else --

a

much more inclusive embrace of human creativity and political dissent.

Like most endeavors, there were failures and crises along the way. But

even with Pacifica's tumultuous history, the last three years have been

times of extraordinary upheaval.



<p>Two words -- "censorship" and "democracy" -- summarize much of what

has been at stake in the national battle over Pacifica.



<p>Now, some very good news: Democracy is winning.



<p>As the owner of noncommercial radio stations based in five

metropolitan areas -- San Francisco, Los Angeles, Houston, New York and

Washington -- the nonprofit Pacifica Foundation operates with a national

board of directors. During the 1990s, a succession of power grabs

enabled

a board majority to emerge with ill-disguised contempt for the

progressive

principles and grassroots innovation that had long enlivened the

Pacifica

airwaves.



<p>In 1999, turmoil reached a boiling point at the Pacifica station

headquartered in Berkeley, Calif. -- the nation's oldest

listener-sponsored radio outlet, KPFA. Long-simmering conflicts erupted

after Pacifica's national management tried to prevent KPFA from airing

news reports about firings at the station.



<p>People at KPFA refused to knuckle under. They resisted in ways that

journalists and activists have resisted for hundreds of years -- by

speaking out and by organizing. Apparently baffled that so many

employees

would take principled positions at the risk of losing their jobs, the

Pacifica management called in police, even ordering the arrest of

longtime

reporters in the KPFA newsroom.

<p>During a lockout that lasted several weeks, the outpouring of

support

for KPFA included a series of large demonstrations. One afternoon, more

than 10,000 people marched by the boarded-up station. Pacifica

management

felt compelled to relent. The station reopened.



<p>The Pacifica picture turned bleaker at the end of 2000 when a

"Christmas coup" at WBAI in New York City resulted in the firing and

banning of dozens of longtime staffers and programmers. Opponents of the

crackdown mobilized to resist the takeover while the station's new

management retaliated against critical voices. Producers for Pacifica's

hard-hitting "Democracy Now" program, the most popular in the network's

history, were harassed until they moved out of the WBAI studios. At that

point, the Pacifica-owned stations -- except for KPFA in Berkeley --

stopped broadcasting the program.



<p>At KPFK in Los Angeles, KPFT in Houston, WPFW in Washington and

WBAI,

station managers went along with a national Pacifica regime eager to

censor criticism of their own censorial policies. Hundreds of program

hosts and other volunteers were purged from the four stations because

they

refused to remain silent about the suppression.



<p>In contrast to the self-selecting power consolidation by Pacifica's

board majority, KPFA moved ahead with a democratizing process that

initiated regular elections -- so that thousands of supporters, as

members

of listener-funded KPFA Radio, could vote for a "local advisory board"

to

represent them.



<p>For years, the corporate-minded new regime atop Pacifica had a grip

on the network. Along the way, it was sometimes grim to see the

responses

from left-leaning institutions that had for decades been among key

constituencies of the Pacifica network. Some accommodated themselves to

the network's new regime.



<p>But a lot of other organizations protested the new censorship and

thereby risked being frozen off Pacifica's airwaves. Nationwide, dozens

of

community radio stations helped by condemning Pacifica actions and

boycotting its news show. Across the nation, countless listeners became

media activists as they devoted enormous amounts of time and energy to a

movement aimed at recreating Pacifica as an unabashedly progressive

grassroots network.



<p>Because of such efforts, ranging from lawsuits and picket lines to

boycotts and public education campaigns, the pressure became too much

for

the corporate-minded majority on the Pacifica national board. In late

December, a legal settlement reconstituted the board. And now, for the

first time in many years, the board's majority is committed to

progressive

principles.



<p>Many challenges are ahead. The ousted regime left the network with

massive debt, largely due to sky-high bills from law firms, security

services and public-relations outfits. Managers who've been in place at

four Pacifica stations have clear records of censorship that suited the

network's former board majority. As those managers update their resumes

and look for jobs elsewhere, they can boast of extensive experience at

opportunism.



<p>For understandable reasons, many people are cynical about media

these

days. But we shouldn't succumb to defeatism. "Democratic media" is not

necessarily an oxymoron.
