<p>EVERETT, Wash. -- I work operating industrial machinery at a paper mill that 

is owned by a global corporation. My mill was built in the 1920's, when the stock 

market was soaring, F. Scott Fitzgerald was writing about the rich and Babe Ruth 

was hitting home runs for the Yankees. I get paid by the hour and do not understand 

the markets. I do not belong to a country club or own a suit. I just want to work 

at the mill until I retire.</p>

<P> My mill has survived the Depression, a world war, even a couple minor earthquakes. 

But I worry if it can survive Ken Lay. Small investors like me — encouraged by 

politicians, financial advisers and CNBC — poured our retirement savings into 

the stock market. Now we are dismayed that the corporate captains have abandoned 

accountability while the crew sinks with the ship.</p>

<P> Perhaps I am looking for excuses for the recent poor performance of my 401(k) 

plan, but I wonder if the market is fair. In 2001, the average chief executive's 

pay was more than $11 million, according to Pearl Meyer & Partners, an executive-compensation 

consulting firm. Executive pay has been climbing steadily for the past two decades 

and has outpaced employee pay. Two decades ago, C.E.O.'s were paid about 40 times 

more than the average hourly employee; now they make more than 500 times the wage 

of the average hourly employee.</p>

<P> Last year the C.E.O. of my company made 592 times more than I did. I wonder 

if that makes me underpaid or the C.E.O. overpaid. Recently management told hourly 

employees at my mill to make concessions or risk losing our jobs. We made the 

concessions last autumn, but last spring the C.E.O. received a stock "gift" worth 

$1.4 million.</p>

<P> This isn't capitalism, it's avarice. I am not naïve. I know about the robber 

barons of the late 19th century and others throughout history who have abused 

the system. But never has the gap between executives and employees been greater. 

This disparity threatens the capitalist system itself. When employees make concessions 

while executives take bonuses, the bonds of common purpose are broken.</p>

<P> Contrast this with the Marine Corps, which is structured so that enlisted 

personnel and officers work together for a common purpose. The Marine Corps commandant 

runs an organization with 172,600 men and women, oversees an annual budget of 

some $13.2 billion and is paid $163,177 annually — just 13 times more than the 

pay of a new private in boot camp. The system is successful because of a tradition 

of shared risks and rewards.</p>

<P> All employees want their company to succeed, and I am proud to work where 

I do. I imagine my concern about my company's share price is as great as my C.E.O.'s; 

a portion of my 401(k) is in company stock. I recognize my job depends upon my 

company making a profit.</p>

<P> But I wonder if corporate executives appreciate the role workers play in their 

success. Free enterprise is a system of risks and rewards. As it now stands, employees 

suffer most of the risks, while executives enjoy most of the rewards. </p>
