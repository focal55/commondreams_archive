ONCE WE were free to choose, it was all supposed to work. And so we chose, and this is what has happened:

<p> The cost of health care is again rising by double digits. Employers are shifting more health costs to their workers - higher copayments, higher deductibles, higher out-of-pocket maximums. The more you get sick, the more you pay.

<p> The number of uninsured is rising with the number of unemployed. The states are buckling under the weight of higher Medicaid costs. The rolls are up. So state budget knives will soon come down.

<p> Some doctors boldly are considering leaving Medicare, once considered a financial boon and now becoming another bust. It's just another insurer whose reimbursements are so low that doctors can barely afford to keep the clerical staff they need to file the claims.

<p> Some are starting "boutique" practices. Ante up a few thousand dollars and you can buy a luxury that used to be a lifestyle: doctors who are always on call, who can give you an appointment on short notice, who come to your house when you're sick and hold your hand when someone in the family dies. These doctors may be outrageously greedy. Or maybe just outraged at the transformation of their offices into assembly lines.

<p> The hospitals have cut so many beds that now, instead of worrying about expensive rooms that are lying empty, public health officials worry about finding spare cots for potential victims of bioterrorism. Think armories and high school gyms.

<p> "What if we really had a bad flu epidemic this winter?" asks Dr. William Hall, president of the American College of Physicians and American Society of Internal Medicine.

<p> Forget smallpox. We can't handle the flu.

<p> It is time to admit the health-care solution of the 1990s - HMOs - didn't solve anything.

<p> It hasn't put a lid on costs. Health insurance costs for employers rose more than 11 percent last year, according to the consulting firm William M. Mercer Inc. Another 13-percent increase is expected for 2002. Medicaid, the federal-state program that insures low-income families, is in outright crisis, with costs climbing, rolls rising from the recession - and states unable to pay. And HMOs in Medicare?

<p> "It's been a disaster," said Hall.

<p> Those Medicare HMOs that haven't abandoned a community altogether are abandoning the promises, such as generous prescription-drug coverage, they used to lure the elderly in.

<p> The HMO solution hasn't produced a generation of caring, involved general practitioners who know patients so well they can guide sick people to the care they really do need - and away from that they really don't. After all, besides greater efficiency and lower costs, managed care was supposed to create a system of medically knowledgeable gatekeepers who would help with your care, not just your employer's costs.

<p> "It was supposed to deliver the promise of a gatekeeper who knew you really well as a patient," said Barry Schilmeister of Mercer's New York office.

<p> Instead, it delivered an indifferent voice at the end of a toll-free line. And a new by-product: a generation of workers who, now given a different choice, are moving in droves toward more loosely controlled health plans - which, in turn, is helping to drive up costs.

<p> "The American health-care system costs too much and does not work," candidate Bill Clinton wrote in 1992.

<p> You could write it again now, without much editing. The choice made in 1994 was to let it be, to reject a national solution and let every American find his own. Each employer and each individual would choose in a marketplace that would somehow bring perfect rationality to a perfectly irrational health-care system.

<p> For that to be true, you would have to believe that economics, and not emotion, is what drives people when they're having a baby or some tightness in the chest. You would have to assume that people who lose their jobs, and with it their insurance, have a choice. Or that people who go without insurance because they can't afford the premiums are making an informed decision, not a desperate one.

<p> Now we know all the old health-insurance problems, and some new ones, are still problems. The question is who, if anyone, will step forward to suggest a real solution.
