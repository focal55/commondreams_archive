<p>In a time of grim realism in world affairs, it might seem odd to talk about 

slowing any kind of arms race.</P>

<P>The world is bracing for the fallout from a U.S. assault on Iraq. The Bush 

administration is withdrawing from arms-control agreements. It's pushing ahead 

with the development of space-based weapons systems and a new generation of nuclear 

devices. To many, disarmament is a dirty word when the world is under attack.</P>

<P>But the case for it is as strong as ever, particularly where proliferation 

of small arms and light weapons is concerned. Potential victims of mercenary armies, 

garden-variety terrorists, armed gangs and organized criminals around the world 

have as strong a claim to protection as those in Osama bin Laden's sights. They 

have a right to demand that weapons manufacturers and governments do everything 

possible to ensure that arms are not knowingly delivered to those with a track 

record of atrocities, or in situations where they are bound to pour fuel on conflicts 

already raging.</P>

<P>As I wrote on Friday, the global weapons trade experienced a slowdown last 

year. It was driven largely by economic conditions and isn't likely to endure. 

Something like half a billion light weapons -- guns, grenade launchers and the 

like -- are believed to be in circulation. Despite their low cost, they are responsible 

for the vast majority of war deaths among civilians.</P>

<P>These are the tools of rival armies in places such as Chechnya, Colombia and 

the Democratic Republic of Congo, and of dictators elsewhere in Africa and Central 

Asia.</P>

<P>There are few signs of a <I>crise de conscience</I> among their suppliers, 

and a post-Sept. 11 spike in arms transfers is likely. &#34;From my perspective, 

the war on terrorism is an excuse to sell arms and get a U.S. foothold in new 

markets,&#34; says Tamar Gabelnick, director of the arms sales monitoring project 

at the Federation of American Scientists.</P>

<P>Efforts to promote curbs on arms deals suffered a setback last year at the 

first United Nations conference on small arms and light weapons. The meeting endorsed 

an action plan to combat illicit armaments traffic. But it was severely weakened 

after U.S. representatives stood firm against the notion of curbs on civilians' 

right to bear arms and supplying weapons to friendly rebel armies. Nevertheless, 

another conference is to be held in 2006.</P>

<P>Another proposal comes from a group of Nobel Peace Prize winners led by Oscar 

Arias, the dour but dogged former president of Costa Rica. It's a global treaty 

that would prohibit the transfer of weapons where there is a &#34;reasonable risk&#34; 

that they would be used to commit atrocities, aggression or violations of the 

law of war.</P>

<P>This initiative, the Framework Convention on International Arms Transfers, 

draws on the experience of the European Union, which has some of the world's biggest 

weapons producers -- and, since 1998, a much-criticized code of conduct for arms 

deals. Unlike the non-binding EU code, it would prohibit certain types of transactions. 

Ultimately, it could lead to common standards for arms transfers among countries 

that now have widely varying systems for scrutinizing and approving military exports.</P>

<P>Such a treaty, if effective, would remove a principal argument from those who 

argue against arms-trade restrictions: If we don't do it, someone else will. It 

would help lift the mantle of secrecy off the world of arms dealing, as it is 

slowly being raised from mining, oil and other industries with a global reach.</P>

<P>The idea deserves a fair hearing, at the very least. </p>
