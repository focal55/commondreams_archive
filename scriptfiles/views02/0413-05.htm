WASHINGTON &#151; The Democrats these days have the self-confidence 

  of a couple of gawky adolescent boys fantasizing about getting dates to the 

  junior prom. When they are together as a group, they can talk a brave game. 

  But when it comes to picking up the phone and actually (yikes!) calling a girl, 

  they become hopelessly flustered and tongue-tied.

<p>This Democratic dilemma was highlighted Thursday at a conference 

  sponsored by the Campaign for America's Future, a group that has emerged as 

  the progressive counter-weight to the centrist Democratic Leadership Council. 

  Rather than rousing the faithful to a fever pitch, speeches by Democratic House 

  members, former Clinton advisors, AFL-CIO President John Sweeney and three likely 

  presidential candidates underlined the reality that this party is crippled by 

  fear.</p>

<p>Who would have imagined a year ago that a gathering of 

  left-wing Democrats would barely mention George W. Bush's proposed $48 billion 

  increase in the military budget? Or that the party's progressive shock troops 

  would shy away from deriding conservative Attorney General John Ashcroft for 

  short-circuiting civil liberties in his efforts to combat terrorism? Virtually 

  the only high-energy moment came when fiery Illinois Rep. Jan Schakowsky provoked 

  the audience into repeating the refrain, "Tax breaks for the rich," as the Bush 

  administration's favored solution to all national problems.</p>

<p>This weekend, many would-be 2004 Democratic presidential 

  contenders will be in Orlando test-marketing stump speeches at the Florida state 

  party convention. For North Carolina Sen. John Edwards and House Minority Leader 

  Dick Gephardt, who will be in Iowa this weekend, Thursday provided an opportunity 

  to test applause lines before a live audience. But judging from Gephardt's overamplified 

  bellow and Edwards' well-crafted but vague rhetoric, the Democrats still have 

  a long way to go in their quest to perfect a politically potent party message.</p>

<p>Thursday's conference was billed as a repudiation of Enron 

  economics. Veteran activist Bob Borosage, the group's co-director, called Enron 

  "the classic scandal to depict this conservative era." But former Clinton pollster 

  Stan Greenberg presented survey data to show that congressional Democrats have 

  derived virtually no political benefit from the largest corporate scandal in 

  decades. As he put it, "When it comes to fighting the special interests in Washington, 

  there is no difference between the two parties. If Democrats are speaking out, 

  they're not being heard."</p>

<p>At a time when the president's poll ratings are so high 

  that they deserve their own flight path, the Democrats are not likely to be 

  handed many issues. That's why the party's failure to successfully exploit Enron 

  is so symbolic of Democratic disarray.</p>

<p>Even health care, traditionally a potent Democratic issue, 

  inspires little more than an apologetic stammer from party leaders. Gephardt 

  dramatically declared, "We've got a health care crisis in America." So what 

  bold policy alternative was offered by the man who wants to be speaker of the 

  House and who is laying the groundwork for his second presidential race? Gephardt 

  mentioned the need to expand health insurance coverage, but then immediately 

  admitted, "I don't have some grand, wise, simple scheme to do it."</p>

<p>For his part, Edwards began with the truism that Democrats 

  "have to be willing to be heard in easy and difficult times." Using almost the 

  same words as Gephardt, Edwards referred to the "looming health care crisis." 

  But in these difficult political times, Edwards, too, grew timorous when it 

  came to the solutions part of the equation. After invoking the Democratic mantra 

  of making "prescription drugs affordable for all Americans," he promptly conceded: 

  "It's not easy. There's no magic solution."</p>

<p>Vermont Gov. Howard Dean &#151; the latest in a line of 

  small-state Democratic governors entranced with the notion that he can catch 

  fire in the primaries &#151; is the would-be contender with nothing to lose. 

  Dean, who will skip Florida to make his pitch at the Minnesota party convention, 

  was the lone Democrat with the moxie to declare, "The first thing we need to 

  do is to roll back those (Bush) tax cuts." But boldness is easy for a little-known 

  candidate fantasizing about somehow wresting the nomination from the likes of 

  Al Gore.</p>

<p>While political soothsaying this far in advance is always 

  a mug's game, it is probable that Bush will still appear virtually unbeatable 

  in early 2004 when the Democrats choose their nominee. What that means is that 

  primary voters are likely to be searching for a candidate who makes them feel 

  good as Democrats, rather than merely judging the field through the prism of 

  who will make the best president. These psychological factors are apt to turn 

  voting in the primaries into a form of self-expression rather than an exercise 

  in political pragmatism. That's why these three factors will loom large in the 

  Democratic race:</p>

<p><b>&#149; Ideology. </b>Left-leaning Democrats, who can 

  be a potent voting bloc in the primaries, may be attracted to Dean's long-shot 

  crusade, Gephardt's pro-union Democratic credentials or the partisan rhetoric 

  of Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry. If he runs, Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman 

  is likely to be the most conservative Democrat in the race.</p>

<p><b>&#149; Gratitude.</b> This is Gore's strong suit, especially 

  among Democrats still snarling "We wuz robbed" over the 2000 election. But Gephardt 

  and Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle may also collect due bills for standing 

  up for party principles in a brutal environment.</p>

<p><b>&#149; Likability. </b>With his Southern charm and boyish 

  good looks, Edwards has the edge as the primary contender most likely to leave 

  Democratic voters smiling. Though Daschle and maybe even Dean could also emerge 

  as the Happy Warriors in the Democratic field.</p>

<p>Yes, it will be a long and winding road to the Iowa caucuses 

  and the New Hampshire primary. But as Democrats begin their warm-up exercises 

  at the starting gate, they should remember that even fleet feet spell defeat 

  if you are running scared.</p>
