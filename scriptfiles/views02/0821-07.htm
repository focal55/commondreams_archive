<p>A few days from now, approximately 60,000 people will arrive in Johannesburg, 

South Africa for the United Nations World Summit on Sustainable Development. 

<p>The Johannesburg Summit is particularly significant because it comes ten years 

after the landmark Earth Summit in Rio, where well-meaning government leaders 

and professional activists actually produced something more than more than hot 

air: Agenda 21, a comprehensive declaration of principles and plan of action for 

guiding the world towards sustainable patterns of development. The Johannesburg 

Summit is billed as a crucial step in fulfilling the potential of Agenda 21, promising 

to identify achievable short-term goals and establish concrete plans for their 

achievement. 

<p>Certainly the need for sustainable development is more obvious than ever. The 

excesses of short-sighted industrialization and overconsumption have thrown the 

Earth dangerously out of balance, with catastrophic climate shifts and shortages 

of natural resources promising massive famine, disease, and social unrest in coming 

decades. The cloud of toxic pollution two miles high which now shrouds southern 

Asia from Afghanistan to Sri Lanka is a gruesome exclamation point on the state 

of the planet and many of its inhabitants. 

<p>However, even if one dismisses critics who portray the Johannesburg Summit 

as a vast self-congratulatory talking shop, there is no question that the organizers 

and attendees are guilty of either shamefully poor taste or nauseating hypocrisy. 

<p>Southern Africa is on the brink of what has been described as the worst humanitarian 

crisis in a decade. According to the World Health Organization, between twelve 

and fourteen million in people face starvation in the next several months; famine 

looms over Malawi, Zambia, Lesotho, Swaziland, Mozambique and Zimbabwe. Child 

malnutrition is rising dramatically, disease is rampant, and the nightmare is 

exacerbated by rates of AIDS infection ranging from 13% in Mozambique to 33% in 

Zimbabwe. 

<p>No mention of the famine can be found on the official UN Summit website, nor 

on the site of JOWSCO, the South African logistical managers. United Nations reaction 

has been limited to a tepid memo from UN Secretary General Kofi Annan's chief 

of staff, warning UN delegates not to bring more aides than necessary, as it "could 

be perceived as an obvious waste of personnel and financial resources." 

<p>"We must keep in mind that this conference is taking place in the midst of 

a major food crisis in southern Africa, affecting 13 million people," reads the 

memo. "It would be wise to refrain from excessive levels of hospitality, and any 

event sponsored by the United Nations should be of modest, even frugal, dimensions." 

<p>Such callousness might be expected from a meeting of the World Trade Organization 

or IMF -- but not from the professed defenders of humanity's poor and downtrodden. 

<p>While impending famine is not sufficient reason to halt the Summit -- the crisis 

at least partly results from the absence of sustainable development, and the goals 

of Agenda 21 must be met quickly if future crises are to be averted -- the apparent 

indifference of Summit organizers to the horror surrounding them is unconscionable. 

<p>The United Nations has budgeted $47 million for the Johannesburg Summit. Attendees 

will spend roughly $5,000 apiece on airfare, food, and lodging. All told, more 

than a quarter of a billion dollars will be spent debating the future of sustainable 

development -- and none of it, apparently, will reach the millions of people about 

to starve outside the Summit doors.
