<p> There is a specter haunting the U.S, alienation.  That is detachment from 

social institutions.  Three of these are the family, school and work.



<p>Longer and more intense working days have helped to make family life for 

many more precarious in the U.S.  This trend has increasingly dehumanized 

people.  You don’t have to be a sociologist to see it happening.



<p>People being pushed and pulled on the job can react irrationally to these 

pressures.  Some snap.  Others do a slow burn, harming themselves and their 

families in various ways (using alcohol, illegal drugs, etc.).



<p>In the meantime, public schools can be a breeding ground for alienation.  

Consider the official hype around standardized testing.  Proponents claim 

that it is a valid measurement of student learning.



<p>Many parents, students and teachers think otherwise.  Yet their voices are 

rarely heard versus those who officially support standardized testing.  

Moreover, imagine the disillusionment among students who score poorly on the 

tests.



<p>Expressions of alienation surface at many levels in the U.S.  A century ago 

author Thorstein Veblen understood this.  Today’s popular culture also 

offers a glimpse of how and why U.S. social conditions are anti-human.



<p>Take African-American rappers.  There are those who have voiced an 

alienation born of resistance to social conditions.  I mean the actual 

living conditions of some black people in the U.S.



<p>A report in the New England Journal of Medicine 12 years ago noted that 

“black men in Harlem were less likely to reach the age of 65 than men in 

Bangladesh.”  Meanwhile, skin-color profiling has led to a boom in the 

incarceration of people, disproportionately black and brown, in the U.S.  

The world’s lone superpower has been feverishly locking down its people of 

color, whose labor-power is not much needed in the job market.



<p>Significantly, a white rapper such as Eminem in part draws on some blacks’ 

dissatisfaction with their lack of freedom in the U.S.  Consider his 

criticism of white-skin privilege.  In “White America,” Eminem credits his 

commercial success to his skin color “Let’s do the math/If I was black/I 

would’ve sold half.”



<p>Eminem’s criticism of the nation’s color line can weaken this dehumanizing 

trend by helping to place the issue before the public.  More progressive 

talk (which can lead to progressive action) about the harmful effects of 

color and class in the U.S. could help to break down people’s withdrawal 

from public life, now dominated by big business interests.  Today as before, 

those who are the least free (people of color) define what the term means 

for them, with far-reaching effects.



<p>Meanwhile, mythology of a colorblind society panders to some alienated 

members of the working-class in the U.S. and Europe.  Take Ward Connerly’s 

Racial Privacy Initiative in California, where a fiscal crisis has followed 

a dot-com bust, placing many working-class people in harm’s way.  The RPI is 

an attempt to re-define skin-color differences by officially removing them, 

while leaving intact basic economic inequality between the rulers and the 

ruled.



<p>In Denmark and the Netherlands, dissatisfaction with income inequality 

resulting from market-friendly government policies has partly led to a 

political backlash against immigrants, people of color.  There and in the 

U.S., the economics of racism can alienate some whites from non-whites.  

This trend helps to disunite the working-class as a political force for 

progress, hardly incidental in a market economy.



<p>One thing seems clear.  The concept of alienation is complex, with many 

causes, all of which must be taken very seriously.  People’s constructive 

and destructive responses are proof of that.
