<p>SOMEDAY, PEOPLE will look back at President Bush's environmental 

record and shake their heads in disbelief. This administration has waged a 

relentless war against environmental protections supported by the vast 

majority of Americans.

<P>Maybe folks don't worry all that much about shrinking glaciers. And perhaps 

we can't follow debates about arcane EPA regulations. But in every poll, 

Americans reveal how strongly we desire clean air and water, oppose oil 

drilling and treasure pristine wilderness. If Democrats want to stand for 

something and attract all kinds of voters, they should make the defense of the 

environment one of their guiding principles.

<P>They might start with our national parks. Despite a deluge of protest from 

the public, the Interior Department has decided to permit snowmobiles in 

Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks. (But it banned off-road vehicles 

in Florida's national parks, where brother Jeb Bush, next in the dynastic line,

governs.)

<P>The Clinton presidency left quite a different legacy, which, on a recent 

visit to the Southwest, I had a chance to observe up close.

<P>The first thing I noticed in Zion National Park -- aside from the soaring 

walls of magenta sandstone -- is how well the National Park Service has 

reduced congestion and pollution. As recently as 1999, long lines of cars 

choked the tiny town of Springdale, Utah, right outside the park. Inside Zion, 

cars used to squeeze through the narrow canyon, spewing a haze of pollution 

into the air and filling the cathedral-like walls with sounds of idling motors 

and impatient honking.

<P>No more. Gone are the cars -- their noise, pollution and traffic jams. In 

their place are clean, free shuttle buses that stop every few minutes in 

Springdale and bring you to the visitors' center. From there, propane-fueled 

shuttle buses carry you through the canyon, dropping off enthusiastic 

sightseers and picking up exhausted hikers.

<P>In Bryce Canyon National Park, I discovered yet another oasis of sanity. 

Instead of driving your own car, you take shuttle buses to any of the vista 

points that look down on the park's famous cylindrical spires, carved from the 

rock by erosion and tinted with colors too subtle to name.

<P>The park service has even tamed the congestion and pollution that has 

ruined many a visit to the Grand Canyon. Today, the best way to visit the 

canyon's South Rim is to arrive, park your car, and then just hop on one of 

the frequent shuttles that circle the village and carry visitors to the lodges,

restaurants and laundries.

<P>The park service has mercifully banished cars along the South Rim road as 

well. If you want to enjoy the great chasm's scenic grandeur or hike the 

trails that meander below the South Rim, you simply take one of the frequent 

buses that stop at each vista point and trailhead.

<P>On one hike through a dense forest, I sat on a rock and could actually hear 

the distant roar of the rapids of the Colorado River. In splendid silence, I 

gazed at migrating hawks and watched the changing play of light and shadows as 

the sun moved across the endless sky.

<P>I've only visited a handful of the national parks, but these recent changes,

begun during the Clinton years, reveal how well the National Park Service has 

learned to balance the preservation of our nation's natural wonders with 

public access.

<P>Democrats should wake up and realize that the public's desire for 

environmental protections transcends ideological and political allegiances.

<P>Snowmobiles in the Yellowstone and Grand Teton parks? Future generations 

will be flabbergasted. I already am.</P>
