<p>THE BUSH administration's plan for preemptive war against Iraq so flagrantly 

violates both international law and common morality that we need a real national 

debate.

<P>The discussion should begin with the recognition that an attack on Iraq would 

constitute an attack on the Charter of the United Nations, since the United States 

would then be in violation of several provisions, beginning with Article 1, Section 

4, which states: ''All members shall refrain in their international relations 

from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political 

independence of any state... ''</P>

<P>But let us suppose that international law should not stand in the way when 

extraordinary circumstances demand immediate violent action. Such circumstances 

would exist if there were, in the language of our own Supreme Court, a ''clear 

and present danger'' represented by the Iraqi regime of Saddam Hussein. </P>

<P>There are facts and there are conjectures about Iraq. The facts: This regime 

is unquestionably tyrannical; it invaded a neighboring country 12 years ago; it 

used chemical weapons against Kurdish rebels 15 years ago. The conjectures: Iraq 

may have biological and chemical weapons today. It may possibly be on the way 

to developing one nuclear weapon. </P>

<P>But none of these facts or conjectures, even if true, make Iraq a clear and 

present danger. The fact that Iraq is a tyranny would not, in itself, constitute 

grounds for preemptive war. There are many tyrannies in the world, some kept in 

power by the United States. Saudi Arabia is only one example. That Iraq has cruelly 

attacked its Kurdish minority can hardly be a justification for war. After all, 

the United States remained silent, and indeed was a supporter of the Iraqi regime, 

when it committed that act. Turkey killed thousands of its Kurds, using US weapons.</P>

<P>Furthermore, other nations which killed hundreds of thousands of their own 

people (Indonesia, Guatemala) not only were not threatened with war, but received 

weapons from the United States.</P>

<P>Iraq's history of invading Kuwait is matched by other countries, among them 

the United States, which has invaded Vietnam, Cambodia, Grenada, and Panama. True, 

Iraq may possess, may be developing ''weapons of mass destruction.'' But surely 

the possession of such weapons, if not used, does not constitute a clear and present 

danger justifying war. </P>

<P>Other nations have such weapons. Israel has nuclear weapons. Pakistan and India 

have nuclear weapons and have come close to using them. And what country has by 

far the largest store of weapons of mass destruction in the world? And has used 

them with deadly consequences to millions of people: in Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Southeast 

Asia? </P>

<P>There is the issue of weapons inspection. Iraq insists on certain conditions 

before it will allow inspections to resume. Secretary of State Colin Powell told 

the Senate Foreign Relations Committee earlier this year that ''inspectors have 

to go back in under our terms, under no one else's terms.'' One might ask if the 

United States would ever allow its biological, chemical, and nuclear facilities 

to be inspected, under any terms. Is there one moral standard for Iraq and another 

for the United States? </P>

<P>Before Sept. 11 there was not the present excited talk about a strike on Iraq. 

Why would that event change the situation? There is no evidence of any connection 

between Iraq and that act of terrorism. Is it possible that the Bush administration 

is using the fear created by Sept. 11 to build support for a war on Iraq that 

otherwise has no legitimate justification? </P>

<P>The talk of war has raised the question of American casualties, and rightly 

so. Are the lives of our young people to be expended in the dubious expectation 

that the demise of Saddam will bring democracy to Iraq? And what of the inevitable 

death of thousands of Iraqis, - all of them made doubly victims - first of Saddam, 

then of Bush? Shall we add a new death toll to the hundreds of thousands of Iraqis 

(the figures are from the UN) who have died since the application of sanctions? 

</P>

<P>A war against Iraq has no logical connection to the tragic events of Sept. 

11. Rather than diminishing terrorism, such an attack would further inflame anger 

against the United States and may well lead to more terrorist attacks. We have 

a right to wonder if the motive for war is not stopping terrorism but expanding 

US power and controlling Mideast oil.</P>

<P>A preemptive war against Iraq, legally impermissible, morally unpardonable, 

would be a cause for shame to future generations. Let the debate begin, not just 

in Congress, but throughout the nation.</P>
