<p>LONDON</b> </a> The human rights situation in Iraq is being invoked with unusual 

frequency by some Western political leaders to justify military action. This selective 

attention to human rights is nothing but a cold and calculated manipulation of 

the work of human rights activists.

<p>These same governments turned a blind eye to Amnesty International's reports 

of widespread human rights violations in Iraq before the Gulf War. They remained 

silent when thousands of unarmed Kurdish civilians were killed in Halabja in 1988.

<p>Not only have the people of Iraq continued to suffer at the hands of the government 

- torture, extrajudicial execution, &quot;disappearances,&quot; arbitrary detention 

and unfair trial - they have also borne the brunt of the United Nations sanctions 

regime since 1990. Sanctions have jeopardized the right to food, health, education 

and, in many cases, life of hundreds of thousands of individuals, many of them 

children.

<p>There are claims that the Iraqi government is deliberately manipulating the 

sanctions regime for propaganda purposes - but that does not absolve the UN Security 

Council from its share of the responsibility for failing to heed the calls to 

lift all sanctions provisions that result in grave violations of the rights of 

the Iraqi population. As the Security Council deliberates on the use of military 

force, it must consider not only the security and political consequences of its 

action but also the inevitable human rights and humanitarian toll of war: civilians 

who will be killed by bombing or internal fighting, children who will die because 

sanctions make access to basic necessities and humanitarian assistance even harder.

<p>Concern for the lives and security of the Iraqi people is sorely missing from 

the debate, not to mention the knock-on effects on the human rights of the people 

of neighboring countries. As the keeper of international peace and security, the 

Security Council has responsibility under the UN Charter to seek a solution through 

peaceful means first. It must remind its most powerful member that force is the 

last resort and only to be applied in full compliance with international law. 

Have we really reached that point of imminent danger which leaves no other choice?

<p>The United Nations was created to preserve peace and promote human rights, 

not to encourage war.
