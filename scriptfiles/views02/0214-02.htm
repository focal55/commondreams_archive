THERE IS one thing you can say about the epic struggle that consumed the House of Representatives into the night. It was not Armageddon.

<p> That is the provocative word that leaked out from behind the closed doors of the House Republican caucus a few days ago. It is the term Speaker Dennis Hastert \{R-Ill.) used to describe what his party believes is the real danger of enacting the Shays-Meehan bill to regulate the financing of campaigns: The legislation, which would shut the spigot of unlimited and unregulated "soft money" to campaigns, could bring an end to Republican control of the House, the speaker warned. So he and his lieutenants set about to stop it.

<p> Hastert can thank that most generous congressional friend, Enron's Kenneth Lay, for giving the reform measure its final push forward. Last night, the legislation was struggling to survive the gauntlet of amendments offered to weaken it. 

<p> There is much talk of what a breakthrough it would be to get the unlimited soft money given by corporations, wealthy individuals and unions out of the political system. Courageous is one word the politicians are applying to themselves. Moral is another. Even in a city of overstatement, these are whoppers.

<p> I have nothing against the reformers. But there's nothing they've proposed that will get special-interest money out of politics. It is not only because the crafty will exploit new loopholes from whatever regulations replace the old.

<p> A recent study by the U.S. Public Interest Research Group shows, for example, that nearly two-thirds of the political donations given by Enron and Arthur Andersen since the 1990 election cycle weren't soft money at all. They were "hard-money" contributions - the supposedly good kind.

<p> Under the reform legislation, the limits on "hard-money" donations, now $1,000, would likely be doubled to $2,000. Congress would curb its unhealthy habits by cutting out the ice cream, while taking two slices of pie.

<p> With the higher limits, Ken and Linda Lay would have been able to give $975,000 in hard money to various candidates and parties since the 1990 cycle, according to U.S. PIRG. That's about $100,000 more than the couple actually did give through a combination of hard- and soft-money donations.

<p> Higher limits would mean the highly paid Enron executives and their spouses who were not-so-gently pressured by Lay to give to George W. Bush in 1999 at the start of his presidential campaign - when early money was urgently needed - could be dunned for twice as much. Who among them would refuse to pony up?

<p> And who, among you, would have a spare $2,000 to kick in and even up the score?

<p> I do not doubt the honesty of the reformers, nor the legitimacy of their zeal. When your workplace is the go-along, get-along labyrinth of corridors and hideaways that is the U.S. Capitol, you do not become anyone's hero by blowing the place up.

<p> Rep. Christopher Shays' (R-Conn.) career will forever be burdened by the quiet acts of retribution that are the precision weapons in a party leadership's arsenal. As for Rep. Marty Meehan (D-Mass.), the pols back home were so thankful for the national attention and measure of respect he brought their state that they threatened, for a time, to redistrict him right out of his seat.

<p> It is not their fault reform is more of an eye tuck than a facelift. It is ours.

<p> You cannot read a poll or sit in on a focus group of average voters and not hear the disgust. Voters, correctly, blame the campaign-finance system for Congress's perennial failure to get the people's business done. They know it is why there is no bill of rights for HMO patients. They know it is why there is no Medicare prescription drug benefit and no relief, still, for the millions with no health insurance at all. They know it is why there has not even been an extension of unemployment benefits in the midst of recession.

<p> They know money talks. But the only way to silence it is to get the corporate interests completely out - and the public interest in. There is only one way to do that: Public financing of campaigns.

<p> If you want a government by the people and for the people, then the people have to pay the bill. Otherwise, the favors will flow right back to those who've actually picked up the tab.
