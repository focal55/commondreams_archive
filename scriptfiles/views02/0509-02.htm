<p>Myths are stubborn things. This is especially true in Washington, headquarters of the political mythology industry.

<p>For decades, taxpayers have spent billions of dollars on a farm-subsidy program that is supposed to fulfill a moral duty to save family farmers. Nevertheless, as the cash sluiced out to the fields, the number of family farms has dwindled inexorably downward.

<p>A Star Wars-like missile-defense program survives year after year. It has not yet met performance standards most of us expect of the family sedan. The mythology that keeps it alive is more powerful than the facts.

<p>Another Washington myth is that individuals investing on their own will enjoy a better life in retirement than their stodgy old parents, who wouldn't know a stock from a savings bond.

<p>This myth survived the meltdown of the Enron 401(k) plan. It survives the growing scandal in the accounting industry, with its extravagant book-cooking and cover-ups. It may survive even the expos&#233; from New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer's investigation of Wall Street analysts. These are the people whose job is to give investors - these future retirees who intend to do so well - unbiased advice.

<p>These analysts are a wretched group. According to e-mail that they thought would remain private, they have a habit of promoting a stock as fit for purchase by the plebes while deriding the same issue as "a piece of crap" among themselves.

<p>One Merrill Lynch analyst worried that ordinary investors "are losing their retirement" because of the firm's foul advice. Tough luck. Fat commissions and investment-banking business for the firm won the day.

<p>The companies might be crooked, the accountants corrupt. The Wall Street analysts who rely on books rigged by cynical corporate chieftains and their crafty accountants aren't straight shooters. They are rapacious spinners.

<p>This is the crowd we are supposed to trust to help us to a secure retirement.

<p>That has been the foundation of pension policy for the last two decades. During that time, the 401(k) has become the pension plan of choice, as employers eschewed traditional defined-benefit pensions that guarantee a monthly income for retirees, but higher costs for companies. The president proposes to privatize Social Security, saying individuals on their own can gain greater wealth than they would otherwise get in a monthly check.

<p>With the run-up in stock prices, everyone was eager to jump into the fun. So what if some numbers turned out to be funny?

<p>Now the first 401(k) generation is nearing retirement. So Edward N. Wolff, a New York University economist, decided to see if running with the bulls is the route to riches.

<p>He thought, given the stock boom of the 1980s and 1990s, that it would be. He was wrong.

<p>Wolff examined expected retirement wealth among those 47 to 64 - which he defined as Social Security income, traditional pension income and money in contributory plans such as a 401(k)s - between 1983 and 1998. Only those whose net worth already was above $500,000 gained in retirement wealth. For everyone else, it fell.

<p>The proportion of individuals who can expect to replace half their income in retirement fell sharply, according to Wolff, whose study recently was published by the Economic Policy Institute. And more people will be unable to generate enough retirement income to stay above the poverty line.

<p>The government spends $60 billion a year subsidizing 401(k) contributions through tax breaks. Like all subsidies, this one was meant to promote virtue: fatter nest eggs, freedom from want in old age. Like many tax breaks, it has increased wealth for the already wealthy.

<p>Is this what we want from our pension policy? It is, anyway, how lawmakers have fashioned it. Their love affair with pension-savings subsidies is starting to resemble their lust for farm payments. The ardor is based more on myth than measurable fact. They should not be allowed to do for tomorrow's retirees what they've done for the family farm.
