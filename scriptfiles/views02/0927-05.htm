<p>HIS TELEGRAPHED war on Iraq belongs on a cineplex trailer. ''An obedient son, 

mopping the floor for his father (1991 clip of fleeing remnants of the Republican 

Guard) ... a defense secretary trying to annihilate the 1960s (clip of Kent State) 

... a secretary of state frozen out in a Cabinet Cold War (clip of a black man 

being passed by taxi cabs) ... a vice president who has not been seen since the 

Florida recount (clip of an empty chair) ... a security adviser who could scare 

Cleopatra Jones out of her Afro (blaxploitation clip of Jones gunning down criminals). 

<P> 

<P>''Four men. One woman. Five visions. Brash. Bellicose. Blind with ambition. 

Bound by their hatred of the Axis of Evil. Their mission: to drive a madman away 

from critical oil supplies for sport utility vehicles. Which one of them will 

go mad first?</P>

<P>''Coming on Christmas Day: `Regime Change.' Directed by Martin Scorcheasy. 

Special effects by George Nukas. Special rap by JA Rule (John Ashcroft). Special 

reunion soundtrack of Michael Jackson and the all-star cast who sang to end famine 

in Ethiopia in 1985: `I am the world, Who needs the UN? I am the one to make a 

brighter day, so let's bomb Baghdad.'</P>

<P>''Starring George W.W. (World War) Bush. Costarring Donald ''Weapons of Mass 

Destruction'' Rumsfeld. His credible evidence is so incredible no one gives it 

credibility; costarring Colin ''Reluctant First Striker'' Powell and Dick Cheney. 

He'll kick your posterior - if you can find him; And introducing Condoleezza Rice. 

Never tell her you will do nothing.'' </P>

<P>One person who might not have given this flick four stars was James Thomson. 

Thomson, who died this summer at the age of 70, was the curator for the Nieman 

Foundation for Journalism at Harvard University from 1972 to 1984. In the 1960s, 

Thomson was an Asian foreign policy adviser in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations.</P>

<P>Thomson was noteworthy for being an early dissenter from President Johnson's 

mass destruction in Vietnam and for wanting better relations with China. Thomson 

quit in 1966. </P>

<P>Two years later, Thomson wrote ''How Could Vietnam Happen?'' in the Atlantic 

Monthly. Much of that essay, which won an Overseas Press Club award, applies to 

the push by President Bush to mount an attack Iraq.</P>

<P>''The key here is domestic politics; the need to sell the American people, 

press, and Congress on support for an unpopular and costly war in which the objectives 

themselves have been in flux,'' Thomson wrote. </P>

<P>''Once you have said that the American Experiment itself stands or falls on 

the Vietnam outcome, you have thereby created a national stake far beyond any 

other stakes. Crucial throughout the process of Vietnam decision making was a 

conviction among many policy makers that Vietnam posed a fundamental test of America's 

national will.... These are not men who can be asked to extricate themselves from 

error.''</P>

<P>''There is a final result of Vietnam policy,'' he wrote, that ''holds potential 

danger for the future of American foreign policy: the rise of a new breed of American 

ideologues who see Vietnam as the ultimate test of their new doctrine. I have 

in mind those men in Washington who have given a new life to the missionary impulse 

in American foreign relations, who believe that this nation, in this era, has 

received a threefold endowment that can transform the world. As they see it, that 

endowment is composed of, first, our unsurpassed military might, second, our clear 

technological supremacy, and third, our allegedly invincible benevolence (our 

`altruism,' our affluence, our lack of territorial aspirations).</P>

<P>''Together, it is argued, this threefold endowment provides us with the opportunity 

and the obligation to ease the nations of the earth toward modernization and stability, 

toward a full-fledged Pax Americana Technocratica. In reaching for this goal, 

Vietnam is viewed as the last and crucial test. Once we have succeeded there, 

the road ahead is clear.''</P>

<P>Today, Bush tells us that Iraq is the crucial test. With a sagging economy 

and surrounded by ideologues, he is succumbing to the missionary impulse. If he 

cannot get Osama bin Laden's devil horns to hang over his mantle, Saddam Hussein's 

will do just fine, even though Hussein, regardless of his own evils, has not been 

tied to the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.</P>

<P>''What can be said of the men `in charge?''' Thomson asked. ''It is patently 

absurd to suggest that they produced such tragedy by intention and calculation. 

But it is neither absurd nor difficult to discern certain forces at work that 

caused decent and honorable men to do great harm.'' </P>
