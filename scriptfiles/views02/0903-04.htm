<p>MARY ROBINSON, United Nations high commissioner for human rights, will step 

down from her position on Sept. 11.<b> </b> The date is ironic for more than its 

obvious symbolism, as much criticism of Robinson has stemmed from her questioning 

of the US war against terrorism. Despite the difficulty of heading an underfunded 

human rights commission in a vast international organization, Robinson has managed 

to be an outspoken advocate for human rights worldwide.

</table>Appointed in 1997, Robinson's positions have drawn backlash from such countries 

as Israel, Russia, and the United States. She has repeatedly criticized the Israeli 

occupation of Palestinian territories, sparking Israeli officials to declare Robinson 

biased. Following a visit to Chechnya in 2000, Robinson released a report to the 

UN Human Rights Commission that resulted in the censuring of Russia, one of only 

five permanent members of the UN Security Council, for violating human rights 

there.<b> </b> </P>

<P>Since last Sept. 11, Robinson, a former president of Ireland, has expressed 

concern over the potential loss of human rights in the war against terror. In 

a Jan. 6 speech at the John F. Kennedy Library, Robinson said, ''If human rights 

are respected ... conflict, terrorism and war can be prevented.'' This assertion 

garnered harsh criticism from US officials. Yet Robinson's desire to focus on 

the fundamental causes of terrorism demonstrated her commitment to its eradication.</P>

<P>Robinson later condemned US detention of terrorist suspects without detainee 

indictments, citing the need for ''translating intelligence information into evidence 

that is acceptable in courts of law.'' She called for support of human rights 

despite the climate of fear, stating that, ''even in the case of prolonged terrorism, 

the protection of human rights requires international oversight.'' Robinson's 

willingness to challenge the Bush administration, at a time when so few would 

for fear of seeming unpatriotic, is laudable.</P>

<P>The position of high commissioner is a difficult one. Arthur C. Helton, senior 

fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, says human rights advocates have been 

pleased with Robinson's efforts, but adds that even her ''ardent voice became 

lost in the bureaucracy'' of the United Nations. Despite the inherent frustrations 

of the position, the next high commissioner should uphold Robinson's legacy of 

agitation, continuing to challenge powerful countries others have shied away from, 

such as Russia and the United States.</P>

<P>Human rights can always be bettered; challenges of government malfeasance can 

be nothing but positive, as they highlight abuse and instigate reform. The heated 

criticism Robinson has received only underscores how well she fulfilled her mission.</P>
