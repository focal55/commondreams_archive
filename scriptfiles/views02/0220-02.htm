This is the part of the column that is not made up -- or in Defense 

Department-speak, it is "white" information:

<P>The Pentagon has created (and is funding with millions of taxpayers' bucks) 

the Office of Strategic Influence whose mission it is to crank out extra 

special U.S. war propaganda. As the New York Times, which broke this story 

Tuesday, described it, the office plans to expand its scope to "provide news 

items, possibly even false ones, to foreign media organizations as part of a 

new effort to influence public sentiment and policymakers in both friendly and 

unfriendly countries . . ."

<P>The Office of Strategic Influence is headed by Brig. Gen. Simon Worden, an 

astrophysicist and 27-year veteran of the U.S. Air Force.

<P>War-words wars -- or propaganda -- are nothing new. From Voice of America 

broadcasts to the carpet-bombing-by-pamphlet of Afghanistan, the United States 

has recognized a key military tenet: information, true or fabricated, can be a 

powerful part of a fight. For the past 30 years, however, we've pretty much 

confined the dissemination of untrue verbiage -- "black" information in DOD-

speak -- to our enemies.

<P>Why? Well, believe it or not, it's actually illegal for such entities as 

the CIA and the Pentagon to propagandize in the United States. But technology 

has turned the planet into a global village, so it's no longer possible to 

keep a false story that's been fed to some foreign news agency or government 

official from being picked up and used by U.S. news outlets. Care must be 

taken.

<P>If the Bush administration OKs the expansion plans of the Office of 

Strategic Influence (and who imagines it won't?), distinctions disappear. 

"Friendlies" as well as "unfriendlies" (more DOD-speak) will be fair game for 

true or false info.

<P>Already the Pentagon has hired a private ad firm that specializes in 

propaganda for the Middle East. According to Pentagon officials quoted in the 

N.Y. Times, the OSI also would hire other companies to "help develop 

information programs and evaluate their effectiveness using the same 

techniques as American political campaigns, including scientific polling and 

focus groups . . ."

<P>So, this is the part of the column that (so far) is made up:

<P>"Good morning, Gen. Worden. You wanted to see me?"

<P>Yes, lieutenant. I'm not too happy with your brief on our latest campaign.

<P>"Which part, sir? The Afghan focus group, the fake news story in Iraq or 

the polling in Somalia?"

<P>All three. Take this focus group feedback: "I really don't like it when 

your bombs accidentally wipe out half my village." Or, "Could someone please 

explain again the difference between collateral damage and just plain 

killing?" Didn't anybody have anything positive to say?

<P>"Well, they all liked the free food, sir. Especially the sushi."

<P>(Expletive.) Never mind. What's the problem in Iraq?

<P>"It looks like nobody's buying that e-mail blitz we did as the 'Concerned 

Citizens for a Saddam-less Iraq.' Not one radio station or newspaper picked up 

on it. Two guys from a Dutch cable channel showed up at the Baghdad protest 

rally, but it turns out they were making a travelogue."

<P>And the polling in Somalia? What's the excuse there?

<P>"We're doing the best we can, sir, to see how limited air strikes might be 

received. But, as you may recall, about 80 percent of Somalis have no phones, 

so we can't exactly get to them during dinner. We're sending teams door-to-

door but, again, given all the wars, a lot of Somalis don't have doors either."

<P>This is ridiculous. We've got to call in the experts or we'll lose this 

propaganda war for sure. Find out right now who does those ads for Mercedes-

Benz and get them on the payroll.

<P>"Mercedes, sir?"

<P>Yes, lieutenant, they speak our language: Perception is not always reality.</p>
