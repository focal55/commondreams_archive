When President George Bush called for a "crusade" against terrorism last fall, 

flustered aides quickly claimed he had misspoken and really didn't mean to invoke 

the medieval Christian invasions of Muslim nations. 

<p>But in his bellicose state of the union speech last week, evangelical Christian 

George Bush left no doubt that a crusade was exactly what he had meant. Better 

a crusade than facing the spreading Enron scandal or explaining away a looming 

deficit brought on by reckless spending. 

<p>Or explaining the mess made by the administration in Afghanistan: spreading 

chaos and warfare; Russia's takeover of the north; full force resumption of heroin 

exports to the U.S. thanks to the overthrow of Taliban; 5,000-plus civilians killed 

by punitive U.S. bombing; murder or inhumane treatment of captured enemy fighters; 

and, of course, the escape of Osama bin Laden and the al-Qaida leadership. 

<p>No matter. Afghanistan, trumpets the White House, was a great military victory 

that will be duplicated against other Muslim malefactors who resist America's 

will. 

<p>Bush proclaimed in Churchillian tones that an 'axis of evil' composed of 'terrorist 

nations' Iraq, Iran, and North Korea threatened the U.S. and the world. This silly, 

simplistic reduction of complex foreign policy issues into comic book terms, and 

Bush's threats of more military action around the world, made good political theatre 

in the U.S., where war fever has been stoked to fever pitch by the White House 

and the all too accommodating American media. 

<p>Interestingly, the most-wanted on America's new hit list - Iraq, Iran, and 

North Korea - just happen to also be top enemies of Israel. (North Korea supplies 

missile components and technology to Israel's Arab foes and Pakistan.) 

<p>A near unanimity of policy and views has developed between the Bush administration's 

super-hawks and Israel's hard right Likud government led by Ariel Sharon. Both 

are intent on liquidating any Muslims who resist, both have declared war on the 

PLO and its chief, Yasser Arafat, both view resistance by Muslims as "terrorism," 

and both disregard international law and UN resolutions. 

<p>In short, Gen. Sharon's iron-fisted policies have become those of George Bush. 

Bush's speech made it disturbingly clear that the U.S. has become the enemy of 

the Muslim world. Muslim nations must either bow to American diktat or be deemed 

hostile. 

<p>White House claims that Iran is a mortal danger to the U.S. because: a) it 

supports Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, and b) is trying to develop limited strategic 

weapons. This shows how disconnected from reality the administration has become, 

and how much its policies are being shaped by parties who do not always place 

America's interests first. 

<p><B>Guerrilla war</B> 

<p>Hezbollah waged a long, dirty guerrilla war against Israel's long occupation 

of southern Lebanon. Israel and its media supporters branded Hezbollah "terrorists." 

But most nations regarded Hezbollah as a legitimate national resistance movement 

fighting to free Lebanon from Israeli occupation, which was repeatedly ruled illegal 

by the UN and in violation of international law. 

<p>Iran helped arm and finance Hezbollah, whose guerrillas were to Iran what the 

Nicaraguan Contras and Afghan "freedom fighters" were to America. To brand Iran 

a "terrorist state" because of its support of a legitimate resistance movement 

is mendacious and Orwellian. 

<p>Iran has opposed U.S. hegemony in the Mideast, sometimes by covert operations. 

But bombings of U.S. military bases, long blamed on Iran, were done by the al-Qaida 

group. Before damning Iran, look at America's own record. 

<p>During WWII, the U.S., Britain, and the USSR invaded Iran, an independent nation. 

In 1953, the U.S. and Britain overthrew Iran's government when it sought to gain 

control of its own oil resources. The U.S. put Shah Mohammed Pahlavi on the throne 

and kept his outrageously corrupt, kleptomaniac regime in power through the army 

and the dreaded U.S. and Israel-trained secret police, SAVAK, which tortured and 

killed tens of thousands of Iranians. 

<p><B>Funding Iraqi military</B> 

<p>After the Shah was overthrown by the 1979 Iranian revolution, the U.S. sent 

Iraq's Saddam Hussein to invade Iran and crush its Islamic government. The U.S. 

secretly supplied Iraq with money, arms, intelligence, and chemical and biological 

weapons. The U.S. shot down an Iranian civilian airliner and waged a naval war 

against Iran in the Gulf. Iraq's invasion cost Iran 250,000 - 500,000 dead. 

<p>The U.S. repeatedly sought to overthrow the Iranian government, even financing 

the terrorist Mujihadin-i-Khalq organization, which assassinated much of Iran's 

leadership with bombs. 

<p>Iran does not yet have nuclear weapons, but is developing medium-ranged missiles 

that may reach Israel. Such weapons, claims Iran, are for self-defense, to counter 

Israel's nuclear/bioware arsenal. Israel has openly threatened Iran with nuclear 

attack. If Iran's missile and strategic weapons program is "terrorism," then Pakistan, 

India, Syria, Israel, Egypt, Taiwan, South Korea, Turkey, and many other nations 

are equally guilty. 

<p>Instead of threatening war against Iran, a nation of 68 million, the U.S. should 

be pressing all Mideast nations - including Israel - to scrap their weapons of 

mass destruction and work for peace in Palestine. The terrible 9/11 attacks were 

the result of America's five decades of policy blunders in the Mideast. The U.S. 

does not need any more enemies.
