<p>The memorial service for Senator Wellstone, his wife Sheila and 

daughter Marcia at the Washington Hebrew Congregation in Washington, DC 

on November 13, 2002 was a fitting and diverse tribute from their two 

sons, Mark and David, Senatorial colleagues, staff and friends.



    <p>With each heartfelt expression, the assemblage understood what 

Senator Tom Daschle meant when he said "so much was lost in that crash."



    <p>Paul and Sheila Wellstone were there always for the poor, the 

homeless, the sick and the defenseless.  They championed justice for 

millions of people and traveled to their places of distress to see their 

plight first-hand.  Senator Wellstone always wanted to see situations 

for himself - in Bosnia, Thailand, Columbia, American prisons.



    <p>Yesterday the Associated Press called me to ask who would take the 

place of Paul Wellstone in the U.S. Senate.  I had no answer because now 

there is no one with his sense of consistent, determined energy on so 

many issues, so many networks, so many strategies.



    <p>Anyone who visited him in his Senate offices was greeted so warmly 

and authentically that it was like coming home.  His phrase -- "Never 

separate the lives you live from the words you speak" is one for the 

book of quotations.  it is also a self-description of Paul and Sheila.



    <p>In the Senate, Wellstone was identified by his support for raising 

the frozen minimum wage, for renewable energy and for opposition to 

corporate lobbyists who demand corporate welfare, tax escapes (to 

Bermuda tax havens), and lax enforcement of the corporate crime laws.  

He took on the tobacco companies, the drug companies and the health 

insurance giants.



    <p>But perhaps Paul and Sheila Wellstone's greatest passion 

was legislation which would give mental health patients health insurance 

parity with those suffering from physical illness.  At the memorial 

service, Republican Senator Pete Domenici, tossed aside his prepared 

remarks to speak about how he met Paul Wellstone at a meeting of mental 

health advocates.  His affection for the Minnesota Senator was apparent 

when he vowed that the parity bill he and Wellstone have co-authored 

would be enacted by the Congress next year and would be known as "the 

Paul Wellstone memorial mental health parity law."



    <p>Senator Wellstone's desk in the Senate is now shrouded in black.  

His Senate colleagues unanimously passed legislation to apply $10 

million to establish the Paul and Sheila Wellstone Center for Community 

Building in St. Paul, Minnesota.



    The Wellstones understood to their core the meaning of Jean Monnet's 

words -- "Without people nothing is possible, but without institutions 

nothing is lasting."  The essence of community is the banding together 

of people to do for themselves and posterity what they could not do 

alone -- both in the civic society and in government.



      

<p>The last bill Paul Wellstone introduced was S.3143, known as the consumer and 

shareholder protection association. It was legislation that would facilitate through 

inserts in mailings of large publicly traded corporations, including financial 

institutions, invitations to their customers to join together voluntarily in non-profit 

associations that would defend their interests. (for full text see <a href="http://www.essential.org" target="_new">essential.org</a>). 

<p>The corporate crime wave and the looting of the pensions and 401ks 

of millions of Americans losing trillions of dollars worried Wellstone.  

He wanted to help build institutions of investor and consumer influence 

to prevent recurrences in the future.



    <p>After the fatal airplane crash, commentators were awed by 

the outpouring of praise for Wellstone by friends and adversaries

alike.  

<p>What was it about this politician that led his strongest opponents in 

the Congress to weep when they heard the news?  Certainly, it was his 

friendly personality and his personal interest in their own family 

tragedies.  They all had a Paul Wellstone story dear to their heart.  

But it was mainly what Senator Daschle called the rarest of traits -- 

"his moral courage."  Something  maybe they had wished on themselves 

long ago.



    <p>Garrison Keillor commemorated Wellstone in his nationally syndicated 

public radio program with these words: "Paul Wellstone identified 

passionately with people at the bottom, people in trouble, people in the 

rough.  He was an old-fashioned Democrat who felt more at home with the 

rank and file than with the rich and famous."



    <p>At the short end of some 99 to 1 of 95 to 5 votes in the Senate, 

Wellstone's problem was that he did not have enough "old-fashioned 

Democrats" with him in the Senate.  There may come a time when his 

statement that "politics is not about power; it is about people" will 

attract many more dedicated adherents throughout the land.</p>
