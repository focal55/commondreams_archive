<p>All that rises also falls. So it is in the natural world and human institutions. 

The slide in the U.S. stock market is an example of the latter. 

<p>The part of the story that’s missing in the mass media generally is the force 

that drove investment to the U.S. stock market in the first place. In brief, it 

was a crisis of overproduction. 

<p>Industry after industry had made more products—autos to computer chips—than 

could be sold for a profit on the market. Market saturation of a particular product 

didn’t happen by itself. The “why” of the story is that the working majority hasn’t 

been able to buy what it has made. 

<p>Accordingly, overproduction reduced profitability for those who buy labor-power. 

No profits, no investment in more productive capacity. The result was lots of 

money with no place to go. 

<p>What to do? The response from the titans of the global market economy was twofold. 

One was that investment migrated from industrial production to financial speculation. 

<p>The other was the destruction of productive capacity. The International Monetary 

Fund and World Bank in part enforced policies that purposely plunged Third World 

and newly industrialized nations into depressions that devastated people’s living 

standards. 

<p>In the meantime, investment seeking profits flowed into the U.S. stock market. 

Want proof? The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 14-fold between Aug. 12, 1982 

and June 5, 2001. 

<p>For some, the good times rolled. That roll is drawing to a close. There are 

many consequences. 

<p>Here’s one. The New York Times of June 21 reported that the value of the dollar 

was at a 24-month low versus the euro. The high value of the greenback has been 

a factor facilitating the flow of foreign funds into the U.S. to help consumers 

and corporations live beyond their means (income versus expenditures). 

<p>This unsustainable trend of U.S. spending based on lending was given a boost 

by the nation's high-flying stock market. Its downturn has cast a cloud of doubt 

on the continuation of investment from abroad into the world’s lone superpower. 

<p>One thing is certain. Having the world’s biggest military doesn’t guarantee 

that a nation’s currency will reign supreme. The rising military might of the 

U.S. and the falling value of the dollar are proof of that. 

<p>James P. Pinkerton, a Newsday columnist, recently noted the criminal actions, 

including “aggressive accounting,” that have battered Wall Street, adding that 

the stock market has more room to fall. He wrote: “And for most Americans mindful 

of their financial future, the real problem is that the bull market of the 1980s 

and 1990s is over.” 

<p>But describing the end of what some have called the speculative boom of all 

time by sidestepping what led to its creation covers up what needs to be covered. 

Namely, that a market economy system based on production to meet the needs of 

investors instead of human needs is the problem for the vast majority of humanity. 

<p>The solution to this problem is a social question. The time for independent 

visions of socio-economic organization is now.</P>
