<p>Obituaries for Philip Berrigan, who died last week at age 79, have tended to emphasize his arrest record. Almost all of them have, for instance, noted that he spent 11 of his last 35 years &#034;behind bars for crimes directed against the military.&#034;

<p>We would debate the use of the word &#034;crimes.&#034; Berrigan, a World War II veteran and former Catholic priest who with his Jesuit brother, Daniel, built a movement in opposition to the Vietnam War, nuclear weapons and U.S. policies in Central America and other parts of the world, was arrested many times for acts of civil disobedience and creative protest.

<p>But the Ploughshares peace movement that the Berrigan brothers and their comrades forged was as nonviolent in its nature as it was in its anti-war goals. Thus Berrigan was hailed not for harming society but for trying very hard to help it get onto a better course.

<p>Philip Berrigan may have spent a good deal of the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s behind bars. But he was a better man than many of the fellows who sat behind the big desk in the Oval Office during those years. And we will mourn his passing especially now, when a lesser man seeks to steer this country toward an unnecessary unilateral war with Iraq.
