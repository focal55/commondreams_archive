<p>Every day I have heard it at least once - the timeless phrase that "life is 

not fair," as if it were an excuse for all problems, or an eternal apology for 

what should have come to pass and, through the incompetence or unwillingness of 

others, never will.

<p> Regardless of the countless repetitions, I will never accept this adage as 

truth.

<p> Mankind is more advanced than at any previous time. We pride ourselves on 

our ability to reason, to draw conclusions and to be able to "make a difference."

<p> When we are young, we are told that we can change the world. How can the idea 

of injustice simply be accepted as an unchangeable fact?

<p> It must change if the human race is to evolve.</p>
