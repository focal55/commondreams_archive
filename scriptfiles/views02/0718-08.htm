<p>In response to more than 25 years of violence and

armed struggle in the province of Aceh, Indonesia, a

group of academics and activists have undertaken the

task of creating a peace education curriculum grounded

in the core Islamic peace beliefs and rooted in the

Acehnese social and cultural values.



<p>Islam, derived from the word salam, peace, is at the

core of its very name, a religion of peace.



<p>Many times miscalculated as a religion of vengeance

and retribution, Islam on a global scale has received defamatory attention in recent times.  Yet its truest practitioners continue to quote the Qu'ran as a book of peacemaking directives.



<p>Inequity, violence and a highly traumatized

population serve as the backdrop for this curriculum

and the accompanying teacher and student trainings.

Many rural Acehnese are under-educated, while the city

of Banda Aceh is experiencing a rapid rate of

urbanization.  These factors contribute to a level of dissatisfaction with the centralized Indonesian government, and cause the Acehnese to become further entrenched in the separatist movement.



<p>In the past year alone more than 600 people have been

killed in Aceh.  Nearly every Acehnese has a story of

witness to violence.  Few are untouched by the bloody

struggle.



<p>For the past three decades, violence has been the

modus operandi for resolving conflicts in Aceh.  The

GAM (Free Aceh Movement) and Indonesian military

routinely and aggressively perpetrate acts of violence

which often catch civilians in the crossfire.  Like

many international conflicts, the blame and

frustration is so deep and the feelings so hot that

this power struggle has assumed a life of its own.



<p>Young people angry at the disparity of wealth and

inaccess to better education and thus a better life

have taken up arms to ameliorate their situation.

Admittedly they recognize that weapons are a quick fix

and permit no long-term solution, but are good tools

for getting revenge and perpetuating the conflict.



<p>Recognizing that violence only perpetuates more

violence, the curriculum team began developing a peace education program for high school-aged students as well as teachers, and over the past year has conducted trainings and workshops which have reached both private and public schools throughout Aceh.



<p>Thus far, the Acehnese academic community, including

students, teachers, administrators and government

officials, have embraced this peace initiative with

open arms.  Led by Director, Dr. Asna Husin, supported

by UNICEF, AusAID, and the

Washington, DC-based non-profit Nonviolence

International, this curriculum seeks to bring an

active, dynamic peace perspective to Aceh so that

future generations of Acehnese need not live under the

same threatening conditions that currently exist.



<p>Six basic principles form the foundation for the

curriculum: Introspection and Sincerity, Rights and Responsibilities, Conflict and Violence, Democracy and Justice, Plurality of Creation, and Paths to Peace. Embedded in the lessons in these chapters are crucial Acehnese proverbs that have superficial as well as deeper meanings for bringing about peace and justice.



<p>Central to the curriculum is the teaching that Allah

desires peace.  It is not enough to have peace just

between the individual and Allah, however.  If there

is injustice or inequality among humans, then Allah is

not satisfied.  Moreover, Islam teaches that peace is

not a receptive, passive condition where only

self-interests are served.  Rather peace is a dynamic

which must be continually refined, redefined and

struggled to achieve.



<p>In achieving peace, humans must examine our wants and

needs.  We all experience social, spiritual, physical

and psychological needs, all of which must be kept in

a rough balance to maintain peace.  Our excessive

wants, however, are often the cause of conflict and

violence because this means that others needs are not

being met.



<p>The peace paradigm this curriculum espouses is one

where Allah encompasses the realms of peace within,

peace in the community, and peace with nature.  The

Aceh peace education curriculum teaches that in Islam,

nature is meant to serve our needs  not our wants.



<p>Therefore, to have peace with Allah and peace between

human beings, we must also respect the peace that

exists in nature and not take advantage of natural

resources which bring great wealth to a few and great

poverty to many.  It is the economic injustices that

are perpetrated at a structural level which cause

tremendous personal violence on an individual level.



<p>In Aceh, peacemaking is not a theory or hypothetical

question to be answered with leisure.  It is an

inventive means for proactively addressing the

systemic, militaristic and interpersonal violence

which disrupt every corner of society.
