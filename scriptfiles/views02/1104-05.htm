<p>When Sen. Paul Wellstone of Minnesota died in a plane crash last week, Senate 

Majority Leader Tom Daschle described him as "the soul of the Senate." United 

Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan described him as "a profoundly decent man, 

a man of principle, a man of conscience." </P>

<P>Which leads to the question: What do you do when your soul dies, and your conscience 

goes away? </P>

<P>It's a personal question for me. Paul was my mentor and hero. My 20-plus-year 

career as a community organizer and political activist started as a four-year 

"Wellstone groupie" at Carleton College in Minnesota in 1979. My best friend from 

Carleton, Jeff Blodgett, ran all three of Paul's U.S. Senate campaigns. Now I 

see images of Jeff and his wife and child on television and in the newspaper, 

sobbing and describing Paul's demise as "unthinkable." The personal is political, 

and it hurts deeply. </P>

<P>The death of a hero makes you think a lot about what is worth fighting for. 

Paul was an unlikely senator. Not because he was unlikable; in fact, he was warm 

and personable and funny and well-loved. But because the type of political change 

he longed for was so fundamental, and he spoke his mind, passionately. </P>

<P>As a freshman at Carleton, in 1980, I recall having lunch with him as he angrily 

described the problems his mother, Minnie, a high school cafeteria worker, had 

getting decent health insurance. A decade later, in 1994, he was a U.S. senator, 

at the center of the national health care debate. That battle, like so many big 

ones Paul fought for as a senator, ended unsuccessfully. </P>

<P>One of Paul's favorite ways of analyzing a political question was to ask: "Who 

benefits, and who loses?" The insurance companies won that fight, and working 

Americans continue to lose as the costs of health insurance soar and more poor 

families lose coverage. </P>

<P>Paul, who taught classes on protest politics, once told me he yearned to help 

start one more movement before he died. On the face of it, Paul did not get his 

wish. He was a pragmatist who carved out some compromise legislative victories 

on issues he cared about . But he felt like his major role in the U.S. Senate 

was to serve as the loyal opposition. </P>

<P>He started his career at Carleton as an anti-war activist professor whom the 

college administration tried to fire. He ended his Senate career as the only Democrat 

running for re-election who opposed the resolution for war with Iraq. </P>

<P>Had he lived two more weeks, he may have lost his Senate seat for that vote. 

</P>

<P>He spoke, and voted, his conscience. With his voice silenced, I feel even more 

powerless as America seems to march needlessly toward war. </P>

<P>Look below the surface, though, and Paul did get his wish. He did help start 

a movement: the kind that survives him and will continue to flourish. As a college 

professor and activist, Paul personally and deeply inspired thousands of people 

to act on their beliefs about justice. Many became professional activists. </P>

<P>Here's one local example of the "Wellstone effect." After moving to Oregon 

in 1990, I led organizing campaigns that resulted in a permanent surcharge on 

electric bills for low-income energy assistance, a permanent down-payment assistance 

fund for Portland low-income homebuyers, and a temporary business income tax in 

Multnomah County that prevented a few years of budget cuts in pubic schools, mostly 

by targeting large out-of-state corporations that had enjoyed unprecedented tax 

cuts. I know none of these things would have happened had I not known Paul. Each 

of those campaigns used the classic Wellstone techniques of tireless organizing 

and what he called "building indignation" to force changes among the haves to 

benefit the have-nots. More important, what I learned from Paul was my motivation. 

As with so many others, Paul and his ideas are at the core of my conscience. </P>

<P>Heroes die, but conscience lives on. It is always there, at the core of us, 

needing a voice like Paul's to call it into action. If you make a list of what 

those taught and inspired by Paul accomplished, and will accomplish in the future, 

he got exactly the kind of movement he yearned for. </P>
