LESS THAN four months after the Sept. 11 terror attacks, U.S. forces have Osama bin Laden on the run and George W. Bush's administration is earning praise for conducting "a new kind of warfare" in Afghanistan.



<p>The question now is whether Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld will seize this moment of widespread public support to restructure U.S. forces for the challenges of the future or whether he will abandon the administration's stated commitment to military reform in pursuit of enormous increases in his department's budget. Unfortunately, if Rumsfeld's boss has anything to say about it, the campaign to cut unnecessary weapons programs may become an unintended casualty of the war on terrorism.



<p>In early December, Bush gave a speech at the Citadel designed to "set out the commitments essential to victory in our war against terror." It was a homecoming of sorts for Bush, who gave his first major address on defense policy at the Citadel more than two years earlier at the outset of his campaign for the presidency.



<p>Most news coverage of the second speech focused on the president's pledge to move beyond the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, a promise he fulfilled two days later when he formally notified Russian President Vladimir Putin that the United States would withdraw from the agreement. But another striking element of the president's presentation was barely commented upon. Despite his assertion that the war on terrorism demands that we think differently about how best to defend the United States, Bush studiously avoided the most forward-looking element of his earlier speech at the Citadel.



<p>A central theme of Bush's first Citadel speech was the need to move beyond a military force "organized for Cold War threats" in which there is "almost no relationship between our budget priorities and a strategic vision." To achieve this transformation, Bush argued for a shift toward weapons systems characterized "not by mass or size, but by mobility and swiftness." In order to make this happen, Bush spoke of the need to "skip a generation of technology."



<p>Pursuant to the speech, Bush advisers started raising critical questions. Did the United States really need to spend $350 billion over the next two decades on three new combat aircraft - the F-22, the F-18E/F, and the Joint Strike Fighter? Did the 70-ton Crusader, billed as the Army's artillery system for the 21st century, meet the requirements for speed, mobility and ease of transport set out in Bush's new defense vision? Should the Navy continue to spend money on Cold War-style ships such as a new heavy destroyer and a next-generation attack submarine?



<p>Unfortunately, the notion of cutting back current programs to make way for new concepts soon fell by the wayside, primarily due to lobbying by the military services, major contractors and members of Congress with vested political interests in systems built in their states or districts. As a result, there was no talk of skipping a generation of technology in the president's most recent speech at the Citadel, nor have any of these systems been canceled in the administration's fiscal year 2002 budget, which recently passed Congress.



<p>In the meantime, ballistic-missile defense, an unproved and provocative program that has more to do with unilateralist ideology than carefully considered defense priorities, will receive a $2.5-billion increase, up to $7.8 billion this year. By contrast, new spending on the unmanned aerial vehicles that have been a critical element of the air war in Afghanistan will increase by only one-tenth that amount, or $250 million.



<p>With tens of billions of dollars tied up in expensive Cold War relics, the only way to make room for investments in the systems the president claims are most urgently needed will be to ratchet up Pentagon spending at rates not seen since the first term of Ronald Reagan's administration. Counting the $20 billion in emergency funds provided to the Pentagon after Sept. 11, military spending for the coming year will be at least $363 billion, a $54-billion increase over last year.



<p>Only a small fraction of this funding - including the roughly $1 billion-a-month cost of the war in Afghanistan and the new investments in unmanned aerial vehicles and "smart" bombs - is even remotely related to the war on terrorism. 



<p>Instead of seizing this historic moment to set new defense priorities, the Bush administration appears to be doing exactly what candidate Bush promised not to do - funding two military strategies at once, one for the Cold War and one for the future.



<p>That's great news for weapons manufacturers such as Boeing, Raytheon and Lockheed Martin, but it's an incredibly wasteful way to finance national defense.



<p>Before he submits his military budget request to Congress later this month, Bush should reread his original speech at the Citadel and recommit his administration to the urgent task of reforming the Pentagon budget.
