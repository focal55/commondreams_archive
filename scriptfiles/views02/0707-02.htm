<p>The recent ruling by a federal appeals court in San Francisco to ban the recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance in schools -- claiming the phrase ''one nation under God'' violates separation of church and state -- wasn't nearly as interesting as the public's reaction to it.</p>

<p>Within seconds, politicians of both stripes were falling all over one another to prove how devout they were by decrying the ruling and to use it as a way to make political hay against opponents. Ordinary citizens responded in white-lipped outrage, as if the judges had ruled that all schoolchildren henceforth must paint themselves blue and sacrifice virgins on the playground during lunch.</p>

<p>People acted as though the very pursuit of religious life in America was under siege -- an absurd notion, given there are churches on every corner in this country, our current highest-elected official publicly proclaims he is ''saved'' and politicians of both camps increasingly use the subject of faith to garner votes.</p>

<p>The irony is that public outrage over the ruling -- which has already been put on hold by the judge who wrote the majority opinion and is almost certain to be reversed -- comes at a time when we are at war with extremists who -- ostensibly -- want to turn the whole world into one big theocracy, who will kill for the ultimate goal of no dividing line between church and state.</p>

<p>The thing is -- and I write this as a person of faith -- that having children daily repeat ''one nation under God'' is no more a solution to the ills that plague this country or world than is posting a copy of the Ten Commandments in every classroom, another simplistic cure that is often promoted. Children grow into decent, law-abiding, compassionate human beings if they are raised with love, respect and discipline, not because they recite a rote reference to God every morning. And the bedrock principles of this country -- justice, fairness, dignity -- don't depend on third-graders making references to monotheism.</p>

<p>My grandfather used to say, ''The Devil likes to get dressed up and go to church on Sunday.'' Embedded in that old saying is a cautionary tale about the dangers inherent in public piety, in the easy oaths and proclamations that too often masquerade as true faith, true charity.</p>

<p>In San Antonio alone last year, 21,000 people were homeless, half of them families with children. Corporate mandarins at places such as WorldCom and Enron steal millions (even with ''In God We Trust'' emblazoned on our dollar bills!) in a country where wealth is increasingly becoming concentrated in the hands of the few. At any one time, one out of three young African-American males is in prison, jail, on probation or parole. More than 40 million Americans have no health insurance. Right now, human beings are dropping like flies from AIDS in China and Africa, and all over the world children go to bed hungry.</p>

<p>Too bad folks can't work up a head of outrage over that.</p>
