<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->Under fire from members of the GOP for his praise of Sen. Strom Thurmond&#146;s (R-South Carolina) campaign comments favoring white supremacy in 1948, Trent Lott has stepped down as Senate majority leader.<p>The basic absence of public discussion about it is proof of that.  To be 

sure, the place and time that Lott and Thurmond personified featured overt 

American apartheid for black people, who suffered economically, 

educationally, and legally.



<p>Then in the South, if your were white, you were all right.  If you were 

black, you better step back.



<p>There is much truth in this view of the past.  But it also blurs the class 

lines then and now between white people.



<p>This sleight of hand continues.  Consider Rush Limbaugh and his largely 

white audience.



<p>What do they have in common with him when it comes to income?  Nevertheless, 

their common skin color unites them against their nonwhite foes, real and 

imagined.



<p>Returning to Lott, the prevailing view is that those days of the South’s 

black/white divide that he supported with Thurmond are history.  Moreover, 

the ideology that justified such oppression is also past, with Lott’s 

remarks a kind of regrettable slip of the tongue.



<p>But as the great Malcolm X said, when you’re talking about the South, if 

you’re south of Canada you’re in the South. Lott’s remarks are but the 

proverbial tip of the national iceberg.



<p>White supremacy, in other words, is central to the nation’s history, from 

“sea to shining sea.”  From the genocide of the indigenous residents to the 

forced immigration of the African continent’s people, white supremacy was/is 

the  national mythology.



<p>When my grandfather was a child, the ideology of the dominant pigmentation 

was the “white man’s burden,” with the U.S. military civilizing the 

brown-skinned residents of the Philippines. They learned about U.S. 

democracy from the barrel of a gun, the first of many foreign people to 

receive such violent lessons.



<p>Cut to our current crisis in the Persian Gulf.  A revamped supremacist view 

can be found in the U.S. government’s crusade to bring their idea of 

democracy to the people of Iraq.



<p>Yes, U.S. foreign policy is partly expressed by Secretary of State Colin Powell, a person of color. This  shows what a high priority the Bush administration places 

on countering the image of white supremacy at home and abroad.



<p>Lott’s remark’s on the spurned glories of the South threatened to partly 

alter the administration’s orchestration of a benevolent U.S. imperialism in 

oil-rich Iraq.  He had to go, and did depart as Senate leader of the 

Republican Party.<p><I>Seth Sandronsky is an editor with Because People Matter, Sacramento's progressive newspaper. Email: <A HREF="mailto:ssandron@hotmail.com">ssandron@hotmail.com</A></I><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable --></font></td>
