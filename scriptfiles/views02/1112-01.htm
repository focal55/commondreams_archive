<p>It's show time! Time for the Republican Party to deliver on decades of big 

promises to the true believers: Ban abortions! Renew family values! Win the drug 

war! Slash taxes! Just remember, guys, no more excuses about Democrats obstructing 

the GOP platform. Your bluff has been called.

<p>It is tempting for the Republicans to keep coasting on the wave of wartime 

popularity even though they now control both halls of Congress, but that tactic 

is risky, as the failure of the first Bush presidency attests. Foreign policy 

is an unpredictable business -- don't look now, but Muslim fundamentalists have 

won in Pakistan, Afghanistan is ungovernable and the U.S. march to war against 

Iraq to distract from the failure to smash Al Qaeda is mired in U.N. diplomacy.

<p>Not even another stunning victory over Saddam Hussein will be sufficient to 

ensure reelection for Bush if the economy is in the doldrums, if the national 

debt accelerates and if the Christian right is again frustrated in its relentless 

quest to ban abortions.

<p> The president and his party are now wholly responsible for stewardship of 

the American economy. Their fate two years from now will hang mostly on hard numbers: 

how many of us are unemployed and what remains of our 401Ks.

<p>Yet Bush's key palliative for the stagnant economy, the tax cut, has failed 

miserably as a stimulus and instead has contributed to a sharply rising national 

debt.

<p>Combine that with the spiraling cost of throwing money at any program with 

the vaguest connection to national security and it seems clear that red ink will 

flow heavily from here to the next election.

<p>And don't expect Joe and Jane Middle Class to rescue Wall Street. The Securities 

and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department -- trying to please a White 

House run by old corporate con artists -- are stumbling over themselves to avoid 

responsibility for policing publicly held companies.

<p>It might take a decade or two before regular folks forget how they learned 

painfully anew that gambling, whether on stocks or craps, always brings out the 

sharks.

<p>Big business bet heavily on the Republicans in this election in order to block 

any attempts to bring more CEOs to justice. Better to distract the public from 

the ugly side of deregulation by beating the patriotic war drums and indulging 

the rhetoric of the Christian right by pretending to restore family values.

<p>On the latter front, the GOP's moment of truth may have finally arrived -- 

the mere pretense of commitment to an extremist social agenda may no longer be 

enough for anti-abortion voters. Controlling all branches of the federal government, 

Bush &amp; Co. is going to be under the gun to actually ban abortions, something 

the GOP has boldly pledged for decades.

<p>The social conservatives in the party provided the foot soldiers in the midterm 

election, and they will now demand concrete victories, beginning with a right-wing 

makeover of the judiciary. Bush already has announced that he will resubmit the 

list of conservative federal judicial appointees stalled in the last Senate. And 

with the relatively moderate Sandra Day O'Connor the most likely to step down, 

Bush has promised to appoint an anti-choice Antonin Scalia clone to solidify right-wing 

dominance of the Supreme Court.

<p>Under such leadership, the highest court in the land would be likely to strike 

down Roe vs. Wade. But the mere thought of this long-sought "victory" makes the 

GOP's political pros squirm: To go back to the days when abortion was illegal 

and women routinely died as a result of self-inflicted coat-hanger wounds is hardly 

a prescription for future Republican victories.

<p>The GOP has long blamed Democratic control of one or both houses of Congress 

for its failure to act on a radical agenda that is not supported by most Americans. 

This, in fact, is the disaster that befell the "Gingrich Revolution."

<p>There is another choice for Bush, however. He could lead his party back to 

its roots. That Republican Party was suspicious of foreign entanglements, vigorously 

in favor of population control and civil rights and -- while certainly pro-big 

business -- was committed to stewardship of the nation's resources and the integrity 

of economic instruments such as the stock market. 

<p>Such a turn toward core American values would make Bush a serious leader. Unfortunately, 

he seems to have mastered the tongue of the demagogue and too much enjoys the 

victories that slick words and tough talk afford to consider charting the more 

moderate path Americans seek.
