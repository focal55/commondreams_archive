<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I&#146;ve been waxing nostalgic lately 

over ethics scandals. In thinking about this 15th anniversary issue of <i>Business 

Ethics</i>, I&#146;ve been thumbing through issues back to the summer of 1987, 

reading about the scandals that seem always to come in waves. There was the early 

wave of government procurement fraud, then Medicare billing fraud, then insurance 

sales frauds rippling out from Prudential&#146;s scandals. After reading about 

Prudential in the book <i>Serpent on the Rock</i>, I would have voted it Most 

Fascinating Scandal were it not for the gold-standard scandals of the 1980s, when 

Ivan Boesky and Michael Milken were hauled away in handcuffs for junk bond fraud, 

insider trading, and stock parking. That era holds a special place in my heart 

as my First Ethics Scandal. I remember the urgency I felt as it unfolded, just 

before the first issue of <i>Business Ethics</i> came out. I was certain such 

a major ethics crisis wouldn&#146;t be seen again. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Well. Here we are 15 years 

later, in the midst of ethics&#146; perfect storm, with turbulence patterns converging 

from Enron, Arthur Andersen, Global Crossing, Tyco, Dynegy, Adelphia, WorldCom, 

and the rest. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It&#146;s not hard to trace 

the route from today back to the 1980s. The two eras are (un)ethical bookends 

to the greatest bull market in history. The management excesses that seemed so 

shocking back then &#150; hostile takeovers, massive layoffs, and exorbitant CEO 

pay -- became ordinary stuff in the 1990s. It was fuel for a hungry market, and 

as that market became more ravenous it demanded greater sacrifices. Thus minimally 

acceptable excesses gave way to outrageously fraudulent excesses, until the whole 

thing blew up in a kind of July 4 extravaganza -- with the explosions of Kenneth 

Lay and Andrew Fastow, the flame out of Bernard Ebbers, the detonation of Dennis 

Kozlowski, and the little mauve starburst of Martha Stewart.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The debris from the pyrotechnics 

has been drifting to earth day after day for months now, leaving the business 

press hot to talk about business ethics. Here at <i>Business Ethics</i> we&#146;ve 

been getting as many journalists&#146; calls in a month as we used to get in a 

year. So there seems to be a role for CSR folks, though not the role we had in 

mind when we began. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What we all wanted to do 

back then was change things. Looking back over the years, I&#146;m struck by how 

little change of real substance has taken root. Codes of conduct have sprouted 

like weeds. Ethics officers at major corporations have grown from a handful to 

hundreds. Business for Social Responsibility has become a multi-million-dollar 

operation. Social investing assets have swelled into the trillions. Business schools 

have added endowed chairs and required courses in ethics. Awards and best-of lists 

have grown in profusion. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Through it all -- as ethical 

decision-making was taught to MBAs, good companies were sought out for stock portfolios, 

or descriptions were compiled of best practices -- the underlying assumption was 

that managers had genuine freedom to be socially responsible. We believed CSR 

was about separating the good guys from the bad guys, and that good guys could 

be spotted by their exemplary policies and programs and sustainability reports. 

But the lessons of the perfect storm tell a different story.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As professor Sandra Waddock 

of Boston College Carroll School of Management noted in an unpublished paper, 

<i>&#145;Fluff is Not Enough,&#146;</i> Enron rang all the bells of CSR. It won 

a spot for three years on the list of the 100 Best Companies to Work for in America. 

In 2000 it received six environmental awards. It issued a triple bottom line report. 

It had great policies on climate change, human rights, and (yes indeed) anti-corruption. 

Its CEO gave speeches at ethics conferences and put together a statement of values 

emphasizing &#145;communication, respect, and integrity.&#146; The company&#146;s 

stock was in many social investing mutual funds when it went down. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Enron fooled us. But that&#146;s 

not the real lesson here. The lesson is that all the things CSR has been measuring 

and fighting for and applauding may be colossally beside the point. Because they 

fail to tell us what&#146;s really going on inside companies. What&#146;s going 

on is a single thing: unremitting pressure to get the numbers, by any means possible.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This is happening even at 

the &#145;best&#146; firms. I&#146;ve had candid conversations with managers at 

top-tier firms among our 100 Best Corporate Citizens, and what I hear is disheartening. 

One executive with his firm 25 years told me recently, &#145;I&#146;m inside the 

most enlightened company, and I&#146;m telling you, it is no more.&#146; Another 

legendary CSR firm, once known for its employee-friendly practices and no-layoff 

policy, has in recent years been laying off tens upon tens of thousands, and sucking 

money from an &#145;over-funded&#146; pension plan to feed its bottom line. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Those are the good guys. 

Elsewhere firms stoop to buying &#145;janitor insurance&#146; so they can profit 

when employees die, or move incorporation to Bermuda to evade taxes. No steps 

seem too brazen or shameless to take, when they boost the numbers enough. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If we want to know why the 

corporate social responsibility movement has accomplished so little of substance, 

here&#146;s the reason: the pressure to get the numbers overrides everything else. 

It overrides not because God_given, organic &#145;market&#146; forces are at work, 

but because the system is designed that way. It is designed to serve certain people 

and not others. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Because of course, in getting 

&#145;the numbers,&#146; companies are not compiling bloodless digits at the bottom 

of an income statement. Corporate profits lead to share price increases which 

represent dollars in the pockets of real-life human beings, primarily two groups 

of human beings: executives and wealthy investors. Chief executives get most of 

the blame, and certainly their pay has gone from outrageous to usurious. But they&#146;re 

not the only ones pocketing unconscionable wealth these days. In just the waning 

years of the bull market, from 1997 to 2000, the wealth of the Forbes 400 went 

up by $1.44 billion each. That&#146;s an increase of $1.9 million each day, for 

more than a thousand days on end. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We&#146;re told that everybody&#146;s 

retirement portfolios shared in the gains. But since 1983, two out of three American 

households saw no increase in retirement wealth from pensions. Among the 5 percent 

wealthiest, pension wealth went up 160 percent.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Somebody&#146;s profiting 

from the overwhelming drive to get the numbers, and that somebody is not &#145;everybody.&#146; 

It&#146;s the financial elite.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">They prosper not because 

they&#146;re more productive or virtuous than the rest of us, but because they 

wield power. CEOs select their own board members and craft their own pay packages, 

rigging the game to make themselves wealthy. Yet they keep their jobs only if 

they make shareholders wealthy -- and they get fired when they don&#146;t. In 

the last couple of decades when we dreamed we were working a CSR revolution, the 

real revolution was the shareholder revolt happening in corporate boardrooms. 

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Back in the days of Ivan 

Boesky, hostile takeover artists awakened slumbering boards and forced them to 

better maximize gains for shareholders. A new tool for doing so was firing CEOs, 

which boards did at two dozen major firms between 1991 and 1993, including General 

Motors, IBM, American Express, and Kodak. Another new tool for enforcing shareholder 

primacy was massive stock option packages, the same options packages that led 

directly to the ethical scandals of our day. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It was the laser focus on 

stock price gain that encouraged executives to drive their beasts so hard they 

collapsed. CEOs were the visible villains, but there were whips wielded to keep 

them driving toward maximum share price: whips of firing, stock options, and hostile 

takeovers. These are among the tools of corporate power. And they are tools available 

only to the financial elite. They are among the tools that make corporations and 

CEOs do what they do. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It&#146;s time we in CSR 

began studying these mechanisms, talking about system design, understanding why 

corporations behave so single-mindedly. And that means focusing on power. Because 

power is what it&#146;s all about, not good intentions or voluntary initiatives 

or toothless codes of conduct. Power. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If the financial elite wields 

power, the CSR movement wields talk. We put managers through ethics training, 

help them craft voluntary codes, applaud their environmental stewardship, or launch 

dialogues through shareholder resolutions -- assuming that well-meaning managers 

can overcome the system-wide pressure to get the numbers. But they can&#146;t. 

To use an extreme analogy, it&#146;s like talking ethics to an S.S. officer in 

Weimar Germany, while ignoring the system in which he must function. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If CSR has been riveted 

on things colossally beside the point, it&#146;s because we haven&#146;t focused 

enough on system design -- particularly on how the system lends power to the financial 

elite. We haven&#146;t fully addressed this issue of power. We haven&#146;t adequately 

studied how it&#146;s currently used, or fully imagined how to craft new structures 

of power -- structures where power is wielded not by the few but by the many. 

Structures that can turn stakeholder management from rhetoric into reality. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If we wish to stop being 

beside the point -- if we wish to accomplish something in the next 15 years that 

we failed to accomplish in the last 15 -- we would do well to focus on democratizing 

structures of power. That means imagining, and then creating, economic democracy. 

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Democracy is about two things. 

First, it is about purpose. In the political realm, it&#146;s about an overriding 

concern for the common good. In the economic realm, it&#146;s about having the 

common good trump the narrow self-interest of the financial elite. It&#146;s about 

broadening corporate purpose from serving shareholders to serving stakeholders, 

and releasing executives from the destructive mandate to maximize shareholder 

gain at any cost. Second, democracy is about structures that bring this purpose 

alive. It&#146;s not about separating good corporations from bad, but about shaping 

the system forces that act on all corporations. It&#146;s about consciously crafting 

new democratic system structures -- structures of voice, structures of decision 

making, structures of conflict resolution, structures of accountability. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Eventually this will mean 

changes in law. But legal changes must be of a different sort than we&#146;ve 

attempted thus far. Laws controlling corporations now amount to a patchwork of 

regulations about working conditions, pollution, or consumer well-being -- focusing 

on outcomes rather than underlying mechanisms. Thus we&#146;ve been like homeowners 

chopping down nuisance trees which continually spring back, because we have failed 

to eradicate the roots.&nbsp; As Abram Chayes remarked in <i>The Corporation in 

Modern Society</i>, it was the judgment of America&#146;s constitutional convention 

&#145;that limitations of structure rather than limitations of substance would 

best secure our liberties.&#146; If the founding generation&#146;s work has proved 

&#145;effective, durable, adaptable,&#146; economic reforms have proved less so. 

It is quite possible, Chayes wrote, &#145;that the difference in approach contributed 

to the difference in the quality of the result.&#146;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Taking on the challenge 

of economic democracy is a tall order, but there are tall leaders in the CSR movement 

today: leaders at the peak of personal power, with time yet in their professional 

lives for another major challenge. I&#146;m thinking, for example, of the first 

generation of socially responsible entrepreneurs, the founding fathers and mothers 

of socially responsible mutual funds, the authors of books, the heads of nonprofits, 

the creators of stakeholder theory. I&#146;m thinking of all the people who have 

defined CSR and built it into the industry it is today. When this generation passes, 

their like may not be seen again. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So the people who can lead 

the way are among us. The need for economic democracy is self-evident. And the 

historical moment for change is opening, asthe Watergate of Wall Street unfolds. 

What we&#146;re witnessing today is not another scandal du jour: we are seeing 

the weakness of the system design itself, laid bare for all to see -- if we can 

help people to understand what they&#146;re seeing.&nbsp; We are experiencing 

a unique convergence of forces, not only the forces of scandal, but the forces 

of change. We can use this moment to take corporate social responsibility to the 

next level: the level of economic democracy. We can become a new founding generation, 

completing the design in the economic realm that our forefathers began in the 

political realm. Instead of chasing one form of corporate wrongdoing at a time, 

we can put in place enduring structures of justice, effective structures of checks 

and balances. For it is only in this way that we can truly safeguard the common 

good -- not only for today, but for generation after generation to come.</font></p>
