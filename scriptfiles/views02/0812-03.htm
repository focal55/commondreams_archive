<p>While the Bush Administration prepares for war on Iraq with full-scale weapons 

production and troop deployments, more insidious conditioning for the public acceptance 

of war continues. In the face of repeated statements by Bush and the hawkish members 

of his ruling clique of the need for “regime change” in Iraq, international opinion 

has been forthright in its condemnation of such proposed aggression. However, 

in the absence of the mobilized outrage of the American people, the Washington 

power elite will be emboldened to carry out their war plans. Why the American 

public, so far, has been lackadaisical in its response to this saber rattling 

may be reflective of the increase of psychic and political numbing opportunistically 

manipulated by the Bush Administration since 9/11. 

<p>Psychic numbing, according to the psychiatrist Robert Jay Lifton, builds on 

well-known defense mechanisms, such as repression, denial, and projection, to 

create an exclusion of feeling and disconnectedness. Aided by the surfeit of stimuli 

from televisual culture and media-manipulated images, people may tune out those 

realities and possibilities that threaten their own sense of connection to the 

world. In the case of 9/11, the Bush Administration quickly exploited the anger 

of the American people without allowing a grieving process to mature. Drowning 

out the voices of survivors and their families who opposed retaliation, war on 

Afghanistan was initiated. Begun as a campaign to seek and destroy Osama bin Laden 

and his al Qaeda network, a network created by the CIA in the 1980’s, the intervention 

in Afghanistan quickly became an exercise in imperial politics and the lethal 

arrogance of power. 

<p>In manufacturing consent for the war in Afghanistan, the corporate media deliberately 

initially excluded scenes of civilian deaths. Now, however, with additional reporting 

and investigation by world-wide news agencies and the United Nations, the American 

public is being confronted with the extensive violence visited upon the innocent 

Afghans. Nonetheless, the desensitizing of the American public to the deaths of 

these differently constituted others (by ethnicity, class, and nationality) is 

a form of psychic numbing that may allow for the larger massacre of civilians 

in Iraq. 

<p>Of course, the American public has been bombarded with images and stories about 

the evil policies of Saddam Hussein. While highlighting his use of chemical weapons 

against Iraqi Kurds and Iranians, one rarely finds any mention of Washington’s 

support for Saddam Hussein during the 1980’s when these events happened. Moreover, 

while the Bush Administration has been busy undermining international treaties 

dealing with Chemical and Biological weapons, it has hypocritically insisted on 

unfettered inspections of Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction, weapons which many 

experts and former inspectors, such as Scott Ritter, allege have been severely 

eroded. Nonetheless, the targeting of the truly despicable Saddam Hussein is a 

convenient propaganda device to exclude consideration of the death and destruction 

already suffered by innocent Iraqis. A war on Iraq will only further harm massive 

numbers of civilians without guaranteeing a democratic and stabile post-Saddam 

regime and region. Since the Bush Administration is more interested in seeking 

filial retribution and oil while sowing the seeds of further war-making possibilities, 

it refuses to recognize the catastrophic violent consequences of its intended 

intervention. 

<p>Part of the political numbing that the Bush Administration has visited on the 

American public is intimately connected to the fear and intimidation launched 

by the Ashcroft’s jack-booted Department of Justice (sic). With overwhelming Congressional 

support, the USA Patriot Act was passed, establishing a wide variety of legal 

mechanisms to undermine the Bill of Rights. Although still used against those 

swarthy others, legislation is in place to deter real opposition to the policies 

of an increasingly authoritarian government. Added to this is the recent FBI reorganization, 

a reorganization that facilitates spying on the public without any court orders 

or even evidence of wrong-doing. Moreover, the Bush Administration has made clear 

its intent to deny constitutionally-mandated judicial oversight in its refusal 

to turn over documents to the judge overseeing one of the cases of a so-called 

“enemy combatant.” 

<p>Perhaps it may be time to raise the whole matter of the “f” word. It certainly 

seems reasonable to call this erosion of liberties and rights creeping fascism, 

albeit a postmodern fascism that does not need to rely on mass mobilization for 

realizing a proto-fascist agenda. In one of the most brilliant analyses of everyday 

life in Nazi Germany, Detlev Peukert devoted a whole chapter to “The Atomization 

of Everyday Life” (Inside Nazi Germany, pp. 236-42). Combining a form of psychic 

numbing with political numbing, many Germans just retreated from any public political 

life and took refuge in their own isolation. Since there is much evidence to support 

the tendency towards atomization and privatization of everyday life in the United 

States, it may not require utilizing any reference to fascism, whether postmodern 

or not. On the other hand, when an administrative authority relies on the militarization 

of everyday life to pursue a repressive and aggressive agenda, it may be necessary 

to raise the specter of fascism. 

<p>Promising a war without end and hiding behind a jingoistic veil of war against 

terrorism, the Bush Administration is promoting its own narrow interests in oil 

and order. War-making was as essential to Italian and German fascism as it is 

to this illegal and illegitimate ruling clique in Washington, DC. If we are to 

avoid being dragged into further fascistic adventures, we need to throw off this 

psychic and political numbing and to mobilize at every level to oppose the policies 

and plans of a war-mad power elite.
