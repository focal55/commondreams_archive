<p>WASHINGTON -- A hushed American public has accepted a dearth of information 

since Sept. 11 regarding the events surrounding that day and the aftermath. 

<P> We have seemingly abdicated -- almost gratefully, it appears at times -- the 

right to know.

</table>The Associated Press has reported that Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld&#39;s 

&quot;campaign against leaks&quot; and controlling news &quot;has created an atmosphere 

of fear among some officials who deal with reporters.&quot; 

<P> On CNBC recently, he commented that such individuals &quot;ought to be imprisoned. 

And if we find out who they are, they will be imprisoned.&quot; What about due 

process? 

<P> While we look to our governmental institutions to regain our balance at a 

time when our vulnerabilities are showing perhaps more so than at any time since 

the Vietnam War, might we be giving up more than we intend in the name of security? 

How are civil liberties being affected especially during this potentially endless 

and ill-defined &quot;war&quot;? 

<P> It is incumbent upon a democracy -- our democracy -- to pursue legitimate 

inquiry and seek information and answers. What are the new parameters and what 

do they demand? The American public is absent hard information. 

<P> We are relying on our government to supply all answers, generally operating 

in uncharted territory -- a war with no front and in an atmosphere that is consistently 

edgy and tense, domestically and internationally. Have we given up our right to 

know, to our need to know? And who defines this need? This atmosphere is dangerous. 

<P> Government&#39;s accountability to the people is what makes America unique 

-- not just at the ballot box but through our First Amendment freedoms, most especially 

a free press. 

<P> As a mature society, we understand the need to cede certain power to government 

in the wake of the cataclysm of Sept. 11. But we must not lose our way in the 

process, becoming so distracted that we enable sub-surface panic to displace constitutional 

rights and guarantees. As Benjamin Franklin stated two centuries ago, &quot;They 

that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve 

neither liberty nor safety.&quot; 

<P> Too often in recent months, probing questions to government -- in Congress 

and in the press -- are met with silence and stonewalling, or are labeled as an 

unpatriotic attack on a status quo needed to hold a still emotionally damaged 

country together. 

<P> But questioning Sept. 11 intelligence failures is not only legitimate but 

wise and deserves and demands answers, including what we know about the strength 

and whereabouts of the global terror network still operating. 

<P> We are right to ask who is being held at Guantanamo Bay-- including Americans 

-- and why, and right to expect our news media not just to inquire but to investigate. 

<P> We are right to ask whether certain policy actions are being taken to support 

a political agenda in the name of secrecy and security rather than because they 

are required to &quot;promote the general welfare.&quot; 

<P> We are right to ask about government accountability and what is happening 

on the ground in Afghanistan and Pakistan, including whether our pilots are getting 

the training they need, including &quot;fire discipline.&quot; 

<P> We are right to ask about the health of our relationships with our allies 

and the tensions in our Middle East policies. 

<P> We are right to ask how a new Department of Homeland Security ultimately can 

work when key security agencies such as the FBI and the CIA are outside its domain. 

<P> And, ultimately, we are right to ask whether we are learning the right lessons 

from the past. 

<P> The real danger is turning questioning into an attack on those asking. 

<P> In the midst of feeling our way through a new paradigm, we need to recognize 

the legitimate need for change in new circumstances but not to transform ourselves 

into a society that is a shadow of its pre-Sept. 11 self. This means trust, but 

it also means vigilance. 

<P> The public has a right to know and a need to know. We must think carefully 

about the price of ignorance and the consequences of silence.
