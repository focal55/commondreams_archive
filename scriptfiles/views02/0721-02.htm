<p>RECENT PRESS reports indicate that planning for war against Iraq has advanced 

significantly. When combined with revelations about the granting of presidential 

authority to the CIA for covert operations aimed at eliminating Saddam Hussein, 

it appears that the United States is firmly committed to a path that will lead 

toward war with Iraq. 

<p>Prior to this occurring, we would do well to reflect on the words of President 

Abraham Lincoln who, in his Gettysburg Address, defined the essence of why democracies 

like ours go to war: so ``... that government of the people, by the people, for 

the people, shall not perish from the earth.'' 

<p>Does Iraq truly threaten the existence of our nation? If one takes at face 

value the rhetoric emanating from the Bush administration, it would seem so. According 

to President Bush and his advisers, Iraq is known to possess weapons of mass destruction 

and is actively seeking to reconstitute the weapons production capabilities that 

had been eliminated by UN weapons inspectors from 1991 to 1998, while at the same 

time barring the resumption of such inspections. 

<p>I bear personal witness through seven years as a chief weapons inspector in 

Iraq for the United Nations to both the scope of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction 

programs and the effectiveness of the UN weapons inspectors in ultimately eliminating 

them. 

<p>While we were never able to provide 100 percent certainty regarding the disposition 

of Iraq's proscribed weaponry, we did ascertain a 90-95 percent level of verified 

disarmament. This figure takes into account the destruction or dismantling of 

every major factory associated with prohibited weapons manufacture, all significant 

items of production equipment, and the majority of the weapons and agent produced 

by Iraq. 

<p>With the exception of mustard agent, all chemical agent produced by Iraq prior 

to 1990 would have degraded within five years (the jury is still out regarding 

Iraq's VX nerve agent program - while inspectors have accounted for the laboratories, 

production equipment and most of the agent produced from 1990-91, major discrepancies 

in the Iraqi accounting preclude any final disposition at this time.) 

<p>The same holds true for biological agent, which would have been neutralized 

through natural processes within three years of manufacture. Effective monitoring 

inspections, fully implemented from 1994-1998 without any significant obstruction 

from Iraq, never once detected any evidence of retained proscribed activity or 

effort by Iraq to reconstitute that capability which had been eliminated through 

inspections. 

<p>In direct contrast to these findings, the Bush administration provides only 

speculation, failing to detail any factually based information to bolster its 

claims concerning Iraq's continued possession of or ongoing efforts to acquire 

weapons of mass destruction. To date no one has held the Bush administration accountable 

for its unwillingness - or inability - to provide such evidence. 

<p>Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld notes that ``the absence of evidence is not evidence 

of absence.'' This only reinforces the fact that the case for war against Iraq 

fails to meet the litmus test for the defense of our national existence so eloquently 

phrased by President Lincoln. 

<p>War should never be undertaken lightly. Our nation's founders recognized this 

when they penned our Constitution, giving the authority to declare war to Congress 

and not to the president. Yet on the issue of war with Iraq, Congress remains 

disturbingly mute. 

<p>Critical hearings should be convened by Congress that will ask the Bush administration 

tough questions about the true nature of the threat posed to the United States 

by Iraq. Congress should reject speculation and demand substantive answers. The 

logical forum for such a hearing would be the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee. 

<p>Unfortunately, the senators entrusted with such critical oversight responsibilities 

shy away from this task. This includes Massachusetts Senator John Kerry, a Vietnam 

War veteran who should understand the realities and consequences of war and the 

absolute requirement for certainty before committing to a course of conflict. 

<p>The apparent unwillingness of Congress to exercise its constitutional mandate 

of oversight, especially with regard to matters of war, represents a serious blow 

to American democracy. By allowing the Bush administration, in its rush toward 

conflict with Iraq, to circumvent the concepts of democratic accountability, Congress 

is failing those to whom they are ultimately responsible - the American people.
