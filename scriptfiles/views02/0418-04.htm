Earth Day is a perfect time to celebrate the first, true gift of the Earth to 

us: food. Before we toss our hats into the air, though, we might want to start 

with an admission.

<p>While we in the United States like to think we're blessed with the world's 

best and cheapest food, we've actually let market prices lie to us.

<p>They don't register all the hidden costs of our "factory farming" model, costs 

that undermine the very sustainability of nature's gifts. Food prices don't count 

the fact that soil is eroding on prime farmland many times faster than nature 

rebuilds it, or the marine life we're losing because of nitrogen runoff from overusing 

fertilizers. The latter has created a dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico as big as 

Massachusetts and still growing.

<p>The prices don't include the loss of plant diversity that occurs when our seed 

is supplied by just a few companies aggressively marketing a limited selection 

or the wells in Midwest states poisoned by farm chemicals.

<p>They don't consider the over-exploited oceans, where extinction threatens one-third 

of fish species, or the farm families and entire rural communities wiped out by 

rising farm costs and lower returns.

<p>These are merely the uncounted costs of producing our increasingly unhealthy 

diet. Eating it adds a host of additional costs, including more than 5,000 deaths 

each year from food-borne illnesses, even as agribusiness--especially the meat 

industry--has fought against adding the cost of stricter food safety procedures 

to the bottom line.

<p>We've boasted that ours is the world's most efficient food system, but no business 

could stay afloat for long while ignoring its real costs.

<p>Efficiency and sustainability--the maintenance of Earth's gifts to us and our 

health over time--can no longer be seen as contradictory aims.

<p>Looked at this way, solving our food-related environmental and health crisis 

doesn't require a change in values. No one wants to destroy our Earth or get sick 

from what he or she eats. It requires a change in perception.

<p>We have to see differently. We have to see, then measure and count, the real 

costs of producing food and of our sudden (in historical terms) shift to a meat-based, 

processed, high-fat and sugar diet.

<p>Just as important, we have to see that we can have the healthy food we need 

within a more honest framework of cost-counting.

<p>During the last 30 years, agriculturists around the world have been learning 

to align with nature's genius to create sustainable efficiency--getting the most 

from nature without destroying it.

<p>With true sustainability we do not have to blanket the planet with pesticides 

or turn to untried technologies such as genetically engineered seeds that threaten 

ecological disruption.

<p>Last year, in the first worldwide study of sustainable farming practices, covering 

70 million acres in more than 50 countries, researchers noted that applying ecology-protecting 

methods increased yields substantially. They recorded increases of 150% in root 

crops. True, in some cases sustainable practices can mean lower yields but, because 

production costs drop even more, farmers reap better livelihoods. Besides, overproduction, 

not underproduction, has been the bane of U.S. agriculture.

<p>Once we dispel the myth of efficiency hiding costs, we discover that sustainable 

is synonymous with real efficiency--getting the most of our resources over time.

<p>To eat well, we don't have to acquiesce to a degrading environment, a tragic 

loss of species, a heart-rending erosion of family farming. We can redirect tax 

subsidies to further nonchemical practices and support independent, ecologically 

committed farmers, without fearing that we'll risk inefficiency-induced scarcity.

<p>We must let go of the false trade-off between protecting the planet and feeding 

ourselves.
