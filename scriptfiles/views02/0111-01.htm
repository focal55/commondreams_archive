            AUSTIN &#151; And a happy New Year to all the friendly folks at the 

            Henry Cisneros special prosecutor's office, now coming up on its seventh 

            year. Cisneros, who left office five ago as Clinton's housing secretary, 

            is back in San Antonio doing good works in the area of affordable 

            housing. But his special prosecutor David Barrett, like Ol' Man River, 

            he just keeps rolling along. 

            <P> Cisneros, having long since pleaded to a misdemeanor and paid 

              a $10,000 fine, is no longer a target of investigation, but Barrett 

              is reportedly still investigating someone who did or did not tell 

              him something about Cisneros. It's bound to be a high crime, since 

              the entire flap was over whether Cisneros had lied to the FBI &#151; 

              not about whether he had given money to his ex-mistress (an affair 

              that was both over and public knowledge well before Cisneros ever 

              went to Washington) &#151; but about <i>how much</i> he had paid 

              her. 

            <P> So the moral here is: Don't ever lie to the FBI about how much 

              you have paid an ex-mistress, even if it's common knowledge that 

              you have done so. The Cisneros special prosecutor costs the taxpayers 

              over $2 million a year and is no doubt worth every penny. 

            <P> The special prosecutor law is now dead, too, Congress having realized 

              that it had created a Frankenstein monster &#151; but there is no 

              way to kill off Barrett's office. 

            <P> In another revolting development, Andrea Yates &#151; the Houston 

              mother who drowned her five children in the bathtub &#151; is the 

              poster woman for a long-needed change in the law. Harris County 

              District Attorney Chuck Rosenthal is now indicating that he may 

              not seek the death penalty after all, but will go for a life sentence 

              in exchange for a guilty plea. 

            <P> This woman needs to be put in a mental hospital, not put to death 

              or in prison for life. She's clearly insane &#151; almost as insane 

              as the Texas criminal justice system. Yates has pleaded not guilty 

              by reason of insanity. Well, she's <i>guilty</i>. She killed her 

              five kids and then called the police to report that she'd done it. 

              Nothing can make her not guilty of that hideous act, but she is 

              not a responsible person. The system needs a plea of "guilty but 

              insane." Insanity is not cured by putting people in a Texas prison. 

              It's not good for those with mental health problems. 

            <P> What are we saying by prosecuting this woman? That we don't think 

              there is such a thing as mental illness? Exactly how benighted do 

              we want to prove we are in the year 2002? Yates had a history of 

              post-partum psychotic depression and had tried to kill herself twice. 

              In 1999, when she had four children, doctors told her and her husband 

              she should not have another because of the psychosis. 

            <P> Two weeks before the murders, she was taken off anti-psychotic 

              medication and put on anti-depressants. She went downhill, and her 

              husband begged her doctors to put her back on the stronger meds. 

              She was described as being in a "zombie-like state" at the beginning 

              of her incarceration and has since been put back on Haldol, the 

              anti-psychotic often prescribed for those who hear voices or are 

              thinking delusionally. 

            <P> Do people think she would be "getting away" with murder?" Do they 

              think she's faking her illness? What possible solution to this tragedy 

              can be offered by the criminal "justice" system? 

            <P> While the Yates trial plays itself out, a new film about mental 

              illness, "A Beautiful Mind" starring Russell Crowe, is having an 

              extraordinary impact on those who see it. It is a biography of John 

              Forbes Nash Jr., who won the Nobel Prize in physics in 1994 for 

              work he had done as young man before paranoid schizophrenia cost 

              him about 30 years of his life. 

            <P> For a long period, Nash was the "town nut" in Princeton, N.Js., 

              a demented character familiar to everyone. Nash, extraordinarily 

              enough, recovered from schizophrenia, which is quite rare. 

            <P> I have no idea whether Yates will ever recover &#151; certainly 

              not from having murdered her own children. But Yates is not the 

              one facing a test, this society is. Can we do no better than the 

              superstitious medieval tradition of burning the witch at the stake?
