<p>Until 1998 Sherri Bufkin happily worked as a manager for Smithfield Foods in 

Tar Heel, N.C. But in 1997, when workers in the giant meatpacking plant there 

began to organize a union, her superiors - she has testified - forced her to join 

their campaign to "do whatever was necessary to keep &#91;the union&#93; out."

<p> Bufkin also said she had to tell workers that they would suffer violence and 

lose jobs if they formed a union, and that she had to discriminate in assignments 

against pro-union workers. Worse yet, her bosses insisted that she fire some workers 

simply because they openly supported a union. Then they demanded that she sign 

false affidavits about management's tactics - many of which clearly violated laws 

protecting workers' right to organize.

<p> Shortly after she refused to lie for the company at a National Labor Relations 

Board hearing, Smithfield fired her, plunging her into prolonged unemployment 

and bankruptcy. "I don't regret standing up for the truth," she told a June 20 

Senate committee hearing on obstacles to forming unions, "because now I can look 

my daughter square in the eye."

<p> Senators also heard from workers - like nurse Nancy Schweikhard, ship captain 

Eric J. Vizier and hotel worker Mario Vidales - who told of being the direct victims 

of management harassment, threats to close their workplaces, a beating by anti-union 

thugs, and arrests or surveillance by police cooperating with anti-union employers.

<p> But few other Americans heard these stories, because the hearing went nearly 

unreported. That's a shame. At a time when the country is preoccupied with terrorism 

from abroad and Enron-style corporate abuses at home, it is important to remember 

that millions of American workers who would like to have a voice on the job have 

been denied their internationally recognized human rights by corporations who 

"in too many cases act like real domestic terrorists," in the words of AFL-CIO 

organizer Stewart Acuff.

<p> According to Senate testimony from Kenneth Roth, whose Human Rights Watch 

group two years ago documented "widespread labor rights violations" in the United 

States, in the 1950s a few hundred workers a year were fired - illegally - for 

trying to organize unions. But in 1998 - despite a much lower level of union organizing 

activity - 24,000 workers lost their jobs just because they were trying to exercise 

their internationally guaranteed freedom to associate with other workers on the 

job.

<p> Now, less than 14 percent of the U.S. workforce belong to unions, but surveys 

suggest that 44 percent wish they did. Employer threats, firings and systematic 

intimidation stifle many bids to unionize. In 92 percent of all organizing efforts, 

employers force workers to attend anti-union meetings. In half of all campaigns 

- and more than 70 percent of organizing at manufacturing businesses - employers 

threaten to close the business and, often, to move overseas, if workers unionize.

<p> This month, workers at Quadrtech, a small manufacturing plant in Southern 

California, reached a financial settlement with management that also marked the 

end of their attempt to unionize. Nearly two years ago, a federal court issued 

an injunction to stop the owner from moving to Mexico in order to avoid unionization. 

But the company reportedly kept trying to move.

<p> Even when workers overcome employer obstacles and vote - or otherwise show 

support - for a union, managers often refuse to negotiate a contract. For example, 

much-abused farm workers have voted in 428 elections for the United Farm Workers 

since 1975, but growers have only signed 185 contracts (although a bill awaiting 

California Gov. Gray Davis's signature would require binding arbitration in deadlocked 

negotiations). Employers suffer minuscule penalties that don't deter lawbreaking.

<p> Early this month, the AFL-CIO launched a new campaign to protect worker rights 

at work, especially the right to join unions without interference from employers. 

A stronger worker voice would increase economic security and equality, restrain 

abuse of corporate power, and enhance democracy.

<p> As Kenneth Roth told the senators, "if the rights of workers are not respected 

and protected, then the strength of American democracy and freedom is diminished."

<p> Democracy and freedom need protection from physical threats of terrorists 

- and from overzealous antiterrorists, like the Bush administration, which wants 

to deny workers in a new Department of Homeland Security both civil service protections 

and the right to organize into unions.

<p> But democracy and freedom also must be safeguarded against the corporate economic 

terrorism that hurts us all, not just working people directly denied their rights 

to join together in a union.</P>
