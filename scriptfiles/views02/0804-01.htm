<p>Supporters of the Bush administration's silly saber-rattling on Iraq trooped 

before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last week for a performance that 

would have been laughable if they were not talking about risking thousands of 

American and Iraqi lives and spending billions of U.S. dollars on a fool's mission. 

<P>The "experts" could not even agree on whether the poverty-stricken and militarily 

battered Iraq poses a threat to its neighbors, let alone to the United States. 

They could not agree on whether any U.S. allies would support an attack. They 

could not agree on how to attack Iraq. 

<P>They could not agree on whether a U.S. attack would destabilize the Middle 

East, nor on whether it might create greater antipathy toward Americans than already 

exists. 

<P>They could not agree on who would or should replace Iraqi President Saddam 

Hussein as interim leader. They could not agree on how long the United States 

would have to maintain a military presence or how much that presence would cost 

- although they generally agreed that it would take a long time and a lot of money. 

<P>At the end of two days of testimony, it was clear that Scott Ritter, a former 

U.N. weapons inspector in Iraq, is right. "This is not about the security of the 

United States," Ritter says of the administration's rush to war. "This is about 

domestic American politics. The national security of the United States of America 

has been hijacked by a handful of neo-conservatives who are using their position 

of authority to pursue their own ideologically driven political ambitions. The 

day we go to war for that reason is the day we have failed collectively as a nation." 

<P>One need not be a former U.N. weapons inspector to recognize the absurdity 

of launching a war with Iraq, however. After the hearings, which aired many of 

the concerns and considerations regarding the administration's plans to try to 

depose Saddam, The Capital Times sent a reporter out to ask Wisconsinites the 

question: Is it more dangerous to our safety to try to remove Saddam Hussein from 

power or leave him alone? 

<P>Every person he asked - from computer programmers to office workers to mechanics 

to student interns - questioned the wisdom of launching a war with the purpose 

of removing Saddam. 

<P>"Removing him from power would be more dangerous to the American public and 

I think it's pointless," added John Bayley, a mechanic from Madison. "There are 

all kinds of terrible leaders in the world that we pay no attention to because 

they don't have oil. That's the whole issue: oil. Follow the money. It's about 

Bush's war of terrorism against oil-rich states that don't cooperate with us." 

<P>"I think it would be more dangerous to remove Saddam from power, especially 

the way Bush does things. I see him taking a cowboy approach to foreign affairs," 

said Madison's Rebeca Jefferson, who added that, in the case of Iraq, the president's 

seat-of-the-pants approach "could seriously backfire." 

<P>Members of Wisconsin's congressional delegation - particularly U.S. Sen. Russ 

Feingold, who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee - should recognize 

after last week's hearings that there is no rationale for this war. More important, 

they should listen to the voices of Wisconsinites, whose opposition to launching 

this unnecessary and dangerous war makes a lot more sense than anything coming 

from the Bush administration. </i></p>
