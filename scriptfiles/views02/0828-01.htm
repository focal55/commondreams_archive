<p>WASHINGTON &#151; I was dubious at first. But now I think Dick Cheney has it 

right.</p>

<P> Making the case for going to war in the Middle East to veterans on Monday, 

the vice president said that "our goal would be . . . a government that is democratic 

and pluralistic, a nation where the human rights of every ethnic and religious 

group are recognized and protected."</p>

<P> O.K., I'm on board. Let's declare war on Saudi Arabia! Let's do "regime change" 

in a kingdom that gives medieval a bad name.</p>

<P> By overthrowing the Saudi monarchy, the Cheney-Rummy-Condi-Wolfy-Perle-W. 

contingent could realize its dream of redrawing the Middle East map.</p>

<P> Once everyone realizes that we're no longer being hypocrites, coddling a corrupt, 

repressive dictatorship that sponsors terrorism even as we plot to crush a corrupt, 

repressive dictatorship that sponsors terrorism, it will transform our relationship 

with the Arab world.</p>

<P> We won't need Charlotte Beers at the State Department, thinking up Madison 

Avenue slogans to make the Arab avenue love us. ("Democracy! Mm-mm, good.")</p>

<P> If America is going to have a policy of justified pre-emption, in Henry Kissinger's 

clinical phrase, why not start by chasing out those sorry Saudi royals? If we're 

willing to knock over Saddam for gassing the Kurds, we should be willing to knock 

over the Saudis for letting the state-supported religious police burn 15 girls 

to death last March in a Mecca school, forcing them back inside a fiery building 

because they tried to flee without their scarves. And shouldn't we pre-empt them 

before they teach more boys to hate American infidels and before they can stunt 

the lives of more women?</p>

<P> The vice president declared on Monday, "This nation will not live at the mercy 

of terrorists or terror regimes." I am absolutely with him.</p>

<P> Why should we (and our S.U.V.'s) be at the mercy of this family that we arm 

and protect and go to war for? The Saudis have never formally apologized to America 

for the 15 Saudi citizens who came here and killed 3,000 Americans as they went 

to work one sun-dappled September morning. They have never even tried to rewrite 

their incendiary terrorist-breeding textbooks or stop their newspapers from spewing 

anti-American, anti-Semitic lies, like their stories accusing Jews of drinking 

children's blood. They brazenly held a telethon, with King Fahd and Crown Prince 

Abdullah giving millions, to raise money for families of Palestinian suicide bombers, 

or "martyrs." Last week the Saudi embassy here put out a glossy brochure hailing 

their "humanitarian work" at the telethon. </p>

<P> It was embarrassing yesterday, given President Bush's swagger on Iraq, to 

watch him fawn over the Saudis. At lunch at his ranch he entertained Prince Bandar, 

the man who got private planes to spirit Osama bin Laden's relatives out of the 

U.S. after the attacks. Mr. Bush also called Crown Prince Abdullah yesterday to 

assure him of the "eternal friendship" between their countries and to soothe hurt 

Saudi feelings over a lawsuit filed by 9/11 victims charging Saudi support of 

terrorism. </p>

<P> Mr. Cheney argues that we must invade Iraq while we have a strategic window 

for action, while Saddam's army is still reeling. </p>

<P> But attacking the Saudis would be even easier. They are soft and spoiled. 

Only yesterday Jerome Socolovsky of The A.P. wrote about how King Fahd brought 

thousands of members of the House of Saud to Marbella, Spain, where they stocked 

up on luxury items and hired North African servants. Women in veils and waterproof 

robes rode Jet Skis and members of the royal family talked about the 9/11 attacks 

as an Israeli-C.I.A. plot. </p>

<P> A Saudi invasion would be like the Panama invasion during Bush I. We already 

have bases to use there. And this time Mr. Cheney won't have to beg the royals 

to use their air space, or send American forces.</p>

<P> Once we make Saudi Arabia into our own self-serve gas pump, its neighbors 

will get the democracy bug. </p>

<P> The Saudis would probably use surrogates to fight anyway. They pay poor workers 

from other countries to do their menial labor. And they paid the Americans to 

fight the Iraqis in 1991. The joke among the American forces then was: "What's 

the Saudi national anthem? `Onward, Christian Soldiers.' "</p>

<P> We haven't been hit at home by any of Saddam's Scud missiles. But the human 

missiles launched by Saudi Arabia have taken their toll. </p>
