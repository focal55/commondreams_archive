<p>The collapse of Richard Gephardt's leadership of the House Democratic Caucus 

did not occur on November 5, when the party lost seats in an election where history 

and economic trends suggested that it should have gained them. That result was 

simply a confirmation of the crisis that had been evident for more than a year. 

From the first days of George W. Bush's selected-not-elected presidency, it was 

clear that Gephardt was unprepared to serve as the leader of Congressional opposition 

to a Republican president. After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, 

he simply stopped trying. That doomed Democratic chances of taking over the House 

in 2002, as Gephardt failed to define an opposition agenda and took positions 

out of sync with his own caucus. </p>

<p> That was never more evident than on October 10 when, after Gephardt helped 

craft the resolution authorizing Bush to launch a unilateral attack on Iraq, the 

majority of House Democrats voted against the plan. In surprising result, 126 

House Democrats opposed it with only 81 joining their leader Gephardt in supporting 

it. </p>

<p> Among the Democrats who opposed the resolution was House Minority Whip Nancy 

Pelosi, the California Democrat who won the caucus' Number 2 leadership position 

last year. Pelosi, the ranking Democrat on the House Permanent Select Committee 

on Intelligence, argued -- as did Senate Intelligence Committee chair Bob Graham, 

D-Florida -- that the Bush administration had failed to make a case for its position. 

"I have seen no evidence or intelligence that suggests that Iraq indeed poses 

an imminent threat to our nation," she said, in one of the most powerful indictments 

of the resolution. "If the Administration has that information, they have not 

shared it with the Congress." </p>

<p> Pelosi's stance placed her in direct opposition not just to the Bush administration 

but to Gephardt. And it stirred immediate discussion among House Democrats about 

what it might be like to be a genuine opposition party. An aggressive progressive, 

Pelosi has long argued that Democrats need to clearly distinguish themselves from 

Republicans on domestic and international issues. Now, she can point to Tuesday's 

election results -- in which Democrats who opposed the Bush agenda on taxes and 

war ran better than those who compromised with the administration -- as confirmation 

of her view. </p>

<p> With Gephardt stepping down as minority leader, Pelosi is running hard to 

replace him. She is not starting from scratch. Speculation about Gephardt's departure 

-- in order to focus on a 2004 bid for the Democratic presidential nomination 

-- was rampant in the House even before the election, and Pelosi has been quietly 

organizing support. But she was not alone in that endeavor. Another prominent 

House Democrat, Caucus chair Martin Frost, D-Texas, has been running just as hard 

as Pelosi. </p>

<p> With Gephardt's announcement that he is stepping aside, the contest for the 

top Democratic leadership post in the House will speed up. Democrats are set to 

choose a replacement for the minority leader on November 14. Pelosi is reported 

to have collected commitments from 110 House Democrats to support her candidacy. 

That would be more than enough to secure the position in a House that, depending 

on final results from Tuesday, will include 204 Democratic representatives and 

five delegates from US territories and the District of Columbia. </p>

<p> Commitments of this sort are no guarantee of support in the closed caucus 

vote, however, and Pelosi's backers do not intend to coast through the next several 

days. They know they will be involved in a serious internal campaign against Frost, 

one of the ablest strategists in the House. </p>

<p> It would be a mistake to see the Pelosi-Frost fight as a clear left-right 

struggle. Pelosi is one of the most progressive members of the House, with a voting 

record that frequently displays 100 percent support for the positions advanced 

by organized labor, environmental and consumer groups. But Frost, despite his 

Texas roots, is no southern conservative. He too has earned his share of 100 percent 

AFL-CIO ratings over the years. Pelosi has support from some conservative Democrats, 

who see her as an able fund raiser and an effective spokesperson for the caucus. 

Frost has liberal supporters who respect the leadership role he's played in coordinating 

congressional campaigns over the years. </p>

<p> That said, there are clear distinctions. Where Pelosi was a leading foe of 

the Iraq resolution, Frost supported it. Pelosi has in recent years been an outspoken 

critic of the corporate free-trade agenda, while Frost has a mixed record that 

includes a vote to permanently normalize trade relations with China. (That vote 

by Frost so angered local United Auto Workers members that, in 2000, they removed 

desks that had been donated for use in the congressman's campaign office. He has 

since been more supportive of labor's position on trade issues.) </p>

<p> The biggest difference between Frost and Pelosi came through as they staked 

out their visions for how House Democrats should position themselves in the next 

Congress. The day after Tuesday's vote, Frost's spokesman Tom Eisenhauer told 

reporters, "The country moved to the right yesterday. And House Democrats won't 

win the majority by moving further to the left." </p>

<p> Pelosi, for her part, is arguing that Democrats need to distinguish themselves 

from Republicans. "To win back the House in 2004," she says, "we need a unified 

party that will draw clear distinctions between our vision of the future and that 

espoused by the Republicans."</p> </p>
