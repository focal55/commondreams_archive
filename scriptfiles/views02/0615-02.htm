<p>WHAT WOULD you do if you had a missile defense system that couldn't tell a warhead from a balloon decoy? If you're the US Missile Defense Agency, you'd classify the data about missile defense tests  to hide this fatal flaw.

<P>





<P>In May of 2000 I wrote a letter to the White House that described  how the Missile Defense Agency had doctored results of National Missile Defense tests to hide the fact that they could not tell the difference between simple decoys and warheads. I also described how the agency had altered its entire test program to hide the flaw.  Two General Accounting Office reports issued in March of this year verified the facts I provided to the White House.  The agency responded to my letter by claiming that it was  classified, and it engaged in multiple attempts to stop me from revealing that its  claims amounted to scientific fraud.</P>

<P>In one of these attempts, the agency tried to enlist the help of MIT's president in order to seize research papers from my office, and in another, it sent three agents to deliver a letter to me  that was classified ''secret.'' The letter contained nothing more than publicly available information deemed  classified by the government so that the agency could claim that I would be violating security agreements if I continued to speak about this matter of national security.</P>

<P>Now the agency wants to have the authority to, in effect, classify the fact that it cannot tell warheads from decoys. It claims  that the nature of the decoys that experts know would easily confuse its defense will now be classified.</P>

<P>The intent of this ploy has nothing to do with national security. It is an admission that the only way it can save its unworkable missile defense from reviews that will kill it is to hide information from the public.</P>

<P>The current National Missile Defense interceptor tries to identify warheads and decoys by ''looking at them'' with infrared eyes. Because the missile defense is essentially using vision to tell which objects are decoys and which are bombs,  this technique is no more effective than trying to find suitcase bombs at an airport by studying the shape and color of each  suitcase.</P>

<P>All of the objects that are seen by the missile defense are in space, where there is no air-drag to cause light decoys to slow up relative to heavy bombs. In addition, because there is no air-drag, it is possible to wrap the bomb in light material and make it look like a decoy.  The possibilities for changing the visual appearance of bombs and decoys in the near vacuum of space are virtually endless.</P>

<P>After the first two tests in 1997 and 1998, the agency learned that decoys shaped like nuclear warheads - and even balloons with stripes on them - could not be distinguished from actual warheads. The agency responded by removing these decoys from all subsequent flight tests. In one of the flight tests, the agency claimed a success in telling warheads from decoys that was beyond  expectations.</P>

<P>Later on, General  Accounting Office investigators found that the sensor in that test had failed to  perform and that the claims of success could not possibly have been true.</P>

<P>When the Department of Justice and the  Department of Defense inspector general were investigating the false claims of success for fraud, the agency used researchers at MIT Lincoln Laboratory to create a bogus study that had the effect of misleading the investigators.</P>

<P>In yet later tests the  agency used a balloon that was intentionally designed to be 10 times brighter than the bomb and claimed that the fact that it could tell the difference between the bright and dim objects meant it could tell warheads  from decoys.</P>

<P>It neglected to  explain that it had to know in advance that the brighter object was a decoy,  and if the warhead were placed inside a large balloon it would then be  indistinguishable from the empty decoy balloon.</P>

<P>The   agency has no technical program for solving this fundamental  problem. It has also been unable to provide any credible scientific evidence or analysis to show that it can  ever solve this problem. So what it proposes to do is to classify the fact that the targets it is flying  have been preconstructed in ways that will allow it to tell one from  another.</P>

<P>This misuse of the classification system to hide the fact that the National Missile Defense System has no credible scientific chance of working is a serious abuse of our security  system.</P>

<P>A missile defense system  cannot work unless it is based on sound science. Classifying the fact that there is no sound science that can be used to make this white elephant fly is a disservice  to our democracy and the American people.</P>
