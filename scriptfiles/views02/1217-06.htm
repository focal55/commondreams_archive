<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->AUSTIN -- Damn, it's hard to kill a bad idea. And this one is so rank 

that if Osama bin Laden had come up with it, we'd be forced to admit it 

was a stroke of genius: how to infuriate our allies, cause an explosion 

of anti-American paranoia, and encourage terrorism -- all in one swell 

foop, as one of our old Texas pols used to say.

<p>Unfortunately, this idea is Donald Rumsfeld's.

	<p>The concept of a Pentagon disinformation office is back. "The Defense 

Department is considering issuing a secret directive to American 

military to conduct covert operations aimed at influencing public opinion and 

policymakers in friendly and neutral nations," reports The New York 

Times. "The proposal has ignited a fierce battle throughout the Bush 

administration over whether the military should carry out secret propaganda 

missions in friendly nations like Germany." This is the same stupid 

idea that was beaten back last February when the Pentagon had to 

disband its Office of Strategic Influence when it was pointed out that the 

thing was guaranteed to backfire.

	<p>Let's do that simple old thing where we put the shoe on the other foot 

and see how it feels, substituting "China" for "United States" and 

using the exact plan outlined by the Times: "The Chinese government is 

considering a secret propaganda program that would include, for example, 

efforts to discredit and undermine evangelical Christian churches and 

religious schools that have become breeding grounds for militant 

anti-Chinese sentiment because of China's abortion policies and human-rights 

issues. It might even include setting up schools with secret Chinese 

financing to teach a more moderate Christianity, laced with sympathetic 

depictions of how the religion is practiced in China. The plan also 

includes secret Chinese payments to American journalists to write articles 

favorable to China, and paying citizens' groups to organize rallies in 

support of Chinese policies."

	<p>No, not a good idea. This country already has a credibility problem 

around the world -- why set up an official propaganda office to tell 

lies, when the truth works much better?

	<p> We already have a non-clandestine, open program of public relations 

at the State Department called public diplomacy. Apparently, the old 

U.S. Information Agency, now under State, is in some disarray. I hate to 

mention it, but that is one of those problems you can solve by throwing 

money at it.

	<p>It is both unnecessary and counterproductive to have a secret 

propaganda campaign. The most effective weapon in any information campaign is a 

reputation for telling the truth. And the only way to get that 

reputation is to earn it. The BBC is listened to worldwide precisely because it 

does not spin the news.

	<p>When the "Office of Strategic Lies" was killed off earlier this year, 

Rumsfeld was quite testy at the press conference. "The office is done," 

he snapped. "It's over. What do you want, blood?" No, we want it to be 

over.

	<p>President Bush promised at the time, "We'll tell the American people 

the truth." Then last week, the administration leaked a painfully 

obvious fake story about how Saddam Hussein had given chemical weapons to Al 

Qaeda. That one was shot down so fast -- from inside the government -- 

if you blinked, you missed it. What's next? Iraqi soldiers tossing 

babies out of Kuwaiti incubators again? Rape of the Belgian nuns?

	<p>This administration has such a problem with obsessive secrecy, such a 

compulsion to control information and such a low regard for the 

public's right to know what is being done in their name, with their money and 

with their children's lives that it's seriously alarming. The 

administration is clearly stocked with people who regard the press as a pain to 

be manipulated and public opinion as something that needs to be shaped 

by the government.

	

<p>To review the record: 

<li>One of the first things Bush did in office was rescind the provision that 

gives access to a president's records 12 years after he had left office. 

<li>They're still sitting on the information about who shaped Dick Cheney's energy 

policy, as though we couldn't figure that out. 

<li>Secret detentions without charges, without lawyers. 

<li>The administration requested that the television networks censor tapes from 

Osama bin Laden under the odd pretext that they might contain some coded message. 

Since you could see them in full on Al Jazeera, that was utterly pointless. 

<li>In October, after a leak the White House didn't like, the administration announced 

only eight members of Congress would be permitted to hear intelligence briefings. 

Congress made them back down. 

<p>Out of room and barely started. Ted Gup, author of "The Book of Honor," about 

the secret lives of CIA agents, quotes the British scholar F.M. Cornford: "Propaganda 

is that branch of the art of lying which consists in very nearly deceiving your 

friends without quite deceiving your enemies."</p>
