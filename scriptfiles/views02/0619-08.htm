<p>I.F. Stone, the great independent journalist of the 1950s and ‘60s, once defined 

tragedy as the conflict between right and right. He was talking about Israel and 

the Palestinians. Stone had smuggled himself into the land during the British 

Mandate and his sympathetic writings of the struggle for a Jewish state made him 

a hero to Israelis, but he could empathize with the Palestinians too. Since then 

the rightful claims of both sides has led to a multitude of wrongs. 

<p>While there are difficulties to work out besides the border, the real sticking 

points are the ambitions of a minority on each side to claim all the land between 

the Jordan and Mediterranean. 

<p>Orthodox Judaism is split on the question of occupying the West Bank (which 

they refer to as Judea and Samaria). Some even opposed the establishment of the 

state of Israel on the grounds that it was necessary for the Messiah to appear 

first. Others believe that the Messiah will only appear after all of Biblical 

Israel is occupied by Jews. (They also believe the Messiah is waiting for them 

to rebuild the Temple, which is deemed to be on the site of the Dome of the Rock.) 

A typical statement is one made by a West Bank settler to Bill Moyers (4/5/02): 

“This land belongs to us. And there is proof all through the Bible.” 

<p>The argument, however, is based more on tradition than on Torah. The Bible 

mentions the Promised Land six times, and it is not always the same. In Genesis 

12:7 and 13:15 the extent of the land promised is unspecified. In 15:18 it stretches 

from the Nile to the Euphrates; that is, taking in much of present day Egypt, 

Jordan, and Iraq. Not even the most fervently orthodox Jew has claimed that much 

land, yet there it is in Genesis. However, Genesis 17:8 defines the Promised Land 

as Canaan, which is less than present-day Israel. The most specific definition 

of the Promised Land occurs in Numbers 34:1-12 where its southern boundary would 

chop off much of the Negev while its northern boundary includes much of Lebanon 

and Syria. The Promised Land is mentioned again in Deuteronomy 1:7-8, but its 

extent there is unclear. 

<p>If God can be flexible about the extent of the Promised Land, one might ask, 

why can’t the settlers? 

<p>There is nothing in the Torah that says that Jews must occupy all the land 

between the Mediterranean and the Jordan, or build a Temple on the Temple Mount, 

in order for the Messiah to come. Nor does it say anywhere that even if God gave 

the land to the Jews they can’t be generous and offer a portion of it to the Palestinians 

so both people can enjoy a homeland. While Biblical Israel was sacred to King 

Solomon, that did not prevent him from giving away twenty villages in the Galilee 

to Hiram, the King of Tyre as payment for the wood to build the Temple. This is 

recorded in Kings I, without rebuke or dissent. 

<p>If these arguments are not persuasive, and they probably won’t be, then the 

only thing left for the majority who believe that the promise of peace is more 

important than the promise of land is to assert that priority by cutting off support 

for the settlements and, if necessary, physically closing them. 

<p>I have asked several people who believe passionately that the settlements are 

sacred what their solution would be to the conflict. Usually, they just shrug. 

Either they genuinely don’t know, or they believe that the settlers are doing 

their part and now it is up to God to do His. An increasing number, however, have 

a solution they call “transfer,” which is a euphemism for exile. They believe 

that the Palestinians, at least most of them, should be physically removed from 

all the land west of the Jordan. How, they don’t know. Where, they don’t care. 

<p>Anyone who is not talking about closing settlements is not talking about peace. 

<p>The other intransigent problem is the ongoing determination of Hamas and other 

extremists to obliterate Israel. On the January 27 telecast of “60 Minutes,” Abu 

Marzuk, a senior Hamas official, told Steve Croft that he would accept having 

a Palestinian state within the 1967 frontiers “at least in this stage.” How can 

you make peace with someone who holds in reserve the ambition to destroy you? 

Even if Palestinian leaders were to renounce that goal, it would still require 

trading something tangiblelandfor something as intangible as someone’s word. No 

wonder the idea makes Israelis nervous. The failure of any Palestinians to put 

forth a peace proposal of their own feeds Israeli suspicion on this score. 

<p>But the present situation simply puts those who would destroy Israel within 

Israel. Strategically, it would make more sense to create a more secure border 

and put them outside Israel proper. (And, no, Jordan is not going to take them.) 

That by itself, however, is not enough to ensure Israel’s security. What that 

would take is for the United States or NATO to guarantee Israel’s existence. That 

might take patrols, it would certainly require continued military assistance, 

and it would ultimately mean a willingness guaranteed by treaty to intervene if 

Israel’s existence were threatened. 

<p>The comment by Abba Eben about the Palestinians, that they never miss an opportunity 

to miss an opportunity, is now becoming applicable to Israel as well. The offer 

made by Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia for all the Arab countries to make 

peace with Israel in return for a Palestinian state in the lands occupied by Israel 

as a result of the 1967 war is an opportunity for a dialog. It is not perfect 

as it stands; the devil may well lurk in the details. But it is as reasonable 

a basis for further discussion as the offer made by Barak to Arafat at Camp David, 

yet Israel, so far, has spurned it. 

<p>A majority of Israelis favor a Palestinian state on the West Bank and Gaza 

now. A poll conducted for Yedioth Ahronoth May 14, 2002 found 63% of Israelis 

in favor of a Palestinian state as part of a permanent peace agreement (reported 

by Americans for Peace Now). A feeling of security would increase their numbers. 

That is contrary to the ambitions of Palestinian militants. At the same time, 

by insisting that no negotiations will take place until there is a complete halt 

to terrorist attacks, Sharonwhose Likud Party recently voted to oppose the establishment 

of a Palestinian State anywhere west of the Jordangives terrorists a veto over 

any attempt at an agreement. 

<p>For the terrorists, the settlements are a recruiting tool, indicating to moderate 

Palestinians that they will never have a viable country of their own. For the 

settlers, the terrorists prove that peace is not an option so the country may 

as well hold on to the West Bank. 

<p>The Settlers and the Terrorists need each other, but who needs them
