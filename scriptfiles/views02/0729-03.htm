<p>The daily beat of the Washington drum gets louder and more insistent. It is 

assumed that Britain will answer the president's call to arms against Iraq. Every 

troop movement or redeployment by the UK Ministry of Defence is interpreted by 

commentators with urgent and inevitable significance. But before Bush comes to 

shove, the British government owes the people of the UK a clear explanation of 

the reasons why British forces may be asked to put their lives at risk. 

<P>By any standards, the prime minister's performance before the chairmen and 

women of the select committees of the House of Commons was a virtuoso one. But 

in his answers to the chairman of the foreign affairs committee, and to Charles 

Kennedy the following day at prime minister's questions, there were more than 

a few latent ambiguities, which Mr Blair did nothing to dispel in his end-of-term 

report to the press last week. 

<P>Let us begin by accepting that it is a reasonable assumption that Iraq under 

Saddam Hussein has continued to develop programs for chemical and biological weapons 

and may have the means of delivery. We can't be so sure of nuclear capability 

but, to be on the safe side, let us assume that Saddam Hussein is working towards 

it, as he has been in the past. 

<P>No government committed to the security of its citizens can sensibly exclude, 

in all possible circumstances, the use of military force. But equally, no government 

committed to the rule of international law can choose war unless it is convinced 

that all other avenues of action have been tried and exhausted. 

<P>It should be the first priority of the UN security council and all of its members 

to return the weapons inspectors to Iraq. We should not abandon the strategy of 

containment and deterrence followed since the end of the Gulf war in favor of 

military action unless there is compelling and immediate evidence that self-defence 

requires it. 

<P>What is the objective of current British policy towards Iraq? Military action 

should never be undertaken without clear and realistic political objectives that 

are capable of achievement. The current sanctions policy and no-fly zones are 

designed to contain the Iraqi regime and limit its ability to develop weapons, 

threaten its neighbors or destabilize the region. Can British national security 

only be served by joining in military action for the removal of the current regime? 

<P>If policy on Iraq is to change, the prime minister needs to inform the country. 

Even with a majority of 180, he cannot expect to be taken on trust. He cannot 

even expect to be taken on trust by his own party. 

<P>Where is the evidence to justify a change of policy? The prime minister has 

said that the government is planning to publish the evidence against Saddam Hussein, 

but that he would need to "choose his time" to do this. That time is now. If the 

government has the evidence, it should publish it. If the government is confident 

of its case, it should take it to the British people. 

<P>Just how will military action achieve a better state of peace? Does the British 

government share the somewhat improbable view of some US officials who claim that 

a new regime in Baghdad will create a "benign ripple effect" throughout the region, 

encouraging open and democratic government in neighboring Arab states and helping 

to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict? 

<P>What if these officials are wrong and instead of a ripple of democracy there 

is a bow wave of instability? What if the Kurds in the north of Iraq use change 

in Baghdad as an opportunity to declare an independent Kurdistan? In the present 

fragile state of politics in Turkey, how can we expect Ankara to react? And would 

Iran stand quietly by? Would a dismembered Iraq add to or subtract from stability? 

In 1991 the allies most certainly regarded the break-up of Iraq as one of several 

powerful reasons for not marching on Baghdad after Iraq had been expelled from 

Kuwait. 

<P>Under what legal authority would military action be taken? The government's 

claim is that any British action in Iraq would be "in accordance with international 

law". Existing UN resolutions can be interpreted to permit military strikes as 

part of the enforcement of weapons inspection, as they were in December 1998, 

but they do not allow for regime change. Article 51 of the UN charter gives states 

the right of self-defence, but is silent on the issue of anticipatory action in 

self-defence. Even if the right to pre-emptive action in self-defence can be inferred, 

the imminence of an attack justifying it must be urgent. "Clear and present danger" 

must be given content if it is to justify military action under article 51. 

<P>If the earlier assumption about Iraq having biological and chemical weapons 

is valid, what assessment has the MoD made about the risk of them being used against 

any British force engaged in conflict against Iraq? Even more chillingly, what 

assessment has been made about the risks of them being used against Israel, and 

of the likely response of that nuclear-capable country? 

<P>Crucially, would the deployment of British troops be subject to a debate and 

an affirmative vote of the House of Commons? The prime minister told Charles Kennedy: 

"We will obviously consider how we can best consult the House properly should 

any such action arise." That response suggests that a vote will only be forthcoming 

if the government is confident of winning it. The prime minister is right to be 

anxious. It is not only Labour backbenchers that have been expressing reservations 

but also former Tory ministers still in the House such as Douglas Hogg and John 

Gummer and, outside the House, the former foreign secretary Malcolm Rifkind. 

<P>There is only one way to consult parliament where British lives are concerned, 

and that is with a full debate and a substantive vote. If the prime minister avoids 

a vote in parliament because he thinks he would lose, he will have difficulty 

in leading public opinion in the country. 

<P>It has been a characteristic of the Falklands, the Gulf war, Bosnia, Kosovo, 

Sierra Leone and, more recently, Afghanistan, that the prime minister of the day 

has enjoyed majority support for British involvement in military action. As Sir 

Humphrey might say, it would be "courageous" of the prime minister to embark on 

a military campaign without public support this time. He can only expect that 

support if he answers the questions I have posed and takes the British people 

into his confidence.
