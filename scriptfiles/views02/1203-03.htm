<p>The president clearly does not want to know the truth about Sept. 11. Otherwise 

he would not have appointed Henry Kissinger to head an inquiry into the origins 

of arguably the most successful terrorist attack in history. Long an unabashed 

advocate of concealing and distorting the truth in the name of national security, 

he is the last guy who has the right to ask someone in government, "What did you 

know and when did you know it?"

<p>Kissinger, after all, was the member of the Nixon White House most bent on 

destroying Daniel Ellsberg for giving a copy of the Pentagon Papers, the government's 

secret history of the Vietnam War, to the New York Times. His obsession with preventing 

all government leaks, except those of his creation, is well documented in the 

Nixon tapes. And this is the man who publicly lied about everything from the bombing 

of Cambodia to the cover-up of the Watergate break-in of Democratic Party headquarters 

to the overthrow and death of the democratically elected leader of Chile.

<p>But even if truth serum could be slipped into his morning espresso, Kissinger 

still would be an appalling choice to lead what should be the fearless, unbiased 

fact-finding investigation necessary to prevent future tragedies like the destruction 

of the World Trade Center towers.

<p> He has been much too personally embroiled in the gamesmanship, greed and opportunism 

underlying politics in the Mideast; neither is he willing to disclose his long 

list of lucrative government and business contracts that pose potential conflicts 

of interest.

<p>For example, Kissinger Associates, the former secretary of State's ultra-connected 

consulting firm, has had dealings in the past with Saudi Arabia and Kuwait -- 

the two nations most closely linked with the 9/11 hijackers -- and was the subject 

of a congressional investigation for its role in the $4-billion bankrolling of 

Saddam Hussein in the late 1980s by the Atlanta office of Italy's BNL bank. Kissinger 

Associates then included Brent Scowcroft, who became national security advisor 

for President George H.W. Bush, and Lawrence Eagleburger, secretary of State in 

that administration.

<p>That those ties crisscross with other suspicious activities of close Bush family 

advisors -- including Poppy Bush's consulting role with the Carlyle Group that 

took him to Saudi Arabia to drum up business -- makes Kissinger's selection as 

understandable as it is dishonest.

<p>The truth is, the administration doesn't want a commission looking into what 

went wrong on Sept. 11 because its focus might turn too close to home. The incoming 

Bush administration in 2001 ignored dire warnings from Clinton National Security 

Advisor Sandy Berger that Al Qaeda was the major security threat facing the U.S. 

Instead, the new administration focused on the war on drugs and even funneled 

"humanitarian" aid to Taliban-run Afghanistan as a reward for the fundamentalists' 

eradication of an opium crop.

<p>The truth about Sept. 11 might dampen Bush's exploitation of tragedy to draw 

attention from a sagging economy, a down stock market and stunning financial scandals 

that began with the downfall of Bush's close buddies at Enron. How convenient 

to divert the public's attention from other problems with the notion that the 

whole world must be turned upside down to combat terrorism, when marginal and 

avoidable mistakes by our government allowed the dreams of madmen to be fulfilled 

in blood.

<p>Would the monstrous new homeland security bureaucracy really have protected 

us from a few box-cutter-wielding nuts? How difficult, after all, is it to prevent 

people already on a terrorist wanted list from entering the country to attend 

U.S. flight schools? How hard is it for the president of the United States to 

get the FBI and the CIA to talk to each other? And why are we apparently going 

to war with Iraq, which had nothing to do with Sept. 11, instead of with Saudi 

Arabia, which did?

<p>The Bush administration was floundering before Sept. 11, and it still seems 

to have difficulty dealing with the nation's domestic problems. Instead of facing 

that harsh reality, Bush wants us to welcome the shredding of constitutional protections, 

allegedly for our own protection, and be excited at the prospect of a sideshow 

war with Hussein. 

<p>Best to not look too hard at any of this. The Bush administration resisted 

convening a 9/11 commission for more than a year and, when forced by overwhelming 

public pressure to do so, picked an infamous man with the legendary chops to quash 

any search for truth.
