<p>WorldCom and Enron have become symbols of the problems corporate crime can 

pose for employees and investors.</P>

<P>Many investors now distrust all the information they receive from corporations, 

and many workers worry about accumulating enough for a secure retirement. The 

Bush administration, attuned to these growing middle-class concerns, promises 

to get tough on fraud and other white-collar crimes.</P>

<P>Yet unfortunately, much of the sensationalist coverage of financial markets 

and corporate crime glosses over the deeper problems in corporate governance. 

Jailing a few outrageous liars and cheaters will do little more than serve up 

a few sacrificial lambs. Without greater democratization of the U.S. corporation 

and more just structures of compensation, most workers will have little to look 

forward to during their retirement years.</P>

<P>While Bush sermonizes about corporate crime, many congressional Republicans 

continue to sing soothing lyrics. Not to worry, says Republican stalwart Phil 

Gramm, just a few days before the WorldCom crash. The market is now aware of the 

problems posed by deceitful CEOs and complicit directors. The New York Stock Exchange 

is voluntarily demanding that corporations on its list hire independent directors. 

Corporations are bending over backward to provide comprehensive and honest annual 

reports. The market will punish corporations and investment houses that play games. 

Further governmental initiatives aren't necessary. </P>

<P>Enron's and WorldCom's blatant and outrageous fraud was probably rare even 

in the heady days of the high-tech bonanza. The larger problem lies in the charades, 

exaggerations and studied forms of denial that go on between corporate managements 

and Wall Street brokerage houses.</P>

<P>The Washington Post pointed out May 12 that even after admonitions to provide 

candid information, most corporations issue annual reports that ignore bad news 

or blame it "on uncontrollable factors such as the weather, the economy, the stock 

market or government regulation. . . . There is precious little data and analysis 

on the key operating measures that executives themselves look at to assess the 

company's performance - things such as inventory turns or the cost for each new 

subscriber. . . ."</P>

<P>Conservatives argue that the job of investment houses is to sort through this 

fluff so that clients can make sound investments. Brokerage firms that buy corporate 

image will fail in the marketplace. They are probably right in the long run, but 

all of us don't retire in the long run. Even if investment houses restructure 

analysts' compensation to depend on the value of clients' portfolios, the system 

as a whole will still be highly susceptible to fits of mass euphoria or hysteria. 

Individual analysts whose income now is tied to the paper wealth of their clients 

may often still have an interest in getting aboard or helping to foster new market 

bubbles. </P>

<P>Even skeptical and scrupulous industry analysts may have difficulty in many 

situations. Those managements that can skillfully massage the news will continue 

to induce interest in their stock. The stock price will rise and analysts who 

don't get on the bandwagon will look foolish. They may not retain jobs or clients 

long enough to mutter, "I told you so," as the bubble bursts.</P>

<P>If pension funds are to become equitable retirement instruments, our corporate 

order must start by providing more equal information to all. Independent board 

members are a feeble start. Preventing auditors from also being hired as consultants, 

as provided in a sweeping new law signed by President Bush on Tuesday, will be 

a better place to start. Nonetheless, it still fails to address the many forms 

of sugarcoated information to which The Post alludes.</P>

<P>A sounder course of action would be to require both worker and consumer representation 

on corporate boards and a broader voice for workers in corporate governance.</P>

<P>Worker and consumer representatives must have full access not only to financial 

but to product and operating information. Lost in all the current discussions 

of auditing tricks are the many ways that earlier deceptions regarding the potential 

toxicity of the product and/or production processes brought down many corporate 

behemoths. Nor are such sordid tales as asbestos and tobacco liability confined 

to ancient history. Just this past May, Schering-Plough was forced to pay $500 

million in fines for producing prescription and over-the-counter drugs in factories 

that failed to meet minimal manufacturing standards. </P>

<P>More honest and efficient corporate performance depends less upon harsh criminal 

sanctions than it does on the voice and role both workers and the public can have 

in spotting and preventing malfeasance. The modern corporation is a publicly chartered 

entity enjoying immense legal and economic privileges. Yet here in the United 

States, unlike many European nations, most corporate employees enjoy minimal rights 

to organize, seldom have an equity stake in their firms and cannot even exercise 

basic rights of free speech within the workplace. More than half of U.S. workers 

don't even have pensions to be wiped out by market collapse. Deprived of such 

basic rights, many workers are unable to negotiate even minimal pensions. When 

workers are disenfranchised, corporations and the public also lose capable whistleblowers 

and vital talents.</P>

<P>The cycles of boom and bust that characterize our history have been driven 

in part by systematic misinformation followed by public revulsion. As the dust 

from WorldCom and other corporate swindles fades, investors and policy analysts 

would do well to step back and take a broad look at this history. Our stock market 

has always been a crapshoot. Left Business Observer editor Doug Henwood points 

out that $10,000 invested in the market in 1937 would have yielded $250,000 30 

years later, while $10,000 invested in 1972 would yield $73,000 today. </P>

<P>Even after recent declines, the stock market today is still trading at a price-to-earnings 

ratio somewhat above historic averages. If future earnings "restatements" lower 

earnings even further, there may be even more downside risk. For the market to 

deliver returns equivalent to the 1967 returns cited by Henwood, one must make 

heroic assumptions about either the rate of growth of profits or long-term changes 

in the price-to-earnings ratio investors are willing to accept.</P>

<P>Social Security, a frequent target of conservatives, is on more solid foundations 

than the market. Despite relying on absurdly pessimistic assumptions about overall 

economic growth, Social Security trustees can still report the system is financially 

sound for almost four more decades. Even at that point it would need only modest 

changes to remain solvent another four decades. </P>

<P>Perhaps the most important short-term reform would be to demand that all workers 

covered by private pensions be extended options that include lower-risk, long-term 

annuities.</P>

<P>Employers offering pensions should also be required to provide access to genuinely 

independent advice regarding risks and opportunities. </P>

<P>An adequate retirement income for Americans begins with a healthy Social Security 

system uncorrupted by risky privatization schemes. It must be supplemented by 

pension funds for all workers premised on equal information and opportunities 

for less risky investments. These opportunities, in turn, depend on workers' winning 

a greater voice in corporate affairs. The stock market is no magic bullet. A comfortable 

retirement for most of us will require some heavy political lifting. </P>
