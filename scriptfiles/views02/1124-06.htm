<p> Officially, the market is a place of opportunity once big government steps 

aside. An opportunity for whom is the question. Meanwhile, the U.S. political 

system is increasingly relying on taxpayer dollars to protect rich people from 

market harm, unlike workers. Consider what Congress recently did (not) do for 

property insurers and workers. 

<p>Both houses of Congress just passed a federal terrorism insurance bill. It 

makes the U.S. taxpayer subsidize the cash reserves of property insurers to the 

tune of approximately $300 billion should the nation be attacked by terrorists 

in the future. The private terrorism insurance market will be protected by public 

funds after President Bush signs this bill on Nov. 26. 

<p>The president had claimed that the insurance bill would help create new jobs 

in the construction industry. The evidence for his assertion was not forthcoming. 

The market is truly a miracle for property insurers. When the public’s wallet 

is spread wide for the pickings by Capitol Hill and the White House, of course. 

<p>On the outside of this market solution looking in are about one million jobless 

workers. Their unemployment insurance wasn’t extended by the 107th Congress. It 

finished on Nov. 22 for the year without acting to prevent the cutting off of 

these workers’ payments during the year-end holiday season. 

<p>"The cutoff arises from the fact that a temporary benefit extension approved 

by Congress earlier this year – providing 13 weeks of benefits for those who have 

exhausted their 26 weeks of basic coverage – expires Dec. 28," reported the Nov. 

23 Washington Post. "About 830,000 people will be thrown off the unemployment 

rolls at that point, and an additional 95,000 who exhaust their state benefits 

each week will get no federal aid thereafter." 

<p>According to the Nov. 17 New York Times, "The percentage of people who have 

exhausted their regular unemployment benefits is at the highest level in two decades." 

In other words, U.S. society is experiencing a major job market problem. And the 

market solution for many workers facing the vanishing of unemployment payments 

will be to take jobs at low hourly wages relative to their former jobs. 

<p>Presumably, this trend can help business restore profitability. Without profits, 

the creation of jobs slows down. This trend is certainly underway. Current business 

spending on new employees and equipment is weak. 

<p>Case in point is the Federal Reserve Bank’s recent interest-rate cut to 1.25 

percent. On wonders how low can the Fed go before eliminating its policy options 

to stimulate the economy. At the same time, Congress is turning its back on lending 

a hand to the people whose labor-power makes the economy grow. 

<p>Monetary policy is going in one direction. Fiscal policy is heading the other 

way. 

<p>Such lack of coordination creates a contradiction, the resolution of which 

is currently hard to predict. 

<p>Uncle Sam’s redistributing of income upward towards property insurers helps 

to pave the way for prolonged economic stagnation. Capitalists with large cash 

reserves don’t spend most of their income on the necessaries of life. Their spending 

patterns reflect the class interests of spending based on investment returns, 

unlike that of the general public. 

<p>The federal government’s redistributing of income downward could stimulate 

the economy. Such a policy would put more cash in people’s pockets to buy goods 

and services, thereby bolstering business spending. Accordingly, defunding workers’ 

jobless payments further weakens their buying power and the U.S. economy. 

<p>It is unclear how long political circles of U.S. power can maintain their credibility 

embedded in the concept of national security. It isn’t putting a chicken in the 

pots of a growing number of people. They are suffering from a souring job market 

and a cold shoulder from Congress. </p>
