<p>Wow. When just before 11 September this year, The Independent asked me to pen 

a response to the question "What has changed since 11 September 2002?", I had 

no idea what my musings would cost. I innocently &#150; perhaps naively &#150; 

wrote about what I think is the main change in America since that horrible day. 

I wrote about the suppression of public dissent and the erosion of civil liberties 

in the United States, which as I see it are among the most dire threats that country 

now faces. Little did I know that I was about to experience exactly how fearfully 

limited public debate in America really is.</p>

<p>Somehow, my expression of dismay was twisted in a highly selective retelling 

in the New York Post, a right-wing tabloid, as "an America-loathing diatribe. 

Little... in the foreign press outside al-Jazeera comes close to Roddick's viciousness". 

I was astonished to read that I was suddenly a supporter of terrorism and a hater 

of Americans and devastated at the idea that any American would assume that I 

was not outraged by the barbaric attacks of 11 September.</p>

<p>So let me just be absolutely clear about this &#150; I hate terrorism and I 

hate terrorists.</p>

<p>I have a deep admiration for much that is American. My grandparents emigrated 

to America. My father was born in America. My daughter lives in America. I had 

assumed that my sorrow for 11 September went without saying. And I have repeatedly 

couched my criticism of President Bush in the context of this admiration. It's 

as though, as I leapt to America's defense, some people &#150; perhaps rattled 

by a year of terrorism warnings and haunting memories &#150; assumed I was going 

for its throat.</p>

<p>It didn't help that the Post, a bastion of right-wing simple-minded thinking, 

had deliberately and outrageously misrepresented my opinion. Somehow, my criticism 

of George Bush had been equated with a hatred of the country he leads, as if a 

leader and his country were one and the same, as if all Americans support George 

Bush without reservation or exception.</p>

<p>When I am feeling particularly generous, I suppose this is a simple misunderstanding 

by a few people who accidentally missed my point. But I also fear that perhaps 

this is the natural result of the atmosphere created when a sitting president 

tells his subjects that "you're either with us or you're with the terrorists".</p>

<p>Criticism of Bush, then, is tantamount to friendship with Bin Laden. The mind 

reels at the logic. Teddy Roosevelt must be spinning in his grave. He's the beloved 

American president who said: "To announce that there must be no criticism of the 

president, or that we are to stand by the president right or wrong, is not only 

unpatriotic and servile, but is morally treasonable to the American public."</p>

<p>None the less, I quickly learnt what abuse has been leveled at other people 

who have dared to criticize the Bush administration in the past 12 months. I hadn't 

realized just how brave other people had been to take even the most reasonable 

public stand against government policies with which they disagreed. Even though 

I wrote that I worried about the suppression of public dissent, I suppose I naively 

miscalculated my own entry into that arena. I admit that I was gobsmacked at the 

vicious, hateful, threatening messages directed at me after that essay appeared. 

It was comforting to know, however, that I was suddenly reviled alongside such 

admirable thinkers as Norman Mailer, Noam Chomsky, Erica Jong, Susan Sontag, Robert 

Fisk and Ralph Nader. Again, good company to find yourself in!</p>

<p>When the vitriol first started trickling in, I thought to myself: "Am I crazy? 

Was I wrong? Is this what you get for defending the Bill of Rights? Is there really 

something un-American about saying that the constitution is precious?" It was 

Kafkaesque &#150; I was fighting shadows, trying to make a few strangers understand 

that they had been misled, that I didn't hate them, that I am anything but un-American.</p>

<p>It's as though these few people are so desperate to find an enemy at which 

to hurl the anger and hurt of 11 September that they are lashing out blindly. 

I just happened to have stepped in front of their fists. But most of the responses 

I got from those who were angry just seemed to get it all wrong:</p>

<p>"I think you're all goose-stepping Nazis deep inside. I know Osama and gang 

would never do you any harm &#150; after all you are his breeding ground." As 

if a Nazi or an Osama bin Laden would argue for civil liberties.</p>

<p>"If you SO despise America, then take your shitty products and get the fuck 

out! There is no need for us to shop for your filth if you are going to talk shit 

and lie about a country that made your fortune." As if I had said I despise America, 

and as if I'd made a fortune in the United States (hardly!).</p>

<p>Some were astounding, coming from self-proclaimed patriots and defenders of 

America:</p>

<p>"This lady should look at the laws imposed in the UK in WWII. When a country 

is under attack, they cannot be as open as they once were. Hopefully, we will 

have our liberties returned when the crisis is over. But I'm not holding my breath." 

As if the loss of basic freedoms warranted nothing more than an "oh well".</p>

<p>But most were just funny:</p>

<p>"Years ago, I discovered... that Anita is a 'watermelon' (green on the outside 

and red on the inside)."</p>

<p>"Going into a Body Shop is like stepping into a nouveau-hippy paradise. Pot-based 

lotions, hug-a-tree cleansers, you name it. It should come as no surprise that 

a retail equivalent of an Al Gore-Lenin merger is headed by a flaming left-wing 

communist."</p>

<p>"Anita needs reminding that the enemy thinks her products are sinful and would 

like to behead any one selling or using them."</p>

<p>This, apparently, is the caliber of conservative political discourse among 

my detractors.</p>

<p>But I have received far more letters of support than hate mail, almost all 

of it from Americans:</p>

<p>One read: "I am alarmed that George Bush is taking away our right to free speech 

in the guise of defending our country against terrorists. Just because Bush has 

said that 'you're with us or against us' doesn't make it so."</p>

<p>"I am a California human rights attorney and a customer of The Body Shop... 

I was pleased to read Ms Roddick's column, which I took as a call to defend what 

are usually regarded as America's finest values &#150; freedom of speech and association 

among them &#150; against the depredations of a power-hungry and opportunistic 

government. I did not take it as a condemnation of America, and I fail to see 

how any intellectually honest reader could have done so."</p>

<p>I quickly realized that a large number of Americans, if not a majority of them, 

feel much the way I do. But it is a vocal vigilante minority that is attempting 

to intimidate those with whom it disagrees, and it is able to do this with the 

encouragement of Bush, who &#150; by equating dissenters with terrorists &#150; 

has declared open season on anyone who disagrees with him.</p>

<p>Which, of course, proves precisely the point of my original article: the freedom 

to dissent is in danger in America. Maybe I didn't realize I was leaping into 

the fire, but I'm not sorry I did. As G&uuml;nter Grass said: "The job of a citizen 

is to keep his mouth open."</p>
