<p>WHEN SOMEBODY bids too much at an auction or when a corporate raider overpays 

to acquire a company, this is known as the ''winner's curse.'' The too-eager winner 

would literally have been better off if somebody else had won. 

<P>To a great extent, the winners of yesterday's election will suffer from a political 

winner's curse. What they are facing is not pretty.</P>

<P>Start with the states. Democrats enjoyed some pick-ups of governorships. But 

the states have not been in such fiscal straits since the 1970s. All but a few 

states face huge deficits. This is less the result of past spending sprees than 

of economic slowdown and the reduction in federal aid.</P>

<P>Federal tax cutting and program reduction at the expense of aid to the states 

should have been a big election issue, but it wasn't. Republican gubernatorial 

candidates and incumbents were more loyal to their president and his ideology 

than to their own constituents. Most Democrats either didn't raise the issue or 

couldn't make it resonate.</P>

<P>Candidates idiotically outdid each other to promise no tax increases or to 

insist that previously unnoticed budget savings could be easily reaped so that 

services would not suffer.</P>

<P>Now comes the reckoning. Any candidate for governor who told the voters it 

is possible to solve the state fiscal crisis without serious cuts in services 

or an increase in state taxes was telling a whopper. So congratulations, winners. 

You now face the unenviable task of explaining to constituents why it's not really 

your fault that services are being slashed and in many cases taxes raised as well. 

But in fact, it's mostly not the governors' fault. Instead of hectoring each other, 

governors, consumers of state services, and taxpayers should all be marching on 

George W. Bush's White House.</P>

<P>In the 1970s, Republican presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford came to the 

rescue of the states with revenue sharing. This was the ''New Federalism'' backed 

with actual resources. Bush, by contrast, talks a good federalist game. But he'd 

rather squander federal revenues on tax cuts for which he can claim credit and 

let the governors take the heat. </P>

<P>While yesterday's election was not really a referendum on him, the president 

faces heavy economic weather, too. The Federal Reserve's policy-setting committee 

meets today amid signs that the economy is continuing to weaken. Many analysts 

are calling for yet another cut in short-term interest rates, perhaps all the 

way from the current four-decade low of 1.75 percent to 1.25 percent.</P>

<P>The Fed is in a jam. If it does cut rates, it signals that the Fed agrees that 

things are pretty bleak. If the Fed fails to cut rates, it is confessing that 

it's out of tricks. The economy is on the edge of a double-dip recession. Business 

profits can't gain traction because the economy still suffers from all the over-investment 

of the 1990s.</P>

<P>With profits weak, business is laying off workers rather than hiring new ones. 

The layoffs, in turn, drag down consumer spending, which then reinforces the weak 

profits. To complete the cycle, the dismal profits serve to short circuit any 

durable stock market rally. Accounting scandals and lax regulation continue to 

sow doubts about whether even reported corporate profits are real.</P>

<P>The only thing keeping the economy afloat is those very low interest rates. 

Consumers may be pinched, but mortgages are a bargain; new car financing deals 

are great; and home equity loans are there to be tapped.</P>

<P>But this source of stimulus can go on only so long. Lower rates could mean 

a cheaper dollar, and perhaps inflation. Inflation invites higher rates. But with 

the economy so dependent on very cheap credit, any hike in rates would be a disaster. 

If, say, a war triggered even mild inflation and the Fed had to raise rates, things 

could get really nasty.</P>

<P>There is no easy cure for this condition. Eventually, the excess capacity of 

the 1990s will be worked off or written off. And eventually, some political party 

will again come to power actually believing in public investment. That would be 

good for those hard pressed states. It would also create more jobs. But with both 

parties tripping over each other to swear off serious public outlay, that day 

won't come soon. So the economy will remain soft for a while.</P>

<P>In the meantime, although Congress remains closely divided, it's a Republican 

administration setting the agenda. And a Republican president will be held accountable 

by voters two years from now. </P>
