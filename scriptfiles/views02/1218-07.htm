<p>Are capitalism and caviar incompatible? Is the system that prides itself 

on the creation and veneration of wealth unable to to maintain a 

sustainable market for one of the great trappings of wealth? 



<p>Well, at the very least, the tragic story of the global caviar industry 

gives pause. It stands as a parable illustrating the pitfalls of the 

market fundamentalist ideology that has dominated global economic 

policy-making for two decades. 



<p>The story of the industry is recounted in a new book by Inga Saffron, a 

Philadelphia Inquirer reporter and former Moscow correspondent for the 

paper, Caviar: The Strange History and Uncertain Future of the World's 

Most Coveted Delicacy (New York: Broadway Books). 



<p>For most of the twentieth century, the world caviar market was supplied 

primarily by the Soviet Union. Caviar -- the salted eggs of sturgeon or 

paddlefish -- is a creation of Russian culture. Although sturgeon once 

populated many of the world's great seas and rivers in large numbers, 

most of the world's supply after World War I came from the Caspian Sea 

and the Black Sea. 



<p>After coming to power, Saffron says, "the Soviets realized they could 

make a lot of money if they controlled the caviar market." 



<p>They exported the product to Western markets to earn hard currency, but 

limited supply to increase prices. 



<p>"I don't want to say that they had a great environmental record, because 

they didn't," Saffron says. "But they did act as a brake on fishing 

because they limited caviar exports." 



<p>Even when the Soviets embarked on their disastrous dam-building schemes, 

which blocked sturgeon from swimming upstream to spawn, they developed 

an extensive hatchery system that maintained the sturgeon population. 



<p>Communism, it turned out, was pretty good for caviar. 



<p>When the Soviet Union collapsed, so did the protections and support 

system for caviar. 



<p>In the chaos following the fall of the Soviet Union, factories across 

the country stopped doing business as government money for operating 

expenses evaporated. Funding to maintain the hatcheries similarly 

disappeared, and the hatchery system fell apart. Overall, Saffron says, 

the hatchery system became much less efficient, and was able to put back 

many fewer fish than it had before. 



<p>Even worse, perhaps, was the rampant poaching that occurred after the 

fall of the USSR. 



<p>"Many of the people who had been thrown out of work began to fish 

illegally," according to Saffron. "They began to poach for sturgeon and 

make caviar in their kitchens, because that is the only way they could 

make money. It was the one resource in Southern Russia." 



<p>The old Soviet limits on fishing "were ignored, and people just fished 

all the time," she says. 



<p>Enforcement agencies were weak and ineffectual. Many were bought off or 

intimidated by the criminal gangs that gained control over much of the industry. 



<p>Today, the sturgeon in the Russian and Kazakhstan portions of the 

Caspian are in steep decline, and Saffron has little hope that they will 

be saved. International controls on caviar imports are coming too 

little, too late, and in any case cannot stop the internal traffic in 

the delicacy. 



<p>The collapse of the sturgeon in the Russian and Kazakhstan portions of 

the Caspian is history repeating itself. Rampant overfishing led to the 

rapid destruction of sturgeon populations in Germany, France, the 

Eastern United States and the U.S. Great Lakes, all in a matter of 

decades in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. 



<p>Today, the counterexample to the laissez-faire caviar failure is Iran. 

Like the Soviet Union once did, Iran maintains strong limits on fish 

catch in its portion of the Caspian and operates a sophisticated and 

effective hatchery system. 



<p>Countries relying only on price signals to regulate the industry have 

witnessed a short cycle of boom and bust. 



<p>Countries that have succeeded in maintaining a viable caviar industry 

over time have made long-term investments in infrastructure and put in 

place systems to ensure sustainable management of limited resources. 



<p>Those are key elements for effective economic management and a livable 

world. 



<p>Markets alone will not deliver them.
