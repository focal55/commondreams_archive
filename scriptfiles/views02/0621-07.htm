<p>The journalist I.F. Stone used to joke that the government issues so much information 

every day, it can't help but let the truth slip out every once in a while. The 

Bush Administration's recent report on global warming is a classic example. Though 

far from perfect, it contains some crucial but awkward truths that neither George 

W. Bush nor his environmentalist critics want to confront. Which may explain why 

the Administration has sought to bury the report, while critics have misrepresented 

its most ominous conclusion. </p>

<p> <i>U.S. Climate Action Report 2002</i> made headlines because it contradicted 

so much of what the Administration has said about global warming. Not only is 

global warming real, according to the report, but its consequences--heat waves, 

water shortages, rising sea levels, loss of beaches and marshes, more frequent 

and violent weather--will be punishing for Americans. The report's biggest surprise 

was its admission that human activities, especially the burning of oil and other 

fossil fuels, are the primary cause of climate change. Of course, the rest of 

the world has known since 1995 that human actions have "a discernible impact" 

on the global climate, to quote a landmark report by the United Nations Intergovernmental 

Panel on Climate Change. But the White House has resisted this conclusion. After 

all, if burning fossil fuels is to blame for global warming, it makes sense to 

burn less of them. To a lifelong oilman like Bush, who continues to rely on his 

former industry colleagues for campaign contributions as well as senior staff, 

such a view is nothing less than heresy. </p>

<p>No wonder, then, that Bush and his high command have virtually repudiated the 

report. Although their staffs helped write it, both EPA Administrator Christine 

Todd Whitman and Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham claimed they were unaware of 

the report until the <i>New York Times </i>disclosed its existence on June 3. 

Bush himself dismissed it as a mere product of "the bureaucracy," that oft-vilified 

bogyman of right-wing ideology. But he could equally have blamed his own father. 

The only reason <i>U.S. Climate Action Report 2002</i> was compiled in the first 

place is that George Bush the First signed a global warming treaty at the 1992 

Earth Summit that obligates the United States to periodically furnish such reports 

to the UN (one more reason, it seems, to despise treaties). But somebody in the 

Administration must have seen trouble coming, because the report could not have 

been released with less fanfare: It was simply posted on the EPA's website, three 

unguided links in from the homepage. If you weren't looking for it, you'd never 

find it. </p>

<p> The Administration has been hammered for issuing a report that on one hand 

admits that global warming threatens catastrophe but on the other maintains there 

is no need to reduce consumption of fossil fuels. The report squares this circle 

by arguing that global warming has now become inevitable, so we should focus less 

on preventing it than on adapting to it. To deal with water scarcity, for example, 

the report advocates building more dams and raising the price of water to encourage 

conservation. Critics see such recommendations as proof that the Administration 

is doing nothing about global warming. Unfortunately, it's not that simple. </p>

<p> The worst thing about the new global warming report is that it is absolutely 

correct about a fundamental but often unmentioned aspect of the problem: the lag 

effect. Most greenhouse gases remain in the atmosphere for approximately 100 years. 

The upshot of this undeniable chemical fact is that no matter what remedial steps 

are taken today, humanity is doomed to experience however much global warming 

the past 100 years of human activities will generate. That does not mean we should 

make matters worse by continuing to burn fossil fuels, as Bush foolishly urges; 

our children and grandchildren deserve better than that. It does mean, however, 

that we as a civilization must not only shift to green energy sources immediately 

but also begin planning how we will adapt to a world that is bound to be a hotter, 

drier, more disaster-punctuated place in the twenty-first century. </p>

<p> Many environmentalists know it is too late to prevent global warming; the 

best we can do is minimize its scope. They don't like to admit this truth, because 

they fear it will discourage people from making, and demanding, the personal and 

institutional changes needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. There is that 

risk. But a truth does not disappear simply because it is inconvenient. Besides, 

a green energy future would mean more, not less, economic well-being for most 

Americans, while also increasing our chances of avoiding the most extreme global 

warming scenarios. Sometimes the truth hurts. But avoiding it will hurt even more.</p>
