<p>The lasting legacy of the Vietnam War, it is often said, is Americans' demolished 

tolerance for body bags filled with U.S. men and women.

<p>True enough. But Vietnam also demolished faith in the top brass, who misled 

the American people about the mayhem happening half a world away. In the end, 

it was the acid of deception, not defeat, that dissolved the public's trust.

<p>Today the battleground is Afghanistan, not Vietnam, and the motives are nothing 

like those that led millions of U.S. soldiers into Southeast Asia. Today's is 

a different cause, a different enemy, a different military, a different time, 

a different public. Yet America is still America -- a democracy -- and thus the 

need for truth is the same today as it was 30 years ago.</p>

<p>So let's have the truth about U.S. military actions that have killed hundreds 

of Afghan civilians in the war against terrorists. 

<p>A <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines02/0720-09.htm">New York Times 

report</a> Sunday raised questions about the targeting intelligence and methods 

used in U.S. air attacks in Afghanistan, suggesting that flaws in military policy 

are contributing to the civilian deaths.

<p>What's troubling about the report is not simply the occurrence of civilian 

fatalities; they are a fact of war. What's disturbing is the sense, from the report, 

that innocent Afghan villagers, alive or dead, have been insufficiently acknowledged 

by the U.S. military.</p>

<p>"American commanders say they have not kept track of civilian deaths in Afghanistan," 

the Times noted. Worse, the report said, military commanders have often denied 

the civilian casualties "despite evidence on the ground."

<p>The humanitarian conventions of the civilized world insist that warring nations 

at least try to distinguish the innocent from the enemy. It is not always possible 

to do so, but the attempt must be made.

<p>Is the U.S. military making an adequate attempt? Are the fatalities in the 

Afghan villages unavoidable? Are they militarily necessary? Have the deadly attacks 

achieved any headway against Osama bid Laden or his minions?</p>

<p>The American public deserves the truth, because in a democracy it is ultimately 

the people who direct military policy. As a nation, we cannot divorce ourselves 

from our military's successes or failures, because in the end they are our own. 

That's another lesson from the Vietnam experience -- gone but not, we hope, forgotten.</p>
