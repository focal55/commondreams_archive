<p>Like an ad campaign, the headlines and the lead stories on the morning 

of Election Day 2002 let the jittery electorate know that the CIA under 

the Bush administration could shoot straight, from great heights and by 

remote control. It was reported that a missile had preemptively killed 

six people presumed to be Al Qaeda members (meaning capture is not 

necessary) one of whom is believed to have been the mastermind of the 

USS Cole attack. Vengeance, extermination and high-tech-unmanned sharp 

shooting all on vivid display to dazzle and assure undecided voters that 

Republicans are better killers than Democrats. By the end of the day 

Harvey Pitt resigned. It was a clever and fortunate news cycle for the 

occupation, which was looking to induce an encouraging and usable signal 

from the democracy they trashed just two years earlier.



<p>What the Bush infomercial gives the consumer is catchy and irresistible 

to some. The thrill of being frightened leads to a vote for security 

over vision. It's a bargain not unlike the born again Christian 

contracts - here's hell and here's what we'll do to make sure you don't 

end up there.



<p>During the campaign of 2000 Bush said he liked the idea of the bully 

pulpit, which is another way of saying he's a happy puppet and contented 

salesman. He uses his position as star pitchman to keep the enemy fresh 

and vivid - he keeps black and white as the real national colors and 

he'll get the contracts that he was sent to Washington to get. He is 

there to socialize the cost and privatize the profits.



<p>No one for a minute - not even the camp follower Andrew Sullivan - can 

believe the Republican party presented Bush minor as a candidate for 

America based on any evidence of qualification. Was it his vision for an 

energy diverse future - or his keen grasp of geo-political tensions and 

international cultural forces - or his appreciation of race and poverty 

- or his desire to relieve the sense of alienation that so many American 

citizens struggle with daily? Were these the horizons that the 

Republican Party felt that their candidate could address in a way no 

other candidate could?



<p>The hip voices that proclaim Bush as a shrewd politician miss the fact 

that "shrewd" is not what America needs. "Shrewd" is in the market place 

-we need something else from the hallowed halls of our noble capital. 

Selling policy and philosophy as if it were product is the cynical and 

disrespectful chore of the corporate raiders posing as statesmen. They 

can definitely get buyers and that's what they were after in the midterm 

elections. Enough consumers bought the product of pre-emption, war and 

nationalism. Voters were turned into stockholders voting on an 

acquisition. Iraq was sold as one of those acquisitions and a killer 

security system was thrown in as a major bonus.



<p>Bush as the spokesperson for these products is the point of his 

occupancy. That was his job description. He is there to pump up the 

villains and call in the troops and pay back the backers. James Baker 

did not go to Florida in November 2000 as a patriot. He went down there 

to protect his Carlyle Group investors and his investment - the 

stumbling racehorse who could easily now also be called War Emblem.



<p>The occupation continues to sell their products that they have convinced 

us we need. Threat levels; chatter and credible warnings - smoking 

mushroom clouds - these are the fear factors that make the occupation 

necessary and approved of. The administration is a black hole around 

which a lot is said and agitated. When looking for a direction or a 

vision the essence of why Bush was put there is that he must not provide 

one. And he doesn't. All he has to say is "We're gonna get 'em." (In 

fact that's all he ever really says) and the contracts and the public 

funds needed to seemingly do that are merrily funneled to where he was 

asked to funnel them.



<p>Along with the returns the most terrifying thing on election night TV 

was "Journeys with George", the documentary that followed the 2000 Bush 

campaign. It seemed as though he was briefed that he must get the press 

to fall in love with him. Like Willy Loman, the most important thing for 

a salesman is to be liked. So instead of this behind-the-scene footage 

giving us a glimpse into the thinking process of a potential leader this 

is what we heard. The spunky interviewer asks George, "What about the 

little guy?" To which the Republican candidate responds, "Hey - I'm a 

little guy. I'm...5'11"." Offensive charm is abundant in the midst of 

the charm offensive.



<p>The concept of a "little guy" was too bizarre and alien for him to even 

have an opinion or plan about. The woman asking the question was someone 

he could "mess" with. She was just some quirky liberal to be handled - 

not a "major league asshole" as he referred to a reporter from the New 

York Times when he thought no one was listening. This "gal" was just a 

"head cold" with a lens and some questions that he, along with his 

candidacy, was incapable of taking seriously.



<p>Bush is not a little guy - he's a small mind with a narrow scope and a 

sales pitch. The fact he was deemed to be the best front man for the 

forces that put him there speaks volumes about those forces. Bush did 

not hopscotch around the country to inspire - he took Air Force One 

hither and yon to scare and herd the voters. It was a weird 

psychological swagger - the Bushmaster - not quite trigger-happy but 

trigger ready - cocked and committed to pulverize anything and anyone, 

except himself that would threaten the peace. It was and continues to be 

a high gloss, predictable and painful infomercial. The sales are good. 

Thirty years ago there was another salesman who was even better. He won 

every state in his re-election - except one. Two years later - he was, 

as this infomercial host also must be, forced to resign. But in the 

present circumstances it would be more precise to say that Bush would 

not be resigning, he would be forced to return stolen goods.
