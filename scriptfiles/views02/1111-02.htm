<p>During his final, frantic -- and ultimately wildly successful -- 

15-states-in-five-days campaign spree, President Bush repeatedly 

exhorted Americans to be "willing to serve something greater than 

ourselves."



<p>But, in truth, it's pretty obvious he didn't really expect us to listen.



<p>As Bill Maher writes in his just released book "When You Ride 

Alone, You Ride with bin Laden": "We were asked to do very little  and we responded. That's the bargain we tacitly make with our 

presidents: We won't ask too much of you, if you don't ask too 

much of us."



<p>And true to form, in speech after speech, the president has been 

asking very little of us. At one stop he recommended we "be a Boy Scout leader or a Girl Scout leader." At another he suggested 

that Americans "put their arm around somebody who hurts and say 

'I love you. What can I do to help you? How can I make your life 

better?'" Unfortunately, he failed to mention what to do when the answer to that question is: "Take you damn arm off of me and get me some affordable health insurance!"



<p>Now I'm not saying that there is anything wrong with being a Boy 

Scout leader or telling people that you love them (even when you 

don't -- by the way, Mr. President, I love you.) Indeed, I'm all 

in favor of these things. But there is a world of difference 

between urging mild, spare-time charity and championing a cause 

that will transform our society. It's the difference between 

flaccid, patronizing stump speech rhetoric and invoking 

patriotism to rally us as a nation to a common mission.



<p>In 1961, John F. Kennedy stood in front of a joint session of 

Congress and laid out a vision for the future: "I believe this 

nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before the 

decade is out, of landing a man on the moon." He used his bully 

pulpit to gather the political will to meet a monumental 

challenge -- and backed it up with financial muscle. Eight years 

later after a mobilization of resources, exceptionally talented 

people, and that extremely American can-do quality, we achieved 

the science fiction goal when Neil Armstrong bounced across the 

lunar surface. People, no doubt, still told each other "I love 

you," but love doesn't get you to the moon.



<p>So what if President Bush were to use his newly-won political 

power to do the same -- to call on the American people to commit 

themselves to a large, collective purpose? There's no shortage of needs. I have two that immediately come to mind.



<p>He could borrow President Kennedy's language and call on the 

nation to "commit itself to achieving the goal, before the decade is out, of becoming completely independent of foreign oil." Or he  can call on the nation to "commit itself to achieving the goal,  before the decade is out, of closing the ever-widening gap between the children growing up with hope for the future and 

those growing up in despair."



<p>Okay, I realize that, given the president's oily background, 

there is probably very little chance of his choosing the first 

cause even though the cause of energy independence seems to offer plenty of opportunity for an oil industry willing to harken, no 

pun intended, back to its energetic wildcatting roots. But what 

about the second goal? After all, he and his wife have already 

shown an interest in the subject.



<p>Last week, over 1,000 people gathered in Washington to celebrate 

25 years of Communities In Schools (CIS), a remarkable 

organization that has turned around the lives of hundreds of 

thousands of at-risk children throughout the country.



<p>Among the group's high-profile supporters is First Lady Laura 

Bush, who has praised CIS as "a terrific model for people who 

want to make a difference. It's an organization that has proven 

for 25 years that they can turn kids on to learning by turning 

them on to life."



<p>Bill Milliken, CIS's founder, was himself a troubled kid growing 

up in Pittsburgh in the 50s. He's now putting into practice the 

national exhortation Bush has yet to make. "Our communities have 

been blown apart," Milliken told me, "and we have kids running 

around looking for help. We're responding to this by bringing 

caring adults into one central location -- the schools -- to meet the children's unmet needs. Our work is based on the belief that programs don't change kids -- relationships do."



<p>Communities In Schools currently has over 45,000 volunteers 

working in 2,550 schools -- putting in 1.8 million hours a year. 

Those are impressive numbers -- until you consider the magnitude 

of the problem: There are over 96,000 public schools and roughly 

13 million at-risk children.



<p>And that's where the power of the presidency comes in. We cannot 

go from where we are to where we need to be with individual acts 

of charity and touchy-feely speeches alone. To create the critical 

mass that will truly transform the lives of a generation of 

children, we need to make a Manhattan Project-level commitment of resources and resolve.



<p>So let's strike a new bargain with our leaders: We will expect a 

lot more of them and we're ready for them to ask a lot more of 

us. President Bush claims to believe in the country. So why 

doesn't he believe in us?</p>
