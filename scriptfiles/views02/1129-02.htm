<p> While corporate America has overcome all hesitation about pushing the limits 

of consumer patience in this regard, Thanksgiving marks some sort of official 

starting point for the holiday season. And with it comes the question: What makes 

a good present? 

<p>I am not in the camp that would sap the season of all festivity by promoting 

a &#034;no presents&#034; principle. But I do recognize that an awful lot of what 

is given may fall into that forced category that ends up occupying the back of 

closets or the bottom of drawers until, mercifully, preparations for a move require 

the donation of said &#034;gift&#034; to an appropriate charity. 

<p>It is with this understanding in mind that I dare to suggest that - in addition 

to the cool and colorful gifting that this column wholeheartedly encourages - 

readers might consider a leap up the charity food chain. Instead of a gift that 

will eventually become a donation to the Goodwill folks, how about skipping over 

the long, slow process that leads to the donation and simply contribute in the 

name of the beloved - or perhaps merely tolerated - recipient. 

<p>Most people have a favorite charity, be it a church, a school or the exceptionally 

noble American Red Cross (despite the unfortunate Elizabeth Dole connection of 

some years back). There is much to be said for donating money in someone&#039;s 

name to a group they already support. But I prefer using gift donations as a way 

of introducing people to new ways of giving. 

<p>Here are a few examples: 

<p>If you want to give a gift that gets the recipient in on the ground floor of 

a movement that will be vital to debates over food safety in the decade to come, 

consider Genetically Engineered Food Alert! 

<p>This is a great organization that is in the thick of the research, activism 

and lobbying fights to prevent corporate agribusiness from changing the genetic 

makeup of not just the food in their pharmaceutical test plots but the food crops 

that are contaminated by their experiments. You can learn more about the group 

and how to support it on the Web at <a href="http://www.gefoodalert.org" target="_new">www.gefoodalert.org</a> 

or by writing GE Food Alert, 3435 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 385, Los Angeles, CA 90010. 

<p>Here in the Midwest, the Organic Consumers Association (<a href="http://www.purefood.org" target="_new">www.purefood.org</a> 

or 218-226-4164) is another great group that maintains close ties with Madison 

activist John Stauber&#039;s Center for Media and Democracy (donate to it online 

at <a href="http://www.prwatch.org" target="_new">www.prwatch.org</a>). 

<p>For 20 years the Wisconsin Community Fund has provided funding for groups working 

in Wisconsin to achieve social and economic justice. The organization has supported 

everything from progressive farm activism to women&#039;s rights, and its track 

record for identifying new groups that are having an impact is particularly impressive. 

<p>To learn about all the organizations the fund supports, and about its innovative 

alternatives for giving, visit its Web site at <a href="http://www.wisconsincommunityfund.org" target="_new">www.wisconsincommunityfund.org</a>, 

call 251-6834 or visit its office at 1202 Williamson St., Suite D. (That office, 

by the way, is located in the Madison Social Justice Center facility, a great 

local project that houses many activist groups. You can donate to the center online 

at <a href="http://www.socialjusticecenter.org" target="_new">www.socialjusticecenter.org</a>.) 

<p>The American Friends Service Committee&#039;s Peace Fund. If you&#039;re looking 

for a savvy, effective and consistent advocate for peace, the Nobel Peace Prize-winning 

AFSC is a good choice. 

<p>The organization&#039;s activities range from the political to the humanitarian, 

and it is a major partner in the Campaign of Conscience, a joint endeavor with 

the Fellowship of Reconciliation and Pax-Christi USA to provide life-saving aid 

to Iraqi communities that have suffered as a result of economic sanctions against 

that country. 

<p>You can learn more about how to support the AFSC&#039;s peace work and how 

to give a gift donation on the Web at <a href="http://www.afsc.org/iraq/" target="_new">www.afsc.org/iraq/</a> 

or by calling (888) 588-2372. 

<p>Locally, the Madison Area Peace Council also deserves support. You can learn 

about this ambitious and effective group at <a href="http://www.madpeace.org/" target="_new">www.madpeace.org/</a> 

or by calling 835-7501. </p>
