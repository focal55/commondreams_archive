<p>Whatever the outcome of the intense diplomatic maneuvers at the UN, whatever 

cover the UN might give to an American attack on Iraq, they cannot hide a fundamental 

truth. It has profound implications for future relations between states. Henry 

Kissinger, archpriest of realpolitik, has called it "revolutionary". Tony Blair 

appears to have embraced it, though we cannot be sure. 

<P>A new doctrine of war has been laid down by the Bush administration that casts 

aside all the traditional tenets of international law as well as the UN and NATO 

charters. It abandons the concept of deterrence, considered the bedrock of stability 

throughout the cold war and cited by successive British governments as justification 

for their nuclear arsenal. 

<P>Ever since September 11 last year, it has been reflected in speeches, notably 

by Donald Rumsfeld, the US defense secretary, his deputy, Paul Wolfowitz, and 

Bush's national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice. It was spelt out most clearly 

by Bush himself in June. The US, he said, would no longer rely on "deterrence" 

and "containment"; it had to be "ready for pre-emptive action". 

<P>He added: "America has, and intends to keep, military strengths beyond challenge, 

thereby making the destabilizing arms races of other eras pointless." This new 

doctrine was enshrined in the Bush administration's National Security Strategy 

document published last month. 

<P>As Jonathan Schell put it in a recent issue of the American magazine the Nation: 

"In short, the United States will establish, preserve and make free use of an 

absolute military supremacy over every other nation on earth." 

<P>The new doctrine includes the right of the US to use its unsurpassed, indeed 

unsurpassable, military power to overthrow governments by force if, in Washington's 

view, they attempt to acquire weapons of mass destruction - Vice-President Dick 

Cheney has suggested this includes no fewer than 60 states - or harbor terrorists. 

<P>At least Kissinger, a historian by profession, appreciated the significance 

of the new doctrine. Regime change as an aim of military intervention is a direct 

challenge to the international system established by the 1648 Treaty of Westphalia, 

he recently wrote in the Los Angeles Times. That treaty established the principle 

of "state sovereignty": that war is justified only by aggression across a national 

border. Though he argued that Saddam Hussein presented such a danger as to make 

pre-emptive action "an imperative", he warned: "It is not in the American national 

interest to establish pre-emption as a universal principle available to every 

nation." 

<P>Bush and his advisers have made no such qualification in their quest for a 

new, aggressive Pax Americana, something they had wanted from the start but for 

which they were confident of attracting sufficient US domestic support only after 

the September 11 attacks. 

<P>Bush, who, judging by American opinion polls, desperately needs Britain to 

join any military action against Iraq, was persuaded by Blair, among others, to 

follow the UN route, if only for presentational purposes. This approach had the 

added advantage of pulling the rug from under the Democrats in Congress and Labour 

backbenchers in the Commons. 

<P>"Any action that we in the United Kingdom take will be strictly in accordance 

with our obligations in international law and under the United Nations charter," 

Jack Straw insisted last week. "Under the charter," he explained, "individual 

countries can act against others without a security council resolution, for example 

in the case of self-defense." 

<P>His choice of language was deeply misleading. In international law, as in the 

UN and NATO charters, nations can attack others only in "self-defense.". As Kissinger 

suggests, this has always meant defense against an actual attack by another state, 

though more recently international lawyers have said it could also cover an imminent 

attack. As the government's law officers have advised, it certainly does not allow 

for war for regime change. 

<P>Bush, who says his aim is to topple Saddam, has been persuaded by Blair among 

others to use the UN as a figleaf. It is now incumbent on Blair to say whether, 

as he colludes with Bush, he accepts the new American doctrine of military intervention. 

Blair must also explain why he believes Saddam cannot be deterred from using weapons 

of mass destruction (as he was during the 1991 Gulf war). 

<P>The prime minister, as well as his foreign and defense secretaries, must say 

what they really mean. Do they really believe the concept of deterrence, and the 

established principles of international law, can be abandoned - with the huge 

risks that implies - and are they prepared to argue their case with the British 

public?
