<p> Saturday, the FBI announced it was investigating

whether the Saudi government funded students who

assisted two of the 9/11 hijackers. Only this summer,

a top Pentagon official told me there was no

connection between the Saudi government and the

September 11th attacks. Quite understandably that was

all he could say in light of the Administration's

policy. What is disturbing, if not surprising, is that

the Administration stubbornly continues to downplay

the Saudi government's complicity and perhaps direct involvement in al Qaeda's funding, so as not to distract from its war plans for Iraq. 

<p>It would behoove Americans to recall that in 1945

president Franklin Roosevelt and King Abdul-Aziz Ibn

Saud agreed that the U.S. would protect Saudi Arabia

from foreign threats and in return would gain

preferred access to Saudi oil. Implied in this deal,

was that the U.S. would overlook the autocratic nature

of the Saudi government, as it was a vital buffer

against communist incursion. 

<p>Much has changed since 1945, but this bargain

has endured because it remains highly profitable for

leaders on both sides--but at what cost?

Unfortunately, 9/11 and other previous al Qaeda

attacks are probably only the beginning of the cost to

the U.S. But the Saudi government may also eventually

pay, as the clash on November 16th and November 17th

between Saudi security forces and young disciples of

bin Laden hinted.   

<p>Obviously the Bush administration is not willing to

sever ties to Saudi Arabia, to pull out our troops,

close our bases, and pay $5 dollars/gallon or more at

the gas pump. But, if the Administration and Congress

are going to be serious about eliminating al Qaeda,

then they must bring enormous pressure to bear on the

Saudi government to completely cooperate in

apprehending and bringing to justice private citizens

or officials that have aided al Qaeda. No doubt this

will be tricky, as the money has probably come from

the highest levels. However, to ignore this, as the Administration would like, is a mistake we cannot

afford to make.   

<p>Last month the Washington Post reported that

U.S. intelligence named about a dozen of al Qaeda's

Saudi financiers and that the Treasury Department is

sending officials to Europe to gain cooperation in

freezing their assets. These private Saudi citizens

have apparently been funding al Qaeda all along and

enjoy the protection of the government. This is no

secret and the Administration knows it, but has so far

been unwilling to take the drastic action necessary to

cut terrorist funding.

<p>Two months ago, the Wall Street Journal cited the

example of an alleged al Qaeda logistics chief and

Saudi businessman who was recently detained by Saudi

police, after he was named in a private lawsuit

brought by victims of the World Trade Center attacks.

If we knew about him, why didn't we present him with a

one-way ticket from Prince Sultan Air Base to

Guantánamo Bay?  

<p>The truth is, we know very well where the money is

coming from, even though American officials insist

it's difficult to track the many cash transactions

involved. It is difficult, but it's significantly

harder when you're not even willing to try.
