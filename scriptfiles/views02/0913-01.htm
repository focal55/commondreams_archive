<p>With all the war fever about re-invading

Iraq, the press and politicians are ignoring

the opinion of the veterans of our last war in

the Gulf. But we veterans were there, and

we have unique and critical first-hand

knowledge of the course and consequences

of warfare in Iraq. Our opinions should be

solicited and heard before troops deploy for

battle, not after they have returned

wounded, ill or in body bags. 



<p>Another invasion of Iraq in 2002 will be very

different from the invasion of 1991. The

war's mission has changed in the intervening

years, from removing Iraq from Kuwait to

removing the entire Iraqi government and

military establishment from power. Because

the goal of the U.S. military has changed, the

Iraqi army may retreat to the cities, where

they may face better odds than in the desert. 



<p>During the open desert tank battles of '91,

U.S. tanks out-classed and out-fought

obsolete Iraqi tanks, and U.S. infantry

captured tens of thousands of poorly

supplied Iraqi soldiers operating without

command and control from Baghdad. But in

the urban warfare scenario of 2002, pitched

infantry skirmishes and ambushes in cities

may present a more level battlefield for Iraqi

troops fighting in their hometowns. The Iraqi

military can be expected to fight for each

block within each city with the most ruthless

means available. When faced with the

impending overrun of their nation, the Iraqi

military didn't hesitate to use chemical

weapons against Iran. 



<p>Because of these significant differences,

here are 10 reasons why, as a Gulf War

combat veteran, I oppose a second Gulf War

as a costly and preventable mistake. 



<p>1. U.S. troops are vulnerable to Iraqi

chemical and biological warfare agents -- if

Iraq is capable of using them. The gas masks,

detection alarms and protection suits don't

work, according to internal Department of

Defense documents uncovered during

investigations by the U.S. General

Accounting Office. This leaves U.S. troops

highly vulnerable to chemical and biological

attack. U.S. chemical and biological warfare

agent casualties in 2002 could be

significantly higher than in 1991. Only a few

months ago, the Pentagon sent out a press

release stating 140,000 U.S. soldiers were

exposed to low-levels chemical agents near

Khamisiyah, Iraq during the Gulf War.

While these soldiers appeared to return

home healthy, many tens of thousands face

long-term disabling medical problems that

are difficult to treat. 



<p>2. Scientific evidence shows that even

low-level chemical exposures are dangerous.

According to a recent National Academy of

Sciences report (Gulf War and Health,

September 2000), low-levels of chemical

warfare agents cause long-term medical

problems. This conclusion is based on

research resulting from the sarin attack in

Japan in 1995. 



<p>3. Research shows long-term adverse side

effects from mandatory vaccines given to

U.S. soldiers deploying to the war zone.

According to the product label insert made

by BioPort in Michigan, the sole producer,

the experimental anthrax vaccine has caused

several deaths. The National Academy of

Sciences this year concluded there are some

risks to the hotly debated vaccine. 



<p>4. The Gulf War battlefield remains

radioactive and toxic. Scientific research

funded by the military and released two

years ago links exposure to depleted uranium

 (DU) ammunition with cancer in rats. Solid

depleted uranium bullets, ranging in size

from 25mm to 120mm, are used by U.S.

tanks, helicopters and planes to attack

enemy tanks and armored personnel carriers.

The Gulf War battlefield is already littered

with more than 300 tons of radioactive dust

and shrapnel from the 1991 Gulf War.

Another war will only increase the

radioactive and toxic contamination among

U.S. soldiers. As of today, U.S. troops are not

fully trained about the hazards of depleted

uranium contamination, even though

Congress enacted a law in 1998 requiring

extensive training, especially for medical

personnel. 



<p>5. Research shows long-term adverse side

effects from mandatory pills given to U.S.

soldiers deploying to the war zone.

According to testimony before Congress

(Rand Corporation, 1999), the experimental

pyridostigmine bromide (PB) anti-chemical

warfare agent pills "can't be ruled out" as

linked to Gulf War illness. During the war,

soldiers were told to take one pill every eight

hours. After the chemical alarms sounded,

some soldiers, out of legitimate fear for their

lives, took more than the prescribed amount.

To date, the long-term consequences of PB

pills remain largely unknown. 



<p>6. The Iraqi civilian opposition was

abandoned by U.S. troops in the first Gulf

War. After U.S. troops had liberated Kuwait

and conquered southern Iraq at the end of

February 1991, former President George

H.W. Bush encouraged the Iraqi opposition,

mainly civilians, to rise up against the Iraqi

dictatorship in March 1991. However,

former President Bush left the rebels twisting

in the wind to be ruthlessly killed by the

Iraqi army's Republican Guard flying

helicopters allowed by the cease-fire

arranged by U.S. military and political

leaders. U.S. troops in southern Iraq in

March 1991 were ordered not to interfere.

How can U.S. troops or Iraqi rebels be

confident this won't happen again? Long

oppressed by the Iraqi military, what will the

civilian population do if Iraq is liberated?

The American public won't support a

long-term occupation and high casualties. 



<p>7. Many post-cease-fire military actions of

the first Gulf War were deplorable. In March

1991, the Iraqi army was in a full route

inside Iraq. Against orders, former General

Barry McCaffrey slaughtered thousands of

retreating Iraqi soldiers after the cease-fire

(documented in the article, "Overwhelming

Force," by Seymour Hersh, The New

Yorker, 2000). Many U.S. soldiers returned

home with serious objections about the

course and consequences of such actions,

including the horrific carnage of the

"highway of death," littered with hundreds of

destroyed cars, tanks and human remains

(see "Prayer at Rumayla" by Gulf War

veteran Charles Sheehan-Miles, Xlibris,

2001). Will there be another massacre of

Iraqi soldiers? Will Iraqi troops slaughter

U.S. soldiers in retaliation, killing U.S.

prisoners or retreating U.S. soldiers? And will

the press be allowed onto the battlefield to

record what really happens? 



<p>8. No one has been held accountable for

arming Iraq with chemical and biological

weapons from 1980 to 1990. A recent news

article reported that top aides for former

presidents Reagan and Bush armed Iraq with

these weapons during Iraq's war against Iran

between 1980 and 1988 ("Officers Say U.S.

Aided Iraq in War Despite Use of Gas," New

York Times, Aug. 18, 2002). Some of these

former George H.W. Bush aides now work

for President George W. Bush. These

advisors did nothing to stop the sale of the

chemical agents to Iraq, did nothing to stop

the use of the agents by Iraq, and did nothing

to tell the world about Iraq's crimes, even

when the world learned Iraq used poison gas

against civilians. These top political aides

have remained silent for more than 14 years,

and many refused to comment on the recent

news reports. 



<p>9. U.S. allies in Europe oppose invading Iraq.

They have refused to supply soldiers,

funding or logistical support. Some of the

serious U.S. battlefield casualties from 1991

were sent to U.S. military hospitals in

Germany. Where will our casualties be flown

to for emergency care if Germany follows

through on its policy to remain neutral and

not allow the use of German airspace? This

contrasts sharply with the more than 30

nations allied with the U.S. during Desert

Storm in 1991. Today, the U.S. has no Arab

allies. In 1991, the U.S. forgave billions in

outstanding loans owed by Egypt to buy its

support. Now Egypt and other Middle

Eastern nations oppose a second invasion of

Iraq. If something goes wrong, where will

U.S. troops retreat if Saudi Arabia won't

allow U.S. troops within its borders? We

must avoid another Gallipoli. 



<p>10. The Department of Veterans Affairs will

not be able to care for additional casualties

because VA can't even take care of current

VA patients. Most veterans now wait six

months to see a VA doctor, and most

veterans wait more than six months to

receive a decision on a VA disability claim.

Many of those waiting in line are Gulf War

veterans, many with unusual illnesses.

According to VA, of the nearly 700,000

veterans who served in Desert Shield and

Desert Storm, more than 300,000 have

sought VA healthcare, and more than

200,000 have filed VA disability claims. Two

weeks ago, President Bush slashed $275

million from the healthcare budget of the

Department of Veterans Affairs. 



<p>Although the Iraqi government is a corrupt

dictatorship that must eventually be

removed, current proposals to remove the

government by deploying hundreds of

thousands of U.S. troops are deeply flawed.

A premature attack against Iraq, especially

when the public opposes it, would be a

horrible mistake. Since 1990, more than 400

U.S. soldiers have died in the Gulf War

theater of operations. Untold hundreds of

thousands of Iraqis, both soldiers and

civilians, also died. A second invasion of

Iraq for one man is not worth one more life;

let's use common sense and avert a second

Gulf War.
