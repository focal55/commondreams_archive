One of the leading political figures embroiled in 

the Enron scandal is being handed a "Get Out of Jail 

Free" card, and he doesn't deserve it. That is Robert 

Rubin, President Clinton's former Treasury Secretary. 

	

	<p>Rubin seems to have everything he needs to be 

inoculated from the scandal's contagion: one of the 

most powerful and influential people on the planet, he 

has charmed not only bankers and political leaders of 

both parties, but the media and opinion-makers as well. 

In the press he was often portrayed as a primary 

architect of America's longest-running economic 

expansion, in the 1990s.



	<p>A cover of Time magazine in 1999 displayed 

Rubin, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, and Larry 

Summers (number two at Treasury, later replacing 

Rubin) as "The Committee to Save the World." But 

more recently he has been caught peddling his influence 

for the financial giant Citigroup, where he left public 

office to become a top executive.



	<p>As Enron's accounting irregularities were being 

discovered and its fortunes rapidly sinking, Bob Rubin 

placed a call on November 8 to Peter R. Fisher, current 

undersecretary of the Treasury for domestic finance. 

According to Treasury, Rubin wanted to know if the 

Bush administration was going to intervene with the big 

credit rating agencies, who were about to lower their 

rating of Enron's debt. Since Rubin's Citigroup was 

holding hundreds of millions of dollars worth of 

Enron's debt, it had quite a large stake in the outcome 

of any such decision.



	<p>Treasury told the press that Fisher said no, and 

Rubin agreed with the decision -- as if this were just an 

informational call to discuss the pros and cons of 

political intervention to protect the credit rating on 

Enron's bonds. But this should not be allowed to drop. 



<p>The public needs to know more about this phone 

call, and any others that Rubin may have made on 

Citigroup's behalf. Whether or not they are technically 

illegal, such actions are a blatant and corrupt abuse of 

one of the highest offices of our government.



	<p>For those who followed Rubin's role in the 

Asian economic crisis a few years ago, this comes as no 

surprise. If we look at what Treasury actually 

accomplished with a $120 billion loan package for the 

region, it was quite different than what Time magazine 

and the rest of the press were led to believe. They got 

the taxpayers of Indonesia, South Korea, and the other 

affected countries to guarantee the bad debt held by 

foreign corporations and banks.



<p>Rubin and Summers did nothing to help these 

countries when they needed reserves to keep their 

currencies from falling, and we now know that 

Treasury's actions actually helped cause the crisis and 

made it much worse. They were not "saving the world." 

They were saving Citibank and others from losses due 

to their bad loans -- just as Rubin tried to do when he 

called Treasury about Enron's debt.



<p>But these details of the Asian crisis did not get 

much press. That is why it is so important that the 

current investigations pursue the political corruption 

involved in the Enron scandal. Rubin is holding one of 

the two biggest smoking guns so far discovered.  (The 

other is held by the Bush administration: According to 

former Federal Energy Commission Chairman Curtis 

Hebert, Jr., Enron CEO Kenneth Lay told him he would 

support him as Chairman if he changed his views on 

utility deregulation. Hebert said he refused. He was 

subsequently replaced by Pat Wood III, a friend of Ken 

Lay and George W. Bush.)



<p>Of course most of the political casualties of an 

independent investigation would be in George W. 

Bush's camp.  After all, this is the Enron administration 

-- the list of officials with Enron ties is long and goes 

right to the top, including chief economic adviser Larry 

Lindsey (former Enron consultant); US Trade 

Representative Robert Zoellick (former Enron advisory 

board); chief political advisor Karl Rove (investor).



<p>But the Democrats have been unsure about 

whether to pursue the investigation into the political 

realm. Part of this timidity is a desire to avoid the 

appearance of partisan excess that, in the Clinton 

scandals, drew a backlash against the Republicans. But 

they are undoubtedly afraid that some of their own 

luminaries, Rubin chief among them, might end up on 

the wrong side of a subpoena. It would be a shame if 

these fears, and the media's reluctance to pursue these 

issues independently, kept the public from learning the 

truth about the political corruption involved in Enron's 

rise and decline.
