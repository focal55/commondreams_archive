<p>Anybody who has done some foreign reporting knows that the views of correspondents 

on the nature of the crisis or war which has brought them to a particular place 

tend to be similar. Day-to-day experience, constant discussion, and the weight 

of numbers produce a consensus which only a few resist. Thus most of the correspondents 

who covered Vietnam felt that the war was in some way wrong, a feeling reflected 

in their stories, and thus today most of the correspondents who cover the conflict 

between the Israelis and the Palestinians would agree that Sharon is more of an 

obstacle to peace than Arafat. The point here is that the consensus is multinational 

and, especially, that there is not that much divergence between Americans and 

non-Americans. 

<P>The picture painted for readers of, for example, the New York Times, Le Monde, 

or the Guardian by the reporters on the spot in Israel and the territories is 

in essentials the same. Comment, put together in the metropolis, is a very different 

matter, as are the stories reporting on the views and decisions of policy makers 

in capitals, above all Washington. But this argument from journalism on the ground 

is of interest because it contradicts the notion that an almost genetic difference 

can now be seen between Americans, as citizens of the imperial center, and non-Americans, 

and it reminds us that we have been in similar situations in the past, long before 

anybody was talking of the single superpower. The difference it suggests is not 

that between Americans and everybody else but between the sensible conclusions 

of people on the spot and the overly abstract, unreal and sometimes fantastical 

conclusions of people in power. 

<P>The Vietnam war in Washington was a construct shaped by ideology and national 

pride, constantly being refashioned by rival institutions, personalities, and 

factions. The Vietnam war in Vietnam was a terrible fight in which men, women, 

and children were extinguished every day, and that touched the consciences, sharpened 

the minds, and inflamed the passions of those reporting the conflict. Although 

less free to express their views publicly, soldiers, diplomats, and intelligence 

people were affected in the same way. The views of the working press and others 

on the ground in Vietnam, first that the war was being fought in the wrong way 

and, later, that on balance it had better not be fought at all, did eventually 

reach Washington and affect decisions there. 

<P>America is not of course fighting in the Middle East, and this administration's 

refusal to fully engage is clear, yet most see success there as vital to its wider 

interests. If the question that the press in Vietnam initially raised through 

its reporting was "is this the right way to make war?" that for their successors 

in Israel and Palestine is "is this the right way to make peace?" The answer of 

the reporters today, with many nuances, is no, and they may be discreetly joined 

in that by diplomats and others. But this skepticism, as President Bush's speech 

this week makes clear, is not getting through to the center Elements of a response 

to reality mingle with elements of what was so evident during the Vietnam years 

- an insistence that reality conform to ideology or to the compromises worked 

out between Washington schools and factions, and anger at those who point out 

that it does not. 

<P>Thus the Bush administration does not ask whether it is possible that the Palestinians 

pass through the eye of the needle in order to attain the heaven of a state, it 

merely asserts that they must. It does not attend to the evident readiness of 

the Sharon government to sabotage any progress toward a political settlement, 

but assumes a goodwill in that respect which simply does not exist. 

<P>The Bush administration may be especially prone to fantasy in many fields. 

The Republican campaign in opposition for national missile defense, based on the 

claim that the right technology, with enough effort and money, was just around 

the corner, has become in office an $8bn research program without the slightest 

chance of producing an effective defense for years to come, the Carnegie Endowment 

specialist Joseph Cirincione has argued convincingly. The administration has in 

effect admitted as much by its new doctrine of preventative attack but the expensive 

NMD program stays in place, soaking up resources that might contribute far more 

effectively to American security if used in other ways. 

<P>Another example of fantasy at work is the American campaign against the international 

criminal court, which could even undo the NATO peacekeeping forces in the Balkans. 

There are legitimate concerns over how the ICC may operate, but the American demand 

for immunity rests on the fantastical notion that the court would reward American 

risks and sacrifices in peacekeeping by victimizing American personnel, a concept 

as far from the purposes of the new institution as can be imagined. 

<P>American governments are of course not alone in being attached to unrealistic 

doctrines or pursuing contradictory policies, and the resistance of rulers to 

unwelcome news about what is actually happening on the ground is an old story. 

The problem is only particularly American because of American primacy. This, you 

might say, is always going on in government, as is the countervailing process 

of slowly grasping that policy does not fit reality. It is on this possibility 

that the present Palestinian leadership rests its remaining hopes. As when mediaeval 

rebels used the device of blaming the monarch's advisers but not the monarch himself, 

they have embraced the positive elements in the Bush speech and girded themselves 

for the continuing fight to turn round the American establishment. 

<P>Vietnam was less critical for America than it seemed to be at the time. There 

is reason to believe, by contrast, that Palestine could indeed be crucial in determining 

whether we are entering an era of vicious irregular war or whether we can contrive 

a round of settlements. The achievement of a viable Palestinian state could produce 

a domino effect, to use Vietnam phrases, by changing the hearts and minds of men 

and women in many societies. 

<P>The denial of such a state could bring a domino effect in the other direction. 

The Bush administration, of course, thinks of the yet different domino effect 

of giving in to terrorism, something that underlines the connections between the 

Vietnam time and the present day. The Vietnam generation has been in charge for 

a decade. Now that things have become truly serious on Bush's watch, it would 

be a good idea to recall how hard it was, once upon a time in Washington, to sort 

out the real facts from the rhetoric, how unready those in power were to listen 

to voices that turned out to be telling the truth about how the war was going, 

and how they made the mistake of casting the conflict in apocalyptic terms that 

made changing policy all but impossible.</p>
