<p>As religious leaders, we collectively disavow the path that affirms that grief 

must lead to war. We refuse to accept violence as the necessary consequence of 

loss. Our religious traditions must not bless war. Those peace-loving expressions 

of one God must not support the lie of the "just war" against Iraq.<p>

We see the costs of war as including the loss of American lives and treasure; 

further death and neglect of Iraqi civilians, especially children; the tarnishing 

of the United States' reputation and diplomatic leadership; and an intensification 

of hatred in the Middle East toward the U.S. and the West.<p>

We reject the heresy that sprang from the embrace of nationalism by religion's 

sanction of wars. For all time, the evil and pernicious "blessing of war" as just 

must be repudiated.<p>

We know what our faith traditions command of us: to be peacemakers; to do good 

to those who hate us; to abide by the peace of God/the Ultimate.<p>

Our faith traditions, said Mohandas K. Gandhi, are highways leading to the same 

destination. Christian and Muslim, Hindu and Jew, Buddhist and Shinto, Bahai, 

Sikh and Jain: All celebrate the sacredness of human life and charge us to build 

a just, peaceful and equitable world; all celebrate the power of love to vanquish 

hate and the power of mercy to overcome vengeance.<p>

We also remember all too well the wars carried out in our religions' name in Vietnam, 

Korea, Cambodia and many more places. Our experience in faith leads us to repudiate 

war as the method for problem solving.<p>

We mourn the loss of life resulting from the attacks of Sept. 11, but we do not 

ask that more blood be shed. Our mourning is a peaceful mourning and is not a 

podium to call for a war of vengeance against Iraqis.

<p><i>Leonard I. Beerman is the founding rabbi of Leo Baeck Temple; James Lawson 

is pastor emeritus of Holman United Methodist Church, Los Angeles, and president 

of CLUE (Clergy and Laity United for Economic Justice); Maher Hathout is senior 

advisor of the Muslim Public Affairs Council of Los Angeles; George F. Regas is 

rector emeritus of All Saints Church, Pasadena, and convener of Interfaith Communities 

United for Justice and Peace. They are among the founding members of the <a href="http://www.icujp.org/home.shtml" target="_new">Interfaith 

Communities United for Justice and Peace</a>, formed in the aftermath of the events 

of Sept. 11, 2001. </i>
