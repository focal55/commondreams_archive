<p>This August 6th and 9th will mark the 57th anniversary

of the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It's

a time for contemplation and reflection on the part of

the American public. We are still coming to grips with

our reprehensible past, and have yet to face the

enormity of what our government has done.



<p>This year, as always, there will be a few token

comments lamenting the regrettable deaths of civilians, countered by further justification of the rightness of the act. It is widely and fervently believed that this attack was necessary to defeat the Japanese and end World War II. But such belief is a myth, originating as government propaganda and perpetuated by each U.S. administration since Truman.



<p>Every year a spate of newspaper editorials from World

War II veterans and others vehemently defend the

destruction of the two "enemy targets."  These authors evidently are still persuaded by the official line that the bombs were dropped as a last resort to prevent a horrific loss of American lives. That was, and in some cases continues to be, the position of history texts and mainstream media.



<p>But numerous books and the now-declassified relevant

government documents belie such assertions. There is

strong evidence that most decisive factors already

pointed to a successful conclusion of the war without

the use of the bombs or a large invasion force. A more

accurate assessment indicates that the bombs were

detonated in the pursuit of scientific and

technological knowledge and to intimidate a powerful

and intransigent Soviet Union. Some historians suggest

that the weapons were used mainly because we had them

and we wanted to see (and demonstrate to the world)

what they could do.



<p>These are sobering and disturbing conclusions, however

valid. We Americans would much prefer to believe that

we simply took the necessary and appropriate action to

end a brutal conflict. We don't want to admit that we incinerated and irradiated all those human beings for any other than the most noble of imperatives. We adamantly resist the imputation that our misguided and misinformed leaders coldly sacrificed so much life (enemy or ally) to further their own purposes.



<p>Yet the facts are there. I won't go into all the

evidence, but look for yourself. Read the quotes, the

journal entries, the historical record. Until we face

the facts courageously and humbly, until we dispel the

official myth, the likelihood increases that it will

happen again. There are powerful interests that want to

make the use of nuclear weapons acceptable and

plausible. We must ask ourselves how much restraint we

can expect from the current nuclear-advocating and war-embracing leadership.



<p>It's time we finally faced the truth. Especially in the

recent advent of public admission of misbehavior (e.g.,

the Catholic Church and the IRA), it is incumbent upon

us and our leaders to speak the truth and put an end to

the myth that justifies this unjustifiable act of

nuclear aggression. Specifically, we need an official declaration of what we all sense intuitively but so far have refused to acknowledge: this nation was wrong to use nuclear weapons against those cities for reasons which we now know to be suspect.
