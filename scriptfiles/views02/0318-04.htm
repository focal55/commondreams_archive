SIX MONTHS after 9/11, we experience an eerie sense of normalcy. The 

Oscars generate their usual hype; friends once again discuss divorce. People 

return to airplanes; fans eagerly await a new baseball season.

<P>Yet, nothing is normal. Beneath the routine sounds and sights of daily life 

lurks the stark, unsettling fact that our society is not as democratic as it 

was last summer.

<P>The Sept. 11 terrorist attacks created a legitimate need for heightened 

security, intensified surveillance and enhanced intelligence. Like other 

Americans, I fully support the Bush administration's effort to protect us from 

further terrorist attacks. But nothing -- absolutely nothing -- justifies the 

secrecy that has shrouded the Bush presidency, its gratuitous violation of 

civil liberties, or its corrosive constraints on our most cherished democratic 

practices.

<P>Consider what has happened during these past six months. President Bush has 

repeatedly invoked executive privilege and refused congressional requests for 

information. He created a shadow government without informing congressional 

leaders. He overturned the Presidential Records Act of 1978 and gave himself 

the right to seal past presidential papers since 1980. He deposited his own 

gubernatorial papers in his father's presidential library where they are 

inaccessible to the public.

<P>On the defense front, the Bush administration appointed John M. Poindexter -

- who, along with Ollie North, masterminded the Iran-Contra arms- for-hostages 

scam -- to head the Pentagon's new Office of Information Awareness. The 

president has extended the war on terrorism to Yemen, Georgia and the 

Philippines without a declaration of war or congressional approval. He even 

declared a new unilateralist Bush Doctrine: The United States reserves the 

right to enter any nation to pursue terrorists or destroy weapons of mass 

destruction, whether or not it is invited by a head of state and without 

seeking approval from the U.N. Security Council.

<P>Members of Congress are finally resisting this assault on the system of 

checks and balances that our nation's founders created to protect our 

democratic government. The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of 

Congress, is suing Vice President Dick Cheney for refusing to hand over 

records from secretly held energy meetings. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., has 

asked the GAO to investigate the impact of Attorney General John Ashcroft's 

Oct. 12 memo to all federal agencies, in which he urged them to resist Freedom 

of Information Act requests.

<P>But Congress must do more to restore its check on an increasingly imperious 

presidency. The Bush administration is using the threat of terrorism to 

curtail civil liberties, bully legislators, scatter troops across the world 

and intimidate Russia, China, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Libya and Syria with 

the threat of pre-emptive tactical nuclear strikes.

<P>George. W. Bush should remember that he lost the popular vote and never 

received a mandate from the American people for these policies. His current 

approval ratings, according to many political analysts, rest more on fear than 

on a national consensus.

<P>He should tread carefully. Americans recognize that patriotism is not only 

the willingness to fight fascism or terrorism, but also the passion to protect 

our democratic freedoms right here, at home.
