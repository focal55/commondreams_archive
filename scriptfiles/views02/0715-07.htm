<p>Recently, Americans have been focused on corporate crimes that cheated 

stockholders and taxpayers out of money to benefit executives and politicians.



<p>This week we must focus on a crime that cost thousands their lives, as 

executives and politicians try to cut a deal to escape what little 

accountability remains.



<p>To persuade us of its importance, Rashida Bi -- one victim of that corporate 

crime -- is risking her life on hunger strike (for constant updates on the hunger 

strike, as well as details about the strikers' demands, see <a href="http://www.bhopal.net/hunger-index.html" target="_new">http://www.bhopal.net/hunger-index.html</a>). 

<p>The story began goes back to the 1984 Union Carbide accident in Bhopal, 

India, which released a cloud of methyl isocyanate (MIC), hydrogen cyanide, 

and other toxins. Somewhere between 4000 and 8000 people died at the time, 

and victims' advocates estimate that in total over 20,000 have died as a 

result of this largest industrial accident ever, with 150,000 suffering 

continuing injuries and medical problems.



<p>The cause was extreme corporate malfeasance. The plant was not up to 

minimal Union Carbide safety standards -- large quantities of MIC were 

unwisely stored in a heavily populated area, the refrigeration unit for the 

MIC (which is supposed to kept at temperatures below 32 F) was deliberately 

kept turned off to save $40 per day in Freon costs, the safety systems were 

dismantled, and the alarm system was turned off. This even though the same 

plant had earlier suffered potentially lethal accidental releases of gases 

like the deadly nerve agent phosgene. Both civil and criminal charges were 

filed, including a charge of culpable homicide against Warren Anderson, 

then Carbide's CEO.



<p>The civil case was settled, after extreme obstructionism on the part of 

Carbide, for a paltry $470 million -- a few hundred dollars each for 

victims still suffering a nightmarish array of cancer, tuberculosis, severe 

birth defects, reproductive and menstrual abnormalities, eye problems, and 

more. The settlement, reached without consulting the victims, was so 

favorable that when it transpired Carbide's stock jumped two points.



<p>Carbide's callousness is so extreme that it has disclosed neither the exact 

chemical composition of the gas cloud, calling it a "trade secret," nor the 

results of its own medical studies on the effects of MIC. As a result, the 

few doctors available to help the victims have great difficult working out 

the best methods of treatment.



<p>The U.S. government has consistently refused to honor its own extradition 

treaty with India, which requires it to send Anderson to be tried in India 

for his reckless indifference to human life.



<p>Dow Chemical, which acquired Union Carbide in 2001, refuses to admit any liability 

for Carbide's actions. Dow also plans to mass-market Dursban, a product banned 

by the EPA in 2000 because it can cause severe neurological damage (especially 

to children), to Indians as a household insecticide (see <a href="http://www.bandursban.org" target="_new">http://www.bandursban.org</a>). 

<p>This happy state of affairs, however, is not enough for Dow. It has also 

pressured the Vajpayee government in India to reduce the charges on 

Anderson and others from "culpable homicide" to "hurt by negligence," a 

non-extraditable offense -- and also to use part of the pathetically low 

compensation to victims for cleanup of the area, shifting liability from 

the polluter to the victims of the pollution. The final decision on some 

charges will be made on July 17.



<p>Rashida, another victim named Tara Bai, and activist Satinath Sarangi of 

the Bhopal Group for Action and Information are ready to fast to the death 

to prevent these moves. Although the fast is just into its third week, 

because of the extreme heat in Delhi and the crippling effects of gas 

injuries, Rashida and Tara are failing fast.



<p>The fast is also intended to draw world attention to the continuing exigent 

circumstances of Carbide's victims. For years, none of the victims had access 

to any sustained affordable medical care. More recently, the Sambhavna trust (<a href="http://www.bhopal.org" target="_new">http://www.bhopal.org</a>), 

a nonprofit NGO, provides some care to about 10,000, barely 6% of the total number 

of surviving victims. At least 5000 families must still regularly drink water 

contaminated by mercury and roughly a dozen volatile organic compounds as a result 

of the accident. 

<p>It is easy to focus on the shameful complicity of the Indian government, which 

has consistently shown more interest in courting foreign investors than in the 

health of its citizens -- and activists are calling for Americans to complain 

to the Indian ambassador (see <a href="http://www.corpwatchindia.org/action/PAA.jsp?articleid=1843" target="_new">http://www.corpwatchindia.org/action/PAA.jsp?articleid=1843</a>). 

It's also clear that Dow must be held accountable. 

<p>But let's not forget the actions of our own government, which consistently 

goes to bat for U.S. corporations, no matter how disgusting their actions. Enron 

was a major beneficiary, with both Clinton and Bush officials on numerous occasions 

pressuring India, Mozambique, Argentina, and countless other countries into signing 

sweetheart deals that benefited Enron stockholders and not their own people (see 

<a href="http://www.nowarcollective.com/enron.htm" target="_new">http://www.nowarcollective.com/enron.htm</a>). 

<p>Enron was hardly unusual, however; U.S. corporations count on this kind of 

coercion in their international dealings. Although this latest initiative 

is still new, and there is as yet no direct evidence in the news that U.S. 

government officials are running interference for Dow, whatever we find out 

later -- presumably after the hunger strikers are dead -- will hardly come 

as a surprise, with the most pro-corporate administration in U.S. history 

currently in power.



<p>Recent scandals make it very clear that we are governed by politicians who 

are little more than corporate shills, enriching themselves as they defraud 

the public. This is no mere matter of individuals, but a cancer at the 

heart of our political system. Rashida and her associates remind us that 

these scandals are not just about ill-gotten gains for a few folks like 

George W. Bush. They have a body count.
