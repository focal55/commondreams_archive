<p>FROM THE testimonials, Paul Wellstone was the face of the Democratic Party. 

Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle called Wellstone the ''soul of the Senate.'' 

Senator John Kerry called Wellstone ''the pied piper of modern politics. So many 

people heard him and wanted to follow him in his fight.''

<P>Senator Jean Carnahan of Missouri said Wellstone ''stayed true to his beliefs.'' 

Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa said Wellstone ''was my best friend in the Senate.'' 

Senator Mary Landrieu of Louisiana said, ''Our nation has lost one of its most 

passionate voices for those who most often have no voice in Washington.'' Senator 

Joe Lieberman said Wellstone ''never wavered in his courageous determination to 

be a voice for the voiceless.'' </P>

<P>Soul. Courage. Voice for the voiceless. That surely described Wellstone, the 

Democratic senator from Minnesota who died two weeks ago in a plane crash just 

before the midterm elections. Wellstone was known for his fights against tax and 

welfare cuts, against rushes to war, and for health care.</P>

<P>That does not describe his fellow Democrats. The tragedy beyond his own death 

is that he was not the pied piper portrayed by Kerry with legions behind him. 

The cautious Democrats heard him and fled his politics as if they had encountered 

Legionnaires' disease. They ran right into the cold shower of crushing defeat. 

The shivering Democrats have been exposed as members of a party without soul or 

passion. They have discovered the price of cowardice.</P>

<P>The Republicans added to their majority in the House. They regained control 

of the Senate. Democrats will replace Republican governors in states critical 

in presidential politics - Illinois, Michigan, and Pennsylvania - but inept Democratic 

gubernatorial campaigns in heavily Democratic Massachusetts, Maryland, and New 

York resulted in Republican victories. Georgia has its first Republican governor 

since Reconstruction.</P>

<P>Give the Republicans credit. They know what they stand for. Tax cuts. Guns. 

Bombs. Oil. Big business. Old boy networks. Privatization. Plundering the earth. 

Pillorying and padlocking the poor. Party-line votes.</P>

<P>The Democrats? One day they are for peace and justice; the next they are a 

bunch of brown-nosing Republicrats. In 1991, for example, the Democrats held a 

57-43 majority in the Senate. But several conservative Democrats (funny that ''liberal 

Republican'' is not a common term) went with the Republicans to confirm party-line 

conservative Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court.</P>

<P>Democratic President Clinton won the White House in 1992 with great promises 

of fairness, then chickened out on universal health care and gay rights in the 

military. Clinton was a master Republicrat. His administration ended welfare and 

helped sell more US arms than ever to the rest of the world. Little happened on 

gun control or public school infrastructure. While the economy did soar, so did 

the gap between the rich and the poor. Most Republicans would envy such a record.</P>

<P>Clinton's would-be successor, Al Gore, had neither the charisma to be a believable 

Republicrat or the conviction to be a progressive Democrat. The Republican winner, 

George W. Bush, rapidly evolved into a master at keeping things party-line simple. 

His campaign for what became a $1.35 trillion tax cut was so successful that 12 

Democratic senators defected to help create a 58-33 victory for Bush.</P>

<P>After the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, Bush has kept Americans so focused 

on Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein that the Democrats have yet to fight against 

a sputtering economy and an imploding health care system. The Democrats have been 

so afraid to challenge jingoism that 29 Democratic senators went along with 48 

Republicans to give Bush the authority to unilaterally attack Iraq without provocation.</P>

<P>Kerry, ignoring Wellstone's flute, voted for the war. Despite calling Wellstone 

his best friend, Harkin voted for the war. Despite praising Wellstone for his 

courage, Lieberman voted for the war. Despite calling Wellstone the ''soul'' of 

the Democratic Party, Daschle voted for the war. New York's Hillary Clinton voted 

for the war. Clinton is obviously learning fast from her husband.</P>

<P>Kerry, Lieberman, and Democratic Senator John Edwards of North Carolina, who 

also voted for the war, are presidential hopefuls for 2004. Somehow, they think 

that cheerleading for Bush will help them beat Bush. Such thinking failed Senators 

Jean Carnahan of Missouri and Max Cleland of Georgia.</P>

<P>Despite voting for Bush's tax cuts and his war, the two Democrats were ousted 

by Republicans. Despite voting for the tax cut and the war, Landrieu has been 

forced into a runoff against a Republican. Kerry praised Wellstone as a pied piper, 

but the Democrats have actually followed the Republicans into the trap of copycat 

politics. The Democrats, who could be a voice for the voiceless, have instead 

discovered that the copycat got their tongue.</p> </P>
