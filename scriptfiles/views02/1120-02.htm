<p>It didn't take long. </p>

<p> That is, for Nancy Pelosi, the new Democratic leader in the House of Representatives, 

to run for cover. Days after her colleagues selected her to replace Dick "I'm 

Outta Here" Gephardt, Pelosi appeared on <i> Meet The Press</i>. Out of the box, 

Russert asked her about recent news reports on the increasing threat posed by 

a resurgent al Qaeda. Pelosi, the ranking Democrat on the intelligence committee, 

confirmed the "threat is real" and added, "We stand shoulder-to-shoulder with 

the President in the fight against terrorism." Is a new attack inevitable? Russert 

wondered. "That certainly is a possibility," she replied, and added, "We stand 

shoulder-to-shoulder with the president." </p>

<p> Clearly, she had inherited page one from Gephardt's playbook: regarding terrorism, 

handcuff yourself to Bush. Russert asked if Pelosi supported the policy of monitoring 

Iraqis who are in the United States. She did not answer directly, and Russert, 

in his way, kept pushing. She remarked she was not familiar with the details of 

this particular initiative, but asserted, "I stand with the president in rooting 

out terrorism." </p>

<p> Russert turned to the subject of war in Iraq. He noted that Pelosi, who had 

voted against authorizing Bush to launch a war against Iraq whenever he wants, 

had said in September, "I have not seen the intelligence to justify the action 

that the president is suggesting....What is the threat that [Saddam] poses to 

the United States?" Russert then queried her, "Do you think that the situation 

with Iraq is a distraction from the war on terrorism?" </p>

<p> Her reply: "I don't think its a distr--I mean, any decision--I don't question 

a decision of the president of the United States on his timing or on the priority 

he gives a threat." But wasn't that precisely what she had done in the remark 

Russert had quoted? And hadn't she taken issue with Bush's priorities by voting 

against the resolution? If she believed there was no justification for action 

against Saddam, then she would have to consider a war against Saddam as something 

of a distraction. On national television, she was undressing politically--and 

undermining her previous stand and the arguments of fellow Democrats who had joined 

with her in opposing the it's-up-to-Bush war legislation. </p>

<p> Pelosi caved further. Russert asked what she would do if Bush declared that 

Saddam was thwarting inspections and ordered military action without consulting 

the United Nations. "If our young people are called to duty, certainly we'll support 

the action of the president," Pelosi answered. "I hope that it does not come to 

that." She commented that she preferred the conflict be resolved "diplomatically 

rather than just showing our power by going in militarily." </p>

<p> Had she given Bush a go-to-war-free card by signaling that she and other Democrats 

would not stand in the way should Bush decide to attack Iraq without support from 

allies? Russert tightened the knot: "But if the president decides to go unilaterally 

or with the British and the Turks without UN approval, you would support the president?" 

</p>

<p> "Yes, I would support the president," Pelosi replied. At least, she dropped 

the bit about standing shoulder-to-shoulder with the guy. But where was the intellectual 

honesty? If, in her mind, the case has not been made that Saddam is a threat to 

the United States, why back a unilateral move? And why permit Bush--whose credibility 

she had previously challenged--to make the call on his own? Moments earlier, Pelosi 

had noted she fears a US strike against Iraq will have negative consequences for 

the war on terrorism. Consequently, in the event Bush does order such a war, it 

should be incumbent upon Pelosi, as someone whose job it is to protect Americans, 

to argue that a misguided action is under way. That, of course, would be a challenge, 

for extensive pro-war sentiment usually accompanies the initiation of military 

action. But with the position she has adopted, Pelosi doesn't have to fret in 

advance about being rolled. Instead, she is ready to salute. </p>

<p> Here is the Pelosi position: I'll argue with Bush over this life-and-death 

matter, but I won't criticize him if he makes a wrong decision that I believe 

imperils the nation, in fact, I'll endorse it. This is the sort of opposition 

that a president need not worry about.</p>
