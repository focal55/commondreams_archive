<p>Thanks partly to its association with 1960s

counterculture, marijuana use has long been considered vaguely un-American. Never

mind that millions of Americans have indulged in it. The pot-smoking pinkos of

yesterday are -- according to the Bush administration -- the aiders and abettors of

terrorists today. 

<p>

A new series of antidrug ads aimed at teenagers, commissioned by the White

House Office of National Drug Control Policy, blames consumers of illicit drugs

for the proliferation of terrorism. "Drug money supports terror," the ads

proclaim. "I helped a bomber get a fake passport," one young actor confesses.

Others own up to helping  terrorists blow up buildings, murder police officers,

and teach other kids how to kill. "Where do terrorists get their money?" the ads

ask. "If you buy drugs, some of it might come from you." 

<p>

You can view a typical "I helped" ad (and other official  anti-drug

propaganda) at <A HREF="http://www.mediacampaign.com" TARGET="_new">www.mediacampaign.com</A>. There you'll find details about the

"undeniable link between terror groups and illicit drugs. ... Twelve of the 28

terror organizations identified by the U.S. Department of State in October 2001

traffic in drugs." You'll also find a role for yourself in the fight against

terrorism. In addition to shopping, you can stop using drugs -- illegal drugs, that

is; you may continue smoking tobacco and abusing alcohol or valium. "If you quit

drugs, you join the fight against terrorism in America," the president has

proclaimed, making it clear that using particular drugs is tantamount to treason.

(You are, after all, either with the president or against him.)

<p>

I don't mean to deny the link between the drug trade and terror. Traffic in

illegal drugs has greatly contributed to  violence at home and abroad. (Before

drug trafficking was blamed for international terrorism, it was financing the

arms race in America's streets.) But I do mean to mock the  administration's

limited understanding of cause and effect. Blaming drug consumption -- and not drug

prohibitions -- for the violent trafficking in drugs, the administration  reminds

me of a terrier I once had who refused to approach the intersection where a

speeding car had grazed him,  although he blithely continued crossing other

streets. He blamed his injury on one particular street, not the perils of running

in front of any particular car. 

<p>

He was a smart dog and not entirely illogical, but his analysis was deeply

flawed, like the administration's analysis  of the link between terror and drugs:

It's not the demand  for drugs that creates a highly lucrative, violent, and

apparently ineradicable black market; it's the prohibition of drugs that are

greatly in demand. It's not the demand for  drugs that props up repressive

regimes that nurture and  harbor terrorists. It's American support for those

regimes that agree to combat the illicit drug trade. When the antidrug ads ask,

"Where do terrorists get their money?" the right  answer is, "If you pay taxes,

some of it may come from you." In the spring of 2001, the Bush administration

gave $40 million dollars to the Taliban because it promised to crack down on

opium growers. 

<p>

Meanwhile, impoverished Americans who rely on government subsidies have been

made the casualties, not the beneficiaries, of the war on drugs. Under a 1988 law

(passed by a Democratic Congress, signed by President Reagan, and strengthened by

President Clinton, who ordered its stepped-up enforcement), public-housing

tenants may be evicted from their apartments if any member of their household or

any guest is caught using illegal drugs "on or near the premises," whether or not

the tenant had any knowledge or control of the drug use. A unanimous Supreme

Court recently upheld this harsh "one-strike" law in a case that dramatized its

abuses. Decided on March 26, <I>HUD v. Rucker</I> allowed the eviction of a

63-year-old great-grandmother whose disabled daughter was caught with cocaine

some three blocks from the projects, as well as the eviction of a 75-year-old

partially paralyzed man whose caregiver was found with cocaine in his apartment.

<p>

<span class="dropcap">T</span>he war against drugs has long been a war against poor people and

racial minorities, as its opponents stress. (African Americans constitute a small

minority of the nation's drug users but a large majority of people sentenced for

drug offenses.) When the children of affluent people are caught using drugs,

they're apt to end up in treatment programs; the children of poor people are more

likely to end up in jail, while their parents may end up on the streets. You

don't have to be soft on drugs to recognize the inequities. As Dan Abrahamson,

director of legal affairs for the Drug Policy Alliance (formerly the Lindesmith

Center-Drug Policy Foundation) remarked, "Jeb Bush was not kicked out of his

public housing due to his daughter's drug use." 

<p>

Indeed, a federal appeals court had enjoined the no-fault eviction of

unelected public-housing tenants, noting that  it raised "serious" due-process

questions by allowing "tenants to be deprived of their property interest without

any  relationship to individual wrongdoing." But neither the relatively liberal

nor the conservative wing of the Supreme Court perceived any constitutional

restriction on no-fault evictions. All the justices (except Justice Stephen

Breyer, who did not participate in the decision) apparently agreed with Congress

that the scourge of illicit drug use poses a greater threat to poor people living

in subsidized housing than a no-fault  eviction policy that may render them

homeless if one of  their grandchildren is caught with a joint on a nearby street

corner. What are all these drug warriors smoking?</p>
