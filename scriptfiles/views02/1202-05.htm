<p> Just offhand, would you think that anyone in America is curious as to why 

Muslim fundamentalists hate us so much? 

<P>If we were given the answer, straight from the horse's mouth, would anyone 

pay attention? 

<P>If Osama bin Laden wrote, "This is why we hate you," and then laid it all out, 

chapter and verse, do you think we'd be curious enough to read what he had to 

say? 

<P>The answers to these questions seem to be no, no and no. 

<P>Lives are at stake in our "war on terrorism," perhaps thousands of lives, maybe 

hundreds of thousands -- and not just overseas. Untold numbers of Americans might 

die -- right here, in the United States of America -- before our "war" is resolved, 

and yet we seem not one whit interested in the motivations of our enemies. 

<P>That's the conclusion one must reach if one looks at our studious avoidance 

of the "letter to America" purportedly written by Osama bin Laden. 

<P>Have you seen that letter? Have you read about it in your newspapers? Have 

you heard it mentioned on television or on the radio? 

<P>Not likely. As near as I can tell, after searches on both Nexis and Google, 

bin Laden's "letter to America" has been thoroughly ignored by the American press. 

<P>It has had quite a few mentions on the Internet, however. 

<P>The only place off the Web that the English version of the letter has been 

reprinted in its entirety, to my knowledge, is in the United Kingdom's <A HREF="http://www.observer.co.uk/worldview/story/0,11581,845725,00.html" TARGET="_new">Observer</A>. 

<P>The letter, written in Arabic and about 3,800 words long, has been around the 

past few weeks. It was originally posted "on a Saudi Arabian Web site previously 

used by al-Qaeda to disseminate messages," the Observer reported. 

<P>It was then picked up and sent by Mohammed al-Massari to hundreds as an e-mail 

attachment. The Observer described al-Massari as "the UK-based Saudi Arabian dissident 

whose Committee for the Defence of Legitimate Rights has opposed the al-Saud regime 

for more than a decade." 

<P>The Observer had the letter translated into English by Arabs living in England. 

<P>Was the "letter to America" truly written by bin Laden? Who knows? I can't 

tell, and I certainly wouldn't take the word of any government "expert," theirs 

or ours. Whoever wrote it, however, seems to have done a good job of laying out 

the case against America and other Western nations, as seen through the eyes of 

Islamic fundamentalists. 

<P>In his "Churchillian" address to Congress on Sept. 20, 2001, President Bush 

gave his reasons why our enemies hate us. 

<P>"They hate what we see right here in this chamber -- a democratically elected 

government. Their leaders are self-appointed. They hate our freedoms -- our freedom 

of religion, our freedom of speech, our freedom to vote and assemble and disagree 

with each other," Bush said. 

<P>Judging from bin Laden's letter, Bush was right in that. Islamic fundamentalists, 

like fundamentalists everywhere, are not too keen on democratic principles. 

<P>But bin Laden went a few steps further. Bush didn't. 

<P>"Why are we fighting and opposing you?" bin Laden asked. Then, answering his 

own question, he wrote, "The answer is very simple: Because you attacked and continue 

to attack us." 

<P>He focused on Palestine, "sunk under military occupation for more than 80 years. 

The British handed over Palestine, with your help and your support, to the Jews, 

who have occupied it for more than 50 years; years overflowing with oppression, 

tyranny, crimes, killing, expulsion, destruction and devastation." 

<P>Because of our continued support of Israel, bin Laden wrote, we must share 

the blame for the mistreatment of Palestinians by the Israeli government. 

<P>But although the continuing problems in Israel seem to be on the top of every 

Arab's complaints against America, the list of complaints is long. Bin Laden continues, 

"You attacked us in Somalia; you supported the Russian atrocities against us in 

Chechnya, the Indian oppression against us in Kashmir and the Jewish aggression 

against us in Lebanon." 

<P>He adds, "Under your supervision, consent and orders, the governments of our 

countries, which act as your agents, attack us on a daily basis." 

<P>After a long list of complaints, bin Laden asks, "Is it in any way rational 

to expect that after America has attacked us for more than half a century, that 

we will then leave her to live in security and peace?" 

<P>If you want to know our enemy, I urge you to read the letter attributed to 

bin Laden. 

<P>We're in trouble. We could be badly hurt by our enemies. 

<P>So far, we've been lucky. During World War II, German scientists were trying 

to develop atomic weapons. We beat them to it. 

<P>When the war in the Pacific went bad for the Japanese, they enlisted kamikaze 

pilots to fly explosive-laden planes into our warships. Some observers believe 

the strategy might have changed the outcome of the Pacific war if it had been 

tried earlier. 

<P>As the events of Sept. 11 showed, and as we see almost every day in Israel 

and other nations, we are opposed by a totally dedicated enemy who doesn't fear 

death. 

<P>For our own good, we'd better start paying attention to what this enemy has 

to say. We have problems that guns and bombs alone won't solve.
