<p>Something remarkable happened early this week in the West Bank city of Nablus.</p>

<p>Palestinians, who have been under an around-the-clock curfew, discovered civil disobedience. They spurned the curfew and took to the streets <i>en masse</i>, reopening shops, banks and other civic institutions. Instead of using the tools of indiscriminate murder, they resisted the occupying Israelis without violence.</p>

<p>Although the Palestinians violated the clampdown, the Israeli troops outside the city made no move to stop them until yesterday, when the army intimidated curfew-breakers back into their homes in retaliation for a Hamas bombing at Jerusalem's Hebrew University. Until then, the detachment in Nablus had tolerated -- and by inaction, tacitly encouraged -- the disobedience.</p>

<p>Admittedly, the movement was only a minor transgression against the larger occupation. Poverty-stricken families restocked their pantries; the brief flow of currency ended 40 days of stagnation. But if the defiance spreads to other West Bank towns, it could potentially convince Palestinians that nonviolent protest is the best way to neutralize the Israeli army. The peaceful action in Nablus -- in contrast to Gaza, where thousands celebrated the university bombing -- shows that where wholesale carnage and internecine warfare fail to make an autonomous state, loud but nonbloody dissent may just have a chance.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, a Selma-style civil-rights movement will be an uphill battle. Given the historic tendencies of the Palestinians, self-righteous indignation will prevail over constructive resistance. Wednesday's gruesome attack proves that. Furthermore, tribal leadership structures, ineffective communication networks and eroded self-confidence make grass-roots organization almost impossible.</p>

<p>The good news is that despite all those obstacles, the seeds of resistance have already sprouted in Nablus and may take root elsewhere. Although it represents a strategic setback for Israel's military war on terrorism, civil disobedience should be considered a leap forward for everyone. A paralyzed army and an unruly West Bank are better than the terrorist-and-tank dynamic that has shaped the conflict thus far.</p>

<p>Nor would widespread defiance be a big loss for Israelis. They know persecution better than anyone and have never liked the violence of occupation anyway. As Israel's former Prime Minister Golda Meir said years ago, ``We can forgive the Arabs for killing our children, but we cannot forgive them for forcing us to kill their children.''</p>

<p>Which means that if a civil-disobedience movement unfolds in the occupied territories, it might supply the solution both sides have been praying for. It could rally Palestinians without killing innocent Israeli civilians. That would annul Israel's justification for the reoccupation.</p>

<p>The ramifications could even influence Israeli politics. They could revitalize the dormant Israeli left and unite it with the nonviolent pursuit of a Palestinian state. The left has been uncharacteristically silent since the Passover bombing in Netanya this spring, a sign of how far right the terrorist attacks have moved the Israeli electorate. But the left still sees a Palestinian state as the only way to end the unceasing give-and-take that has plagued the Middle East since September 2000.</p>

<p>It's a simple cause-and-effect calculation. Violence moves Israeli voters rightward; nonviolence moves them to the left. After two years of the intifada, Ariel Sharon has popular support for the imposition of curfews, the destruction of terrorists' homes and the erection of a wall to separate Israelis from their neighbors. Under siege, those are the only options. Should vigils supplant the siege, however, it could mean the demise of the Sharon government.</p>

<p>Sharon's mandate will last only as long as terrorism prevails, so the key for the Palestinians is to prevent the terrorists from setting the agenda, as they always have. That's what happened with the university attack and the retributive clampdown.</p>

<p>The decades-old answer is to abandon terrorism. There will always be terrorists, but they don't always have to speak for the Palestinians. Israel's determination to strike back shows that they don't help the cause. It's a choice between the protest of Nablus and the bloodthirsty revelry of Gaza.</p>

<p>The suffocated people of the West Bank have the precedent and resources -- it's not as complicated as bomb building -- to short-circuit the reoccupation. They should recognize their success in Nablus, end the two-year cycle of bloodshed and march in protest down the path to a Palestinian state. Where embittered violence has never worked, the Palestinians may be better off linking arms and singing <i>We Shall Overcome</i>.</p>
