<p> Officially in the U.S., market rules are the cure for social problems.  Take 

people living on welfare and in poverty.



<p>The way for them “to move up the economic ladder” is to work for wages, 

noted Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio.  He supports a revision of the federal 

welfare program (now Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) signed by 

Democratic President Clinton in 1996 that ends in 2002.



<p>House Republicans such as Boehner took their cue on revising TANF from 

President Bush.  With little fanfare, House Republicans passed legislation 

on May 16 that would make TANF recipients labor longer (40 versus 30 hours 

per week).



<p>As recent entrants in the job market, they would likely work for low pay.  

Market rules dictate that people with no or little history of paid work earn 

low wages.



<p>These workers then get penalized with substandard nutrition and shelter.  

They are known as the so-called “working poor.”



<p>We see here the role of the government.  It is to enforce market rules on 

the politically powerless for the benefit of their employers.



<p>The U.S. government is not shrinking in the age of “globalization.”  Rather, 

government is increasing its enforcement power against the interests of the 

poorest people being pushed to participate more in the nation’s job market.



<p>The proposed revision of welfare is a new phase in the class war waged by 

the few against the many to regulate wages downward.  Flooding the job 

market with previously inactive workers will serve to moderate or even pull 

down the wage demands of active workers.



<p>The latter know what time it is concerning the finding and keeping of a job 

that pays the bills.  And that time is not the best for them now in the 

nation’s workplaces.



<p>Officially, the U.S. job market has yet to show clear evidence of a recovery 

from last year’s no/slow growth, or recession.  April’s official 

unemployment rate was 6.0 percent versus 5.7 percent in March.



<p>Meanwhile, some employers have indicated that they will hire new workers at 

a more sluggish rate versus the previous year due to the “soft economy.”  

Consider the jobless rate, seasonally adjusted, for workers 16 through 19 

years old, up 16.8 percent this April, a five-year high, reported The Wall 

Street Journal of May 15.



<p>Moreover, a certain kind of economic prosperity creates social conditions of 

instability. In the U.S., the accumulation of capital by a tiny minority 

with the guiding hand of government has, in turn, helped make the lives of 

the nation’s poorest adults and their dependents more precarious.



<p>They can in part thank the two parties of big business for federal welfare 

reform on Clinton's watch.  This has paved the way for the current revision.



<p>By mandating longer hours of wage-labor for TANF recipients, Congress and 

the president would force families to have less time together.  This reduces 

parental oversight of children, a recipe to increase  family stress and 

turmoil.



<p>House Republican legislation that would lengthen the work week of TANF 

recipients will be subsequently considered by the Senate.  Market rules and 

welfare reform march on.
