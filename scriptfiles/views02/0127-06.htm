As the Enron story unfolds, we are reminded why the U.S. Supreme Court, in its famous 1976 Buckley vs. Valeo decision, said that the appearance of 

corruption, not just corruption itself, justifies congressional action to 

place limits on our campaign-finance system.

<P>The court understood that public mistrust of government is destructive to 

democracy; from a constitutional point of view, it hardly matters whether that 

mistrust is based on actual misconduct or simply its appearance.

<P>Congress must address public confidence in government at this crucial time 

by finally passing campaign-finance reform.

<P>In the case of Enron's collapse, the need to address public mistrust is 

paramount for Congress and the Bush administration as they investigate alleged 

wrongdoing.

<P>When a corporation such as Enron leaves devastated employees and fleeced 

shareholders in its wake, the public depends on Congress and the 

administration to determine what went wrong and defend the public interest.

<P>But the potential for a conflict of interest is clear.

<P>Many of the elected officials now asked to sit in judgment of Enron, 

including members of Congress, the attorney general and the president, have 

been accepting and even asking for campaign contributions from Enron for years.

<P>The political parties have pocketed more than $3.5 million in unregulated, 

unlimited soft money from Enron since 1991.

<P>Congress must move forward with the investigations into Enron's conduct, 

despite the potential conflict of interest that political contributions might 

pose.

<P>In fact, this is familiar territory for Congress. Everyday, members of 

Congress accept huge campaign contributions with one hand, and vote on issues 

affecting their contributors with the other. And everyday, the public 

naturally questions whether their representatives are giving special treatment 

to the wealthy interests that fund their campaigns and bankroll their 

political parties.

<P>In the case of the Enron investigations, each member of Congress must 

decide whether simply donating Enron contributions to charity or even recusal 

is the appropriate way to attempt to address public skepticism.

<P>Enron deftly used the campaign-finance system to its advantage long before 

the story of its collapse made its political contributions so well known. 

Enron's executives had a hot line to government leaders shaping energy policy, 

and even reportedly were assisted by high government officials with a debt 

owed to Enron by the government of India.

<P>The Enron scandal illustrates the permanent conflict of interest that 

political contributions -- especially unlimited soft money contributions to 

the parties -- have created for elected officials at both ends of Pennsylvania 

Avenue.

<P>In the case of soft money, both parties have gladly accepted money from 

officials at Enron and the auditing firm of Arthur Andersen. Those soft money 

contributions compromise the integrity of members of both parties as inquiries 

into these corporations' conduct get under way.

<P>Attorney General John Ashcroft's decision to recuse himself from the 

investigation is confirmation of this deep conflict of interest. The Bush 

administration must take every step possible to remove the appearance of a 

conflict in all aspects of this case, and if evidence of impropriety by any 

high-ranking official arises, it should immediately appoint a special counsel.

<P>But however hard Congress and the administration might work to maintain the 

integrity of the investigations into Enron's actions, they are hindered from 

the start by the staggering sums of money Enron poured into the political 

system.

<P>We are just beginning to understand the depth of the accounting and 

financial scandals Enron and Arthur Andersen have set in motion, and it will 

take time to decide how Congress should work to prevent similar problems in 

the future.

<P>But we don't need months to decide how to address the potential conflict of 

interest that unlimited political contributions create for members of Congress 

and presidential administrations. The Senate passed the McCain-Feingold bill 

to eliminate the soft money system last April, and the House is poised to 

debate its counterpart, the Shays-Meehan bill.

<P>While eliminating soft money will not cure the campaign-finance system of 

every ill, it will end a system of unlimited donations that has blatantly put 

political access and influence up for sale.

<P>Enron is just one of the many corporations, unions and wealthy individuals 

that has exploited the soft-money loophole to buy influence with Congress and 

the executive branch at the very highest levels.

<P>While Enron's demise has highlighted some of the worst failings of 

government, perhaps it can also, ironically, restore some faith in government 

by affecting real change.

<P>One of the first things that can be done is to shut down the soft-money 

system. Both Congress and the Bush administration should take seriously the 

public's concern about their potential conflict of interest.

<P>By passing campaign-finance reform, they can begin to regain some of the 

public's trust.

<P><I>U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold is a Wisconsin Democrat. He and Sen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican, are sponsoring legislation that would ban soft money.</I>
