<p>When Johannesburg hosts the World Summit on Sustainable Development 

(WSSD) next week, it will be hosting three conferences: one for 

official delegates, one for "civil society," and one for those unable 

to pay the US$150 registration fee to qualify for membership to 

"civil society." This three-tiered arrangement of the conferences 

tells an uncomfortable story of bureaucratic power, control and 

resistance, one that is very much of our time.



<p>To understand what's going on, it's worth reading between the lines 

of the official pronouncements that have been published in the run up 

to the Summit. And if we look at the bevy of press releases and 

research findings from the World Bank, the WSSD secretariat and 

others, we find that the Summit's sponsors have come up with an earth 

shattering idea, one that diagnoses-and purports to 

treat-environmental problems the world over. The idea is this: 

special interest groups are bad for the environment.



<p>Okay, so it's not such an earth shattering idea. But there's some 

merit in it. Consider industrial lobbies. They are able to have their 

way because they are small, well organised, and have every incentive 

to avoid paying for costly environmentally-friendly change. One need 

only look to the Bush administration's cosy relationship with the 

U.S. energy industry for evidence. If only this unrepresentative 

power of small groups could be managed, the environment would 

flourish-or so the argument runs.



<p>Have a look at that again. It's a magnificent piece of blamestorming. 

This logic tars both industrial interest groups and small progressive 

organisations with the same brush, not because of their politics, 

power, or relationship to society or the environment but because they 

are both small.



<p>This couches environmental problems as a battle between small and big 

groups. Political issues take a back seat. Size is the important 

factor here. Thus, small groups such as Food First, the Environmental 

Defense Fund, or Greenpeace, their massive subscriber base 

notwithstanding, count as small special interest groups. As such, 

they come in for the same policy prescription, the same levelling 

discipline. Having diagnosed that only size matters, the 

international institutions safeguarding the environment, together 

with their corporate partners, present their cure: increase the 

international policing of domestic politics. This focus on small 

groups provides a license to fight not only the small but immensely 

powerful industrial interest groups, but also the small and much less 

powerful groups that constitute civil society at home and abroad. And 

this strikes at the heart of democracy.



<p>If this interpretation is correct, we might expect to see a schism in 

the public sphere between those groups and agencies willing to 

cooperate with corporate interests and those who are not.  The word 

for this process is "partnership." And there's a great deal of it 

around. At the Johannesburg summit itself, the "civil society" 

secretariat has sought corporate funding. The International Chambers 

of Commerce and the World Business Council for Sustainable 

Development for their part have been exceptionally promiscuous, 

partnering with the UN, the World Bank, some NGOs and a smattering of 

academic institutions to demonstrate that, if business is left free 

from the shackles of state regulation, it can consummate its affairs 

responsibly.



<p>The orgy of partnerships at the WSSD (and almost every other major 

multilateral event of late) might make us want to think again about 

Margaret Mead's oft-quoted soundbite: "Never doubt that a small group 

of thoughtful committed citizens can change the world.  Indeed, it's 

the only thing that ever has."  Although this slogan has been recited 

as a hard-times mantra by embattled progressives the world over, it's 

a double-edged slogan. It provides too much succour to those whose 

trust in people's ability to choose action rather than free-riding 

wavers more than it ought. It is also incorrect.



<p>Many of the finest moments in history have come not from a group of 

well organised individuals, but the collective actions of hundreds of 

thousands. Whether this action has been in the home, in the fields, 

in the factories, or in the classroom, populism and mass action 

remain important. In light of the large-scale mobilisations around 

the World Bank, World Trade Organization and corporate rule over the 

past five years, the most appropriate response to the corporate 

take-over of the WSSD is also demonstrably feasible: a blaze of mass 

politics.
