<p> When the dust has settled and the blood and tears have dried, we will be able 

to say one thing with certainty about last week's terrorist attack in Kenya. Anyone 

who tells you the war against terrorism is being won is lying. 

<P>It is the great heresy of free societies, so speak it softly, but the accumulating 

evidence of the past four years is that terrorism can - and does - work. And it 

is working on a global scale. 

<P>It is a simple fact that is more terrifying than any of attacks themselves 

- 11 September included. That a tiny group of extremists, for the most part using 

the most basic of technologies, could effect such a startling paradigm shift that 

has transformed the world we live in. But to what end? The answer is more surprising 

than our political classes appear yet to have grasped. 

<P>Strip away the millenarian agenda and its language of apocalyptic struggle 

- the Great Satans, the enemies of God, references to the Crusaders. Strip away, 

just for a moment, its extreme religious aspects and what you are left with is 

a non-negotiable political agenda. That aim is to remove - or neutralize - American 

and Western influence from large areas of the globe, including states that are 

not exclusively Islamist. 

<P>It is a tension that was in part foreseen by Benjamin Barber in 1992 in his 

essay 'Jihad versus McWorld', which predicted that the greatest threat to democracy 

would be the clash between the spread of a homogenizing American culture - paradoxically 

indifferent to what was happening in the world it touched on - and a new kind 

of anti-political tribal politics which, he predicted, would see 'the breakdown 

of civility in the name of identity; of comity in the name of community'. 

<P>Barber thought that breakdown in civility would likely come from the kind of 

gang warfare then beginning to grip the Balkans. Instead, the real challenge to 

McWorld has been the unforeseen emergence of an extremist version of radical Islam 

literally at war with the West and all it stands for. For the time being at least, 

it seems it is the terrorists who are winning. 

<P>It is a pessimistic outlook, but an easy case to make. Let's start with the 

most obvious economic impact. The fear engendered by a spate of attacks by Jihad 

International - al-Qaeda and groups that share its agenda - is crippling the long-haul 

tourist industry, threatening the West's airline industry and has almost shut 

down tourism outside of the US. That cost is likely to amount to billions of pounds 

in the long run, its impact being felt as keenly in countries such as Indonesia 

and Kenya which are heavily dependant on tourist dollars. 

<P>What is less quantifiable is what John Stevenson, senior fellow in counter 

terrorism at the International Institute for Strategic Studies describes as al-Qaeda's 

aim of 'neutralizing' America and the West's influence in large areas of the world. 

Already the US and other countries have reduced embassies in vulnerable areas 

of the world, like other nations - Britain included - closing down missions at 

times of threat. But it is not just diplomats who carry our message into the world. 

Business too is supposed to fly the flag for our values. And as businesses become 

more wary of operating in threatened areas, they too will withdraw to safer areas 

of operation. 

<P>And in our withdrawal from exactly those places where the kind of Islamist 

extremism we fear most is at its most threatening, we give up the intellectual 

and psychological space to those who most threaten our values. Because the real 

war with al-Qaeda, as James Thomson, president of the Rand Corporation think-tank, 

pointed out in the organization's summer review, is not simply one of missiles, 

snatch squads and bullets. It is quintessentially one of ideas. 

<P>And it is in the war of ideas that we are most notably failing in the war on 

terrorism. As Thomson's overview points out, even a year after 9/11 America and 

its allies still have little idea of the roots of the discontent that has made 

Jihad International so attractive to so many young Islamist men, or the etiology 

of the hatred of America. 

<P>Not only is the message not getting across, but there seems to be a fundamental 

misunderstanding of where the real sophistication of Jihad International comes 

from. It is not in its ingenious and despicable skill in butchering innocent civilians, 

or even in its apparently formidable organizational skills, which in reality may 

be far less formidable than assumed, but in syndicating and marketing its brand 

of terror. This is not the old terrorism of the IRA or ETA, with structures, doctrines 

and pseudo-military organization.



 What Bush and Blair and all their allies do 

not understand is that it is the idea of al- Qaeda, not its physical reality, 

that is the key, an idea which has taken deep root in countries from Afghanistan 

to South East Asia and Africa. 

<P>At the center of that idea is an oppositional discourse that seeks to drive 

the west - particularly America - out of what Osama bin Laden has claimed as the 

wider Islamic nation. That misunderstanding is represented at its worst by George 

Bush who - it is said - keeps a list of 12 names of the top al-Qaeda terrorists 

in his desk and ticks them off as they are captured or killed. 

<P>But al-Qaeda is less a hierarchical organization



 out of James Bond led by 

a sinister mastermind, than a dynamic dialogue between like-minded radicals conducted 

via mosques, radical publications and the internet. A specific order is almost 

redundant as individual groups know exactly what must be done and when, adapting 

themselves to new security constraints and to new targets. 

<P>And what appears to have been 'understood' before the attack on Mombasa was 

that it was the right time to polarize the war on terrorism. Just at the moment 

Bush and his allies had constructed a grudging consent from the Arab world for 

its tough line on Iraq, Jihad International brought in Israel. In his belligerent 

threat to hunt down the perpetrators of the Mombasa attacks, Israel's right-wing 

prime minister Ariel Sharon has threatened to upset the delicate consensus between 

America and its allies on the issue of the war on terrorism, and on the Security 

Council over Iraq. 

<P>Few o Sharon's friends among the hawks that surround George Bush are unaware 

of his motto - 'Always escalate' - and his long history of ill-conceived military 

responses from the Gaza raid, the invasion of south Lebanon to his handling of 

the al-Aqsa intifada, that have delivered a quick political or military fix at 

the cost of long-term disaster. 

<P>By bringing Israel explosively into the mix a week before the deadline for 

Iraq's weapons declaration, Jihad International has shown a political and operational 

astuteness that is quite terrifying. 

<P>What is more terrifying still is the notion among the West's political classes 

that it is an organization



, not an idea, that they are fighting. With each new 

arrest, each new targeted killing, we congratulate ourselves that we are winning 

- until the next atrocity takes place. All the while, we fail to tackle the ideas 

that replace each arrested or dead terrorist with a new recruit. 

<P>As the tens of millions dead in the last century demonstrated, ideas - no matter 

that they are venal ones like Nazism or Stalinism - can be as hard to kill as 

they are lethally and stupidly persistent. 

<P>But in a war of ideas, to do nothing is the worst of all options.
