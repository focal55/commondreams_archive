<p>As the wildfire of corporate scandals rages around us, it's clear it’s being 

fueled by the dry rot of conflicts of interest: accountants double dipping as 

consultants, Wall Street analysts acting as investment bankers, politicians turning 

a blind eye on the dirty deeds of their campaign donors. But there is another, 

even more combustible conflict of interest that has yet to hit the headlines. 

The two-faced status of mutual funds managers. 

<p> Mutual funds are now among the largest owners of American corporations -- 

controlling close to $3 trillion in stock. The 75 largest mutual fund companies 

control 44 percent of the voting power at U.S. companies. So there are enormous 

consequences for all of us when the owners elect not to act like owners, but like 

timorous lackeys desperate to please management. 

<p> But that's exactly what's happening because of a gargantuan conflict of interest: 

The giant mutual funds are serving two masters. As owners of huge amounts of stock, 

it is their job to hold incompetent or self-interested management accountable. 

But there are massive fees coming their way when corporate executives award them 

401(k) and pension fund assets to invest. 

<p> For instance, the nation’s largest mutual fund, Fidelity, which owns 5.3 percent 

of Tyco's stock, also earned $2 million in 1999 for its part in running Tyco's 

401(k) plans. Indeed, last year over 50 percent of Fidelity's $9.8 billion in 

revenues was generated by administering 401(k) plans and other employee benefit 

services for some 11,000 companies, including Philip Morris, Shell, IBM, Monsanto 

and Ford. 

<p> Those running the mutual funds know that if they create controversy they jeopardize 

their chances of getting the contracts for these services. And it's definitely 

controversial to make a stink about excessive CEO pay packages, blank check loans 

to senior executives, or abusive accounting strategies. That’s why the whistle 

they should be blowing seems stuck in their throat. 

<p> So they hold their tongues, don't ask the tough questions, and time and again 

refuse to disclose how they vote on proxy ballots. And as California Treasurer 

Phil Angelides told me: "That silence speaks volumes." Angelides is at the forefront 

of demanding that mutual funds be more transparent, but, so far, to no avail. 

<p> With the monster mutual funds too afraid of losing business to ever rock the 

boat -- with ownership essentially AWOL -- irresponsible corporate execs have 

been allowed to run wild. This is how this mother of all conflicts of interest 

begets her malevolent progeny. 

<p> With their financial clout, if mutual funds demanded change they would not 

-- indeed, could not -- be ignored. In fact, they could have insisted on -- and 

gotten -- all the rules and standards the new corporate reform law imposes. And 

much, much more. But because of their competing interests, they didn't -- to their 

lasting shame, the detriment of their investors, and, indeed, to the detriment 

of us all. 

<p> Imagine how different things would be if these funds, instead of abrogating 

their responsibility as owners, had embraced it. If you owned hundreds of millions 

of shares in a company, would you be sitting on your duff waiting for Harvey Pitt 

to rush to the rescue and protect your assets? Or would you be taking matters 

into your own hands? Mutual funds are not just sleeping giants. They are giants 

with a serious case of narcolepsy. 

<p> And it's not like there are no role models. Take the example of Bill Gross, 

founder and managing director of Pacific Investment Management Co. (PIMCO), which 

manages over $250 billion in bond funds. This spring, after Gross took General 

Electric to the woodshed for misleading investors about the company's debt, he 

unloaded most of PIMCO's $1 billion in GE bonds. 

<p> "I picked on GE," Gross told me, "because I wanted to alert the investment 

universe that it wasn't just Enron, Tyco or WorldCom pulling some fast ones, but 

GE -- the biggest guy on the block -- and probably everyone in between. GE definitely 

changed things in the last six months and I sort of think I nudged them along 

the way." 

<p> He didn't just nudge them along the way. He wounded them enough to force them 

to clean up their balance sheet. Gross' speaking out was as remarkable for its 

effectiveness as it was for its rarity. 

<p> To see how an investment fund that doesn't have its hands tied by conflicts 

of interest might operate, take a look at the California Public Employees' Retirement 

System (Calpers), the nation's largest pension fund, which manages $137 billion. 

<p> Since Calpers gets its money directly from the state of California, it doesn't 

have to kow-tow to the whims of corporate bosses dangling the prize of juicy pension 

fund management fees. Calpers has announced that it will not do business with 

any bank that breeches the Chinese Wall between research and banking, and is considering 

Angelides' proposal that it divest from any company that has moved offshore to 

avoid paying taxes. 

<p> "What we've tried to do," Angelides told me, "is ask the question: how can 

we use our power to send a clear message to the market about the importance of 

corporate responsibility and conduct?" 

<p> The debate over the last few months has focused on accounting firms not mixing 

auditing with consulting, and investment banks keeping research independent of 

banking. It is now time to hold mutual funds accountable: Isn't their fiduciary 

obligation to their investors paramount? Or are they using the money of working 

Americans as a come-on to generate more servicing fees? 

<p> The biggest mutual funds like to adorn themselves with high-minded monikers 

like Fidelity, Puritan, Flagship, and Strong American. They now need to start 

living up to their true-blue names.
