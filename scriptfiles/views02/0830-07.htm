<p>It is suddenly <i>de rigueur</i> for US officials to say, "Saddam Hussein gassed 

his own people." They are evidently referring to the Iraqi military's use of chemical 

weapons in the Iraqi Kurdistan town of Halabja in March 1988 during the Iran-Iraq 

War, and then in the area controlled by the Teheran-backed Kurdish insurgents 

after the cease-fire in August. </p>

<p> Since Baghdad's deployment of chemical arms in war as well as peace was known 

at the time, the question is: What did the US government do about it then? Nothing. 

Worse, so strong was the hold of the pro-Iraq lobby on the Republican administration 

of President Ronald Reagan, it succeeded in getting the White House to frustrate 

the Senate's attempt to penalize Baghdad for violating the Geneva Protocol on 

Chemical Weapons, which it had signed. This led Saddam to believe that Washington 

was firmly on his side--a conclusion that paved the way for his invasion of Kuwait 

and the 1991 Gulf War, the full consequences of which have yet to play themselves 

out. </p>

<p> During the five years following October 1983, Iraq used 100,000 munitions, 

containing chiefly mustard gas, which produces blisters first on the skin and 

then inside the lungs, and nerve gas, which attacks the nervous system, but also 

cyanide gas. From the initial use of such agents in extremis to repel Iranian 

offensives, the Iraqis went on to deploy them extensively as a vital element of 

their assaults in the spring and summer of 1988 to retake lost territories. At 

the time, even as the US government had knowledge of these attacks, it provided 

intelligence and planning assistance to the Iraqi army, according to an August 

18 front-page report by Patrick Tyler in the<i> New York Times</i>. </p>

<p> Iraq's use of poison gases to regain the Fao Peninsula, captured by Iran in 

early 1986, was so blatant that the United Nations Security Council could no longer 

accept Baghdad's routine denials. After examining 700 Iranian casualties, the 

UN team of experts concluded that Iraq used mustard and nerve gases on many occasions. 

</p>

<p> Yet, instead of condemning Iraq unequivocally for its actions, the Security 

Council, dominated by Washington and Moscow, both of them pro-Baghdad, balanced 

its condemnation of Iraq with its disapproval of "the prolongation of the conflict" 

by Iran, which had refused to agree to a cease-fire until the Council named Iraq 

the aggressor (which America got around to doing in 1998!). </p>

<p> Contrary to its proclamations of neutrality, Washington had all along been 

pro-Iraq. It lost little time in supplying Baghdad with intelligence gathered 

by the Saudi-owned but Pentagon-operated AWACS (Airborne Warning and Control Systems) 

flying in the region. This tilt became an embrace after the re-election of Reagan 

as president in November 1984, when Iraq and America re-established diplomatic 

ties. </p>

<p> From mid-1986, assisted by the Pentagon, which secretly seconded its Air Force 

officers to work with their Iraqi counterparts, Iraq improved its accuracy in 

targeting, hitting Iran's bridges, factories and power plants relentlessly, and 

extending its air strikes to the Iranian oil terminals in the Lower Gulf. Under 

the rubric of escorting Kuwaiti oil tankers, the Pentagon built up an armada in 

the gulf, which clashed with the puny Iranian navy and destroyed two Iranian offshore 

oil platforms in the Lower Gulf in retaliation for an Iranian missile attack on 

a US-flagged super-tanker docked in Kuwaiti waters. </p>

<p> It was against this backdrop that Iraq began striking Teheran with its upgraded 

Scud ground-to-ground missiles in late February 1988. To recapture Halabja, a 

town of 70,000 about fifteen miles from the border, from Iran and its Kurdish 

allies, who had seized it in March, the Iraqi Air Force attacked it with poison 

gas bombs, killing 3,200 to 5,000 civilians. The images of men, women and children 

frozen in instant death, relayed by the Iranian media, shocked the world. Yet 

no condemnation came from Washington. </p>

<p> It was only when, following the truce with Teheran in August, Saddam made 

extensive use of chemical agents to retake 4,000 square miles controlled by the 

Kurdish rebels that the Security Council decided to send a team to determine if 

Iraq had deployed chemical arms. Baghdad refused to cooperate. </p>

<p> But instead of pressing Baghdad to reverse its stance, or face an immediate 

ban on the sale of US military equipment and advanced technology to Iraq by the 

revival of the Senate's bill, US Secretary of State George Shultz chose merely 

to say that interviews with the Kurdish refugees in Turkey, and "other sources" 

(which remained obscure), pointed toward Baghdad's using chemical weapons. These 

two elements did not add up to "conclusive" proof. Such was the verdict of Shultz's 

British counterpart, Sir Geoffrey Howe. "If conclusive evidence is obtained, then 

punitive measures against Iraq have not been ruled out," he said. But neither 

he nor Shultz is known to have made a further attempt to get at the truth. Baghdad 

went unpunished. </p>

<p> That is where the matter rested for fourteen years--until "gassing his own 

people" became a catchy slogan to demonize Saddam in the popular American imagination.
