The Office of Strategic Influence went from obscurity to infamy to 

oblivion during a spin cycle that lasted just seven days in late February. 

Coming to terms with a week of negative coverage after news broke that the 

Pentagon office might purposely deceive foreign media, a somber defense 

secretary announced: "It is being closed down." But for Donald Rumsfeld and 

his colleagues along the Potomac, the inky cloud of bad publicity has a big 

silver lining.



      <p>Orders to shut the controversial office came a day after President 

Bush proclaimed zero tolerance for lies from U.S. officials. "We'll tell 

the American people the truth," he vowed.



      <p>Would the Defense Department try to deceive journalists? The question 

in the air was distasteful, and the answer from Rumsfeld could only offer 

comfort: "This is something the Pentagon has not done, is not doing and 

would not condone."



      <p>A retired Air Force general was likewise reassuring when the Office 

of Strategic Influence crashed and burned. "I'm absolutely convinced that 

in no way would top officials of the administration ever have approved 

lying to the media," said Donald Shepperd, who now works as a CNN military 

analyst.



      <p>After Rumsfeld ceremoniously disbanded the office, amid profuse 

pledges of veracity, Newsday columnist Ellis Henican astutely observed: 

"But don't worry, Rumsfeld's people were whispering yesterday around the 

Pentagon. They'll keep on spreading whatever stories they think they have 

to -- to foreigners especially. Call it the free flow of misinformation. 

Who needs a formal office for that?"



      <p>The whole brouhaha must have caused quite a few laughs in high places 

behind the Pentagon's thick walls.



      <p>In American news outlets, some of the attacks on the Office of 

Strategic Influence actually reinforced the notion that the U.S. government 

has no rational motive for hiding truth, since its real endeavors can 

proudly stand the light of day. It's an easy misconception that would 

hardly displease the propagandists who concocted the Office of Strategic 

Influence in the first place.



      <p>At the end of a tough New York Times piece, titled "Office of 

Strategic Mendacity," columnist Maureen Dowd applied an oily salve to the 

PR wounds she'd just inflicted. "Our cause is just," she concluded. "So why 

not just tell the truth?"



      <p>Why not just tell the truth? Because -- whether the issue is support 

for human-rights abusers or civilian deaths courtesy of U.S. taxpayers -- 

"the truth" would often indicate that the Pentagon's cause is not just. 

That's why not.



      <p>As soon as Rumsfeld declared the Office of Strategic Influence to be 

null and void, some public-relations dividends began to flow. The Chicago 

Tribune quoted Lucy Dalglish, executive director of the Reporters Committee 

for Freedom of the Press, generously praising officials at the Pentagon: 

"This is good news for the public. Now we can have more confidence that 

what they're telling us is true."



      <p>But anyone would be ill-advised to have "confidence" in the 

truthfulness of Pentagon pronouncements -- or to trust that officials 

aren't hiding key facts with the simple strategy of withholding 

information. As a practical matter, the most effective whoppers -- "the 

greatest triumphs of propaganda," in the words of Aldous Huxley -- are told 

by maintaining "silence about truth."



      <p>Four centuries ago, the French cardinal and statesman Richelieu wrote 

that concealing true intentions "is the art of kings." ("Savoir dissimuler 

est le savoir des rois.") For kings and presidents, the illusion of 

credibility is crucial. Manipulative successes hinge on deference from 

courtiers and scribes; reporters and pundits.



      <p>To a significant extent, the uproar over the Office of Strategic 

Influence could end up leaving the impression that the Pentagon has a 

policy of being truthful with journalists. If so, other institutions eager 

to repair their images might consider setting the stage for similar 

damage-control moves.



      <p>For instance, if a staffer at Philip Morris leaked a memo proposing 

to deliberately target teenagers with cigarette advertisements, the 

president of the firm could then call a news conference to explain that 

he's shocked -- shocked! -- that anyone would suggest such a thing. With 

luck, some news accounts would portray nipping the formal proposal in the 

bud as an indication of resolute integrity. Meanwhile, young people would 

remain in the cross hairs of countless cigarette ads.



      <p>Such tactics can only succeed, of course, to the extent that 

journalists are gullible -- or believe that they must pretend to be -- 

while encouraging the public to go along with the charade.



      <p>Hey, whatever works.
