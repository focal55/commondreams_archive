<p>They spoke in different voices and from different perspectives. But the dozens 

of Wisconsinites who addressed Monday's extraordinary legislative hearing on whether 

the United States should attack Iraq delivered a single message: The Bush administration's 

attempt to fake up a case for war has not succeeded in convincing the people of 

this state that there is a need to go to war. 

<P>Former U.S. Rep. Robert Kastenmeier, who represented south-central Wisconsin 

in Congress for 32 years, told the town hall meeting at the Capitol, "I wish my 

fellow Americans were not so easily talked into going to war." But, as speaker 

after speaker came to the microphone in the State Capitol hearing room, it was 

clear that Wisconsinites are not as easily fooled as some Americans. 

<P>As state Sen. Fred Risser, D-Madison, and state Reps. Frank Boyle, D-Superior, 

and Mark Miller, D-Monona, listened, a stunningly diverse array of speakers addressed 

the question of whether the United States should launch a pre-emptive attack on 

Iraq. Religious leaders and atheists, farmers and city folks, students and professors, 

elected officials and people who said they had previously been apolitical all 

answered, "No!" 

<P>Perhaps the most striking detail of the day - and it really was a <EM>day</EM> 

of testimony - was the age range of the speakers. 

<P>Sixteen-year-old Norah Hazelton, a Stoughton High School junior, waited more 

than three hours to argue, "The U.S. should not even be considering war when all 

of the alternative options have not been explored." 

<P>Referring to the inadequate "case" that the Bush administration has made for 

launching a pre-emptive attack on Iraq, Hazelton said, "I don't see why we should 

risk starting World War III over a paranoid assumption." 

<P>Hazelton may be young and idealistic. 

<P>But her take on the Bush administration's ill-advised rush to war was echoed 

by the elderly and experienced - from Kastenmeier to the many war veterans who 

addressed the hearing. 

<P>"Whether or not the Congress approves, whether or not the United Nations approves, 

I oppose bombing Iraq," said Ted Shannon, a World War II veteran from Middleton. 

<P>Shannon argued that the Bush administration is engaging in hyperbole about 

Iraq in order to turn the attention of the American people away from a badly stumbling 

economy and the president's failure to address real threats to the United States 

and the world. "Iraqis are not our enemies. Our enemies are poverty and disease 

at home and abroad," said Shannon, who called talk of war with Iraq "a very convenient 

foil to distract our nation." 

<P>Shannon joined veterans from World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War 

who argued passionately against the unnecessary war that the Bush administration 

is now attempting to cook up. 

<P>"Among the strongest critics of proposals for new wars are the veterans of 

past wars," said World War II veteran Jackson Tiffany, 77, who said he and other 

veterans of the fight against Hitler's aggression felt a sense of "outrage that 

our nation would be considering a pre-emptive war." 

<P>It is sad that members of Wisconsin's congressional delegation were not present 

to hear the testimony from their constituents on an issue the House and Senate 

could be addressing as early as this week. The state's two senators and nine representatives 

should have rearranged their schedules to be present. But their absence is no 

excuse for a vote cast against the wishes and the sound arguments of their constituents. 

<P>Congressional votes on whether to give the president the authority to wage 

war against Iraq are coming fast - perhaps before the end of this week. If Wisconsin's 

representatives choose to represent Wisconsin, they will listen to the loud voices 

of the people of this state and vote "no!"</p>
