<p>Before we talk about a new war with Iraq, we must recognize that the "old war" 

never ended. Last month, an airstrike by the United States killed one Iraqi and 

injured 17 others -- and we should not miss the significance of this fact. More 

than a thousand Iraqis have been killed and many more wounded since the illegal 

no-fly zones were imposed in 1991 -- areas that we purportedly patrol to keep 

Iraqis safe. 

<P>In spite of the slanted testimony of the recent Senate Foreign Relations Committee 

hearings on the potential for a renewed war with Iraq, where no dissenters were 

allowed to speak, the entire world seems to be sending a message to the United 

States that invading Iraq and deposing Saddam Hussein is an unequivocally bad 

idea. 

<P>Nations such as Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Germany have demonstrated 

outright disapproval and nonsupport for a U.S.-led war against Iraq. 

<P>Not invited to testify were Scott Ritter, the ex-U.S. Marine who led the UNSCOM 

weapons inspection team until December 1998 when the United Nations withdrew the 

group prior to a heavy bombing raid on Baghdad, and Dennis Halliday and Hans Graf 

von Sponeck, two career United Nations officials who resigned their posts as chief 

humanitarian coordinators in Iraq in protest of the devastating effects of the 

sanctions. These three would have provided vital information regarding the status 

of the Iraqi population, the deaths of more than half a million children due to 

preventable illnesses and malnutrition, and more than a million total people in 

Iraq since the Gulf War of 1991. 

<P>"I bear personal witness through seven years as a chief weapons inspector in 

Iraq for the United Nations to both the scope of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction 

programs and the effectiveness of the U.N. weapons inspectors in ultimately eliminating 

them. While we were never able to provide 100 percent certainty regarding the 

disposition of Iraq's proscribed weaponry, we did ascertain a 90 to 95 percent 

level of verified disarmament. This figure takes into account the destruction 

or dismantling of every major factory associated with prohibited weapons manufacture, 

all significant items of production equipment, and the majority of the weapons 

and agent produced by Iraq," wrote Ritter July 20 for the Boston Globe. 

<P>Noticeably absent from the dialogue about Iraq is the impact a "new" war would 

have on the civilian population. A Los Angeles Times report states that much of 

the fighting this time around would be centered in cities and urban areas, increasing 

the likelihood of high numbers of civilian casualties. 

<P>Also unmentioned is the impact the war preparation is having on the children 

of Iraq whose lives are suspended in wait of more bombings. In a letter to American 

students in reference to the December 1998 bombing, "Please send us gifts and 

not bombs from Father Christmas." We must consider the psychological toll that 

even the preparation for war takes on the children. 

<P>The following stories attempt to humanize the lives of average Iraqis as I 

encountered them last summer. Not much has changed since then.

<P><b>Scenes of war </b>

<P>Iraq is the cradle of civilization, home to the famed Garden of Eden, to Babylon, 

to the Tigris and Euphrates, to the Fertile Crescent. It houses the birthplace 

of Abraham, the mosque of Imam Ali and the most widely accepted evidence of the 

Great Flood -- seashells atop a 4,000-year-old ziggurat in the middle of the desert. 

Yet, since the Gulf War, the sanctity of this historically significant land has 

been desecrated and its people demoralized, as I learned while visiting Iraq July 

and August 2001. 

<P>Daily calls to prayer broadcast throughout the city awakened me to the impact 

of the sanctions and the residual effects of the Gulf War. The call begins with 

"God is greater than all." I quickly learned that since Aug. 6, 1990, the effects 

of war are even more far-reaching than God.

<P><b>Omran </b>

<P>Omran was a 12-year-old shepherd boy walking through his family's field in 

May 2000 when a stray bomb fell from a U.S. plane patrolling the illegal no-fly 

zones over the southern portion of Iraq. This bomb instantly killed him -- and 

ripped apart the social fabric of his tiny village near Najaf. 

<P>I visited Omran's family last summer. I tried my best to explain to Omran's 

mother, father, brothers and entire village that the memory of their son is not 

forgotten. Omran's story has been told hundreds of times to high school students, 

to colleges, to peace and justice and religious groups across the United States 

as part of a nationwide project to remember Omran. 

<P>I listened as Omran's father told of his inexplicable loss, of the pain of 

losing a child, of no apology from anyone, save the five American pacifists sitting 

before him hot and dusty in the dry Iraq desert. Omran's mother, who has scarcely 

spoken since he was killed and who is suffering from a serious heart condition, 

embraced me and we shed tears together over the helplessness of the situation.

<P><b>Cancer ward </b>

<P>It is 140 degrees inside the hospital at Amara. The air conditioning does not 

work because the electrical facilities were bombed during the Gulf War and spare 

parts are routinely denied as dual-use items by the Sanctions Committee at the 

United Nations. 

<P>A mother sits cross-legged on her son's bare hospital bed, a piece of torn 

cardboard in one hand, fanning her child. She is sobbing uncontrollably, rocking 

back and forth. Her son is unconscious, dying of cancer; he has no IV bag, no 

medicine, no painkillers. She has no tissue, so I ask for a handful and give them 

to her; she glances at me with tired appreciation. 

<P>She places the cardboard fan on the bed and begins to knead at her son's body 

-- his torso, his legs -- in a desperate attempt to rouse him. He does not move. 

I sit helpless on the sheetless bed next to her, watching, invading this private 

moment, glued to this scene, futile tears rolling down my cheeks. I think, "This 

is my fault." The guilt endures. 

<P>Across the room, the doctor escorting our group through the hospital pokes 

and prods at sleeping, sick babies causing them to wake up screaming in pain to 

demonstrate the malignancies, tumors and gross deformities that have mysteriously 

appeared since the Gulf War. All the children are crying now; all their mothers 

try to comfort them and not look annoyed that the gawking Americans have disturbed 

their lives.

<P><b>The car accident </b>

<P>We fasted for a day across from the United Nations on Aug. 6, 2001, in the 

oppressive heat. At the end of the day, a blowout on the road a few feet from 

us caused a car to spin out of control and crash into our Iraqi friend's car -- 

our 70-year-old friend who is a taxi driver and who relies on his car for income. 

Both cars are totally wrecked, blood everywhere. Spare car parts and new tires 

are expensive. The transfer rate for the Iraqi dinar to U.S. dollars has been 

devalued from 3:1 to 2000:1, meaning average Iraqis have virtually no purchasing 

power. 

<P>I call out for our friend who miraculously emerges from the back seat of his 

smashed vehicle, banged, bruised and filled with glass in his eyes. He is dazed, 

then suddenly realizes that his livelihood has been instantaneously taken from 

him. He starts to cry. I try to negotiate with Kalashnikov-toting soldiers to 

let our friend get examined by a United Nations doctor for internal injuries before 

they take him to the police station. We ask another Iraqi how much to junk the 

car and buy a new one. He looks surprised. "Junk the car? In Iraq, we fix everything." 

<P>While we in the United States live out foreign wars vicariously through our 

movies, through the news and through the threats of nuclear force made by those 

in power, I recall the people I met in Iraq whose lives are considerably less 

glamorous than the remote Hollywood versions we see and hear about. I often wonder 

if the case of Iraq is an example of the best our foreign policy can be. 

<P>Iraq is more than its one leader. It is a country of 23 million people who 

all have stories, hopes and fears.

<P><b>Basketball and books </b>

<P>When 58-year-old Zuhair Matti moved to Los Angeles from Baghdad, Iraq, in March 

1977, he hardly figured that returning to his homeland would be an intangible 

goal. 

<P>A member of the 1973 Iraqi Olympic basketball team, Matti played against athletes 

from all over the world in the games that symbolize internationalism, peace and 

sportsmanship. Held in Tehran, Iran, just a few years prior to the Iran-Iraq war, 

the 1973 Olympics were a chance for Matti to shine as a national celebrity for 

Iraq. His athletic ability and love of his country and people made him a national 

superhero with fame and status. 

<P>In 1977, Matti moved to Los Angeles at the behest of his wife, whose family 

lived here. Now an American citizen with two American-born sons, ages 23 and 14, 

Matti makes ends meet by working at Home Depot, still pining for a family half 

a globe away whom he has not seen for 24 years. 

<P>When Matti fled Iraq, he was an officer in the army; he took a vacation and 

never returned. That, compiled with travel made more difficult by the U.N.-imposed 

and U.S./U.K.-upheld economic sanctions, which disallow travel to and from Iraq, 

dims hopes that Zuhair will return to his native country soon. He explains: "Travel 

is so expensive and I don't want to return with only a few dollars in my pocket. 

I want to be able to treat everyone very well when I go back. Iraqis are the most 

generous people on Earth. They are magnanimous people." 

<P>Al-Mutannabi Street in Baghdad is a well-known book market there, which offers 

evidence to the academic and intellectual impact of embargo. Half a mile long, 

lined on both sides of the street with books ranging from 1980s computer manuals 

to linguistics textbooks to copies of the Qu'ran, the book market demonstrates 

the impact on the educated class through a persistent starvation of minds and 

deprivation of information. 

<P>The street is lined with children peddling comic books and middle-aged men 

selling novels, manuals and movie posters. The children ought to be in school 

and the men ought to be working in their professional capacities. Fifty-year-old 

shoe shiners were at one time physics professors. Taxi drivers were electrical 

engineers. 

<P>Since it is illegal to send anything weighing more than 12 ounces to Iraq through 

the U.S. Postal Service, medical textbooks and other professional journals cannot 

be sent. None of the books I saw was published later than 1989. 

<P>That hot day on Aug. 3, 2001, I met Matti's brother Gassan selling books on 

Al-Mutannabi Street. Through a translator, he asked where I live. When I replied 

that I live near Los Angeles, his face lit up. "Please call my brother when you 

get back home," he implored. "Tell him I am well! Tell him our mother is well! 

Tell him how I look; you see I look well, right? I have not seen him in more than 

20 years!" 

<P>One of the few promises I can make to the Iraqis I met last summer is that 

upon my return, I will tell their stories to as many people as will listen. Upon 

returning to the United States, I called and subsequently met Zuhair Matti, fulfilling 

Gassan's wish. 

<P>"You are a nice young woman, Leah," Matti tells me. "Thank you for what you 

are doing for my people." His gratitude surprises me, yet marks a quintessentially 

Arab sentiment that for however good you are to someone, the goodness will be 

returned tenfold to you. 

<P>Perhaps Zuhair Matti will be able to travel to Iraq, whether or not he violates 

the inhumane sanctions that divide families and isolate the Fertile Crescent from 

the rest of civilization. Perhaps he will see his aging mother before she passes 

away. He says that the most important thing is "to judge a person based on how 

nice he is," and how important it is to have diverse friends. He believes that 

people are good, regardless of race and ethnicity. 

<P>Perhaps if more Americans knew Iraqis like Zuhair Matti, we would not be so 

quick to condemn all Iraqis to a slow death via sanctions or an even more expedient 

death in a new war.

<P><b>Precarious situation </b>

<P>Prior to 1990, Iraq was deemed an emerging first-world country by the United 

Nations. The oil empire had brought Iraqi citizens great wealth and a prosperous 

society that boasted free medical care for every citizen as well as free education 

up through university. In many ways, the standard of living in Iraq once was comparable 

to middle-class American life. 

<P>Because of the sanctions, no currency flows in or out of Iraq. Any financial 

transactions must be approved by the Sanctions Committee 661 at the United Nations 

in New York. It is illegal to wire money from the United States -- or anywhere 

else -- to family inside Iraq's borders. All goods and funds entering or leaving 

Iraq must have the approval of the five permanent members of the Security Council 

whose representatives sit on the 661 Committee. The economy has been at a standstill 

for 11 years, targeting the civilian population while a powerful few score illegal 

contracts to smuggle oil out of the country. 

<P>Yet for most Iraqis in 2002, many of the basic health and household amenities 

are far out of reach. Prior to the Gulf War in 1991, the transfer rate of dinar:dollars 

was 3:1. Now the transfer rate soars at nearly 2,000 dinar to $1, effectively 

stripping the average, middle-class Iraqis of any meaningful purchasing power. 

<P>During a visit to a pharmacy in Baghdad, I learned that only the wealthiest 

private sector can afford higher-quality toothpaste, costing 1,250 dinar (71 cents). 

The rest of the population buys lower-quality toothpaste at 250 dinar (14 cents). 

Prior to 1990, diapers cost 18 dinar and were widely used throughout Iraq. A box 

of 10 diapers in August 2001 cost between 2,000 to 4,000 dinar ($1.14 to $2.29). 

One bottle of shampoo costs 1,500 dinar, or $1.86. 

<P>An average salary in Iraq is roughly 5,000 dinar per month. The Iraqi government, 

dominated by the Ba'ath party, employs many people -- doctors, teachers, engineers 

and other civil servants. Prior to the Gulf War, teachers in Iraq earned the equivalent 

of $300 to $400 per month. They now earn the equivalent of $3 to $4 per month. 

<P>Health care has gained a price tag as well in Iraq. Once-affordable medicines 

like aspirin are too expensive for people to buy now. Ibuprofen and vitamins cost 

200 dinar each (11 cents) for 10 tablets. Twelve capsules of Erythromyacin, an 

antibiotic, cost 500 dinar (29 cents). Some health-care and household items are 

available in Iraq and to a certain extent are available to the general public. 

But, families must spend their money only on necessities such as rent and food 

rather than on aspirin and cough syrup or trips to the hospital. 

<P>Iraqi families finding themselves in financially precarious situations often 

take their children out of school and send them to beg, steal, peddle candy or 

cigarettes or shine shoes. I spent a great deal of time with Achmed and Saif, 

13 and 12, respectively, who shined our shoes every day for 750 dinar, less than 

50 cents. They arrived at our hotel long before we awoke and stayed until late 

at night. 

<P>Because of the devaluation of the dinar, often only one child per family will 

be able to attend school due to the cost of supplies such as books, shoes and 

clothes. A remarkable increase in both depression and juvenile delinquency has 

occurred in Iraq in the past 11 years. One 10-year-old boy had been sent by his 

father to sell cigarettes on the street to increase the family's income rather 

than attend school. Many customers took advantage of his naivete, taking cigarettes 

and promising to return with payment later. At the end of the day, when the boy 

had no cigarettes and no money to show, his father scolded him and sent him to 

bed with no dinner. This young boy went to his room, wrapped himself in towels 

and set himself on fire. 

<P>Once-rare crimes like theft and vandalism are now more commonplace among the 

young, and because the onset of social problems only began within the last 11 

years, state-supported social services have only a feeble infrastructure to deal 

with the ever-expanding magnitude of these issues. 

<P>Desperation and poverty have contributed to a breakdown in family structure 

and support. The hopelessness for a better future pervades the culture of Iraq, 

especially among the youth. Their scholastic apathy shows a scary trend signifying 

their awareness of their dim future. Regardless of how hard they study in school, 

they know they do not have promising prospects. 

<P>We must not allow Iraqis to take steps backward toward enforced child labor, 

divestment from quality education and further poverty. Justice and peace for Iraqis 

mean that they must have a sense of economic mobility and stability in their society.
