<p> There is little that those of us who oppose the coming war with Iraq can now 

do to prevent it. George Bush has staked his credibility on the project; he has 

mid-term elections to consider, oil supplies to secure and a flagging war on terror 

to revive. Our voices are as little heeded in the White House as the singing of 

the birds. 

<P>Our role is now, perhaps, confined to the modest but necessary task of demonstrating 

the withdrawal of our consent, while seeking to undermine the moral confidence 

which could turn the attack on Iraq into a war against all those states perceived 

to offend US strategic interests. No task is more urgent than to expose the two 

astonishing lies contained in George Bush's radio address on Saturday, namely 

that "the United States does not desire military conflict, because we know the 

awful nature of war" and "we hope that Iraq complies with the world's demands". 

Mr Bush appears to have done everything in his power to prevent Iraq from complying 

with the world's demands, while ensuring that military conflict becomes inevitable. 

<P>On July 4 this year, Kofi Annan, the secretary-general of the United Nations, 

began negotiating with Iraq over the return of UN weapons inspectors. Iraq had 

resisted UN inspections for three and a half years, but now it felt the screw 

turning, and appeared to be on the point of capitulation. On July 5, the Pentagon 

leaked its war plan to the New York Times. The US, a Pentagon official revealed, 

was preparing "a major air campaign and land invasion" to "topple President Saddam 

Hussein". The talks immediately collapsed. 

<P>Ten days ago, they were about to resume. Hans Blix, the head of the UN inspections 

body, was due to meet Iraqi officials in Vienna, to discuss the practicalities 

of re-entering the country. The US airforce launched bombing raids on Basra, in 

southern Iraq, destroying a radar system. As the Russian government pointed out, 

the attack could scarcely have been better designed to scupper the talks. But 

this time the Iraqis, mindful of the consequences of excluding the inspectors, 

kept talking. Last Tuesday, they agreed to let the UN back in. The State Department 

immediately announced, with more candor than elegance, that it would "go into 

thwart mode". 

<P>It wasn't bluffing. The following day, it leaked the draft resolution on inspections 

it was placing before the UN Security Council. This resembles nothing so much 

as a plan for unopposed invasion. The decisions about which sites should be "inspected" 

would no longer be made by the UN alone, but also by "any permanent member of 

the security council", such as the United States. The people inspecting these 

sites could also be chosen by the US, and they would enjoy "unrestricted rights 

of entry into and out of Iraq" and "the right to free, unrestricted and immediate 

movement" within Iraq, "including unrestricted access to presidential sites". 

They would be permitted to establish "regional bases and operating bases throughout 

Iraq", where they would be "accompanied... by sufficient US security forces to 

protect them". They would have the right to declare exclusion zones, no-fly zones 

and "ground and air transit corridors". They would be allowed to fly and land 

as many planes, helicopters and surveillance drones in Iraq as they want, to set 

up "encrypted communication" networks and to seize "any equipment" they choose 

to lay hands on. 

<P>The resolution, in other words, could not have failed to remind Iraq of the 

alleged infiltration of the UN team in 1996. Both the Iraqi government and the 

former inspector Scott Ritter maintain that the weapons inspectors were joined 

that year by CIA covert operations specialists, who used the UN's special access 

to collect information and encourage the republican guard to launch a coup. On 

Thursday, Britain and the United States instructed the weapons inspectors not 

to enter Iraq until the new resolution has been adopted. 

<P>As Milan Rai's new book War Plan Iraq documents, the US has been undermining 

disarmament for years. The UN's principal means of persuasion was paragraph 22 

of the security council's resolution 687, which promised that economic sanctions 

would be lifted once Iraq ceased to possess weapons of mass destruction. But in 

April 1994, Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, unilaterally withdrew 

this promise, removing Iraq's main incentive to comply. Three years later his 

successor, Madeleine Albright, insisted that sanctions would not be lifted while 

Saddam remained in power. 

<P>The US government maintains that Saddam Hussein expelled the UN inspectors 

from Iraq in 1998, but this is not true. On October 30 1998, the US rejected a 

new UN proposal by again refusing to lift the oil embargo if Iraq disarmed. On 

the following day, the Iraqi government announced that it would cease to cooperate 

with the inspectors. In fact it permitted them to continue working, and over the 

next six weeks they completed around 300 operations. 

<P> On December 14, Richard Butler, the head of the inspection team, published 

a curiously contradictory report. The body of the report recorded that over the 

past month "the majority of the inspections of facilities and sites under the 

ongoing monitoring system were carried out with Iraq's cooperation", but his well-publicized 

conclusion was that "no progress" had been made. Russia and China accused Butler 

of bias. On December 15, the US ambassador to the UN warned him that his team 

should leave Iraq for its own safety. Butler pulled out, and on the following 

day the US started bombing Iraq. 

<P>From that point on, Saddam Hussein refused to allow UN inspectors to return. 

At the end of last year, Jose Bustani, the head of the Organization for the Prohibition 

of Chemical Weapons, proposed a means of resolving the crisis. His Organization 

had not been involved in the messy business of 1998, so he offered to send in 

his own inspectors, and complete the job the UN had almost finished. The US responded 

by demanding Bustani's dismissal. The other member states agreed to depose him 

only after the United States threatened to destroy the Organization if he stayed. 

Now Hans Blix, the head of the new UN inspectorate, may also be feeling the heat. 

On Tuesday he insisted that he would take his orders only from the security council. 

On Thursday, after an hour-long meeting with US officials, he agreed with the 

Americans that there should be no inspections until a new resolution had been 

approved. 

<P>For the past eight years the US, with Britain's help, appears to have been 

seeking to prevent a resolution of the crisis in Iraq. It is almost as if Iraq 

has been kept on ice, as a necessary enemy to be warmed up whenever the occasion 

demands. Today, as the economy slides and Bin Laden's latest mocking message suggests 

that the war on terrorism has so far failed, an enemy which can be located and 

bombed is more necessary than ever. A just war can be pursued only when all peaceful 

means have been exhausted. In this case, the peaceful means have been averted.
