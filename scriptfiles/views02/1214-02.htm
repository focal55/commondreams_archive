<p>A sense of the larger picture is growing among US citizens, notably,

though not only, among a young generation, along with a revulsion

against official and corporate contempt for the will and welfare of

ordinary citizens, for the value of human life itself. The antiwar

movement of this century is a movement to reclaim democracy and to push

it further. It has no token national leaders; it is various in its

formations and organizing principles, often originating and working

locally, yet in touch with other groups. It is connected through free

giveaway papers like the San Francisco-based, nationally distributed

<i><a href="http://www.war-times.org/" target="_new">War Times</a></i>, through Internet sites and e-mail correspondence,

through teach-ins, vigils, strikes, newsletters, cell phones, radio,

cartoon strips, art and bumper stickers, benefits and much else.



</p>

<p>



Links between militarization, racism, economic and gender inequity,

perversion of the criminal justice system and the electoral system are

made not because of laundry-list sectarian opportunism but because, more

and more, the actual connections are being laid bare by the activities

of the current Administration and its corporate family. The origins of

this antiwar movement and all it implies lie in the extremism of a

long-unresponsive government, a stumbling and incoherent empire, most of

whose citizens don't want an empire at such cost, if they want one at

all.

</p>

<p>



To be "antiwar" is not a simple position. It means disentangling the

strands that connect the weapons industry with the lack of will for

diplomacy and coherent foreign policy. It means understanding what the

militarization of a society costs, economically and socially and in

terms of civil liberties, the propaganda of violence as both heroism and

efficient solution. It means probing the official versions to reveal how

and why we are being driven toward aggression. To be "antiwar" is to be

for public debate and knowledge, the foundations of democratic polity.

</p>

<p>



A new growth in public consciousness and political intelligence

challenges an autocratic government from within and is seen as dangerous

to vested interests. Like every past movement for humanization, for the

amelioration of suffering, this antiwar movement will be attacked not

only by the right but by onetime liberals who fear the costs of real

peace and justice more than they dislike the costs of empire. Regime

Change Begins at Home: Vote, said one bumper sticker during the last

election. Regime change is a very large order indeed, and will involve a

long process of public education and self-education, of demanding and

rewarding courage in elected officials and of political work beyond the

ballot. Demonstrations are the tip of the iceberg in this process.

</p>

<p>



Making clear how issues are connected has been the great work of the

progressive movements of the past forty years. Keeping issues separate,

silencing those who try to connect them, has been the great strategy of

media and of presidential power. The fear of socialism, even of the word

itself, suggests how our social imaginations have been abridged and

hampered. For the question of the future is, ineluctably, After regime

change, what? What are we for? What do we want to see happen? And how do

we want to make it happen?</p>
