IN WHAT WE like to call the "waiting period" of the Mideast War, as 

Secretary of State Colin Powell makes his leisurely tour of North Africa, 

answering the always fascinating question "What are you doing here instead of 

in Jerusalem?," let us turn our attention to American policy in the Middle 

East.

<P>First, we must talk about which policy we're talking about: the Bush 

Disengagement, the Bush Doctrine, the Bush Engagement, the Bush Time-to-Get-

Serious Ploy or the Bush How-About-a-Nice-Game-of-Solitaire plan, which was 

operational as of 8:45 a.m. yesterday, when I wrote these words.

<P>The president has told Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon that he really 

must stop rolling over cities and killing civilians, a firm statement that was 

widely interpreted in Israel to mean "Keep right on doing it until Colin 

Powell gets there, and then we'll talk."

<P>Suiting action to words, three days later Bush sent Powell to Casablanca. 

He went there for the waters. He was misinformed.

<P>Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat, meanwhile, was ordered by 

Bush to stop ordering terrorist attacks. At the time, Arafat was huddled in 

three rooms in the middle of what remained of his ruined compound, connected 

to the world by means of a cell phone with failing batteries.

<P>Apparently when Powell gets to Israel (on Friday, unless Sharon isn't 

finished by then), he will suggest some sort of cease-fire. He may be denied 

access to Arafat, but perhaps he'll be allowed to shout at him over the 

rooftops. Powell will also once again announce his displeasure with Israeli 

actions, a statement that will be seen in Israel as meaning "Don't worry, 

we're not about to cut off any aid."

<P>CAN WE SAY a few things that we're pretty sure are true? Can we say that 

American policy toward the Middle East might make more sense if it were based 

on true things?

<P>1. The goal of Ariel Sharon and his cabinet is to end the possibility of a 

Palestinian state anywhere near Israel. That has always been his goal.

<P>Lately, he has taken to calling this policy "part of the war on terrorism," 

since that phrase seems to play darn well in Washington.

<P>2. Yasser Arafat is a weak and untrustworthy leader who has little control 

over the people he leads. He is a figurehead. He is also a symbol to the rest 

of the Arab world, and symbols are important in international politics, and he 

is not the leader of the Palestinian people. There is no leader of the 

Palestinian people.

<P>3. There is, however, a cobbled-together and occasionally functional 

Palestinian state, an "infrastructure," if you will. It is that infrastructure 

that is the target of the Israeli assaults.

<P>4. There is no question that Arafat knew about

<P>and/or authorized some suicide bombings and other attacks on civilians. 

There is no question that Israel has killed many civilians in its current 

offensive -- how many it is impossible to say because the press has been 

denied access to the battle areas.

<P>5. If terrorism is defined as the wanton killing of civilians for political 

ends, it is, as a technique of modern warfare, at least as old as the carpet 

bombing of Dresden. It is horrific and morally unjustifiable, but it is a fact 

of life. Making war on terrorism is like making war on greed -- nice idea, 

probably not practical.

<P>THE PROBLEM WITH our pick-a-number policy is that we are, by our tacit 

support of one side in this conflict, creating conditions that may result in 

either the overthrow of moderate Arab governments or the brutal repression of 

popular movements all over the Mideast.

<P>We need allies. Forget trying to untangle the skeins of conflict in Israel; 

we need to stop the bloodshed and protect the possibility of a peaceful 

Palestinian state or we reap the whirlwind.

<P>We keep saying that we are the last great superpower; how super are we?
