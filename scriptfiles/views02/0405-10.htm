One of the hardest decisions for citizen reform groups to make when 

        supporting legislation that is pending for years is how much weakening 

        they will tolerate before they break away in opposition.

<p>Campaign finance reform in Congress, after years of struggle by coalition 

        groups such as Common Cause and Public Citizen, passed and was unenthusiastically 

        signed into law by President Bush last month. Popularly known as the McCain-Feingold 

        bill (after Republican Senator John McCain and Democratic Senator Russ 

        Feingold), this original reform of corrupt money in politics has been 

        subjected to serious attrition. Originally, it provided for some free 

        television and radio time for ballot-qualified candidates vying for federal 

        office. That and other provisions were dropped in order to pick up support 

        for passage -- so much so that some observers began calling the legislation 

        the &quot;Cain-Gold&quot; bill. </p>

      <p>The core of the new law is banning &quot;soft money&quot; -- those unlimited 

        hundreds of millions of dollars mostly from business interests that flow 

        only into the coffers of the political parties. But in return, McCain-Feingold 

        had to agree to doubling &quot;hard money&quot; that any person could 

        give directly to members of Congress or Presidential candidates. Beginning 

        after the 2002 elections, individuals can give $4,000 for an entire election 

        cycle (primary and general election) instead of $2000. </p>

      <p>As Congressional opponents and their outside patrons chipped away at 

        the legislation during the past four years, the outside reform groups, 

        which have been striving for reform of the auction system of elections 

        for over two decades, continued to bite their lips and remained in support. 

        First, it was half a loaf is better than nothing; then it was a quarter 

        of a loaf. Butthen it became an unwillingness to turn against the legislation, 

        given all those thousands of dedicated hours and commitment to the idea 

        of reform that the bill clung to in their minds. </p>

      <p>Well, one of the long-time citizen organizations concluded that the erosion 

        of the legislation was too much to take. The U.S. Public interest Research 

        Group (U.S. PIRG) on March 20th denounced and opposed McCain-Feingold. 

      </p>

      <p>In its statement, U.S. PIRG said: </p>

      <blockquote>

        

<p><i>&quot;In a climate of spiraling fundraising, and in the wake of the 

          Enron debacle, Congress had the opportunity to pass real campaign finance 

          reform that would have reduced the influence of money on American democracy. 

          Unfortunately, politicians were not up to the task. . . the Senate passed 

          a soft money 'ban' riddled with loopholes and actually increased the 

          amount that the wealthiest individuals can contribute to candidates.&quot;</i></p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>The partially student funded PIRG predicted that &quot;hard money will 

        skyrocket, soft money will go to state and local parties and independent 

        expenditures, candidates will not spend less time fundraising, and big 

        donors will still buy election results to put their favored candidates 

        in office.&quot; </p>

      <p>The groups also predicted that President George W. Bush will become the 

        first major party candidate to refuse to accept voluntary spending limits 

        in the 2004 general election. One Republican campaign manager has predicted 

        that Bush could easily raise $500 million in hard dollars -- an unheard 

        of amount. </p>

      <p>It was not easy for U.S. PIRG to oppose the bill. But there are limits 

        to continual concessions that defeat the purpose of the legislation. Watch 

        for a huge increase in complexity in the federal election rules which 

        already necessitate a very expensive software program merely for candidatecompliance. 

        Soon small party candidates will not be able to afford the compliance 

        costs, never mind the ballot access hurdles, just to have a chance to 

        compete. </p>

      <p>Badly boomerang-prone as the new law is, it did break the myth that no 

        campaign finance reform could ever get through Congress and be signed 

        by a Republican President. Even if it took a myth of a bill to achieve 

        that result. </p>

      <p>Senator Russell Feingold told me last year that he is going to introduce 

        a bolder public financing of public elections bill soon after the McCain-Feingold 

        bill passes. That would certainly simplify the rules as well. </p>

      <p>U.S. PIRG, in the meantime, urges the following ways to sever the link 

        between big money and politics: contribution limits set at a low level 

        that average Americans can afford, mandatory spending limits, strict limits 

        on out-of-district contributions, tax credits for small political donations, 

        and free media for candidates.&quot; </p>

      

<p>This is their answer to what they call the recent &quot;sham reform that 

        takes us backwards.&quot; See <a href="http://www.pirg.org" target="_new">www.pirg.org</a>
