<p>Hi- 

<p>I just watched the season opener of "Wide Angle" on PBS. 

<p>What shameless propaganda and obvious PR maneuvering for Dubya, Rumsfeld and 

Wolfowitz’ nasty little war plan! What a travesty of journalism! What an assemblage 

of hearsay and unexamined assumptions! What a monumental piece of arrogance! How 

much lower can PBS stoop? 

<p>Could you possibly concoct anything more one-sided? You should call the series 

"Right Angle"—and I don’t mean "correct." 

<p>

with a documentary on Iraq. Hosted by former State Department spokesman James 

Rubin and featuring a documentary titled &#8220;Saddam&#8217;s Ultimate Solution,&#8221;

If we cannot demonstrate political power in the face of such horrendous propaganda

</table>Allow me a few questions and observations: 

<p>1) Where were your reporters and Richard Perle back when Saddam took power 

with the help of the CIA and the blessings of the U.S.? 

<p>2) Why do "we" suddenly care about the Kurds when "we’ve" abandoned them to 

slaughter so many times before? Where was your moral outrage while the Kurds were 

actually being gassed in Halabja and elsewhere—when Saddam Hussein was a U.S. 

ally and "we" were supplying him (and the Iranians) in their war against one another? 

Why don’t you mention the more recent and ongoing Turkish attacks against the 

Kurds in Turkey and Northern Iraq? Could it be because Turkey is in NATO? A partner 

in the so-called War on Terrorism? One of the leading recipients of U.S. military 

aid and hardware? 

<p>3) If your reporter wants do some real investigative work, why doesn’t he uncover 

the names of the U.S. and European companies that did business with Saddam during 

this period? Rolf Ekeus’ rationalization isn’t terribly convincing or satisfying 

to an enquiring spirit. Couldn’t your "journalist" have asked others for this 

information instead of formulating a blind alley? I wonder if he even examined 

those unexploded shell casings for lot numbers or other trademarks? Such dedication 

must not go unrewarded. 

<p>4) Can’t you find another side to this story or don’t you even want to bother 

with the trappings of "objectivity" at all? Could you not find Tariq Aziz or Scott 

Ritter or Denis Halliday or Hans Van Sponeck or Ramsey Clark or John Pilger for 

comment? How about the widows and mothers of shepherds bombed in U.S. and British 

air strikes since the war supposedly ended? Would their opinions matter? 

<p>5) Where is any mention of the much more serious effects of the sanctions on 

the people of Iraq? What about "our" use of Uranium 238 weapons during the War 

on Iraq? How about the long-lasting deleterious effects of Gulf War Syndrome, 

massive spills and oilfield fires, deliberate destruction of water systems and 

other civilian infrastructure? How about the willful denial of food and medicine 

to desperate millions? 

<p>6) If there were secret sites manufacturing "weapons of mass destruction," 

what sense would it make to bomb them, thereby further dispersing the deadly chemical 

and biological agents and causing inestimable environmental contamination? Do 

"we" care about future exposures and a long-term legacy or not? It’s rather easy 

to guess the sad answer. 

<p>7) Where is there any support for these allegations of connection to Al Qaeda? 

Why are the sources who purport to know these things unidentified? Couldn’t they 

be protected by "our" intelligence services or set up in the Witness Protection 

Program? 

<p>8) How do we (the people) know this isn’t just part of Rumsfeld’s promise to 

lie to us? 

<p>9) Where is the common-sense-and-decency challenge to the notion that "we" 

have the right to depose other countries’ leaders at will? (Especially ones "we" 

helped to power and collaborated with for years in the past?) Is there any whisper 

of diplomacy? International law? Peaceful, legal "regime change"? 

<p>10) How much you wanna bet the attack will be conveniently placed around the 

fall elections? 

<p>11) Are satellite photos of a few trailers in a line and a road that seems 

to peter out in a sandy, windblown desert (How could that happen?) supposed to 

convince us of nefarious deeds? If this is indeed a suspicious site, why haven’t 

"we" already bombed it like so many others in Iraq? Who or what would stop "us"? 

It’s not like it’s an unusual occurrence, is it? Of course, you wouldn’t want 

to report that, I guess. Those facts aren’t helpful to your campaign. 

<p>12) Why would a "fundamentalist" like bin Laden work hand in hand with a secularist 

like Saddam Hussein? Why would the Kurds be his major target in the area rather 

than Western oil companies or the corrupt monarchies of Gulf States that he despises 

for their abandonment of "traditional values" and compromises with modernist exploiters 

of Arab resources and sovereignty? Isn’t this supposed little grudge against the 

Kurds a little off-message for a guy who is allegedly responsible for attacking 

U.S. embassies, warships and national landmarks? Why would Hussein invite Al Qaeda 

in at a time when he’s trying to get rid of weapons inspectors and escape further 

bombings and sanctions? Why would bin Laden choose the patch of the MidEast/South 

Asia region most surveilled and bombed (until Afghanistan) for his base of operations 

or for conducting "secret terrorist training camps"? 

<p>13) What about "our" not-so-secret terrorist training camps, like Fort Benning? 

What about "our" weapons of mass destruction? What about "our" nuclear capability? 

What about "our" chemical and biological weapons programs? Is Iraq allowed to 

come inspect "our" facilities? Are even our own independent journalists? 

<p>14) Isn’t it thoroughly obvious that this is an administration pretext for 

another oil grab and for the creation of a new more dependable client state? How 

many people in top positions in the Bush administration are former oil executives? 

Who sits on the board of the Carlyle Group? Who hobnobs with Osama’s parents? 

Who sat in on the meetings with Cheney to develop the "new energy policy"? Where 

are the big corporate scandals breaking? Nothing like a little fearmongering and 

war to divert the people’s attention from the criminals at home, eh? 

<p>15) Can’t you at least get Jamie Rubin to pretend he has some differences with 

an old Republican rival like Perle? Can’t he work up any imagined reportorial 

detachment from an American Enterprise Institute hack? Does he have to be such 

a transparent flack by smiling and gushing at the end of the pre-scripted, totally 

rehearsed "interview"? This wasn’t even "softball"; it was more like wiffle ball 

with a marshmallow bat. 

<p>16) Does Rubin have to use the pronoun "we" while mapping out the strategy 

for all-out armed attack of a nation thoroughly demeaned and crippled by more 

than a decade of "the Allied Forces’" ruthless cruelty—a nation currently unengaged 

in military adventures or hostilities with its neighbors (unlike the USA, for 

one prominent example)—with such apparent relish? Are we (the viewers) supposed 

to believe he’s part of the Fourth Estate or is his inability to divorce himself 

from his former post within the establishment somehow supposed to confer his mugging 

and scraping with dignity and authority? 

<p>17) Where were the incubators? Don’t tell me you were concerned with credibility? 

Was this special broadcast gratefully funded by "the Nation of Kuwait" like NPR 

of a recent era? Couldn’t Rubin’s old pal Madeleine Albright be hauled in to reassure 

us that the coming atrocities are "worth the price"? Where was Barry McCaffrey?—an 

expert witness to the massacre of Iraqi non-combatants if ever there was one. 

Will he be called back to the theatre to preside over the carnage or is he still 

too busy murdering campesinos in Colombia? 

<p>18) Doesn’t your collusion in creating the conditions for the invasion and 

overthrow of a foreign government bother you in the slightest? Doesn’t a gleefully 

proposed ouster of another country’s leader involving hundreds of thousands of 

American troops (not to mention a probable equal number of Iraqi casualties) make 

you shudder or think twice? Can you not disguise your greed and jingoism a little 

more carefully? Or perhaps develop a conscience? How about a pretense at impartiality? 

<p>Well, I can probably guess how most of your other shows will go. 

<p>Unfortunately, I may never know, since (except for next week’s promising episode 

by Jon Alpert on China and the WTO) I won’t be watching. I couldn’t bear to waste 

another hour of my life on such patent Machiavellian brainwash as what I saw tonight. 

When you rediscover your mission to provide the public service of genuine journalism 

and alternative broadcasting instead of apologias to cynical hypocrites and cold-blooded 

powerbrokers, drop a line. Until then, I’ll be searching for truly wider perspectives. 

<p>Sincerely unyours,

<p>P.S. Please tell me Doug Cuomo only bestowed your awful drek with his wonderful 

music out of contractual obligations through some package deal. I love the tunes 

he put together for Bill Moyers&#8217; series &quot;NOW,&quot; a much more even-handed 

and tolerable approach to current events (except when Moyers, too, is demonizing 

Muslims and pandering to fears of more terrorist attacks). That show has been 

getting steadily better since its debut and regularly challenges the status quo. 

You should watch it. Some integrity might rub off.</p>
