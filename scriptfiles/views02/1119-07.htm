Texas -- Osama bin Laden is back, and suddenly no one gives a damn? What is this??!! 

The White House spokesman announced, "This is about more than one man." The president 

now says it "really doesn't matter much" if bin Laden is dead or alive. This is 

the same president who promised to bring him back "dead or alive," isn't it?

<p> Howard Kurtz of The Washington Post dismissed bin Laden as "a blast from the 

past." Well, that was a helluva blast, Howard, and I for one haven't forgotten 

it. I want that son of a bitch dead or alive, and I want getting him to be this 

country's top priority in terms of enemies. 

<p>Maybe they're downplaying bin Laden because he's so hard to get. I can understand 

that. It was always more of a complicated international police operation than 

a matter of bombing poor Afghanistan. But we knew going in that it was "a different 

kind of war" and that we were in it for the long haul. The one thing I never expected 

was that we'd just drop the whole thing. 

<p>I know we are not actually doing that, that we still have people hunting "O-sama 

Bin," as he is called in Texas, probably night and day. But the degree of focus 

and determination makes a difference in a long criminal hunt. When you let your 

task force get distracted by new cases, you lose focus. Like the sniper case, 

this one will probably be solved by a piece of luck, "a break," but you have to 

be looking hard for the break. 

<p>What is the tactical advantage in dismissing his reappearance as though it 

were of no consequence? That only encourages reluctantly cooperating intelligence 

agencies, like the one in Pakistan, to think, "Whew, heat's off." 

<p>We weren't attacked by Iraq, we were attacked by bin Laden's terrorist network. 

We weren't attacked with nuclear weapons, we were attacked with box-cutters. That 

hate-crazed religious fanatic, so intoxicated by his own mad rhetoric that he 

thinks he has a right to kill people, is a clear and present danger. His organization 

has been striking all over the world, even blowing up Aussies in the paradisiacal 

Bali. But we're all supposed to focus on Saddam Hussein. 

<p>OK, let's. It seems to me we should all recognize there's a real downside risk 

to doing nothing about Saddam Hussein. I understand the case for doing something 

is well-made in Ken Pollack's new book, "The Threatening Storm" (it's a serious 

journalistic no-no to cite a book you haven't read: I've barely started it --but 

the reviews were good). I also think we need to recognize there's a grave downside 

risk to invading his country. I don't mean to dismiss the horror of war, and I 

highly recommend Chris Hedges' splendid little book (which I have finished) "War 

Is a Force That Gives Us Meaning." Hedges spent years covering wars and has written 

the book "not to dissuade us from war, but to understand it." His understanding 

is profound and was earned on the ground. 

<p>But (she said, taking up the argument again), the greatest risk for us in invading 

Iraq is probably not war itself, so much as: What happens after we win? The risks 

of an invasion setting off reactions from a hideous civil war in Iraq to toppling 

regimes all over the Middle East is very real. Also at risk is the very international 

cooperation necessary to track Al Qaeda. 

<p>There is a batty degree of triumphalism loose in this country right now. We 

are brushing off world opinion as though it mattered not a whit what other people 

think of us. People say dismissively, "Oh, the French have always hated us." That 

is simply not true. Or, "The Italians are always demonstrating about something." 

Half a million of them? The National Review even saw fit to run a piece by some 

juvenile jerk attacking Canadians as a bunch of whiny wimps. Great, just what 

we need -- let's see if we can possibly alienate the best neighbor any country 

ever had. 

<p>In the first place, that kind of arrogance is exactly what creates terrorists. 

In the second place, it is the cooperation of Arab countries we particularly need 

at this point. And long-term, when our most serious problems will be lack of water, 

overpopulation and global warming, international cooperation will be critical 

to our lives. 

<p>The way one solves problems obviously influences not only the outcome, but 

the kinds of problems one faces after the immediate problem is settled. If we 

use war, the other problems will in turn be harder to solve. Including and especially 

getting bin Laden. 

<p>So it seems to me we should be engaged not in some simplistic debate about 

hawks and doves, or even chickenhawks and doves, but a sober, thorough and very 

realistic weighing of the relative risks involved. While we focus on Al Qaeda.</p>
