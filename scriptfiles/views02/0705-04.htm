<p>DAVID GUNN wishes he could be confused with Louis Gallois. Here in the United 

States, Gunn, the new president of Amtrak, has emerged from his gloomy jousts 

with Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta with the impression that even if Amtrak 

survives, it will be an indentured serf leaning on a scythe and gazing longingly 

at the Ford Expedition rolling into the castle.

<P>All Mineta gave Gunn was $100 million of a requested $200 million in emergency 

loan guarantees. The money averts a July shutdown but runs out by summer's end, 

leaving the White House and Congress to decide again what gruel to spoon out to 

the scraggly serf.</P>

<P>The same lords of transportation confer knighthood on giant cars with billions 

of dollars of silent subsidies in low gasoline taxes. The airlines are the court 

jester. They make cattle pens seem like condos, teenagers seem fiscally responsible, 

and Fenway security look like the CIA. The lords throw them a $15 billion tip 

for their jokes. </P>

<P>Lord Mineta was kind enough to say, ''No wants to see Amtrak die,'' but it 

is clear that severe dehydration is unworthy of his attention. Speaking of his 

negotiations with the Bush administration, Gunn said, ''We listened to their ideas, 

and, while I wouldn't say it was a dry hole, there wasn't a lot of water in it.'' 

</P>

<P>In not-so-medieval France, the well overflows with wine, with passengers who 

are figuratively quite tipsy. Gallois is the chairman of France's national rail 

company, SNCF. A year ago France opened a high-speed rail line that goes from 

Paris to Marseilles in three hours. The distance between that nation's two biggest 

cities is virtually the same as the distance from Boston to Washington.</P>

<P>Imagine. Boston to Washington. Three hours. By train! No one in his right mind 

would ever again drive eight to nine hours down the scenic and gastronomical nightmare 

of the New Jersey Turnpike. For a lot of people, a comfortable three-hour train 

trip from downtown to downtown, during which books can be read, laptops plugged 

in, and people met would seem to beat showing your hooves at the X-ray machine 

for the right to be herded into an arthritic cattle pen, zipping through the clouds 

in an hour and a half merely to stand in line for a cab for the privilege of idling 

in rush hour.</P>

<P>Given a legitimate choice, the French have decided it was no choice at all. 

The service from Paris to Marseilles is averaging 1.5 million passengers a month, 

dwarfing the 273,000 that used the Acela Express between Boston and Washington 

in May.</P>

<P>Rail service now constitutes 61 percent of travel between Paris and Marseilles. 

Trains also carry 60 percent of the passengers between Paris and London.</P>

<P>As a measure of how much travelers in the Northeast Corridor want trains, Amtrak's 

New York-Washington run since the birth of the Acela has captured a similar 58 

percent share of rail/air travelers even though it is no match for the French 

service. In the same time the Acela goes from Washington to New York, the French 

train would be approaching Boston.</P>

<P>Since the terrorist attacks, the Acela has helped Amtrak double its share of 

rail/air passengers between Boston and New York to 38 percent. Any further improvement 

requires new rails and ending the logjam with commuter trains in Connecticut.</P>

<P>That will take an investment on the level of the French, who subsidize their 

trains at a cost of $3 billion to $4 billion a year. Based on population, the 

same investment in the United States would be $20 billion. That is still less 

than the $32 billion a year we lavish on highways, and it is not even half of 

President Bush's proposed increase for the military.</P>

<P>Americans have chosen individual convenience, or the illusion of it, at the 

cost of horrible rush-hour congestion and pollution. The French and other congested 

European nations have chosen to understand that the benefits of having trains 

that go 160 to 180 miles an hour far outweigh the costs.</P>

<P>Pierre-Bernard Fauverge, a spokesman for SNCF, said, ''Our trains work because 

they are nationalized, not run for profit, but as a public service.''</P>

<P>Gallois, the president of SNCF, said, ''There is a feeling in France that SNCF 

belongs to the nation.'' There is, of course, no such feeling for Amtrak. For 

all his jousting, Gunn ended up with gruel.</P>

<P>As autos and airlines feast on the black holes of the White House and Congress, 

Gunn stares into the well and can hear a resounding echo of emptiness. The well 

might not be completely dry, but what is at the bottom is hardly not wine for 

royalty. It is vinegar for the serfs.</p> </P>
