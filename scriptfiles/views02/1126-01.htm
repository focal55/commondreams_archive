<p> IT IS ODD that the national holiday set aside for the benign purpose of expressing 

gratitude should also celebrate a primal encounter between European settlers and 

the native peoples who preceded them.

<P>In the American memory, Miles Standish, in his Pilgrim hat and broad collar, 

is forever shaking hands with Massasoit, who saved the settlement from hunger 

with instructions about growing corn and catching turkeys. It was 1621 when the 

settlers and the natives sat down together to celebrate ''good increase,'' and 

their harvest banquet became the paradigm of neighborliness, the good feelings 

we all indulge this week.</P>

<P>One needn't attribute base motives to those English separatists to acknowledge 

that their arrival was anything but an occasion for thanksgiving to those who 

greeted them. Indeed, the mythic encounter that took place at ''Plimouth'' was 

an instance, in a phrase of the historian Jared Diamond, of ''the greatest collision 

of modern history,'' the colonization of the New World by Europeans, which led 

to the effective disappearance of most groups of native peoples. </P>

<P>Less than 100 years before Standish and Massasoit met, a far more typical encounter 

took place well to the south when the Spanish conquistador Francisco Pizarro captured 

the Inca ruler Atahuallpa. The year was 1532, and that event, too, occurred in 

November. It was the true paradigm for what was coming because, despite collecting 

a massive ransom, Pizarro murdered his prisoner and conquered the Inca people.</P>

<P>In his book ''Guns, Germs, and Steel,'' Diamond asks why the outnumbered Europeans 

were so successful in overcoming the forces that greeted them. He finds answers 

in the military advantage of their horses, guns, and armor, but there was the 

even more decisive factor of ''diseases transmitted to peoples lacking immunity 

by invading peoples with considerable immunity.''</P>

<P>A smallpox epidemic had come to the Inca region ahead of Pizarro, and, indeed, 

smallpox would clear the way for European settlers again and again. The succumbing 

of native populations to ''germs'' throughout the New World is well known, but 

invader-borne disease was a key factor wherever European colonizers traveled, 

from South Africa to the islands of the Pacific. </P>

<P>In the eventual outcome, it did not matter whether the arriving Europeans came 

in a spirit of amity, as we like to think those Pilgrims did, or of conquistador 

bellicosity. Standish or Pizarro - all the same. Some colonizers were guilty of 

deliberate acts of genocide, while others were the passive beneficiaries of less 

violent mutations. From the point of view of those replaced, however, the newcomers' 

arrival itself was the destructive event. </P>

<P>The image that Graham Greene famously applied to ''The Quiet American'' - ''a 

dumb leper who has lost his bell, wandering the world, meaning no harm'' - is 

apt for colonizers of all kinds, whether they mean harm or not. The movement of 

populations and the intermingling of cultures are morally complex phenomena, although 

in memory they are made simple by the disappearance of the displaced persons and 

their lost cultures. Massasoit is remembered as happy because he is a character 

in the morality play written by the Pilgrims and their children. Massasoit's own 

story is untold this week.</P>

<P>The reason to acknowledge, against all mythology, that there has been a universally 

brutal underside to migration, often involving conquest and victimhood, always 

involving infection of some kind, is not to renounce the profoundly human impulses 

to move and settle. Rather, it is to invent an ethic of movement and settlement 

that is respectful and nonviolent toward those whom the newcomers encounter. Therefore, 

the main moral obligation settlers have upon arrival is to see their arrival from 

the point of view of the indigenous. </P>

<P>This is true on the local scale: Such a shift in seeing explains why a majority 

of Israelis oppose in principle most Israeli ''settlements'' in the disputed territories. 

And it is true on the global scale as well, since ''settlements'' today can involve 

the airways as much as land. Thus, an American-style beauty pageant, with its 

celebration of the female as sex object, can be yet another dumb leper wandering 

the world without a bell, meaning no harm. Media and entertainment entrepreneurs 

have an absolute obligation to anticipate - and mitigate - the culture-smashing 

effects of their interventions.</P>

<P>Thanksgiving is a simple feast, but the event it commemorates was complex. 

A profoundly American story, yet the tale of the encounter between the settlers 

and the natives has never had more human resonance. Can one culture meet another 

without destroying it? Can both cultures survive, celebrating a new mutuality 

of influence and exchange? Can the hope that was embodied in Massasoit's gift 

of corn and turkeys, and in European gratitude, be finally realized? </P>
