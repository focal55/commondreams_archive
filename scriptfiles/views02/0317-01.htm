There's nothing like being in the safe hands of the Bush administration.



<p>I mean, how embarrassing for those poor people in Zimbabwe, dealing with 

their rigged presidential election. Imagine the shame of knowing opposition 

voters had been systematically disenfranchised, and that the Supreme Court 

had stepped in to support a specific presidential candidate. That could 

never happen here! We should go in and show those people how real democracy 

works.



<p>And what's with the British parliament anyway! Last week, Foreign Secretary 

Jack Straw was pummeled about his unquestioning support for Bush policies. 

Fellow MPs named Israel (rather than Iraq) as a violent Middle East country 

deserving an arms embargo, and asked Straw why the UK is threatening to send 

soldiers to Baghdad, but not Jerusalem. In grueling parliamentary sessions, 

Straw was asked why he supports what others see as the simplistic, 

gun-toting policy of the US; his response of, "I have not yet met members of 

the Bush administration who are gung-ho" was met with jeers.



<p>None of that kind of political dissent in the US government! Forget 

Congress' constitutional duty to oversee the US executive branch - since 

September 11th,  Democrats have been so terrified of seeming unpatriotic 

that they've all but rolled over and played dead. Even minor opposition, 

such as Senate majority leader Tom Daschle's tentative questioning whether 

the war should really be broadened, is dealt with swiftly and brutally by 

the administration: Congressman Tom Davis accused Daschle of aiding the 

enemy, and the House majority whip, Tom DeLay, referred to Daschle's 

comments as disgusting.



<p>Looks like it's back to Bush's "you're with us or with the enemy" speech: 

what's clear now though is that "us" means the Bush administration, and not 

necessarily the US government or ordinary citizens.



<p>So our fearless leader blasts the "axis of evil" countries for promoting 

weapons of mass destruction, then in the next breath threatens the use of 

nuclear weapons on countries the US dislikes. "We are at war to keep the 

peace," as Bush says. He gets "hot" at deficiencies in the INS system that 

allowed 2 hijackers to receive visas, but doesn't seem to mind the hundreds 

of US residents rounded up post September 11, shackled and still languishing 

in jails despite not having been charged with any specific crime other than 

looking Middle Eastern.



<p>Meanwhile, the law of the land is determined by a man who reportedly sees 

calico cats as a sign of the devil. US Attorney General John Ashcroft is 

charged with protecting fundamental rights such as freedom of religion, but 

lately has taken to publicly singing self-penned lyrics such as "Only God, 

no other king,"  when he's not holding prayer meetings at the department of 

justice.



<p>Yep, it sure is nice to be in safe US government hands. But as the president 

himself has said, "There ought to be limits to freedom." Too much 

questioning of administration policies just can't be right in times like 

these because Americans (presumably regardless of religious affiliation) 

should bow their "heads in humility before our Heavenly Father."



<p>I guess it's just a coincidence that so often what our Heavenly Father wants 

seems to echo US military policy.



<p>So how best to be a good US citizen in "times like these"? Raising our bowed 

heads to question the credentials of those professing to represent divine 

truth would be a start. Owning our voices is more in  keeping with the 

foundations our country was built on than tolerating this obsequious game of 

mincing words and hiding behind flags.
