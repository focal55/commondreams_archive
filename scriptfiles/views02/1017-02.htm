<p>THAT AN OFFICIAL of the Federal Republic of Germany was sacked last month for 

comparing George W. Bush to Adolf Hitler was proper, but not because of the insult 

to Bush. The extremity of Hitler's malevolence must always be insisted upon. Whatever 

one's problems with Bush, it banalizes evil to equate him with the author of the 

Final Solution. Germans must be particularly careful not to do this.

<P>Historical analogies can often mislead, as the numerous dead ends beyond the 

signpost of ''appeasement'' show. How many people have needlessly died in the 

name of avoiding another Munich? But humans are nevertheless condemned to understand 

the present in the light of the past, especially when events seem unprecedented. 

It is clear that, with the American president intent upon a new program of moralistic 

imperialism, beginning with a war in Iraq, we are in what might be called a threshold 

period, leading from one conception of society to another as yet undefined one. 

The ominous situation requires us to ask: When have we stood in such a threshold 

before?</P>

<P>For Americans of my generation, the years between 1963 and 1965 leap to mind. 

It was then that decisions taken in Washington established a momentum of violence 

that ran unchecked for a decade. By the time US citizens realized what was being 

done in their names, it was too late to stop the momentum until it ran down on 

its own timetable. The United States after the war in Vietnam was a very different 

place from the United States before - to say nothing of the transformation of 

Vietnam. A historic threshold had been crossed, but what everyone saw by 1975, 

few had seen in the pivotal period of 1963-65.</P>

<P>What characterized that threshold? Four things:</P>

<P><b>Low-grade social panic.</b> American citizens had just suffered through 

two traumas - the near-apocalypse of nuclear war over Cuba and then the shattering 

of national self-confidence with the assassination of President Kennedy.</P>

<P><b>The mainstreaming of previously ''extremist'' ideas</b>. Lyndon Johnson 

was elected in 1964 as the ''peace candidate,'' but he immediately embraced the 

rampant belligerence of Barry Goldwater. Savage violence was promoted with hyper-rationality 

as the ''moderate'' course.</P>

<P><b>The surrender by legislators of their constitutional authority.</b> Congress 

ceded emergency powers to the executive with the Gulf of Tonkin resolution, and 

political opposition to the war was permanently marginalized, from Gene McCarthy 

to George McGovern.</P>

<P><b>The recasting of patriotism to mean conformity.</b> National self-criticism 

was defined as disloyalty. America - love it or leave it.</P>

<P>To list such defining notes of a threshold period in the past is to recognize 

them in the present. Our social panic today is tied to terrorism. Formerly extreme 

ideas (contempt for the UN, unilateralism, carelessness about civil liberties) 

animate Washington now. The US Congress has just given Bush nearly unrestricted 

license to use force. Citizens are detached, dissenters are marginalized, and 

a momentum toward permanent war is set loose.</P>

<P>But even to enumerate such characteristics of the time is to recall another 

threshold period, one to which we must return again and again - but this act of 

memory can seem offensive for a reason already noted. Between 1933 and 1935, the 

world changed, although how it changed was not clear until the horrible decade 

that followed had run its course. The notes of that threshold period are familiar. 

The 1933 social panic in Germany was tied to economic distress and to active dread 

of terrorism - in this case communist terrorism (Hitler was elected on March 5, 

just days after the Reichstag was burned, a national horror blamed on communists). 

The once widely denounced ideas of Nazism, especially the political exploitation 

of anti-Semitism, quickly found a place in mainstream attitudes. (Few objected 

to the Nazis' April 1 offensive against Jews.) German legislators ceded their 

responsibility to Hitler by passing the ''Enabling Act'' in April. The last opposition 

party - the Center Party - dismantled itself. The broad population of Germany 

quickly accommodated the new hysterical nationalism despite excesses few would 

have affirmed earlier. A threshold was crossed.</P>

<P>The point of this analogy is not to compare Hitler to Bush any more than the 

1963-65 analogy is to compare Johnson to Bush. The question is not about leadership 

but about societies that allow themselves to be radically transformed without 

substantial debate. The question is about what is lost when traditional restraints 

are abandoned and about what follows when the momentum toward open-ended war is 

set loose. The question is about the cost of world-primacy ambition and who pays 

it. The question is about what happens when national consensus is hijacked by 

fringe politics and when the very people empowered to object say nothing. The 

question, in other words, is not about Bush but about us.</P>
