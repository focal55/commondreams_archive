<p>It's underrecognized and underreported. It's also one of the most significant 

epidemics in the world today.</p>

<p>It's gender violence, manifested essentially as violence against women. A new 

report by the World Health Organization addresses the devastating effects worldwide 

of gender violence. According to the report, it claims almost 1.6 million lives 

each year, about 3 percent of deaths by all causes. Women of all social classes 

and religions suffer significant harm to their health and quality of life. This 

epidemic demands new, more effective policies.</p>

<p>Domestic violence is perhaps the most common kind of gender violence around 

the world. Few precise figures exist, but sometimes the numbers can be shocking. 

Some studies conducted in the United States reveal that each year approximately 

4 million women are attacked by their husbands or partners.</p>

<p>According to another U.S. study, violence against women is responsible for 

a large proportion of medical visits, and for approximately one-third of emergency 

room visits. Another study found that in the United States, domestic violence 

is the most frequent cause of injury in women treated in emergency rooms, more 

common than motor vehicle accidents and robberies combined. It is estimated that 

their treatment costs between $3 billion and $5 billion a year.</p>

<p>No wonder public health experts consider violence against women a global public 

health issue, one requiring a public health approach. Worldwide, violence is as 

common a cause of death and disability among women of reproductive age as cancer, 

and a greater cause of ill health than traffic accidents and malaria together.</p>

<p>Various cultural, economic and social factors, including shame and fear of 

retaliation, contribute to women's reluctance to report these acts. Legal and 

criminal systems in many countries make the process difficult. Frequently, fear 

keeps women trapped in abusive relationships. It has been found that almost 80 

percent of all serious gender-violence injuries and deaths occur when female victims 

of violence try to leave a relationship, or after they have left.</p>

<p>The stubborn fact is that in many countries, violence against women, especially 

in the domestic setting, is seen as normal behavior. The belief that men have 

a right to abuse women tends to perpetuate violent situations. In that sense, 

domestic violence exemplifies perverse power relationships. When these kind of 

relationships become established, people become conditioned to accept violence 

as a legitimate means of settling conflicts, both within the family and in society 

at large, thus creating and perpetuating a vicious cycle. Violence begets violence, 

and often does irreparable damage to the family and to the social structure.</p>

<p>Although physical violence and sexual violence are easier to see, other forms 

of violence include emotional abuse, such as verbal humiliation, threats of physical 

aggression or abandonment, economic blackmail, and forced confinement to the home. 

Many women consider psychological abuse and humiliation even more devastating 

than physical violence. The experience of violence makes female victims more susceptible 

to a variety of problems such as depression, suicide, and alcohol and drug abuse.</p>

<p>Studies in Bolivia and Puerto Rico found that 58 percent of battered women 

had been sexually assaulted by their partners; in Colombia that figure was 46 

percent. Sexual violence increases women's risk of contracting sexually transmitted 

diseases, including AIDS (through forced sexual relations or the difficulty in 

persuading men to use condoms). It also increases the number of unplanned pregnancies 

and may lead to various gynecological problems such as chronic pelvic pain and 

painful intercourse.</p>

<p>Increasingly, the health sector is being urged to consider domestic violence 

as a serious health problem and to research the causes, consequences and ways 

to prevent it. Such a multi-causal problem demands a multi-faceted response, with 

the involvement of different sectors (legal, educational, labor, justice, criminal 

and public health) in the search for solutions. For too long violence against 

women has remained an ignored epidemic. The above evidence shows why it shouldn't 

continue to be so.</p>
