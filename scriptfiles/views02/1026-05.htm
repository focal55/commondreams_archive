<p>The tragic death Friday morning of Sen. Paul Wellstone is likely

to be mourned disproportionately to Wellstone's actual

influence in the Senate. Wellstone had an unusual impact for a

two-term senator from a mid-sized state, but, in the end, he was

only one Senator of 100, one Congressperson of 535.<p>



To some liberals and progressives, however, he was far more, and the

canonization got under way as soon as news of his death hit the wires. 

Every

four years, progressives seem to anoint one or another hot name as 

their

Democratic savior: Jesse Jackson. Jerry Brown. In the run up to 2004, 

it's

Dennis Kucinich. And four years ago --

before health problems nixed his exploration of a presidential

candidacy -- it was Wellstone. That cycle, and years of national

fundraising based on his populist image, have made Paul Wellstone

a well-known and (usually) loved figure in liberal circles. <p>



This, along with a tight reelection bid that suddenly morphs into

a crisis that could again swing control of the Senate, makes

Wellstone's death a particularly newsworthy story. But there is

another way, beyond his liberalism and the Democrat's razor-thin

Senate majority, in which Wellstone will be sorely missed. 

Wellstone himself identified it in an NPR interview last week, in

a story that focused on his race this year against former St.

Paul mayor Norm Coleman, and Coleman's characterization of

Wellstone as out of step with the Senate. Coleman, Wellstone said

scornfully, is all about getting 51 votes. Wellstone was about

doing what he believed was right, no matter who did or didn't

agree. <p>



I didn't always agree with Wellstone's positions myself, but

that's not the point. Congresspeople, like presidents, are

increasingly poll-driven; there are very few left who are

consistently willing to take unpopular stands of any kind. Two of

the most notable, Cynthia McKinney and Bob Barr, were drummed out

of Congress by faceless "moderates" in their own parties in

September. Now Wellstone is gone. Not many remain. Libertarians

have Ron Paul; liberals and progressives have... well, in the

Senate, nobody, really. <p>



Wellstone will be missed precisely because of the party he leaves

behind: a collection of poll-dependent, colorless pols who

probably wouldn't endorse motherhood unless it tested well in

focus groups of probable voters. Wellstone was the only

Democratic senator in a tough race this year who voted against

Bush's war proclamation this month; the Democrats' across-the-

board timidity in the face of George Bush's presidency has

enraged much of that party's constituency. Likewise,

conservatives' timidity in the face of an assault on the

constitution and a militarily unsound invasion plan has a similar

pedigree; if Ron Paul can come up with 35 reasons why invading

Iraq was a bad idea, how telling was it that fewer than a dozen

other Republicans could bring themselves to agree? <p>



For most Congresspeople, taking a righteous stand can never be

justified, because it's always too much of a risk right now,

there's always too much at stake this time around. Wellstone was

willing to be the "1" in a 99-1 vote, and that's why people mourn

him so. People who can't identify their own non-negotiable core

moral values shouldn't be in high public office; people who can

identify them but won't stand by them shouldn't be, either. 

<p> The entire Democratic Party has constructed itself in recent years by trying 

to appeal to new swing voters, and by telling its past supporters: be patient. 

Now's not the time. The lesson for Wellstone's colleagues, as they see the reaction 

to his passing, is short and simple: Life is short. Take risks. Be <I>for</I> 

something.</p>
