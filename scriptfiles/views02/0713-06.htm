<p>The US has historically been one of the most resolute advocates of the Rule 

of Law. However, current trends indicate that it is moving dangerously towards 

completely shunning this approach, resulting in US reliance on Rule of Force as 

the principal means for solving global conflicts. While on the one hand the US 

disavows current obligations under international law and refuses to participate 

in new international legal mechanisms, it expects other countries to adhere to 

such laws and to US directives. Continued US attempts to increase its military 

domination combined with its withdrawal from international legal processes are 

eroding national and international security in an already unstable and unbalanced 

international environment. 

<p><b>Security in the Post-September 11th World </b> 

<p>President Bush has used September 11th to define a new dichotomy dividing states-the 

states with the US and the states for terror-an overly simplistic dichotomy that 

had been missing since the dissolution of the USSR and the end of the Cold War. 

In the aftermath of September 11th, the US made an appeal to the international 

community to join in the fight against terrorism. On the surface, the anti-terrorism 

campaign initially offered a chance for many countries, including countries subsequently 

labeled by the Bush administration as part of an "axis of evil," to realign themselves 

to be on more friendly terms with the US. 

<p>As a result, many countries have changed their political priorities, diverting 

large amounts of resources and attention to the US-led war on terrorism. Furthermore, 

many countries in critical regions such as the Middle East, South Asia and North 

East Asia are following the US example, countering domestic and regional disputes 

with force and rejecting multilateral diplomacy and arms control. In fact, the 

war on terrorism has only added fuel to fire in escalating regional crises. 

<p>September 11th also reinvigorated concerns about the proliferation of weapons 

of mass destruction and their means of delivery. There are legitimate fears regarding 

terrorists acquiring or making nuclear, chemical, biological or radiological weapons. 

However, the US-led response to these fears has been to offer solutions that would 

counter rather than prevent proliferation. 

<p><b>New Nuclear Policy: First Strike </b> 

<p>Serious concerns about US plans were raised this year when portions of the 

classified US Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) that was released to Congress in January 

2002 leaked to the media in March. Despite treaty commitments to reduce its reliance 

on nuclear weapons, the NPR reaffirms the role of nuclear weapons in US national 

security policy. In the past, nuclear weapons have been viewed as a deterrent 

against the use of nuclear weapons. However, the NPR reveals that the US intends 

to integrate nuclear weapons into a full spectrum of war-fighting capabilities, 

including missile defenses. The NPR unveils that nuclear weapons are no longer 

weapons of last resort, but instruments that could be used in fighting wars. The 

NPR also raises the possible resumption by the US of full-scale nuclear testing 

and plans to develop and deploy new "earth-penetrating" nuclear weapons. 

<p>Furthermore, the NPR calls for the development of contingency plans to use 

nuclear weapons against seven states-Iran, Iraq, Libya, Syria, North Korea, Russia 

and China-constituting a disturbing threat in particular to the named states and 

in general to international peace and security. Contrary to long-standing US assurances 

not to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear States, five of these named states 

are non-nuclear states. 

<p>The Bush administration announced in June that it will release a document outlining 

a strategy of striking first. The doctrine will be incorporated into the National 

Security Strategy that will be released in Fall 2002. President George W. Bush 

argues that the US needs such a strategy in order to counter "terrorists and tyrants," 

a phrase that encompasses both states and non-state actors, because Cold War policies 

of deterrence and containment do not fit the post-September 11th world. The argument 

also extends a justification for developing new low-yield, earth-penetrating nuclear 

weapons that could be used preemptively to destroy deeply buried targets and bunkers. 

While there remains an opportunity to address the prospect of terrorism from weapons 

of mass destruction (WMD) and legitimate concerns about WMD and missile proliferation, 

this opportunity is being rapidly squandered. When the US reserves to itself the 

right to strike first with nuclear weapons, it relinquishes the moral high ground 

and the right to tell other nations to give up their weapons of mass destruction. 

<p><b>Arms Control: Significant Nuclear Reductions or Maximum Nuclear Flexibility? 

</b> 

<p>Presidents George W. Bush and Vladimir Putin signed the Strategic Offensive 

Reductions Treaty between the US and the Russia during a summit in Moscow on 23 

May. The treaty calls for the reduction of strategic forces of each country's 

arsenal to 1,700 to 2,200 by 2012, the year in which the treaty expires. It also 

does not require the destruction of a single missile launcher or warhead and each 

side can carry out the reductions at its own pace and even reverse them to temporarily 

build up its forces. In other words, the treaty allows either side to worry more 

about protecting their own nuclear options than constraining the options of the 

other country. A senior US administration official stated, "What we have now agreed 

to do under the treaty is what we wanted to do anyway. That's our kind of treaty." 

<p>Under the terms of the treaty, either side can temporarily suspend reductions 

or even build up forces without violating the treaty. This will allow maximum 

flexibility to the US, which insists on continuing to rely on nuclear weapons 

in its national security policy. The US Nuclear Posture Review, released in January 

2002, stated, "In the event that US relations with Russia significantly worsen 

in the future, the US may need to revise its nuclear force level and posture." 

The new treaty will allow the US to do so. Rather than completely destroying the 

strategic weapons, the US has repeatedly stated that it will shelve or stockpile 

the warheads. 

<p><b>Abdicating Law </b> 

<p>The alternative to a rule-by-force policy is the Rule of Law. Since its founding, 

the US has historically sought to create a legal framework to foster national 

and international security. Under Article VI of the US constitution, "all Treaties 

made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall 

be the supreme Law of the Land." A treaty becomes US law when two-thirds of the 

US Senate give "advice and consent" to its ratification. Although treaties may 

not be perfect, they are critical to articulating and codifying global norms and 

standards. Among other things, treaties contribute to national and international 

security by establishing mechanisms to enforce articulated norms, measure progress, 

and promote accountability, transparency, and confidence building measures between 

countries. 

<p>Although US support for international law and institutions slowly began to 

decline as the 20th century progressed, since the Clinton administration, the 

US has been more hostile toward international law and international legal mechanisms. 

And the trend has only accelerated during the Bush administration. Under the Clinton 

administration, the US refused to sign the Treaty Banning Anti-Personnel Mines 

(Landmines Treaty); the Senate failed to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty 

(CTBT); and the US attempted to obstruct completion of the Rome Statute to create 

an International Criminal Court (ICC), although Clinton did sign this Treaty at 

the final moment. Since President Bush took office, among other actions demonstrating 

its disdain for international law, the US has: 

<p> 

<ul>

<li>withdrawn from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) treaty; <br>

</li>

<li>resisted the idea of a standardized procedure for reporting on nuclear disarmament 

obligations under the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and, in fact, increased the 

role of nuclear weapons in US national security policy; <br>

</li>

<li>sought to terminate the process to promote compliance with the Biological 

Weapons Convention (BWC); <br>

</li>

<li>spurned proposals from Russia and China to ban weapons in Outer Space and 

Space-based weapons; </li>

<li>withdrawn its signature from the International Criminal Court Treaty; <br>

</li>

<li>withdrawn its support for the Kyoto Protocol on global warming, even though 

it played a key role in its creation. <br>

</li>

</ul>

<p><b>Conclusions </b> 

<p>The shift in US policy to rely on force first and consider itself above law 

is detrimental to its own security as well as to international insecurity. Unless 

this process is reversed and unless the US begins to cooperate with other countries 

to ensure a global Rule of Law above the Rule of Force, international disorder 

will gain ground
