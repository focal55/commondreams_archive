<p>The Bush administration has delivered a dangerously radical new embodiment of what 

U.S. "defense" policy will  hereafter consist of.



<p>It elevates "preemption" -- which is simply a euphemism for military aggression -- 

to a universal, first-choice applicability, against both stateless "terrorist" groups, and defined nations.



<p>Meaning that anyone, or any country, that America arbitrarily defines as either "evil" or "rogue", and a purported threat predicated on the sort of fabricated baselessness that's currently being used to 

besmirch Iraq, will be attacked even before

such claimed dangers "are fully formed".



<p>In other words, while they're invisible to all impartial, honest observers.



<p>All that's needed is the rightwing warhawks' contention that this or that legitimate liberation movement -- or a certain nation that has 

philosophical differences with the United States PLUS an army, navy and airforce -- is out to harm us.



<p>Or Wall Street's global interests.



<p>Additionally, there is clear declaration in Bush's National Security Statement that the military superiority which the U.S. currently 

enjoys will not be permitted to be matched by any other country on earth.



<p>Thus, if any state, asserting its sovereign right to build its military for defensive purposes to a level it feels its safety requires -- should 

such level begin to approach that of the U.S. -- would be preemptively attacked to prevent it from doing so.



<p>Please, whatever your political leanings may be, appreciate what is happening here, and 

what it all means.



<p>Bush, Cheney and Rumsfeld have become the bullying bosses of humankind, dictating their corrupt, belligerent political and 

economic "vision" to the entire planet.



<p>Anyone who dissents, finding alternatives to Yankee edict based on their own unique needs, will be forced into the American mold 

by  U.S. armed might.



<p>The Bush White House today made the most outlandish and complete bid for world rule that's ever been historically dared.



<p>Combined with domestic curtailment of Constitutional rights and liberties under USA Patriot Act excesses (which will surely grow even more stringent), what we're ominously seeing is the most authoritarian imposition 

on the largest number of people, both our own citizens and foreigners, since the Hitler heyday.



<p>The crypto-fascism that's long been a hidden feature of the Right...has roared into the open.



<p>And IT, not any alleged or real "enemy" existing either without or within, now presents the greatest mortal danger to our security and 

freedom.



<p>Jefferson and Lincoln would be aghast!



<p>To those who've thus far been quiet about Bush's increasingly outrageous actions: which side are you on?



<p>Will you remain silent?



<p>Or will you finally see the hideous truth and step forward, with others in protest, to save us all from this definite, deadly despotism in 

thin disguise?
