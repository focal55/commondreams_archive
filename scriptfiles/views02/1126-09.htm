<p>If there is any doubt at all that the terrorists have won - that they have 

managed with a single day's freakish hits to revamp the most open society on earth 

into an emerging police state where suspicion and secrecy are the twin watch-towers 

of government and cowering and conforming the prevailing instincts of an allegedly 

free press or an even more alleged political opposition - then last week's creation 

of the Department of Homeland Security should put all such doubts to rest.</p>

<p>The New Deal was a "reorganization" or an "expansion" of government. The creation 

of the Homeland Security Department is a coup within the government. What Ollie 

North once did illegally in a White House basement - free-lancing policy with 

public money and accountability to no one - a $37 billion department with 170,000 

employees will now do legally in what is sure to be a high-rise of basements and 

metaphorical windows on Washington's Bureaucracy Row. Like a Wall Street firm 

beholden only to its board room, the second-largest government department is now 

a proprietary arm of the presidency. It operates beyond congressional scrutiny 

and public accountability, and guarantees secrecy to its own machinations or to 

those of any private business with which it deals.</p>

<p>Let's say Kafka Inc. were a company that made surveillance cameras the government 

was installing at a few thousand intersections. Kafka's products happen to be 

pathetically faulty, as such devices commonly are. The public would be outraged 

if it knew. But all Kafka would have to do to keep its products' evaluations from 

becoming public is submit them to the Department of Homeland Security, where everything 

is to be kept secret by law. What Kafka does, every other company or hospital 

or airline or even local sheriff's department can do with any proposal, any budget 

item, any safety plan made part of the homeland security racket. The department, 

in other words, is a black hole to the Freedom of Information Act - everything 

goes in, nothing gets out.</p>

<p>Secrecy is national security's favored fraud. With rare exceptions, it harms 

the public interest more than it protects it. Keeping America's atom bomb secret 

may have been a good idea, but even that failed. Keeping the Pentagon Papers secret, 

the government's own most damning evidence that the Vietnam War was a known failure 

even in the early 1960s, needlessly prolonged a needless war at the cost of thousands 

of American lives (and perhaps a million Vietnamese). Designed around the same 

principle of prescribing what Americans should and should not know, the new department 

will incubate just such secrets, covering up what should be known at the risk 

of prolonging what shouldn't be happening. Substitute Main Street for rice paddies 

and what's ahead is less reassuring because of the department's existence.</p>

<p>Warranted neither by necessity nor security, the department is a business venture 

without risk, a portal to corporate subsidies that has poured $30 billion in tax 

dollars into the security-industrial complex already, and is projected to pump 

upwards of $100 billion a year in public and private money from here out. Most 

of it is money spent on the kind of specious technologies that had fattened up 

the stock market of the late 1990s before the market bubble finally burst. That 

artificial bubble is being replaced with another, this time at taxpayers' expense. 

As always, war pays dividends to its lucky shareholders.</p>

<p>Those dividends will rise in direct proportion to the loss of openness and 

civil liberties. We've been there before, most recently and most dramatically 

during the 1940s' and 50s' raving campaign on communism. The USA Patriot Act's 

contempt for liberties had its equivalent in the Internal Security Act of 1950. 

The Pentagon's office for "Total Information Awareness," the ultimate electronic 

snoop on every American's activities, had its genesis in the House Committee on 

Un-American Activities' endless and endlessly fabricated dossiers on Americans. 

The Homeland Security Department's cult of secrecy had its miniature version in 

the Atomic Energy Commission, which exerted similar authority on industry and 

the dissemination of information. The overreaction to communism then was as delirious 

as the overreaction to terrorism today. By the time Joseph McCarthy made a fool 

of himself at his Red Menace hearings the country had been under anti-communism's 

debilitating spell for almost a decade. McCarthy was only the summation of a parody 

of liberty, a belated wake-up call to a nation that had been had by its own government's 

fictions.</p>

<p>Osama bin Laden isn't any more of a fiction than Stalin was. But the threat 

Stalin posed to the United States was as fictive then as the threat Osama bin 

Laden poses today. Freak attacks don't make a war, and they certainly don't mark 

a victory. The victory has been handed to bin Laden subsequently, in spades, because 

the nation has let itself be had again. It took 10 years for anti-communism to 

be shown to be "itself a heresy against the basic principles of American life," 

as the late Walter Millis, a long-time editorial writer for the New York Herald 

Tribune, wrote in 1968. If America's richly redeeming history is any guide, it 

will similarly be a matter of time for anti-terrorism to be proven an equally 

lethal heresy and for the Homeland Security Department to be the ugliest parody 

of a lawless and imperious age.</p>
