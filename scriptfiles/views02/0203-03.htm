India lives in several centuries at the same time. Somehow we manage to progress 

and regress simultaneously. 

<p> As a nation we age by pushing outward from the middle--adding a few centuries 

on either end of the extraordinary CV. We greaten like the maturing head of a

</font>I don't mean to put a simplistic value judgment on this peculiar form of 

"progress" by suggesting that Modern is Good and Traditional is Bad--or vice versa. 

What's hard to reconcile oneself to, both personally and politically, is the schizophrenic 

nature of it. That applies not just to the ancient/modern conundrum but to the 

utter illogic of what appears to be the current national enterprise. In the lane 

behind my house, every night I walk past road gangs of emaciated laborers digging 

a trench to lay fiber-optic cables to speed up our digital revolution. In the 

bitter winter cold, they work by the light of a few candles. 

<p> It's as though the people of India have been rounded up and loaded onto two 

convoys of trucks (a huge big one and a tiny little one) that have set off resolutely 

in opposite directions. The tiny convoy is on its way to a glittering destination 

somewhere near the top of the world. The other convoy just melts into the darkness 

and disappears. A cursory survey that tallies the caste, class and religion of 

who gets to be on which convoy would make a good Lazy Person's concise <i>Guide 

to the History of India</i>. For some of us, life in India is like being suspended 

between two of the trucks, one leg in each convoy, and being neatly dismembered 

as they move apart, not bodily, but emotionally and intellectually. </p>

<p> Fifty years after independence, India is still struggling with the legacy 

of colonialism, still flinching from the "cultural insult." As citizens we're 

still caught up in the business of "disproving" the white world's definition of 

us. Intellectually and emotionally, we have just begun to grapple with communal 

and caste politics that threaten to tear our society apart. But meanwhile, something 

new looms on our horizon. On the face of it, it's just ordinary, day-to-day business. 

It lacks the drama, the large-format, epic magnificence of war or genocide or 

famine. It's dull in comparison. It makes bad TV. It has to do with boring things 

like jobs, money, water supply, electricity, irrigation. But it also has to do 

with a process of barbaric dispossession on a scale that has few parallels in 

history. You may have guessed by now that I'm talking about the modern version 

of globalization. </p>

<p> What is globalization? Who is it for? What is it going to do to a country 

like India, in which social inequality has been institutionalized in the caste 

system for centuries? A country in which 700 million people live in rural areas. 

In which 80 percent of the landholdings are small farms. In which 300 million 

people are illiterate. Is the corporatization and globalization of agriculture, 

water supply, electricity and essential commodities going to pull India out of 

the stagnant morass of poverty, illiteracy and religious bigotry? Is the dismantling 

and auctioning off of elaborate public sector infrastructure, developed with public 

money over the past fifty years, really the way forward? Is globalization going 

to close the gap between the privileged and the underprivileged, between the upper 

castes and the lower castes, between the educated and the illiterate? Or is it 

going to give those who already have a centuries-old head start a friendly helping 

hand? </p>

<p> Is globalization about "eradication of world poverty," or is it a mutant variety 

of colonialism, remote-controlled and digitally operated? These are huge, contentious 

questions. The answers vary depending on whether they come from the villages and 

fields of rural India, from the slums and shantytowns of urban India, from the 

living rooms of the burgeoning middle class or from the boardrooms of the big 

business houses. Today India produces more milk, more sugar and more food grain 

than ever before. And yet, in March 2000, just before President Clinton's visit 

to India, the Indian government lifted import restrictions on 1,400 commodities, 

including milk, grain, sugar, cotton, tea, coffee and palm oil. This despite the 

fact that there was a glut of these products on the market. </p>

<p> As of April 1--April Fool's Day--2001, according to the terms of its agreement 

with the World Trade Organization, the Indian government had to drop its quantitative 

import restrictions. The Indian market is already flooded with cheap imports. 

Though India is technically free to export its agricultural produce, in practice 

most of it cannot be exported because it doesn't meet the First World's "environmental 

standards." (You don't eat bruised mangoes or bananas with mosquito bites or rice 

with a few weevils in it, whereas we don't mind the odd mosquito and the occasional 

weevil.) </p>

<p> Developed countries like the United States, whose hugely subsidized farm industry 

engages only 2 to 3 percent of its total population, are using the WTO to pressure 

countries like India to drop agricultural subsidies in order to make the market 

"competitive." Huge, mechanized corporate enterprises working thousands of acres 

of farmland want to compete with impoverished subsistence farmers who own a couple 

of acres. </p>

<p> In effect, India's rural economy, which supports 700 million people, is being 

garroted. Farmers who produce too much are in distress, farmers who produce too 

little are in distress and landless agricultural laborers are out of work as big 

estates and farms lay off their workers. They're all flocking to the cities in 

search of employment. </p>

<p> "Trade Not Aid" is the rallying cry of the head men of the new Global Village, 

headquartered in the shining offices of the WTO. Our British colonizers stepped 

onto our shores a few centuries ago disguised as traders. We all remember the 

East India Company. This time around, the colonizer doesn't even need a token 

white presence in the colonies. The CEOs and their men don't need to go to the 

trouble of tramping through the tropics, risking malaria, diarrhea, sunstroke 

and an early death. They don't have to maintain an army or a police force, or 

worry about insurrections and mutinies. They can have their colonies and an easy 

conscience. "Creating a good investment climate" is the new euphemism for Third 

World repression. Besides, the responsibility for implementation rests with the 

local administration. </p>

<p> <b>Enron in India</b> </p>

<p> The fishbowl of the drive to privatize power, its truly star turn, is the 

story of Enron, the Houston-based natural gas company. The Enron project was the 

first private power project in India. The Power Purchase Agreement between Enron 

and the Congress Party-ruled state government of Maharashtra for a 740-megawatt 

power plant was signed in 1993. The opposition parties, the Hindu nationalist 

Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Shiv Sena, set up a howl of <i>swadeshi </i>(nationalist) 

protest and filed legal proceedings against Enron and the state government. They 

alleged malfeasance and corruption at the highest level. A year later, when state 

elections were announced, it was the only campaign issue of the BJP-Shiv Sena 

alliance. </p>

<p> In February 1995 this combine won the elections. True to their word, they 

"scrapped" the project. In a savage, fiery statement, the opposition leader L.K. 

Advani attacked the phenomenon he called "loot through liberalization." He more 

or less directly accused the Congress Party government of having taken a $13 million 

bribe from Enron. Enron had made no secret of the fact that in order to secure 

the deal, it paid out millions of dollars to "educate" the politicians and bureaucrats 

involved in the deal. </p>

<p> Following annulment of the contract, the US government began to pressure the 

Maharashtra government. US Ambassador Frank Wisner made several statements deploring 

the cancellation. (Soon after he completed his term as ambassador, he joined Enron 

as a director.) In November 1995 the BJP-Shiv Sena government in Maharashtra announced 

a "renegotiation" committee. In May 1996 a minority federal government headed 

by the BJP was sworn in at New Delhi. It lasted for exactly thirteen days and 

then resigned before facing a no-confidence vote in Parliament. On its last day 

in office, even as the motion of no confidence was in progress, the Cabinet met 

for a hurried "lunch" and reratified the national government's counterguarantee 

(which had become void because of the earlier "canceled" contract with Enron). 

In August 1996 the government of Maharashtra signed a fresh contract with Enron 

on terms that would astound the most hard-boiled cynic. </p>

<p> The impugned contract had involved annual payments to Enron of $430 million 

for Phase I of the project (740 megawatts), with Phase II (1,624 megawatts) being 

optional. The "renegotiated" power purchase agreement makes Phase II of the project 

mandatory and legally binds the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) to 

pay Enron the sum of $30 billion! It constitutes the largest contract ever signed 

in the history of India. </p>

<p> Indian experts who have studied the project have called it the most massive 

fraud in the country's history. The project's gross profits work out to between 

$12 billion and $14 billion. The official return on equity is more than 30 percent. 

That's almost double what Indian law and statutes permit in power projects. In 

effect, for an 18 percent increase in installed capacity, the MSEB has to set 

aside 70 percent of its revenue to pay Enron. There is, of course, no record of 

what mathematical formula was used to "re-educate" the new government. Nor any 

trace of how much trickled up or down or sideways or to whom. </p>

<p> But there's more: In one of the most extraordinary decisions in its not entirely 

pristine history, in May 1997 the Supreme Court of India refused to entertain 

an appeal against Enron. </p>

<p> Today, everything that critics of the project predicted has come true with 

an eerie vengeance. The power that the Enron plant produces is twice as expensive 

as its nearest competitor and seven times as expensive as the cheapest electricity 

available in Maharashtra. In May 2000 the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Committee 

(MERC) ruled that temporarily, until as long as was absolutely necessary, no power 

should be bought from Enron. This was based on a calculation that it would be 

cheaper to just pay Enron the mandatory fixed charges for the maintenance and 

administration of the plant that it is contractually obliged to pay than to actually 

buy any of its exorbitant power. The fixed charges alone work out to around $220 

million a year for Phase I of the project. Phase II will be nearly twice the amount. 

</p>

<p> Two hundred and twenty million dollars a year for the next twenty years. Meanwhile, 

industrialists in Maharashtra have begun to generate their own power at a much 

cheaper rate, with private generators. The demand for power from the industrial 

sector has begun to decline rapidly. The MSEB, strapped for cash, with Enron hanging 

like an albatross around its neck, will now have no choice but to make private 

generators illegal. That's the only way that industrialists can be coerced into 

buying Enron's exorbitantly priced electricity. </p>

<p> In January 2001 the Maharashtra government (the Congress Party is back in 

power with a new chief minister) announced that it did not have the money to pay 

Enron's bills. On January 31, only five days after an earthquake in the neighboring 

state of Gujarat, at a time when the country was still reeling from the disaster, 

the newspapers announced that Enron had decided to invoke the counterguarantee 

and that if the government did not come up with the cash, it would have to auction 

the government properties named as collateral security in the contract. </p>

<p> But Enron had friends in high places. It was one of the biggest corporate 

contributors to President George W. Bush's election campaign. US government officials 

warned India about vitiating the "investment climate" and running the risk of 

frightening away future investors. In other words: Allow us to rob you blind, 

or else we'll go away. </p>

<p> Last June the MSEB announced that it was ending its agreement with the Dabhol 

Power Corporation, a joint venture of Enron--which has the largest stake--General 

Electric and Bechtel. DPC ceased operations soon afterward, and is pressuring 

the government to cover its debts. Royal Dutch/Shell, the Anglo-Dutch petroleum 

group, TotalFinaElf and Gaz de France are currently bidding to take over Enron, 

Bechtel and GE's collective stake in the plant in a "distress sale." </p>

<p> <b>Globalizing Dissent</b> </p>

<p> Recently, globalization has come in for some criticism. The protests in Seattle 

and Prague will go down in history. Each time the WTO or the World Economic Forum 

wants to have a meeting, ministers have to barricade themselves with thousands 

of heavily armed police. Still, all its admirers, from Bill Clinton, Kofi Annan 

and A.B. Vajpayee (the Indian Prime Minister) to the cheering brokers in the stalls, 

continue to say the same lofty things: If we have the right institutions of governance 

in place--effective courts, good laws, honest politicians, participatory democracy, 

a transparent administration that respects human rights and gives people a say 

in decisions that affect their lives--then the globalization project will work 

for the poor as well. They call this "globalization with a human face." </p>

<p> The point is, if all this were in place, almost anything would succeed: socialism, 

capitalism, you name it. Everything works in Paradise, a Communist State as well 

as a Military Dictatorship. But in an imperfect world, is it globalization that's 

going to bring us all this bounty? Is that what's happening in India now that 

it's on the fast track to the free market? Does any one thing on that lofty list 

apply to life in India today? Are state institutions transparent? Have people 

had a say--have they even been informed, let alone consulted--about decisions 

that vitally affect their lives? And are Clinton (or now Bush) and Prime Minister 

Vajpayee doing everything in their power to see that the "right institutions of 

governance" are in place? Or are they involved in exactly the opposite enterprise? 

Do they mean something else altogether when they talk of the "right institutions 

of governance"? </p>

<p> The fact is that what's happening in India today is not a "problem," and the 

issues that some of us are raising are not "causes." They are huge political and 

social upheavals that are convulsing the nation. One is not involved by virtue 

of being a writer or activist. One is involved because one is a human being. </p>

<p> If you're one of the lucky people with a berth booked on the small convoy, 

then Leaving It to the Experts is, or can be, a mutually beneficial proposition 

for both the expert and yourself. It's a convenient way of shrugging off your 

own role in the circuitry. And it creates a huge professional market for all kinds 

of "expertise." There's a whole ugly universe waiting to be explored there. This 

is not at all to suggest that all consultants are racketeers or that expertise 

is unnecessary, but you've heard the saying: There's a lot of money in poverty. 

There are plenty of ethical questions to be asked of those who make a professional 

living off their expertise in poverty and despair. </p>

<p> For instance, at what point does a scholar stop being a scholar and become 

a parasite who feeds off despair and dispossession? Does the source of your funding 

compromise your scholarship? We know, after all, that World Bank studies are among 

the most quoted studies in the world. Is the World Bank a dispassionate observer 

of the global situation? Are the studies it funds entirely devoid of self-interest? 

</p>

<p> Take, for example, the international dam industry. It's worth $32-$46 billion 

a year. It's bursting with experts and consultants. Given the number of studies, 

reports, books, PhDs, grants, loans, consultancies, environmental impact assessments--it's 

odd, wouldn't you say, that there is no really reliable estimate of how many people 

have been displaced by big dams in India? That there is no estimate for exactly 

what the contribution of big dams has been to overall food production in India? 

That there hasn't been an official audit, a comprehensive, honest, thoughtful, 

post-project evaluation, of a single big dam to see whether or not it has achieved 

what it set out to achieve? Whether or not the costs were justified, or even what 

the costs actually were? </p>

<p> Cynics say that real life is a choice between the failed revolution and the 

shabby deal. I don't know...maybe they're right. But even they should know that 

there's no limit to just how shabby that shabby deal can be. What we need to search 

for and find, what we need to hone and perfect into a magnificent, shining thing, 

is a new kind of politics. Not the politics of governance, but the politics of 

resistance. The politics of opposition. The politics of forcing accountability. 

The politics of slowing things down. The politics of joining hands across the 

world and preventing certain destruction. In the present circumstances, I'd say 

that the only thing worth globalizing is dissent. It's India's best export.</p>
