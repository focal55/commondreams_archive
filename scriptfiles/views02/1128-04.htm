<p>Asking Henry Kissinger to investigate government malfeasance or nonfeasance 

is akin to asking Slobodan Milosevic to investigate war crimes. Pretty damn akin, 

since Kissinger has been accused, with cause, of engaging in war crimes of his 

own. Moreover, he has been a poster-child for the worst excesses of secret government 

and secret warfare. Yet George W. Bush has named him to head a supposedly independent 

commission to investigate the nightmarish attacks of September 11, 2001, a commission 

intended to tell the public what went wrong on and before that day. This is a 

sick, black-is-white, war-is-peace joke--a cruel insult to the memory of those 

killed on 9/11 and a screw-you affront to any American who believes the public 

deserves a full accounting of government actions or lack thereof. It's as if Bush 

instructed his advisers to come up with the name of the person who literally would 

be the absolute worst choice for the post and, once they had, said, "sign him 

up." </p>

<p> Hyperbole? Consider the record. </p>

<p> <i> Vietnam</i>. Kissinger participated in a GOP plot to undermine the 1968 

Paris peace talks in order to assist Richard Nixon's presidential campaign. Once 

in office, Nixon named Kissinger his national security adviser, and later appointed 

him secretary of state. As co-architect of Nixon's war in Vietnam, Kissinger oversaw 

the secret bombing campaign in Cambodia, an arguably illegal operation estimated 

to have claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of civilians. </p>

<p> <i> Bangladesh</i>. In 1971, Pakistani General Yahya Khan, armed with US weaponry, 

overthrew a democratically-elected government in an action that led to a massive 

civilian bloodbath. Hundreds of thousands were killed. Kissinger blocked US condemnation 

of Khan. Instead, he noted Khan's "delicacy and tact." </p>

<p> <i> Chile</i>. In the early 1970s, Kissinger oversaw the CIA's extensive covert 

campaign that assisted coup-plotters, some of whom eventually overthrew the democratically-elected 

government of Salvador Allende and installed the murderous military dictatorship 

of Augusto Pinochet. On June 8, 1976, at the height of Pinochet's repression, 

Kissinger had a meeting with Pinochet and behind closed doors told him that "we 

are sympathetic to what you are trying to do here," according to minutes of the 

session (which are quoted in Peter Kornbluh's forthcoming book, <i> The Pinochet 

File.</i>) </p>

<p> <i> East Timor</i>. In 1975, President Gerald Ford and Kissinger, still serving 

as secretary of state, offered advance approval of Indonesia's brutal invasion 

of East Timor, which took the lives of tens of thousands of East Timorese. For 

years afterward, Kissinger denied the subject ever came up during the December 

6, 1975, meeting he and Ford held with General Suharto, Indonesia's military ruler, 

in Jarkata. But a classified US cable obtained by the National Security Archive 

shows otherwise. It notes that Suharto asked for "understanding if we deem it 

necessary to take rapid or drastic action" in East Timor. Ford said, "We will 

understand and will not press you on the issue. We understand the problem you 

have and the intentions you have." The next day, Suharto struck East Timor. Kissinger 

is an outright liar on this subject. </p>

<p> <i> Argentina</i>. In 1976, as a fascistic and anti-Semitic military junta 

was beginning its so-called "dirty war" against supposed subversives--between 

9,000 and 30,000 people would be "disappeared" by the military over the next seven 

years--Argentina's foreign minister met with Kissinger and received what he believed 

was tacit encouragement for his government's violent efforts. According to a US 

cable released earlier this year, the foreign minister was convinced after his 

chat with Kissinger that the United States wanted the Argentine terror campaign 

to end soon--not that Washington was dead-set against it. The cable said that 

the minister had left his meeting with Kissinger "euphoric." Two years later, 

Kissinger, then a private citizen, traveled to Buenos Aires as the guest of dictator 

General Jorge Rafael Videla and praised the junta for having done, as one cable 

put it, "an outstanding job in wiping out terrorist forces." As Raul Castro, the 

US ambassador to Argentina, noted at the time in a message to the State Department, 

"My only concern is that Kissinger's repeated high praise for Argentina's action 

in wiping out terrorism...may have gone to some considerable extent to his hosts' 

heads....There is some danger that Argentines may use Kissinger's laudatory statements 

as justification for hardening their human rights stance." That is, Kissinger 

was, in a way, enabling torture, kidnapping and murder. </p>

<p> Appropriately, Kissinger is a man on the run for his past misdeeds. He is 

the target of two lawsuits, and judges overseas have sought him for questioning 

in war-crimes-related legal actions. In the United States, the family of Chilean 

General Rene Schneider sued Kissinger last year. Schneider was shot on October 

22, 1970, by would-be coup-makers working with CIA operatives. These CIA assets 

were part of a secret plan authorized by Nixon--and supervised by Kissinger--to 

foment a coup before Allende, a Socialist, could be inaugurated as president. 

Schneider, a constitutionalist who opposed a coup, died three days later. This 

secret CIA program in Chile--dubbed "Track Two"--gave $35,000 to Schneider's assassins 

after the slaying. Michael Tigar, an attorney for the Schneider family, claims, 

"Our case shows, document by document, that [Kissinger] was involved in great 

detail in supporting the people who killed General Schneider, and then paid them 

off." </p>

<p> On September 9, 2001, <i> 60 Minutes</i> aired a segment on the Schneider 

family's charges against Kissinger. The former secretary of state came across 

as partly responsible for what is the Chilean equivalent of the JFK assassination. 

It was a major blow to his public image: Kissinger cast as a supporter of terrorists. 

Two days later, Osama bin Laden struck. Immediately, Kissinger was again on television, 

but now as a much-in-demand expert on terrorism. </p>

<p> In another lawsuit, filed earlier this month, eleven Chilean human rights 

victims--including relatives of people murdered after Pinochet's coup--claimed 

Kissinger knowingly provided practical assistance and encouragement to the Pinochet 

regime. Kissinger's codefendant in the case is Michael Townley, an American-born 

Chilean agent who was a leading international terrorist in the mid-1970s. In his 

most notorious operation, Townley in 1976 planted a car-bomb that killed Orlando 

Letelier, Allende's ambassador to the United States, and Ronni Moffitt, Letelier's 

colleague, on Washington's embassy row. </p>

<p> Kissinger has more trouble than these lawsuits. The Chilean Supreme Court 

sent the State Department questions for Kissinger about the death of Charles Horman, 

an American journalist killed during the 1973 coup in Chile. (Horman's murder 

was the subject of the 1982 film <i> Missing</i>.) A criminal judge in Chile has 

said he might include Kissinger in his investigation of Operation Condor, a now 

infamous secret project, in which the security services of Chile, Uruguay, Brazil, 

Bolivia, Paraguay, and Argentina worked together to kidnap and murder political 

opponents. (Letelier was killed in a Condor operation.) The Spanish judge who 

requested the 1998 arrest of Pinochet in Great Britain has declared he wants to 

question Kissinger as a witness in his inquiry into crimes against humanity committed 

by Pinochet and other Latin American military dictators. In France, a judge probing 

the disappearance of five French citizens in Chile during the Pinochet years wants 

to talk to Kissinger. Last May, he sent police to a Paris hotel, where Kissinger 

was staying, to serve him questions. In February, Kissinger canceled a trip to 

Brazil, where he was to be awarded a medal by President Fernando Henrique Cardoso. 

His would-be hosts said he had pulled out to avoid protests by human rights groups. 

</p>

<p> A fellow who has coddled state-sponsored terrorism has been put in charge 

of this terrorism investigation. A proven liar has been assigned the task of finding 

the truth. By the way, in 1976, when Kissinger was secretary of state, he was 

informed by his chief aide for Latin America that South American military regimes 

were intending to use Operation Condor "to find and kill" political opponents. 

Kissinger quickly dispatched a cable instructing US ambassadors in the Condor 

countries to note Washington's "deep concern." But it seems no such warnings were 

actually conveyed. And a month later, this order was rescinded. The next day, 

Letelier and Moffit were murdered. (Peter Kornbluh and journalist John Dinges 

recently chronicled this sad Kissinger episode in <i> The Washington Post</i>.) 

Kissinger's State Department had not responded with the force needed to thwart 

the official terrorism of its friends in South America. Perhaps this provides 

Kissinger experience useful for examining the government's failure to prevent 

more recent acts of terrorism. </p>

<p> Other qualifications for the job, as Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney might 

see it? A leaks-obsessed Kissinger, when he served as Nixon's national security 

adviser, wiretapped his own staff. (One of his targets, Morton Halperin, sued 

and eventually won an apology.) And when he left office, Kissinger took tens of 

thousands of pages of documents--created by government employees on government 

time--and treated them as his personal records, using them for his own memoirs 

and keeping the material for years from the prying eyes of historians and journalists. 

He and the Bush-Cheney White House agree on open government: the less the better. 

</p>

<p> Remember, the White House was never keen on setting up an independent commission 

that would answer to the public. Cheney at one point reportedly intervened to 

block a compromise that had been painstakingly worked out in Congress regarding 

the composition and rules of the commission. Finally, the White House said okay, 

as long as it could pick the chairman and subpoenas would only be issued with 

the support of at least six of the commission's ten members. With Kissinger in 

control, the secret-keepers of the White House--who already have succeeded in 

preventing the House and Senate intelligence committees' investigation of 9/ll 

from releasing embarrassing and uncomfortable information--will have little reason 

to fear. </p>

<p> The Bush-Cheney administration has been a rehab center for tainted Republicans. 

Retired Admiral John Poindexter, a leading Iran-contra player, was placed in charge 

of a sensitive, high-tech, Pentagon intelligence-gathering operation aimed at 

reviewing massive amounts of individual personal data in order to uncover possible 

terrorists. Elliott Abrams, who pled guilty to lying to Congress in the Iran-contra 

scandal, was warmly embraced and handed a staff position in Bush's National Security 

Council. But the Kissinger selection is the most outrageous of these acts of compassion 

and forgiveness. It is a move of defiance and hubris. </p>

<p> For many in the world, Kissinger is a symbol of US arrogance and the misuse 

of American might. In power, he cared more for US credibility and geostrategic 

advantage than for human rights and open government. His has been a career of 

covertly moving chips, not one of letting them fall. He is not a truth-seeker. 

In fact, he has prevaricated about his own actions and tried to limit access to 

government information. He should be subpoenaed, not handed the right to subpoena. 

He is a target, not an investigator. </p>

<p> With Kissinger's appointment, Bush has rendered the independent commission 

a sham. Democrats should have immediately announced they would refuse to fill 

their allotted five slots. But after Bush picked Kissinger, the Democrats tapped 

former Democratic Senator George Mitchell to be vice-chairman of the panel, signaling 

that Kissinger was fine by them. How unfortunate. The public would be better served 

and the victims of 9/11 better honored by no commission rather than one headed 

by Kissinger. </p>
