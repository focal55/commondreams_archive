How can it be that an administration top heavy with such pro-democracy stalwarts 

as Otto Reich, Elliott Abrams and John Negroponte would welcome a military coup 

that toppled a democratically elected Latin American president? Amazingly, that 

is what happened April 13, when the administration of George W. Bush hailed the 

ouster of Venezuela’s Hugo Chavez. 

<p>By April 15 Chavez had regained the presidency, thanks in large part to strong 

condemnation of the coup from Latin American leaders, many of whom don’t particularly 

care for Chavez’s brand of populism or his authoritarian streak. Their outcry 

stood in sharp contrast to Uncle Sam’s embrace of the coup makers. 

<p>It was particularly disheartening to hear National Security Adviser Condoleezza 

Rice welcome the coup, for it was she who selected Abrams to advise her on democracy 

and human rights. There is no greater champion of democratic values than Abrams. 

True, he’s a convicted Iran-contra perjurer, and he led cheers for Salvadoran 

army mass murderers and contra cutthroats. But hey, everybody has their bad days. 

<p>Negroponte, our ambassador to the U.N., apparently was out of the coup loop. 

Back in the day, however, as Ambassador to Honduras, he was a great fosterer of 

democracy -- or at least its illusion. (Hey, you got to start somewhere.) The 

Reagan Gang erected a democratic facade in Honduras so the true powers, Negroponte 

and the army, could run the show, crush dissent and harbor Nicaraguan terrorists. 

Yep, Reagan’s beloved contra “freedom fighters” -- “the moral equivalent of the 

Founding Fathers” -- were terrorists: They routinely targeted civilians for rape, 

torture and murder -- and the “murder” portion was justified in a manual the CIA 

wrote for and distributed to the contra terrorists. 

<p>Like Negroponte, acting Assistant Secretary of State for the Western Hemisphere 

Otto Reich is a favorite of Colin Powell, the administration’s “voice of reason.” 

Reich, who was U.S. Ambassador to Venezuela in the late 1980s after a successful 

stint as Reagan’s disinformation czar, had the current U.S. Ambassador urge the 

coup’s front-man -- big-business fat-cat Pedro Carmona -- to refrain from dissolving 

the National Assembly. Reich apparently was concerned that such an act would reduce 

the likelihood that any government other than Reich’s would recognize the coup 

regime. 

<p>Yes, it comes as quite a shock that the government of Reich, Abrams and Negroponte 

would countenance a military coup. But it did, and so we must now parse Bush administration 

statements with the same attention to detail that the media parsed Slick Willie’s 

statements about sex. 

<p>White House spokesman Ari Fleischer stated that administration officials told 

Chavez’s opponents the U.S. “would not support a coup.” So the question to ask 

is, “Did the officials tell the plotters the administration would ‘oppose’ a coup, 

or merely ‘not support’ it?” It appears the administration did not actively oppose 

the coup, given the statements welcoming Chavez’s ouster. 

<p>Imagine that U.S. diplomats and military officials got wind of a plot to oust 

an elected Latin president more to their liking. Let’s say that Mexican generals 

and businessmen had a plan to remove Vicente Fox. Might our officials have informed 

Fox of that fact? Might they have taken steps to head off the coup? 

<p>Or imagine a British plot by the left wing of the Labor Party to banish Bush’s 

regal beagle, Tony Blair. Might the U.S. have fended that one off and alerted 

Blair? 

<p>Here’s another line of questioning worth pursuing: 

<p>What role did the CIA and other U.S. agencies play in supporting, organizing, 

coordinating, stoking or otherwise encouraging the anti-Chavez protests, plots 

and propaganda? There’s a CIA template for fomenting dissent to undermine or overthrow 

governments that tick off Uncle Sam -- e.g., Brazil’s in the 1960s, Chile’s in 

the 1970s and Nicaragua’s in the 1980s. It includes covert aid to and manipulation 

of unions, political parties, business groups, military officers (or ex-military) 

and the media. 

<p>It’s one thing for Venezuelans to organize democratically to oppose certain 

policies. It’s quite another to go beyond that and work for a coup. But it’s even 

worse for a foreign power to covertly stoke and manipulate that opposition -- 

particularly when it knows that the goal is an unconstitutional transfer of power. 

<p>Such matters won’t interest many members of our corporate news media -- particularly 

the “team players” on the broadcast and cable news networks and PBS. But for those 

journalists who take seriously their duty in a democracy to keep the people fully 

informed, it’s time to dig. Actually, it’s past time. Any moderately curious reporter 

familiar with the techniques of CIA destablization programs should long ago have 

recognized the signs that our spooks might be up to their old tricks.
