<p>Even with an enemy as easy to hate as Saddam Hussein, the Bush

Administration's war plans in Iraq have awakened "huge reservoirs of

unease" in the American public, says Peace Action spokesperson Scott

Lynch. The Administration's bullying autumn war drive, its explicit

discussion of pre-emptive strikes and regime change, its overtly

corporate agenda on energy and oil, and its early, arrogant attempts to

make war without Congress, let alone the United Nations, unleashed a

flood of antiwar sentiment and activity across the country. The sheer

breadth of this opposition could help to birth one of the largest

antiwar movements in US history--that is, if these politically diverse

antiwar eruptions can join forces as a movement at all.



</p>

<p>



So far, the strength of the opposition is certainly not its unity, but

its diversity. Here, for example, is a snapshot of the New York City

antiwar movement in the final days of November: Uptown, black and Latino

youth activists and tenant organizers huddle in a back room, discussing

how to turn out bodega owners and taxi drivers for their December 14

march in Harlem "for schools and jobs, not war"; while downtown, a

collection of apron-clad activists, from such global justice outfits as

Reclaim the Streets, hold a "bake sale for the military," a propaganda

stunt to promote an antiwar listserv. Some 2,000 high school students

walk out of their classes to protest the war, organized by one antiwar

coalition, Not in Our Name, and a week later, a thousand

African-American congregants pack the rafters--and basement--of the

House of the Lord Church in Brooklyn for an antiwar town meeting

sponsored by another national coalition, International ANSWER. Meanwhile, coalition-averse artists, interior decorators, restaurateurs and go-go boys calling themselves "Glamericans" meet to plan a star-studded antiwar bash designed to reach those who get their news from MTV.

</p>

<p>



Glance around the country and one sees this diversity multiplied: People

came out for peace marches and vigils even in such conservative redoubts

as Sioux Falls, South Dakota, and Anchorage, Alaska. An estimated

100,000 turned out for a march in Washington. Such mainstays of the

institutional movement as NOW, the NAACP, the National Council of

Churches, the Conference of Catholic Bishops and the California Labor

Federation--organizations that collectively represent millions of

Americans--have all issued strong antiwar resolutions, as have some

thirty city councils. Dissent--or at least discomfort--has cropped up

even in conservative quarters, at the libertarian Cato Institute, which

has called a war "unwise"; among former military and security advisers

such as Brent Scowcroft, who have pushed against unilateral action; and,

most impressively, from the likes of Colin Powell and George Tenet

within the Administration itself. Combined with international opposition

and lukewarm support for the war in polls, this resistance has already

slowed an invasion and backed the Administration into negotiations with

Congress and the UN. Former SDS leader Tom Hayden sees a level of

ferment that was unimaginable at a comparable stage of the Vietnam War,

say in 1965--when only 7,000 turned out for a national march on

Washington.

</p>

<p>



The groundswell of opposition, however, was ahead of any leadership. As

Bush launched his war drive, Democratic Party leaders, urged on by

impassioned constituents, could have marshaled the opposition, but

declined. Peace Action, a descendant of SANE/Freeze, has 100 chapters

across the country and calls itself "the nation's largest peace

organization." But last fall, says Lynch, "we just didn't have the

capacity" to coordinate a mass action. Networks of the other

longstanding peace organizations--Pax Christi, the Quakers, the War

Resisters League--have provided the infrastructure for many of the tiny

vigils in Middle America, but nothing in the way of national

coordination. "The historic peace organizations are always there," says

Leslie Cagan, lead organizer of the 1982 antinuke rally in Central Park,

"and yet they always need to be regrouped whenever a new war comes

along."

</p>

<p>



While these sectors regrouped, far-left groups stepped into the breach.

The International Action Center has built momentum since the 1991 Iraq

war through an antisanctions campaign and was ready to roll after

September 11, convening its new antiwar coalition, International ANSWER,

within days. It was ANSWER that organized the surprisingly large October

26 rallies in San Francisco and Washington, with groups like Peace

Action coming along for the ride. Next in line was Not in Our Name, a

more populist alternative to ANSWER, whose pledge of resistance struck a

chord across the country, reproduced in small-town papers like the

<i>Sierra Vista Herald</i>, which serves an Arizona military town, and

inspired a national day of actions in early October. Much has been made

recently in the left and mainstream press of these coalitions' ties to

the Workers World Party and the Revolutionary Communist Party,

respectively, but journalists' warnings about the risks posed by these

groups lag behind conversations in the streets.

</p>

<p>



Peace activists have been strategizing about the International Action

Center since an earlier guise forced dual marches during the 1991 Gulf

War; at issue was their refusal to condemn Iraq's invasion of Kuwait or

to support economic sanctions as a war alternative. And newcomers like

youth organizer Erica Smiley, 22, weathered painful squabbles over the

DC demonstrations last April--with ANSWER moving the date of its

Palestine-focused march to coincide with a national student peace march,

nearly eclipsing the latter's call to "stop the war at home and abroad."

</p>

<p>



But students, antiglobalization street activists and old-time peaceniks

alike appreciate ANSWER's knack for mobilizing the unaffiliated and

turning out the Arab-American community--the latter due in great part to

the leadership of groups such as the Free Palestine Alliance in ANSWER's

coalition. Tom Hayden recalls "similar divisions, and rival

organizations and factions," in the 1960s antiwar movement, but says

there was an "ecology" to it, in which "most of us recognized that there

was a certain inevitability about the other camp." While some antiwar

activists shun ANSWER altogether, most adopt this ecological view, and

say they are ready to work with--or at least around--the coalition. Most

also agree that a sectarian approach--even a liberal sectarianism that

seeks to isolate the far left--will never build a broad antiwar

movement. And they share the confidence, says David McReynolds, a

longtime activist with the War Resisters League, that "ANSWER's monopoly

has to be broken, and it will be."

</p>

<p>



It's already being chipped away in a variety of ways. A broad spectrum

of players--traditional peace groups; student, global justice and

antiracist activists; mainstream labor, environmental, civil rights and

women's organizations--piggybacked onto ANSWER's big march to convene an

ambitious new national coalition, United

for Peace. A hundred-plus celebrities, working in conjunction with the

National Council of Churches and other liberal institutions, announced

their opposition to the war on December 10 through the new Win Without

War coalition--joining a national day of some 150 antiwar actions called

by United for Peace. Student, labor and women's coalitions are in the

works. And young anticapitalists, with their distaste for

authoritarianism of any stripe, are honing creative strategies for

cooperating with ANSWER while maintaining autonomy. On October 26 a

local coalition spearheaded by the DC Anti-Capitalist Convergence

organized its own feeder march, drawing attention to the potential

domestic costs of the war, which preceded ANSWER's rally. DC ACC's Zein

El-Amine considers the action a great success, because "it was done not

by being separatist from the larger event but by building our own

coalition and preserving our own ideas."

</p>









   <p>

For those behind United for Peace--such as Cagan; global justice guru

Medea Benjamin, founding director of Global Exchange; and former AFL-CIO

official Bill Fletcher, president of TransAfrica Forum--the antiwar

movement's biggest test is not what to do about ANSWER but whether it is

possible to bring together the traditional peace organizations with the

two most dynamic social movements in recent years: the sprawling global

justice coalition that debuted in Seattle and the urban racial justice

movement, with its vibrant campaigns around police brutality, racial

profiling and immigrants' rights. Such a merger, they argue, would

provide lasting infrastructure for an antiwar movement.



</p>

<p>



"Events are showing that these issues are interlinked," says Fletcher.

"But it will be a challenge for the antiwar movement to talk about the

role of empire and the dangers of domestic repression, and a challenge

for organizers in communities of color, who have focused on domestic

issues to the exclusion of foreign policy."

</p>

<p>



It's not an easy fit for the global justice movement, either, except

perhaps for the movement's anticapitalist sector, which, says El-Amine,

has "always understood that you can't have that invisible hand of the

market work overseas without the fist of militarism to open up markets."

Benjamin says that earlier this fall, she heard deep concern from other

global justice forces, still struggling to regroup after September 11,

that taking on the war might alienate labor--which was virtually

unanimous in support of the invasion of Afghanistan--from its "Teamsters

and turtles" alliance. But it turns out that in the view of American

labor, Iraq is no Afghanistan. On Iraq, says former Teamsters organizing

director Bob Muehlenkamp, "unions have begun to question their

government's war policy earlier, more broadly and more seriously than

ever before at such an early stage of a war threat," with giant union

locals, and even two state labor federations, taking an antiwar stance

[see Marc Cooper, "Antiwar Labor Pains," December 9]. In addition, says

Benjamin, the massive antiwar demonstration that burst out of the

European Social Forum in Florence in early November allayed American

activists' concerns about taking on the war. "It sure didn't seem [the

Europeans] had a problem convincing people there that saying no to war

was part of the global justice movement," she says.

</p>

<p>



But the fault line that runs between these three movements--and could

easily capsize them as they combine--is what Fletcher calls "the

tripwire of US politics": race. While the traditional peace

movement--especially its religious wing, mobilized by early, strong

leadership from the National Council of Churches--has conferred a moral

legitimacy on antiwar sentiment and has reached deeply into Middle

America, its organizations are mostly white and middle class. That

pattern has plagued the anti-corporate globalization movement, too. This

whiteness shapes everything from outreach strategies to meeting style to

which messages are considered to have "broad appeal." So it will take

some profound rumblings for this movement to tap the deep pockets of

antiwar sentiment among African-Americans, Muslims and Latinos. (A

recent poll by the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies found

that African-American support for the war was at a low 19 percent.)

</p>

<p>



This is why one of the most talked-about developments among antiwar

activists is a new coalition, Racial Justice 9-11, formed specifically

to build antiwar resistance among communities of color. The coalition's

founding conference last February drew forty community-based groups from

across the country that have traditionally worked only on home-front

agendas, such as criminal justice reform. Coordinator Hany Khalil says

that between "the shift of public money to a permanent war abroad" and

the possibility "that our own home countries might be targeted down the

road," RJ9-11 aims to frame the issues in a way that will break a

"routinization" of priorities and focus community attention on the war.

Indeed, twenty more groups have joined the coalition in recent months.

</p>

<p>



As these movements come together, serious differences of opinion are

inevitable. While some at the founding meeting of United for Peace urged

that a narrow message, "Stop the war on Iraq," would appeal most to

Middle America, Khalil and others argue that separating the war abroad

from the war at home--from immigrant roundups to stateside structural

readjustment--will do little to activate people of color. (The Joint

Center's poll showed that while most African-Americans oppose a war,

only 6 percent rank it as the top concern.) 

</p>

<p>



Likewise, some urge avoiding the third rail of Palestine, not so much

because it would likely alienate Jewish institutions, which have

exhibited little inclination to oppose this war anyway, but because the

issue has to be carefully formulated to avoid alienating important

liberal institutions as well. NOW vice president Olga Vives, for

example, mentioned "balance" on the Israel-Palestine conflict as crucial

to her group's involvement in a broader peace movement. But given that

the Palestinian cause has galvanized the student left and will be deeply

affected by any war in the region, Khalil predicts that the antiwar

movement will have to take up the question.

</p>

<p>



The winning formula, Fletcher says, is to insist that "the front needs

to include anyone who is in opposition to this war," to respect

political differences within the movement as it expands and to work

toward "a broader, anti-imperialist political analysis" that can prepare

the movement to challenge future American military adventures and their

domestic repercussions.

</p>









   <p>

Even as it weathers political growing pains, the movement needs

resources. What that means is not necessarily money, says John Cavanagh,

director of the Institute for Policy Studies, a left-wing Washington

think tank, "but a broad range of organizations to decide this is a

priority and shift their own resources to it." 



</p>

<p>



There are signs this has begun, among both individuals and institutions.

Bob Wing, for example, a lifelong racial justice activist in California,

says he began rethinking his priorities "one second after I learned

about the crash into the World Trade Center" and has become a full-time

antiwar pamphleteer, launching the bilingual tabloid <i>War

Times</i>--which now has a circulation of 120,000. The Rev. Peter

Laarman, who had focused in recent years on building labor solidarity

within his congregation at New York City's historic Judson Memorial

Church, has turned his attentions to organizing clergy against the war,

orchestrating their mass arrest at a December sit-in at the UN. The

Institute for Policy Studies (IPS) has redirected half of its staff to

Iraq work; Peace Action is raising funds to hire regional antiwar

organizers across the country; and Global Exchange has devoted staff

time to building United for Peace. Global Exchange's Medea Benjamin,

meanwhile, helped to launch Code Pink, which uses a gendered spin on

militarism and unilateralism, as well as a daily White House vigil, to

attract feminist troops to the antiwar movement.

</p>

<p>



More mainstream organizations also appear to be extending their antiwar

commitments. NOW adopted a fairly radical-sounding resolution in June,

condemning "the opportunistic use of fighting terrorism as an excuse for

massive imperial expansion," and the group has asked its 500 chapters to

turn out women for the Code Pink vigil each week until March. Greenpeace

USA head John Passacantando, who wrote an open letter to George Bush

opposing the war, says his group plans to build an antiwar message into

its new international campaign targeting ExxonMobil, "considered," he

says, "to be in the front position to benefit from regime change in

Iraq." The NAACP followed up its October antiwar resolution by calling

on all its campus chapters to host town hall meetings about the war. An

AFL-CIO official says he's trying to get antiwar locals and labor

councils together for a national meeting. And the victory of antiwar

sectors of the Democratic Party in the contest for minority leadership

of the House has reopened the possibility that the party will take to

the bully pulpit.

</p>

<p>



Student activism is picking up steam, as several proven networks expand

their mission to join forces against the war. The Student Environmental

Action Coalition launched a Militarism and the Environment campaign in

August; United Students Against Sweatshops is in discussion about

targeting weapons manufacturers; and each is a member of the National

Youth and Student Peace Coalition (NYSPC), which already has the

capacity to reach some 200,000 students and is planning a national

student walkout for next spring. And this is not your father's student

antiwar movement. Erica Smiley, the Washington, DC, youth leader, who is

in the Black Radical Congress and on the NYSPC steering committee, says

the coalition has "all kinds of historically underrepresented youth at

the table"; this is reflected in its focus on "the war at home," meaning

the lack of jobs and affordable education that is forcing many kids to

consider joining the military. NYSPC also plans to develop a web chat

room where young soldiers can anonymously express dissent.

</p>

<p>



The religious mobilization has been the deepest and broadest to date.

Despite near silence in the organized Jewish community and a feeling of

Patriot-era vulnerability among Muslim congregations, courageous clergy

members issued an interfaith call in November for fasting and reflection

on the dangers of this war, published simultaneously in Catholic,

Protestant, Jewish and Muslim papers. The United Methodists sent out an

antiwar educational packet to its congregations across the country. And

the National Council of Churches is in the midst of "A Season for

Peacemaking," which included the civil disobedience Laarman coordinated

at the UN, an action built around the inviting concept of "common

humanity." "We don't think the moderate middle really accepts the

premise of pre-emptive war, but they're being herded along," says

Laarman. "Our role as religious leaders is to unherd them."

</p>

<p>



Cavanagh, who is a United for Peace co-initiator, sees a three-pronged

strategy ahead. First, he says, "what came through in September and

October is that there are millions of Americans who have a ton of

questions. So this is a time when education has a lot of traction."

Second, it's critical to be visible, "to keep the peace movement on the

front pages" as the Administration attempts to discredit the

weapons-inspection process. And third, the movement needs to promote the

voices of unlikely dissenters, such as the many former intelligence

officers who are raising red flags, which will "raise the nervousness

quotient" among the American public. He argues that even postelection,

public opinion still looms large for a White House fixed on 2004.

</p>

<p>



But some of the most decisive factors are out of the activists' hands.



"Most of the opposition is to a unilateral, pre-emptive war," says

Cavanagh. "If there's a clear-cut provocation by Iraq and strong

international backing, all of that evaporates." The more likely

scenario, according to IPS experts, is a feeble excuse for war, trumped

up by the Administration, and lukewarm international backing, with a

couple of abstentions or even no votes on the UN Security Council. That

result would provide a real challenge for the antiwar movement: to

quickly educate against what Wing calls "the big-time propaganda machine

that will fall into place" and win the public debate about what

constitutes a legitimate war. But the movement would likely be aided by

broad popular opposition in Europe and the Muslim world.

</p>

<p>



It would be a moment fraught with danger--of escalating anti-American

terrorism, especially--but also opportunity. "There is a hope of this

war being disrupted as it goes along," says expatriate journalist Mike

Marqusee, who helped to organize London's 400,000-strong antiwar

demonstration in September, "and we in the European peace movement want

to do whatever we can to strengthen American voices of dissent." Medea

Benjamin predicts that January's World Social Forum in Porto Alegre,

Brazil, attended by some 50,000 last year, will forge a large-scale,

international merger of the antiwar and global justice movements--and

give a shot in the arm to the US movement. "There's a real wave of

ferment in the world," says Tom Hayden. "And it seems directly in

response to the cresting of the conservative movement in America. There

was an unexplainable worldwide social movement in 1968 as well, and it's

back, like a second earthquake, on exactly the same fault line. Stay

tuned."</p>
