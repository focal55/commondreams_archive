<p>Returning from an early walk Wednesday--our day of national mourning--I found 

a flag stuck in the geranium plant at the end of our driveway. A foot-long laminated 

flag on a 2-foot spike. The attached tag read, "Compliments of your neighborhood 

Realtor &#91;followed by name and phone number&#93;. Proudly wave your flag on 

these days:" And then it listed all the national secular holidays from New Year's 

to Veteran's Day. Sept. 11 was missing from the list, but I presume that will 

last only until the stock of these blue and white notices is exhausted and the 

Realtors reprint.

<p>I looked up and down the block. Every driveway had its flag. The Japanese American 

household across the street. The Italians. The Persians. The Lithuanians. Even 

the houses under construction where no one was living had American flags. And, 

of course, the houses that were up for sale. Clearly a case of massive involuntary 

flag-waving. Imposed flag-waving. Worse, commercial flag-waving.

<p>For let's face it, the real motivational message is this: May the spirit of 

patriotism inspired by this flag move you so profoundly that you'll call me at 

the following number, let me sell your house and advance my sales ranking to the 

Platinum Circle.

<p> I plucked the flag from the pot, removed the notice and placed the flag in 

another spot, unseen from the street.

<p>Let me be clear. My argument is not against the flag. It is the presumption, 

the imposition of the sentiment and worse, the corruption of patriotism that makes 

me irate.

<p>Let me be clearer. I had spent the hour before this listening to the names 

of the dead being read at the World Trade Center. I noted the Arab names, the 

Korean and Indian, Scandinavian and African names as well as the many Kellys and 

Smiths. I was moved all over again and profoundly sad for the victims and their 

survivors.

<p>I thought of the numerous survivors who have joined forces as Families for 

Peace to visit the civilian victims of the bombing in Afghanistan and to speak 

out against the proposed war against Iraq. To my mind, these brave individuals 

represent the best of America and the transformative good that can rise from ashes 

sown by evil. They represent the independent thought, courage and free will that 

lie at the heart of our national identity. They do not represent mandatory flag-waving.

<p>Nor do they represent the many ways this administration has seized the excuse 

of terrorism to curb the freedoms that I have always believed form the core truth 

behind our flag. Thanks to President Bush, John Ashcroft and the so-called USA 

Patriot Act, our government is authorized to conduct surveillance on U.S. citizens 

even when there is no probable cause.

<p>"Roving wiretap" authority allows the government to intercept conversations 

on cell phones and to monitor multiple telephones and computers used by an individual, 

regardless of how many other people use the same instruments (such as pay phones 

or Internet cafe computers). Section 215 of the Patriot Act authorizes the FBI 

to subpoena records from anybody it wants and prosecute those subpoenaed if they 

tell anyone about it. Federal investigators may now search and seize our belongings 

without probable cause as long as they claim the search is "related to terrorism 

or clandestine intelligence activities." They may monitor our religious and political 

institutions using the same "standard."

<p>Noncitizens may be deported with little or no judicial review, and Americans 

accused of activities that relate to terrorism may be jailed indefinitely without 

trial and without being charged or allowed to confront the witnesses against them.

<p>So much for the 1st, 4th, 5th and 6th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.

<p>All this in the name of the "patriotism" that laminated commercial giveaway 

flags have come to symbolize.

<p>The sorry truth is that our national promise of "liberty and justice for all" 

is under attack not just by terrorists from afar but by those who warn us to hoist 

the Stars and Stripes--or else.
