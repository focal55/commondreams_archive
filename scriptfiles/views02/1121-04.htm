<p>With the exception of Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., Americans 

have never used the word &#034;homeland&#034; to describe their country. But Americans 

will now have a Department of Homeland Security, thanks to Senate Democrats who 

chose to vote for legislation they knew was packed with pork barrel spending, 

corporate welfare and special interest favors. 

<p>The legislation creates the third-largest Cabinet agency, which will in the 

words of Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., become a &#034;bureaucratic behemoth&#034; 

destined to cost taxpayers a fortune while very possibly making it harder for 

federal authorities to fight genuine terror threats. 

<p>With its liability exemptions for corporations, its favors for the pharmaceutical 

industry, and its diversion of federal funds to prop up Texas A&M University in 

the home state of President Bush and Republican Sen. Phil Gramm, a key player 

in shaping the legislation, the legislation is entirely indefensible. 

<p>What made the bill truly disgusting, however, was a section that relaxed a 

ban on the awarding of homeland security contracts to corporations that seek to 

avoid paying U.S. taxes by setting up off-shore tax havens. That ban was crafted 

by the late Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn. 

<p>The overwhelming majority of Democratic senators voted for an amendment to 

the legislation that would have stripped the legislation of the worst sections 

of the bill. But they lost narrowly, and then the vast majority of Senate Democrats 

- including Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wis. - allowed their opposition to collapse. They 

voted with the Bush administration and Senate Republicans to approve establishment 

of the department. 

<p>Voting &#034;no&#034; were the eight Democrats - including Wisconsin&#039;s 

Russ Feingold - and one independent, James Jeffords. Theirs were the only honorable 

votes on this issue. </p>
