<p>YOU COULD SEE the angst on George Bush's face last week, as he struggled to 

look tough on guys in corporate boardrooms wearing business suits. You could tell 

he was itching to get back to something more comfortable, like smokin' out guys 

in faraway caves wearing funny-looking outfits. 

<P></P>

If last September's terrorist attacks were the best thing that ever happened to 

President George W. Bush, the unveiling of widespread corporate hooliganism at 

the heart of American capitalism in recent months is the toughest development 

he's had to face. Turning on friends and political donors is never easy. 

<P></P>

There's also the embarrassment of explaining his own behaviour as a corporate 

director, such as the selling of his shares in Harken Energy just before ordinary 

shareholders — who didn't have the benefit of sitting on the audit committee — 

discovered they faced massive losses. 

<P></P>

As Bush noted in his speech to Wall Street last week: "Corporate leaders who violate 

the public trust should never be given that trust again." (Note that he carefully 

avoided mentioning whether there was anything wrong with them going on to be President.)

<P></P>

Another danger is that the public will begin questioning the very nature of the 

unbridled capitalism under which members of the financial elite have in the last 

two decades twisted and contorted the system in every possible way — legally and 

illegally, it turns out — to massively enrich themselves.

<P></P>

Bush's tax cut, for instance, will transfer immense wealth over the next decade 

to the already hyper-rich. According to the Washington-based Citizens for Tax 

Justice, some $477 billion — more than half of the total savings — will go to 

the top one per cent of Americans, who will save $342,000 EACH.

<P></P>

When this sort of rapacious behaviour on the part of the elite is the basis of 

public policy, it surely sends a message that any manoeuvring in the quest for 

personal enrichment is okay ... at least for those with access to a good accounting 

firm.

<P></P>

It's interesting to note how far things have moved from the days when governments 

were expected to protect something called the "public good."

<P></P>

Even traditional conservatives like Henry C. Simons, a founder of the Chicago 

School, defended progressive taxation as a tool to prevent excessive inequality. 

Simons noted: "There is something unlovely to modern, as against medieval minds, 

about marked inequality."

<P></P>

The medieval mindset has clearly made a comeback in the postmodern era. 

<P></P>

All this has been done beneath a banner of "freeing up the market," accompanied 

by extravagant claims that we'll all benefit. 

<P></P>

The market is portrayed as an arena of efficiency, where decisions are based on 

scientific laws like supply and demand, and where one gets by on merit, not on 

the kind of crony connections that ruled the old-style tribal economies of pre-market 

days. 

<P></P>

But today's brand of capitalism bears little resemblance to this mythical market 

model, except at the lower levels where the market power of capital effectively 

keeps workers in line. 

<P></P>

At the top, the old-boy, crony network continues to thrive. Corporate managers, 

even those running badly failing enterprises, routinely win multi-million-dollar 

stock option packages from corporate boards filled with friends and colleagues 

who understand that a rising tide of corporate compensation lifts all boats.

<P></P>

The collegial atmosphere of all this would make even the most primitive tribal 

chief feel right at home. 

<P></P>

It's hard to see anything particularly efficient about it though.

<P></P>

(It's also hard to imagine how Adam Smith's vision of everyone rationally pursuing 

their own self-interest can even happen when modern accounting trickery prevents 

the players from seeing where their self-interest actually lies.) 

<P></P>

Of course, nobody exemplifies the world of cronyism and old boyism better than 

Bush, whose family not only provided him with personal wealth but also pretty 

much arranged for him to take over the leadership of the "free world." (Or is 

there somebody somewhere who thinks that George W. Bush could have risen to the 

presidency even if he'd been adopted at birth by a family in the South Bronx?)

<P></P>

Bush struggled last week to imbue current-day capitalism with some kind of moral 

substance. "In the long run, there is no capitalism without conscience, there 

is no wealth without character."

<P></P>

Really? As a philosophical observation, this is about on a par with "Shopping 

is good." One can only speculate what Bush meant — that having money builds character 

or having character builds money? (Those guys driving Jaguars must be saints.)

<P></P>

Meanwhile, it's no accident that the New York Times ran a front- page story about 

stepped-up plans to bomb Iraq the same day it reported Bush's Wall Street speech. 

The temptation to get the focus back onto those menacing-looking men in funny-looking 

outfits is clearly huge. 

<P></P>

Saddam better pray that the accounting profession sorts itself out quickly.
