<p>By the end of the Senate’s working day on July 10, it will have been decided 

whether or not Senate Joint Resolution 34 will allow for the passage of 77,000 

tons of nuclear waste through towns across our country for the next thirty years 

by way of truck, train and barge. As a proponent of this plan, Energy Secretary 

Spencer Abraham has argued that the “project is critical for national security.” 

The 50 million people that are within ½ mile of the proposed shipment routes will 

probably disagree. If an accident should occur on a train route, the Department 

of Energy (DOE) estimates that 48 people will die of cancer from the radioactive 

materials released into the surrounding areas. It is not a safe time to tempt 

terrorists with vulnerable shipments of nuclear waste traveling across the country 

at a rate of six shipments per day along predictable routes. As word of this disaster-in-the-making 

gets out, concerned citizens are entering their addresses at <a href="http://www.mapscience.org" target="_new">www.mapscience.org</a> 

to see how close those shipments would come to their residence, nearby schools, 

and local hospitals. 

<p>The sobering reality is that long after the current governing 

administrations are no longer in office, and our children and grandchildren 

no longer walk this earth, the highly radioactive nuclear waste will stay in 

the ground beneath Yucca Mountain, Nevada for 10,000 daunting years.



<p>This monumental decision effects the next 500 generations of citizens to 

come, and should not be taken lightly.  The DOE seems to feel that the 600 

earthquakes Yucca Mountain has experienced in the last 20 years are not 

important enough to warrant halting the plans for dumping nuclear materials 

at the sight.  The DOE needs to face the fact that spending $7 billion on 

researching the site may have been a waste.  There is no denying the 

unpredictability of leaving nuclear waste above Yucca Mountain’s active 

magma pocket, and steam outlets.  Yucca Mountain also lies above the aquifer 

that provides drinking water to Nevada citizens, on Native American land 

belonging to the Western Shosone.



<p>The deepest problem here lies at the base of our views on energy. America 

wants mass amounts quickly, cheaply, and without any strings attached to 

create a dependence on other nations for its supply.  Nuclear energy has 

been a very important aspect of our nation’s energy for the last 50 years, 

promising at first to be “too cheap to monitor.”  But let’s monitor this:  

each of the shipment spills (an estimated one per 300 shipments) will cost 

taxpayers $6 billion to clean up.  The first one hundred years of 

construction and operation of the dumpsite will cost taxpayers $58 billion.  

And don’t forget the “cost” of the lives of local fire fighting, police 

force, and hazardous waste teams who will get lethal doses of high level 

radiation from their exposure to the spills.



<p>No one in this world has any idea what to do with the wastes produced from 

creating nuclear energy.  If Spencer Abraham keeps house anything like he 

handles the problem of our nation’s nuclear waste, there are mounds beneath 

his carpet where dirt has been conveniently swept.  Our nation needs to 

handle this problem.  Shipping the waste in an attempt to hide it does not 

solve the problem.   What administration wants to take on the responsibility 

of switching to renewable energy resources for our nation’s energy needs if 

it means that the economy will be hit?  As a nation we baby the nuclear 

industry with subsidies and other forms of government aid, so we could start 

by transferring some of that wealth to renewable sources.  Meanwhile, Yucca 

Mountain is not the answer.  Is the earth ours, or is it borrowed from our 

children? It is not fair to leave them, and future generations in jeopardy 

this way.



<p>Call senators about Yucca Mountain today at the senate switchboard: <br>

(202)-224-3121.
