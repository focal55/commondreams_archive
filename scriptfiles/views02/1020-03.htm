<p>A unilateral, pre-emptive strike against Iraq at this time by the United States 

is wrong for moral, legal and pragmatic reasons. There is no doubt that Saddam 

Hussein is a ruthlessly brutal dictator who has started wars and committed appalling 

human rights abuses against his own people. He is clearly a danger to world order, 

but it has not been proved that he now poses a direct and imminent threat to the 

United States or our allies. 

<P>Many of the arguments around Iraq are long on rhetoric and short on evidence. 

Universities such as ours teach people to follow evidence to a logical conclusion 

and to allow arguments to rise or fall on their own merits, not on partisan or 

ideological convictions. Political decisions fraught with consequences for good 

or ill are inherently moral decisions that must be supported by compelling evidence, 

not stirring exhortations. 

<P>The Iraq situation raises serious questions that should be answered before 

any policy decisions are made: Should the United States pursue a course of action 

independently from the United Nations? Should our government move unilaterally 

against Iraq as we have on other global issues, including land mines, child soldiers, 

nuclear disarmament, an international criminal court and environmental standards? 

Does all wisdom on international matters reside only in Washington, and not at 

all in Paris, Rome, Bangkok, Beijing, Moscow, Istanbul, Riyadh, Mexico City or 

Abuja? 

<P>The rationale for a unilateral, pre-emptive strike against Iraq does not meet 

the classic criteria for a just war: defensive response, legitimate authority, 

right intention, proportionality of means to end and likelihood of success. The 

U.S. Catholic bishops invoked these principles when they urged President Bush 

"to step back from the brink of war." 

<P>We have a congressional resolution but no compelling evidence to support an 

imminent and direct strike against the United States by Iraq, nor for its complicity 

in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Other means of addressing the situation have 

not been satisfactorily explored, much less exhausted. 

<P>At this time, a military strike against Hussein would be a first step, not 

a last resort. The high probability of innocent civilian casualties -- this is 

murder, not "collateral damage" -- further erodes any claims to moral high ground. 

Assertions that a pre-emptive strike against Iraq would be morally legitimate 

contradict moral principles accepted by ethicists in the West for more than a 

millennium. 

<P>Article 51 of the U.N. Charter permits pre-emptive military strikes only when 

a direct attack is imminent, all other options have been exhausted and there is 

no time for deliberation. There is no compelling evidence that nuclear or biological 

and chemical weapons are aimed directly at the United States and that Hussein 

is but a hair's breadth away from pulling the trigger. The debate thus far has 

focused too narrowly on ending the existence of Hussein's government and not enough 

on working with the world community to force a change in its behavior. 

<P>Military and foreign policy experts question whether Iraq now has nuclear weapons 

and/or the capacity to deliver them. Imagine a world where countries invoked the 

principle of pre-emptive strike as cavalierly as some would have us do. Should 

the same latitude to disregard U.N. Article 51 be given to China, 

<P>India, Israel, Pakistan and Russia as the United States presumes for itself? 

I agree with legal scholar George Bisharat, who said clearly, "Unilateral action 

by the United States against another nation would constitute a grave breech of 

international law." 

<P>Experts caution that a war with Iraq has the potential to further destabilize 

a very volatile Middle East. Promises of an easy win in Iraq ring as hollow now 

as similar assurances did early in the Vietnam War. Unilateral action by the United 

States may further isolate us from the world community and strengthen the hand 

of those who argue that U.S. claims to global leadership are based on nothing 

more than military and economic might. The results of a pre-emptive strike against 

Iraq could trigger the very kind of attacks it aims to prevent and leave the world 

with a bigger mess than the one created by Hussein's grip on power. 

<P>Initiating a unilateral, pre-emptive military strike against Iraq at this time 

violates established principles of ethics and offers no assurance of a more stable 

world order. 

<P>Let my conclusion and reasoning stand as an open invitation to explore and 

answer the issues raised. Let no one inhibit such debate by asserting that questioning 

equals disloyalty or patriotism demands assent to policies and decisions that 

individuals disagree with for legal, moral or pragmatic reasons.
