<p>There is scarcely a discussion of climate change on the radio or television 

that does not involve a "climate skeptic" - someone who believes there is no problem. 

This would be unexceptionable if the media always promoted dissent: if, for example, 

someone was brought in to attack capitalism every time the economy was discussed. 

But the coverage the anti-environmentalists receive suggests that the dissent 

that reinforces an underlying orthodoxy is welcome while that which challenges 

it is not. Whatever the explanation may be, the airtime their views receive is 

out of all proportion to the scientific support they muster. 

<P>But let us, for a moment, assume that they are right. Let us imagine that climate 

change does not exist, that pollution does no damage to ecosystems or human health, 

that fisheries are not collapsing, freshwater reserves are not drying up, topsoil 

is not eroding, and forests and coral reefs are not disappearing. Let us pretend 

there is no conflict between two of the avowed goals of the current earth summit: 

relieving poverty in the poor nations while enhancing economic growth in the rich 

ones. Let us pretend that there is no competition for resources between rich and 

poor. Let us accept, in other words, the myths of neoliberalism. 

<P>This is the position taken by the farmer and philosopher Simon Fairlie in his 

new pamphlet, The Prospect of Cornutopia. He envisages the future that most of 

the rich world's governments, economists and media foresee. In this vision, economic 

growth proceeds at some 3% a year, without threatening the earth's capacity to 

support its population. By 2100, if this rate is sustained, we will be 18 times 

richer than we are today. 

<P>Fairlie asks the question that so many economists have ducked. When we possess 

this fabulous wealth, how will we spend it? "A fraction of this amount," he notes, 

"will provide all of us with the one car per two people which appears to be the 

saturation rate ... What next? Will everyone be jetting around the world on a 

weekly basis from airports in every town? Will each home have 10 rooms and a swimming 

pool and, if so, where are we going to build them?" Will we then inhabit the terrestrial 

heaven that the advocates of endless growth have promised us? 

<P>I hardly dare to mention this for fear of being accused of romanticizing poverty 

or somehow conspiring to keep people in the picturesque state to which I would 

never submit myself. But it is impossible not to notice that, in some of the poorest 

parts of the world, most people, most of the time, appear to be happier than we 

are. In southern Ethiopia, for example, the poorest half of the poorest nation 

on earth, the streets and fields crackle with laughter. In homes constructed from 

packing cases and palm leaves, people engage more freely, smile more often, express 

more affection than we do behind our double glazing, surrounded by remote controls. 

<P>This is not to suggest that poverty causes happiness. In southern Ethiopia 

people desperately want better healthcare, better education, better housing and 

sanitation, not to mention smart clothes, motorbikes, refrigerators and radios. 

But while poverty does not cause happiness, there appears to be some evidence 

that wealth causes misery. Since 1950, 25-year-olds in Britain have become 10 

times more likely to be affected by depression. And it is surely fair to say that 

most of us suffer from subclinical neuroses, anxiety or a profound discomfort 

with ourselves. 

<P>Perhaps one of the reasons why people in Ethiopia appear to be happier than 

we are is that they have less to lose by letting other people into their lives. 

The more wealth we possess, the more isolated we become. We must defend it, and 

ourselves, against the intrusions of other people. 

<P>An increase in wealth is always either preceded or followed by an increase 

in property rights. Over the past 20 years, for example, wealthy people have laid 

claim to human genes, public archives, town squares and village greens, playing 

fields, beaches, even clouds and landing spaces on the moon. Having enhanced their 

wealth, they retreat to gated communities, hire guards and install CCTV and movement 

sensors. 

<P>The rich lock themselves in and lock everyone else out. So many fences rise 

to exclude us that after a while we are no longer shut out but shut in. And if 

we try to cross those barriers we pay dearly, for the increasing freedom of capital 

has been accompanied by unprecedented rates of imprisonment. For both the secluded 

and the excluded, the fruits of economic growth become a substitute for human 

interaction: we prefer watching TV than talking to our neighbors.

<P>Plenty of evidence suggests that as we become richer, we become less content 

with ourselves. It is incorrect to say that necessity is the mother of invention. 

In the rich world, invention is the mother of necessity. When people already possess 

all the goods and services they need, growth can be stimulated only by discovering 

new needs. Advertising creates gaps in our lives in order to fill them. We buy 

the products, but the gaps remain. 

<P>Already, in the rich nations, the beneficiaries of development spend much of 

their money on escaping from it: it costs a fortune to live in a place that does 

not assault your eyes and ears with ugliness. To absorb our increasing wealth 

we must keep building. Our new cars need new roads, our new goods and services 

must come from new shops and warehouses and offices. One day there may be nowhere 

left in which we can shut the noise out of our heads. 

<P>Wealth also appears to reduce our capacity to act. Our reliance upon technology 

supplants our reliance upon ourselves and other people. As George Orwell suggested, 

"the logical end of mechanical progress is to reduce the human being to something 

resembling a brain in a bottle". 

<P>In other words, as Simon Fairlie argues, the rich world is approaching the 

point at which "satiation turns into deprivation". Even if we were to forget the 

damage our growing economies inflict upon the environment, even if we were to 

ignore the conflict between our greed and the fulfillment of other people's needs, 

we should be able to see that economic growth in nations that are rich enough 

already is a disaster. 

<P>Environmentalists have been fudging this issue for far too long. We have been 

demanding an accommodation between the irreconcilable objectives of ever-increasing 

wealth and environmental protection, an accommodation we call "sustainable development". 

<P>We know that the world is already rich enough to meet all real human needs, 

but that this wealth is not trickling down from rich to poor. We know that while 

there is a desperate need for redistribution, further growth in the rich world 

is likely to make everyone more miserable. We know that wealth has been romanticized. 

Yet we are afraid to ask for what we really want. Unless we are brave enough to 

confront the notion that growth is good, the world will shop until it drops.
