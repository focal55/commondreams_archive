<p> Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft's announced desire for camps for U.S. citizens he 

deems to be "enemy combatants" has moved him from merely being a political embarrassment 

to being a constitutional menace.

<p>Ashcroft's plan, disclosed last week but little publicized, would allow him 

to order the indefinite incarceration of U.S. citizens and summarily strip them 

of their constitutional rights and access to the courts by declaring them enemy 

combatants.

<p>The proposed camp plan should trigger immediate congressional hearings and 

reconsideration of Ashcroft's fitness for this important office. Whereas Al Qaeda 

is a threat to the lives of our citizens, Ashcroft has become a clear and present 

threat to our liberties.

<p> The camp plan was forged at an optimistic time for Ashcroft's small inner 

circle, which has been carefully watching two test cases to see whether this vision 

could become a reality. The cases of Jose Padilla and Yaser Esam Hamdi will determine 

whether U.S. citizens can be held without charges and subject to the arbitrary 

and unchecked authority of the government.

<p>Hamdi has been held without charge even though the facts of his case are virtually 

identical to those in the case of John Walker Lindh. Both Hamdi and Lindh were 

captured in Afghanistan as foot soldiers in Taliban units. Yet Lindh was given 

a lawyer and a trial, while Hamdi rots in a floating Navy brig in Norfolk, Va.

<p>This week, the government refused to comply with a federal judge who ordered 

that he be given the underlying evidence justifying Hamdi's treatment. The Justice 

Department has insisted that the judge must simply accept its declaration and 

cannot interfere with the president's absolute authority in "a time of war."

<p>In Padilla's case, Ashcroft initially claimed that the arrest stopped a plan 

to detonate a radioactive bomb in New York or Washington, D.C. The administration 

later issued an embarrassing correction that there was no evidence Padilla was 

on such a mission. What is clear is that Padilla is an American citizen and was 

arrested in the United States--two facts that should trigger the full application 

of constitutional rights.

<p>Ashcroft hopes to use his self-made "enemy combatant" stamp for any citizen 

whom he deems to be part of a wider terrorist conspiracy.

<p>Perhaps because of his discredited claims of preventing radiological terrorism, 

aides have indicated that a "high-level committee" will recommend which citizens 

are to be stripped of their constitutional rights and sent to Ashcroft's new camps.

<p>Few would have imagined any attorney general seeking to reestablish such camps 

for citizens. Of course, Ashcroft is not considering camps on the order of the 

internment camps used to incarcerate Japanese American citizens in World War II. 

But he can be credited only with thinking smaller; we have learned from painful 

experience that unchecked authority, once tasted, easily becomes insatiable.

<p>We are only now getting a full vision of Ashcroft's America. Some of his predecessors 

dreamed of creating a great society or a nation unfettered by racism. Ashcroft 

seems to dream of a country secured from itself, neatly contained and controlled 

by his judgment of loyalty.

<p>For more than 200 years, security and liberty have been viewed as coexistent 

values. Ashcroft and his aides appear to view this relationship as lineal, where 

security must precede liberty.

<p>Since the nation will never be entirely safe from terrorism, liberty has become 

a mere rhetorical justification for increased security.

<p>Ashcroft is a catalyst for constitutional devolution, encouraging citizens 

to accept autocratic rule as their only way of avoiding massive terrorist attacks.

<p>His greatest problem has been preserving a level of panic and fear that would 

induce a free people to surrender the rights so dearly won by their ancestors.

<p>In "A Man for All Seasons," Sir Thomas More was confronted by a young lawyer, 

Will Roper, who sought his daughter's hand. Roper proclaimed that he would cut 

down every law in England to get after the devil.

<p>More's response seems almost tailored for Ashcroft: "And when the last law 

was down and the devil turned round on you, where would you hide, Roper, the laws 

all being flat? ... This country's planted thick with laws from coast to coast 

... and if you cut them down--and you are just the man to do it--do you really 

think you could stand upright in the winds that would blow then?"

<p>Every generation has had Ropers and Ashcrofts who view our laws and traditions 

as mere obstructions rather than protections in times of peril. But before we 

allow Ashcroft to denude our own constitutional landscape, we must take a stand 

and have the courage to say, "Enough." 

<p>Every generation has its test of principle in which people of good faith can 

no longer remain silent in the face of authoritarian ambition. If we cannot join 

together to fight the abomination of American camps, we have already lost what 

we are defending. </i></p>
