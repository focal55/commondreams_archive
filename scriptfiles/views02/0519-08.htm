<p> The picture that has emerged from the chaos of Washington over the 

past several days is a gruesome one. While evidence steadily grows of 

a gross failure to prepare, despite overwhelming reason to do so, for 

the possibility of terrorist attacks, the Bush administration has 

been shameless in its frenzied efforts to evade responsibility and 

prevent the American public from seeking the truth. 



<p>While National Security Adviser Condoleeza Rice approached the press 

with a thirty-seven minute spiel that repeated the word 'general' or 

'generalized' nineteen times in reference to prior warnings of 

terrorist threats, Vice President Dick Cheney laid down a 

thinly-veiled threat to "my democratic friends in Congress," warning 

that "they need to be very cautious not to seek political advantage 

by making incendiary suggestions" that the White House had 

information which could have prevented the tragedy of September 11.



<p>A chorus of administration apologists were quick to respond that 

calls for investigation were, as Cheney suggested, "thoroughly 

irresponsible and totally unworthy of national leaders in times of 

war." Trent Lott accused dissidents of "talking like our enemy is 

George W. Bush and not Osama bin Laden," while Senator Christopher S. 

Bond explained that "the real story here is a bunch of Democrats 

stumbling for anything to put a dent in the president's popularity."



<p>However, these words ring suspiciously hollow to those who, 

rightfully frightened of further terrorist attacks, expect the Bush 

administration to learn from its mistakes instead of hiding them -- 

and these mistakes are becoming more glaring every day.



<p>An intelligence summary given to Condoleeza Rice on June 28 stated 

"it is highly likely that a significant al Qaeda attack is in the 

near future, within several weeks." On July 5, a month and a day 

before President Bush's now-infamous briefing on possible al Qaeda 

hijacking, Richard Clarke, the government's top counterterrorism 

official, warned that "something spectacular is going to happen here, 

and it's going to happen soon." Unlike the July 10 FBI memo about 

suspicious activity in Arizona flight schools, all this was common 

knowledge within the White House -- and raises the question of why, 

when the President received the report of August 6, he was on a 

"working vacation" at his ranch in Texas.   



<p>"I knew [Osama bin Laden] was a menace and I knew he was a problem," 

Bush later said in a Washington Post interview. "But I didn't feel 

that sense of urgency." 



<p>The indifference of our President in the face of such clear warning 

seems inexplicable. So does his assertion that "never did we realize 

that the enemy was so well organized," that al Qaeda "struck in a way 

that was unimaginable." Rice verified this, saying that "I don't 

think anyone could have predicted that . . . they would try to use an 

airplane as a missile, a hijacked airplane as a missile." But the 

organization of al Qaeda had been demonstrated numerous times, and 

the use of airplanes as bombs imagined. Exactly two years before the 

September 11 attacks, a federal report warned that "suicide bombers 

belonging to al-Qaida's martyrdom battalion could crash-land an 

aircraft packed with high explosives . . . into the Pentagon, the 

headquarters of the CIA, the White House."



<p>Given all this, it is unlikely that any amount of Administration 

resistance will stop the investigations, and it is only a matter of 

time before the press seizes on an FBI budget submitted by Attorney 

General John Ashcroft on September 10.



<p>Coming one day after Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld threatened 

presidential veto of the Senate's proposed diversion of $600 million 

to counterterrorism from ballistic missile defense, Ashcroft's budget 

was decidedly cavalier about the prospect of terrorism. According to 

a February 28 New York Times article, Ashcroft identified over one 

dozen objectives more important than fighting terrorism, and rejected 

an FBI request of $58 million for counterterrorism field agents, 

intelligence analysts, and translators. In fact, he proposed cuts in 

fourteen programs, including a $65 million cut for state and local 

counterterrorism programs. By contrast, counterterrorism spending 

under Janet Reno increased by over 25% from 1999 to 2001.   



<p>The September 10 FBI budget is a perfect symbol of the Bush 

administration's failure to prepare for a wave of terrorism that even 

then was accepted as inevitable and imminent. Their repeated denials 

of specific foreknowledge of September 11 are misleading -- the real 

issue is an irresponsibility bordering on the criminal, akin to a 

landlord who knew his building was going to burn yet failed to buy 

fire extinguishers. Administration backpedaling suddenly looks an 

attempt to cover their tracks. 



<p>This, along with a practical appreciation for the value of a 

dissent-free atmosphere in carrying out policies and retaining power, 

has been the Bush administration's guiding mentality, and it is 

making itself obvious in their rabid attempts to stifle the latest 

debates. It is more than investigation of possible counterterrorism 

oversight that they are resisting. They are resisting the erosion of 

the dissent-free culture of political orthodoxy that has dominated 

this nation's for the last eight months -- and it comes not a moment 

too soon.



<p>The President who couldn't even name the leader of Pakistan has 

embarked on a foreign-policy nightmare. America has allied itself 

with a number of flagrantly undemocratic nations, from Uzbekistan to 

Malaysia. Evidence emerges almost daily of our probable role in an 

aborted coup in Venezuela, while our support of a brutal civil war in 

Columbia resembles the early years of Vietnam. One and a half million 

troops are massed at the India-Pakistan border, ready to plunge the 

Indian subcontinent into chaos. War with Iraq looms. The situation in 

Israel and Palestine threatens to destabilize the entire region, and 

our policies in the Holy Land risk birthing a new generation of 

anti-American terrorists. 



<p>Meanwhile, the Bush administration has revived talk of using nuclear 

weapons on a first-strike basis, overturned the 1972 Anti-Ballistic 

Missile treaty, declined to sign a biological weapons treaty, hid our 

own production of biological weapons, refused to recognize 

International Criminal Court, held up the World Council on Children, 

and -- after rejecting the Kyoto Accords -- replaced the head of the 

International Panel on Climate Change. Domestically, we have an 

energy policy written by the same people responsible for staging an 

energy 'crisis' that cost the state of California $30 billion. The 

denial of public inquiry into the matter was justified with an 

invocation of, more or less, the divine right of kings -- fitting, 

perhaps, given the administration's disregard of the Constitution in 

the name of fighting terrorism.



<p>To top it all off, contrary to Bush's campaign promises, our budget 

deficit is at least $121 billion -- and, according to a note from 

Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill in our government's 2001 financial 

report, it may actually run to <i>half a trillion dollars.</i>



<p>The time has come to lift the star-spangled shroud of silence that 

has hidden the affairs of our nation.
