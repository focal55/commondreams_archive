<p>SAN FRANCISCO -- The conventional wisdom in Washington is that it&#39;s pointless 

or reckless for Americans to speak with Iraqi officials. But some on Capitol Hill 

are beginning to think otherwise. 

<P> Last month, for the first time since George W. Bush became president, members 

of Congress -- four Democrats -- visited Baghdad. Hopefully, more will be making 

the journey later this fall. 

<P> Rep. Nick Rahall, a 13-term congressman from West Virginia, started the trend 

in mid-September when he joined former Sen. James Abourezk of South Dakota to 

lead a small delegation of Americans to Baghdad. As a member of that group, I 

was impressed with the candor of the discussions during several hours of meetings 

with high-level Iraqi government ministers. 

<P> The White House was initially low-key about our trip. But when three more 

congressmen announced they were heading off to visit Iraq last week, the White 

House press secretary swung into action. Eager to throw cold water, Ari Fleischer 

claimed that Mr. Rahall&#39;s visit &quot;did not turn out to be as he hoped it 

would because of the rough treatment he got from the Iraqis, their refusal to 

listen to him, to meet with him, to talk with him.&quot; 

<P> Actually, during face-to-face discussions with &quot;the Iraqis&quot; in Baghdad, 

there was plenty of listening, meeting and talking. As Mr. Rahall noted in an 

interview in The Hill Sept. 25, he repeatedly urged Iraqi officials &quot;to accept 

unconditional and unfettered access to U.N. weapons inspectors.&quot; 

<P> And, what&#39;s more, Mr. Rahall said, &quot;they did not reject my suggestions. 

Tariq Aziz, the deputy prime minister with whom I met for over two hours, said, 

&#39;We will give it careful consideration, we will consult with our friends and 

allies, and I will consult with our leadership.&#39;&quot; 

<P> Some prominent Republicans are now anxious to dampen prospects for future 

U.S.-Iraq dialogues involving members of Congress. On Sunday, when Democratic 

delegation members Rep. Jim McDermott of Washington and Rep. David Bonior of Michigan 

appeared on ABC&#39;s This Week from Baghdad, a senator on the program went after 

Mr. McDermott with rhetorical guns blazing. 

<P> &quot;Basically, he&#39;s taking Saddam Hussein&#39;s line,&quot; said Sen. 

Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the GOP&#39;s assistant leader in the Senate. Mr. Nickles 

added that Mr. McDermott and Mr. Bonior &quot;sound somewhat like spokespersons 

for the Iraqi government.&quot; 

<P> Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi called Mr. McDermott &quot;irresponsible&quot; 

and proclaimed: &quot;He needs to come home and keep his mouth shut.&quot; 

<P> But Mr. McDermott&#39;s retort was on target Monday during a CNN interview 

from Baghdad: &quot;What I would suggest &#91;Mr. Lott&#93; do is get on a Royal 

Jordanian airplane and fly over here and take a look. He is talking from absolute 

ignorance of what&#39;s going on, on the ground. And I think he ought to be a 

little more careful about what he says in a country where we value free speech.&quot; 

<P> The current smears and denunciations from Republican leaders indicate how 

threatening it can be when members of Congress won&#39;t defer to the White House 

on matters of international discourse. 

<P> Generally, lawmakers excel at functioning as rubber stamps or feeble dissenters 

when a president puts war at the top of the national agenda. But senators and 

representatives should move beyond their customary roles in order to breathe life 

into democratic processes and hold open the possibility of peace. 

<P> While President Bush continues to insist that his administration has nothing 

to discuss with the Iraqi regime, dialogue could prove to be crucial. 

<P> Edward L. Peck, a former U.S. chief of mission to Iraq, recently pointed out: 

&quot;Our government is constantly saying that there must be discussions between 

parties in disagreement, to avoid or at least reduce the risk of war: India and 

Pakistan, North and South Korea, the Israelis and the Palestinians, the Protestants 

and the Catholics in Northern Ireland. So why don&#39;t we talk to Iraq?&quot; 

<P> As it happened, two days after our delegation met with Mr. Aziz and Iraqi 

National Assembly Speaker Sadoun Hammadi on Sept. 14, the United Nations announced 

that Iraq had agreed to allow unrestricted access for U.N. weapons inspectors. 

That was a highly positive step that could lead to full inspections and effective 

disarmament in Iraq. 

<P> &quot;It seems to me that if we are going to deal with this in a real and 

honest way, we have got to create dialogue,&quot; Mr. Bonior said during his visit 

to Baghdad. Unless war is their goal, elected officials in Washington should find 

ways to conduct more dialogue with Iraq in the very near future.
