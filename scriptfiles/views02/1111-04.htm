<p>With Republicans in control of the Senate, President Bush will try to fill 

the federal courts with judges from the far right. He has long made it clear that 

he wants to appoint conservative judges in the mold of Supreme Court Justices 

Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas.

<p>For the last two years, the Democrats have blocked the president's most conservative 

nominees in the Senate Judiciary Committee. Now that the Republicans have captured 

the Senate, the Democrats no longer control the committee. They have only one 

way to check the president's ability to pack the federal courts and they must 

use it: the filibuster.

<p>There is ample precedent for filibusters of presidential nominations to executive 

and judicial positions. In fact, Republicans frequently used them during Democratic 

administrations.

<p> During the Clinton presidency, Republicans successfully filibustered and blocked 

the nomination of Henry Foster for surgeon general.

<p>In 1968, South Carolina's Sen. Strom Thurmond filibustered to stop the confirmation 

of Justice Abe Fortas to replace Chief Justice Earl Warren and Judge Homer Thornberry 

to succeed Fortas.

<p>Democratic senators must use the filibuster now to block the most conservative 

of President Bush's judicial nominees for the lower federal courts. Also, it is 

likely that a justice or two may resign from the Supreme Court during the remainder 

of the Bush presidency.

<p>Democrats must use the filibuster, and the threat of the filibuster, to ensure 

that a new justice is not a conservative from the same school as Scalia and Thomas.

<p>An enormous amount is at stake in the judicial confirmation process. A change 

in two votes on the Supreme Court could mean the overruling of Roe vs. Wade and 

a woman's right to reproductive choice. In the years ahead, federal courts will 

be deciding crucial questions concerning the federal government's power to provide 

remedies for civil rights violations, including employment discrimination based 

on race and gender.

<p>Also, the federal courts are the essential and only check against excessive 

government interference with individual rights in the name of the war against 

terrorism.

<p>Indeed, in every area of personal freedom, from freedom of speech to privacy, 

American law and policy will depend on the composition of the courts.

<p>Because the Supreme Court decides only about 75 cases a year, and hears fewer 

than 2% of the cases in which review is requested, who sits on the federal Court 

of Appeals is crucial.

<p>During the Clinton presidency, one of us was informed by the White House counsel's 

office that he was being considered for an appointment to the U.S. Court of Appeals. 

Ultimately, he was told that he could not be appointed because it was thought 

that his public support for affirmative action and reproductive freedom made him 

too liberal to be confirmed by a Republican-controlled Senate.

<p>If outspoken liberals were unacceptable judicial nominees during the Clinton 

administration, then extreme conservatives are equally unsuitable now.

<p>Courageous Democrats in the Senate must announce their intent to use the filibuster 

to prevent a conservative takeover of the federal courts that could last long 

beyond our lifetimes.</p>
