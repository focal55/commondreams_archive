<p>In the last two months, people have begun asking whether the intelligence agencies 

had the information, or should have had the information, needed to prevent the 

Sept. 11 attacks. It is an appropriate question.

<p>It is also a question that should be asked about two other disasters that have 

done enormous damage to the nation: the crashing stock market and the plummeting 

dollar. This week's reports of fraudulent accounting at WorldCom make this question 

all the more urgent.

<p>As a result of the stock market plunge, millions of workers, who had looked 

forward to a comfortable retirement, have seen much of their savings evaporate. 

They will have to either delay their retirement or get by with a far lower standard 

of living. Millions of other families lost much of their children's college funds. 

The dollar's decline will also whack the economy in ways that are just beginning 

to be seen. Most important, it will make it more difficult for the Federal Reserve 

Board to boost the economy from its current slump, thus keeping the unemployment 

rate at high levels. Unlike the Sept. 11 attacks, there is no question that the 

financial disasters were foreseeable--a small group of economists tried to warn 

the public about the dangers of an inflated stock market and overvalued dollar. 

Unfortunately, we were a small minority that was largely ignored. Most economists 

were happy to celebrate the stock market and dollar bubbles as good news.

<p>Politics played a large role in the story, and the blame is bipartisan. The 

Democrats under President Clinton were happy to take credit for the nation's prosperity 

at the end of the 1990s. Although some of the prosperity was real (e.g., the lowest 

unemployment rate in 30 years), the bubble part of it was not. But there was little 

political value in calling attention to this fact. The Republicans did not want 

to burst the bubbles because the illusory prosperity provided the revenue to pay 

for their tax cuts.

<p>Recognizing these bubbles didn't require great insight. For example: To see 

the story of the stock market, imagine that there is a government bond that pays 

$5 interest every year and has always sold on the market for $100. This means 

that the bond pays a 5% return. Now imagine that the price of the bond has been 

bid up to $200. Since the bond still pays just $5 a year in interest, the return 

will have fallen to 2.5%.

<p>Unless people are willing to receive a much lower return on this bond than 

they had in the past, the $200 price will not hold. To escape this logic, profits 

would have to grow far faster than any serious economists projected. Even the 

accounting scandals now being exposed were both predictable and predicted.

<p>In a world in which investors are willing to believe unreal numbers, it is 

inevitable that some will seek to profit by deliberately producing their own unreal 

numbers. But the country did not have to be taken in.

<p>Unfortunately, the economists acted like the accountants at Arthur Andersen 

and said exactly what those with money and power wanted them to say.

<p>The reporters who cover these issues, with few exceptions, acted just like 

the business reporters who repeatedly named Enron one of the nation's top companies: 

They celebrated the bubbles.

<p>Similarly, "strong dollar" became a mantra, with few showing any recognition 

of its implications. In short, the people with responsibility, who should have 

known better, completely failed in their jobs.

<p>But one feature of the "new economy" seems likely to hold through this disaster. 

The people on top, those who were most responsible, will survive relatively unharmed 

by the crashes.

<p>Few economists, economic reporters or market analysts are going to find themselves 

either out of work or facing poverty in their old age. That fate will be reserved 

for the people who listened to their advice. </i></p>
