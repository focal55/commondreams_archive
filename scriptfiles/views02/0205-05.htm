A new media tic -- likening George W. Bush to Franklin D.

Roosevelt -- is already so widespread that it's apt to become a

conditioned reflex of American journalism.



     <p>By now, countless reporters and pundits have proclaimed GWB and FDR

to be kindred inspirational leaders -- wildly inflating the current

president's media stature in the process.



     <p>Hammering on the comparison until it seems like a truism, the

Washington press corps is providing the kind of puffery for the man in

the Oval Office that no ad budget could supply. But the oft-repeated

analogy doesn't only give a monumental boost to Bush's image. It also --

subtly but surely -- chips away at FDR's historic greatness, cutting him

down to GWB's size.



     <p>Ever since Roosevelt's death in April 1945 after more than 12 years

as president, many Republican leaders have sought to move the United

States out from under the enormous political umbrella created by the New

Deal -- bitterly opposed by most wealthy interests and the well-heeled

press.



     <p>Roosevelt's economic reforms embodied and strengthened grassroots

struggles for such basic goals as the right to form unions, collective

bargaining, regulation of business, progressive income tax, federal aid

to the needy and programs like Social Security. These are among the New

Deal legacies that have long been under attack, frontally or sneakily,

from most Republicans and quite a few Democrats in Washington.



     <p>For several decades, the arduous and multifaceted project of

dismantling the New Deal has taken aim at a broad political mindset as

well as specific government policies. Yet, in 2002, FDR's mindset --

fervently shared by many millions of Americans -- is scarcely

discernible through today's media fog.



     <p>The more that reporters, commentators and media-selected historians

join the chorus linking Bush with Roosevelt -- as if FDR's domestic

agenda and his underlying values scarcely merit a mention -- the more

that the actual FDR fades into the mist.



    <p> But -- moving beyond facile analogies between Dec. 7, 1941 and

Sept. 11, 2001 -- we should realize that the real Franklin Delano

Roosevelt spoke in ways that would horrify George W. Bush.



    <p> "No business which depends for existence by paying less than living

wages to its workers has any right to continue in this country,"

President Roosevelt declared in June 1933, a few months after taking

office.



     <p>Campaigning for re-election in 1936, he did not search for common

ground with the corporate giants of the day. One of his speeches noted

that big business and finance were "unanimous in their hate for me --

and I welcome their hatred."



    <p> FDR did not stop there. He added: "I should like to have it said of

my first administration that in it the forces of selfishness and of lust

for power met their match; I would like to have it said of my second

administration that in it these forces met their master."



    <p> After five years of his presidency, in a formal message proposing

an investigation of monopoly in the nation, Roosevelt said: "The liberty

of a democracy is not safe if the people tolerate the growth of private

power to a point where it becomes stronger than their democratic State

itself. That, in its essence, is Fascism -- ownership of government by

an individual, by a group, or any controlling private power."



     <p>Across America today, there are seniors who watch George W. Bush on

television, hear the media prattle of ludicrous comparisons with

Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and think: "I remember FDR. And this guy's no

FDR. No way."



     <p>We wouldn't know it from the array of major news outlets mired in

subservience to the White House spin machine and overall big-money

perspectives, but President Franklin Roosevelt was resolute about

directly confronting rich elites and corporate titans. He lambasted them

as "economic royalists."



     <p>Roosevelt matched his rhetoric with action. When he said that "the

citizens of the United States must effectively control the mighty

commercial forces which they have themselves called into being," FDR

meant it.



     <p>Perhaps it would be gratuitously unkind to compare the intellects

and depth of the two presidents. Bush has proved smart enough to fulfill

his ambition of living in the White House while serving this era's

economic royalists. That GWB has just about zilch in common with FDR

should be self-evident.



     <p>Whatever parallels may exist between Pearl Harbor and the World

Trade Center, for the two presidents they signify little more than

circumstantial similarities. Journalists might provide more illumination

by exploring similarities between Bush and Rutherford B. Hayes -- who

also managed to become president after winning fewer popular votes than

his rival but gaining enough disputed electoral votes to prevail.



<p>Political reporters and commentators are proud of being "serious"

journalists, in contrast to entertainment-driven and celebrity-fixated

media professionals. But the current craze of touting George W. Bush as

comparable to FDR is grimly laughable.
