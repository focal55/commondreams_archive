When polled, people are not asked if they are inspired, challenged or uplifted 

by Bush – they are asked if they approve. Like a test screening of a movie searching 

for an ending, audiences are asked what they want to see and hear. Like a child 

who loves a parent who serves fudge as the main course America approves of Bush. 

<p>Apologists for Bush say that he is smart and even if he isn’t he doesn’t need 

to be - that his rabble rousing is the purpose of a president - that he is there 

to reflect not guide or transform the energy of the people. He is meant to preside 

over the drama but not really interfere with or elevate it. By doing what the 

apologists say he must do, not that he has shown to be capable of anything else, 

Bush wins approval. 

<p>He in fact percolates popular paranoia. He senses and generates fear and uses 

it. He will give America a military that can protect its interests but not its 

citizens. He will point to enemies - out there - encouraging the cozy insulation 

of xenophobia – creating the eerie warmth of being huddled in our own cave ready 

to support the long arm of superpower expansion masquerading as superpower justice. 

As he insults and provokes in our name for reasons that are covert, convoluted 

and Carlyle, he is met with approval. 

<p>The purpose of an inspiring leader is not to catalogue the common and predictable 

impulses of people and then canonize them as noble and coherent policy. A leader 

should lift the agenda and the people. A leader should usher his people through 

the canyons of evolution. To diminish the role of a leader to a kind of chairman 

of the board who anticipates and exploits public appetites is to put America and 

the world in peril. 

<p>The death penalty, which is history in all European countries, is the exaltation 

of an understandable and base impulse. Born again Bush pushed and believed in 

the death penalty to such an extent that he became known as governor death. The 

crowded death row and steady rate of murder in Texas show how effective the death 

penalty has been as a deterrent. But even a failed philosophy is held on to if 

it meets with approval. 

<p>The American military was useless in the face of 9/11. In fact, it can be convincingly 

argued that previous, pervasive and perhaps threatened use of the American military 

contributed to the criminal assault. In response America used the same military 

to strike back convincing us that they had the right target even though it was 

only the first target. 

<p>Other than making most of America feel good, the widely broadcast military 

response, which everyone said was the something we had to do, has done nothing 

to resolve the conflicts that feed the pathology that fuels the violence. To be 

told that we’ve had a great victory and at the same time we are more vulnerable 

to attack bears this out. Victory that doesn’t bring security or peace is not 

victory. Our bombs killed a lot of people and generated the need for more bombs 

and more homeland defense, and well-groomed people stand in front of cameras and 

tell us how well the war is going, and we approve. 

<p>Like a smoker with lung cancer adding another pack of cigarettes to his habit, 

Bush increases the military budget. And as he paints a bigger bulls eye on all 

of us every time he speaks from the platform he usurped from us, we are asked, 

do you approve? Although we see high percentages the approval feels like confused 

and numbed acceptance. 

<p>So we wait – like a city on a fault line - plates beneath the earth shift according 

to increased stress, and when no one expects it, an act of terror like an earthquake 

will hit. And Bush will have another window to continue the cycle and win approval. 

He and his handlers trashed our democracy in 2000; insulted international endeavors 

and agreements in 2001; and in 2002 he waves a red flag in front of countries 

he is informed about but about which he knows very little. And America approves. 

<p>Someone who both personifies and manipulates the collective reflexes can be 

approved of. Will he change the world for the better – will he develop a solution 

or adjust the landscape on which the world has battled and bled for years? Will 

he liberate the human condition from the insane paradigm that has kept us landlocked 

and earthbound? Someone who will give the simplistic predictable rush to a population 

hungry for easy words and sentimental, chauvinistic assurances will win approval. 

But he will never win the peace.
