<p> This is what terror feels like. A year ago, after 9/11, we asked why they 

hate us. Today, we ask why we hate ourselves.</p>

<p>On Oct. 28, a student at the University of Arizona shot and killed three professors 

and then killed himself. Robert S. Flores happens to be a Gulf War veteran, like 

John Allen Muhammad, the alleged Beltway sniper, and like executed Oklahoma City 

bomber Timothy McVeigh.</p>

<p>In interviews shortly before his death, McVeigh, speaking of Iraq, said, &quot;What 

right did I have to come over to this person's country and kill him? How did he 

ever transgress against me?&quot; He also said he became personally disillusioned 

with the opportunities he received after failing a test to join the Special Forces. 

By the age of 24, McVeigh was honorably discharged, disgruntled and dangerous.</p>

<p>Why did they do it? Flores is dead, and Muhammad isn't talking. At least one 

columnist has tried to blame Muhammad's spree on hip-hop. And while I'd hesitate 

to blame the military for producing these three killers, we should at least ask 

if their anger had any commonality. This whole country seems to be on the verge 

of a nervous breakdown, tracking terror-sprees on television and watching friends 

and family lose jobs. But, few people with free-floating anxiety turn towards 

murderous rage, or have the skills and weapons to act it out.</p>

<p>For Gulf War veterans, today's talk of war must seem like an unwanted flashback. 

Anna Quindlen's compilation of columns from the New York Times contains articles 

about the war buildup in 1990 that could have been written today. Military recruiters 

visit housing projects and farm-town high schools, not college-prep academies. 

Nineteen-year-olds who thought they'd entered something akin to a military jobs 

program ended up being sent, to their surprise, to combat.</p>

<p>In a theater recently, I saw an advertisement showing recruits climbing a virtual 

mountain of good deeds - helping feed poor people in other countries, planting 

the flag, doing everything but killing.</p>

<p>Packing up to leave your country is like cutting your umbilical cord. Yet, 

even as they left to fight, some Gulf War soldiers questioned why they were going 

to war. And then it was over, so very quickly.</p>

<p>Did Flores, Muhammad and McVeigh bring the war home with them?</p>

                  <p>We can't stomach what our veterans have seen. 

                    At the start of the &quot;war on terror&quot; last year, some 

                    newspapers refused to put pictures of dead Afghan civilians 

                    in their pages to avoid upsetting readers. Indeed. And how 

                    did the images upset the soldiers who saw the carnage? Whether 

                    veterans participated in actual combat or not, they surely 

                    knew what was going on at the front, on the burning roads. 

                  </p>

                  <p>Even in our violence-saturated culture, we gloss 

                    over the true face of death. Unlike some European networks, 

                    our television media show extended, almost reverent shots 

                    of bombs dropping, but not the dead bodies that bombing produces.</p>

                  

<p>It's a soldier's job to kill without feeling. These rogue veterans, did they 

feel when they killed? Can we who sit and watch at home even feel anymore? On 

CNN, a witness to one of the Beltway shootings said, &quot;It was like a video 

game.&quot;</p>

                  

<p>A Japanese child psychologist once told me, &quot;I feel sorry for children 

today. All they have is virtual emotions.&quot; Life equals video game. Death 

equals game over. Restart. Press play.</p>

<p>We wish. </p>
