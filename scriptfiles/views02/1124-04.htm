<p> SOUTH POMFRET, Vt. -- It was California's own Hiram Johnson who said, in a 

speech on the Senate floor in 1917, that "the first casualty, when war comes, 

is truth."

<p>What would he make of the Bush administration?

<p>In a policy shift that reaches across all the armed services, Secretary of 

Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld and his senior aides are revising missions and creating 

new agencies to make "information warfare" a central element of any U.S. war. 

Some hope it will eventually rank with bombs and artillery shells as an instrument 

of destruction.

<p> What is disturbing about Rumsfeld's vision of information warfare is that 

it has a way of folding together two kinds of wartime activity involving communications 

that have traditionally been separated by a firewall of principle.

<p>The first is purely military. It includes attacks on the radar, communications 

and other "information systems" an enemy depends on to guide its war-making capabilities. 

This category also includes traditional psychological warfare, such as dropping 

leaflets or broadcasting propaganda to enemy troops.

<p>The second is not directly military. It is the dissemination of public information 

that the American people need in order to understand what is happening in a war, 

and to decide what they think about it. This information is supposed to be true.

<p>Increasingly, the administration's new policy -- along with the steps senior 

commanders are taking to implement it -- blurs or even erases the boundaries between 

factual information and news, on the one hand, and public relations, propaganda 

and psychological warfare, on the other. And, while the policy ostensibly targets 

foreign enemies, its most likely victim will be the American electorate.

<p>One of Rumsfeld's first steps into this minefield occurred last year with the 

creation of the Pentagon's Office of Strategic Influence. Part of its stated mission 

was to generate disinformation and propaganda that would help the United States 

counter Islamic extremists and pursue the war on terrorism.

<p>The office's nominal target was the foreign media, especially in the Middle 

East and Asia. As critics soon pointed out, however, there was no way -- in an 

age of instant global communications -- that Washington could propagandize abroad 

without that same propaganda spreading to the home front.

<p>Faced with a public outcry, Rumsfeld declared it had all been a big misunderstanding. 

The Pentagon would never lie to Americans. The Office of Strategic Influence was 

shut down. But the impulse to control public information and bend it to the service 

of government objectives did not go away.

<p>This fall, Rumsfeld created a new position of deputy undersecretary for "special 

plans," a euphemism for deception operations. The special plans policy czar will 

sit atop a huge new infrastructure being created in the name of information warfare.

<p>On Oct. 1, in a little-noticed but major reorganization, U.S. Strategic Command 

took over all responsibilities for global information attacks. The Omaha-based 

successor to the Strategic Air Command has solely focused up to now on nuclear 

weapons.

<p>Similarly, the country's most venerable and historic bombing command, the 8th 

Air Force, which carried the air war to Germany in World War II, has been directed 

to transfer its bomber and fighter aircraft to other commands so that it can focus 

exclusively on worldwide information attacks.

<p>The Navy, meanwhile, has consolidated its efforts in a newly formed Naval Network 

Warfare Command. And the Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan, or JSCP, prepared 

by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, now declares information to be just as important 

in war as diplomatic, military or economic factors.

<p>The strategic capabilities plan is the central war-fighting directive for the 

U.S. military. It establishes what are called "Informational Flexible Deterrent 

Options" for global wars, such as the war on terrorism, and separate plans written 

for individual theaters of war, such as Iraq.

<p>To a large extent, these documents and the organizational shifts behind them 

are focused on such missions as jamming or deceiving enemy radar systems and disrupting 

command and control networks. Such activities only carry forward efforts that 

have been part of U.S. military tactics for decades or longer.

<p>But a summary of the strategic capabilities plan and a raft of other Pentagon 

and armed forces documents made available to The Times make it clear that the 

new approach now includes other elements as well: the management of public information, 

efforts to control news media sources and manipulation of public opinion.

<p>The plan summary, for instance, talks of "strategic" deception and "influence 

operations" as basic tools in future wars. According to another Defense Department 

directive on information warfare policy, military leaders should use information 

"operations" to "heighten public awareness; promote national and coalition policies, 

aims, and objectives ... &#91;and&#93; counter adversary propaganda and disinformation 

in the news."

<p>Both the Air Force and the Navy now list deception as one of five missions 

for information warfare, along with electronic attack, electronic protection, 

psychological . attacks and public affairs. A September draft of a new Air Force 

policy describes information warfare's goals as "destruction, degradation, denial, 

disruption, deceit, and exploitation." These goals are referred to collectively 

as "D5E."

<p>In order to do a better job of deception, the joint chiefs have issued a "Joint 

Policy for Military Deception" that directs the individual services to work on 

the task in peacetime as well as wartime. Specifically, it orders the Air Force 

to develop better doctrine and techniques for incorporating deception into war 

plans.

<p>The Air Force, in response, now defines military deception as action that "misleads 

adversaries, causing them to act in accordance with" U.S. objectives. And, like 

the other services, it is increasingly folding its "public affairs" apparatus 

-- that is, the open world of media relations -- into the information warfare 

team.

<p>"Gaining and maintaining the information initiative in a conflict can be a 

powerful weapon to defeat propaganda," the Air Force said in its January doctrine.

<p>That echoes a statement by Navy Rear Adm. John Cryer III, who worked on information 

warfare in the Combined Air Operations Center in Saudi Arabia during the Afghanistan 

war: "It was our belief ... we were losing the information war early when we watched 

Al Jazeera," Cryer said at an October conference, meaning that the U.S. perspective 

was inadequately represented on the Arab world's equivalent of CNN. "We came around, 

but it took a lot longer than it should have."

<p>Of course there is nothing wrong with making sure the U.S. point of view gets 

represented in the news media, both abroad and at home. Done properly, that is 

a prescription for more openness and less unnecessary secrecy.

<p>The problem is that Rumsfeld's vision of information warfare seems to push 

beyond the notion that American ideas and information should compete with the 

enemy's on a level playing field. And Rumsfeld's vision, with its melding of public 

information and deception, is taking root in the armed services.

<p>The new Air Force doctrine, for example, declares that the news media can be 

used not only to convey "the leadership's concern with &#91;an&#93; issue," but 

also to avoid "the media going to other sources &#91;such as an adversary or critic 

of U.S. policy&#93; for information." In other words, information warfare now 

includes controlling as much as possible what the American public sees and reads.

<p>The disinformation campaign being constructed goes against even the military's 

own stated mission. Truthfulness, the Air Force says, is a key to defeating adversaries. 

Accordingly, the service branch adds, "U.S. and friendly forces must strive to 

become the favored source of information."

<p>The potential for mischief is magnified by the fact that so much of what the 

U.S. military does these days falls into the category of covert operations. Americans 

are now operating out of secret bases in places like Uzbekistan and the Kurdish 

enclave in northern Iraq; Special Forces units are said to be inside western Iraq 

as well. In the meantime, the armed forces are making use of facilities in the 

Arab states along the Persian Gulf.

<p>In all these cases and more, the U.S. and other western news media depend on 

the military for information. Since reporters cannot travel into parts of Iraq 

and other places in the region without military escort, what they report is generally 

what they've been told.

<p>And when the information that military officers provide to the public is part 

of a process that generates propaganda and places a high value on deceit, deception 

and denial, then truth is indeed likely to be high on the casualty list.

<p>That is bad news for the American public. In the end, it may be even worse 

news for the Bush administration -- and for a U.S. military that has spent more 

than 25 years climbing out of the credibility trap called Vietnam.</p>
