<p>It's difficult to think of anything more manifestly stupid, not to mention 

dangerous, than the Bush administration's plans to launch a war with Iraq. Dress 

it up in whatever language you please -- "regime change" is the current term of 

choice among administration hard-hats -- the announced intent to topple the government 

of Saddam Hussein and rid the Middle East of this despot is about as inane as 

anything the government of the United States has proposed to do in the past year 

or so. And that, in itself, is saying a lot.</p>

<p>To dispense with the outcries from the right, on one matter there is no argument: 

Saddam is not a nice person. He has used poisoned gas in attacks on the Kurdish 

people in northern Iraq and launched Scud missiles against Israelis during the 

war with Kuwait. He is in a prolonged feud with the United Nations because he 

persists in research on, and presumably the production of, other chemical and 

biological weapons; he has already demonstrated he has no compunction about using 

them. </p>

<p>If he had a nuclear device or access to one, he would likely set it off without 

a moment's hesitation. His presence on the political scene in the Middle East 

is not one that would be missed by peace-loving people.</p>

<p>This having been said, we are compelled to take note of several other matters. 

First, if getting rid of rogues with a fascination with weapons of mass destruction 

is a criterion for launching regime changes, there are a number of other candidates 

who deserve critical attention.</p>

<p>Some are unknown -- such as the shadowy figures in the former Soviet Union 

who are alleged to be able to put their hands on that country's huge and poorly 

guarded nuclear weapons stockpile. Others are on the list of this country's continuously 

floating crap-game of allies (on the list in one moment, off the next). Among 

them is the president of Pakistan, who is now a favorite in Washington because 

he supports our war against the Taliban -- a government that this time last year 

his country enthusiastically supported.</p>

<p>Second, if the rules of international relations have been changed so that we 

can go around ousting whichever governments we don't happen to like, we shall 

have to recognize that we are not the only ones who want to play this game. Effecting 

a regime change is exactly what the fanatics in Islam want to accomplish, only 

the regime they want to topple is the United States and what they consider its 

morally decadent Western culture and values.</p>

<p>But the main reason all the rhetoric of the past several months is so outlandish 

is its apparent assumption that Saddam is an idiot. Are we to suppose that -- 

while the media carry almost daily accounts of war plans being drawn up, troop 

estimates made, allies enlisted and announcements issued, all signaling our intent 

to invade Iraq, march on Baghdad and bring about Saddam's demise -- he is just 

sitting there, twiddling his thumbs and wondering when or where the first bomb 

is going to drop?</p>

<p>Has there ever been a nation before in all of history so confident of the superiority 

of its cause and its power -- and so willing to dismissively consider the "collateral 

damage" that its action would entail -- that it advertised for months in advance 

its bellicose intent? (One does come to mind, but I dare not mention it.)</p>

<p>It is of more than passing interest that the war-drum beating regarding Saddam 

and Iraq has had an inverse relation to the Dow-Jones Industrial Average; as the 

latter has plummeted, the former has intensified. George W. Bush wouldn't be the 

first national leader to launch a war that effectively managed to divert attention 

from a shattered economy, a level of public distrust regarding business and political 

leadership that is palpable and a sense of national malaise of growing proportion.</p>

<p>So, I would keep an eye on the stock market over the months ahead. (If I were 

Saddam, I'd do the same). It may be the best indicator of if and when this insane 

campaign against Iraq is launched.</p>
