<p>One of the definitions of slick is "deftly executed; adroit." Synonyms include 

"sly, shrewd, slippery, wily." These words came to mind as I watched the Republican 

Party's remarkable off-year election triumph last week. Give credit where it's 

due. Bill Clinton at his most devious was never as sly or as cunning (or as politically 

effective) as the Republican Party has become.</p>

<P> I think of the G.O.P. as the costume party. It wears a sunny mask, which conceals 

a reality that is far more ideological, far more extreme, than most Americans 

realize.</p>

<P> Among the less meaningful questions being asked in Washington is whether the 

Republicans, having won control of the Senate and strengthened their hold on the 

House, will now go too far and outpace their mandate. My question is: Where have 

you been? In a nation that is divided almost 50-50 politically, the Republicans 

flew past their mandate a long time ago.</p>

<P> Driven by its right wing and aided immeasurably by George W. Bush's genial 

smile, the G.O.P. is putting in place profoundly conservative policies that will 

hamper progressive efforts for decades to come, no matter what happens in upcoming 

elections.</p>

<P> With the help of Democrats who should have known better, the Republicans have 

already enacted a huge and potentially hazardous round of tax cuts. In an environment 

in which budget deficits have returned and war appears to be imminent, common 

sense would seem to suggest that the government tread softly on tax cuts for the 

time being. But a key element of the G.O.P. agenda in the immediate aftermath 

of last week's stunning victories was a plan to make the current tax cuts permanent 

and enact a new package of cuts.</p>

<P> There is a method to the G.O.P.'s tax cut madness, beyond the obvious benefits 

to the very rich. Conservatives have long reasoned that the only way to destroy 

popular programs that actually help ordinary Americans (Social Security, Medicare 

and so on) is to starve the government of the money needed to pay for them.</p>

<P> The intensity of the conservative opposition to such programs can be startling. 

To Ronald Reagan, for example, Medicare was an affront to the very idea of America. 

The historian Robert Dallek noted that Mr. Reagan "saw Medicare as the advance 

wave of socialism, which would `invade every area of freedom in this country.' 

"</p>

<P> During a budget fight in the mid-90's, Newt Gingrich, apparently referring 

to the original fee-for-service version of Medicare, which had become cherished 

by the elderly, wisecracked: "We don't get rid of it in Round One because we don't 

think it's politically smart."</p>

<P> The way to cripple such programs without openly opposing them is to bleed 

the government of the money to pay for them. With the prospect of budget deficits 

stretching far into the future, and with the first wave of baby boomers already 

well into their 50's, the day of reckoning for Social Security and Medicare is 

not far off.</p>

<P> The right wing of the G.O.P. has also proved itself hostile to environmental 

protection, and to the myriad health and safety regulations that protect Americans 

against poisonous foods and other dangerous products and practices. One of its 

most important leaders in those fights, Representative Tom DeLay, will now ascend 

to the post of House majority leader.</p>

<P> How extreme is Mr. DeLay? When the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to 

the discoverers of the link between chlorofluorocarbons and ozone depletion, Mr. 

DeLay mocked the award as the "Nobel Appeasement Prize."</p>

<P> And then there are the federal courts, which are being packed by conservatives 

from coast to coast, with the big prize &#0151; appointments to the Supreme Court 

&#0151; still to come.</p>

<P> Over the next couple of years as many as three (or more) Supreme Court vacancies 

could open, which could determine the direction of the court for the next 30 years. 

President Bush has made it clear that he favors justices in the mode of Clarence 

Thomas and Antonin Scalia. With two more justices like that, progressive government 

would be caught in the devastating trap of a right-wing assault from all sides 

&#0151; the White House, the Congress and the courts &#0151; with the Treasury 

drained of all money for new initiatives.</p>

<P> Slick? Adroit? Any number of adjectives will do. How about dangerous?&#0160;
