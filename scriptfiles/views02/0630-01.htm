<p>WHEN Samuel Johnson said that patriotism was the last refuge of scoundrels, 

he probably wasn't thinking of crocheted Stars and Stripes doilies or a Kate Spade 

bag in red, white and blue. For anyone who wants to flaunt American colors this 

Independence Day there's plenty more where that came from -- Ralph Lauren's limited 

edition flag teddy bear (a steal at &#163;530), for instance, or Tupperware's 

Fourth of July dessert cups. America: A Patriotic Primer, a new best-selling children's 

title by Lynne Cheney, wife of vice- president Dick Cheney, is flying off the 

shelves in bookshops across the country. Meanwhile newspapers run adverts for 

Longs Drugs, a US institution: 'We will be open on July 4!' they shriek. American 

shops are crammed with more sentimental patriotic schlock than for any Independence 

Day in living memory. Inside one of Longs' huge shops, gaudy Christmas-like decorations 

are draped from aisle to aisle -- red, white and blue, of course -- and stacked 

at the front are boxes of Marshmallow Peeps: star-shaped, artificially flavored 

and flecked with yet more red, white and blue. 

<p>For many, however -- especially in New York -- July 4 will be solemn this year, 

especially with the FBI's warning of a possible terrorist attack. But anyone wanting 

to get out of the city can still fly the flag: why not head to the beach with 

a Mickey Mouse Americana shoulder bag and a Stars and Stripes deck chair, towel 

and bikini?

<p>Of course, not everything is actually so glowingly good. Consumer and investor 

optimism have hit an all-time low in the months since the attacks, confidence 

in government is down, and there is almost daily news about more fraudulent behavior 

on the part of yet another erstwhile success story. WorldCom admits to &#163;2.5 

billion in hidden expenses just as doubts are being raised about the role of Martha 

Stewart, the home decorating guru and billionairess, in the ImClone insider trading 

scandal.

<p>According to a new study by the University of Illinois, nearly half of US public 

libraries surveyed said the FBI or another government agency had requested details 

of borrower records in the past 10 months. Such information can be gathered under 

the controversial Patriot Act, which critics say curtails civil rights. Meanwhile 

satisfaction with the way things are going in the United States has fallen to 

52%, according to pollsters Gallup. After September 11 the measure jumped, reaching 

a pre-Christmas high of 70%. The current level is a post-attack low.

<p>But if the gung-ho patriotism is only skin-deep, it doesn't mean the good citizens 

of America are turning internationalist, or that they have been humbled in the 

face of seemingly intractable problems such as the Middle East or global warming. 

On the contrary, cinemas are showing feelgood movies such as The Sum Of All Fears, 

which stars Ben Affleck and Morgan Freeman as agents hunting down terrorists planning 

to detonate a nuclear device at the Super Bowl. And two particularly patriotic 

films -- last year's war epic Pearl Harbor and the Independence Day musical 1776 

-- are coming to DVD just in time for the glorious Fourth.

<p>Even the New York fire and police departments -- fashion labels of choice since 

September 11 -- have officially plunged into American-sized selling. For the first 

time, salesmen for merchandise licensed by the city departments turned up at a 

trade show this last week.

<p>

<p>Independence Day, the most patriotic of American holidays, has always been 

a time to buy cut-price garden furniture, barbecue grills and swimsuits, to get 

drunk or to jaw about the price of gas for the summer car holiday. There are family 

'cookouts' with hot dogs, macaroni, watermelon and ice cream.

<p>Even the smallest towns have a fireworks displays and Fourth of July parade 

with girls in red, white and blue sequined outfits twirling batons. And there's 

always someone dressed as Uncle Sam. This year the crowds at public events -- 

parades, concerts and firework displays -- are expected to be larger than at any 

time since the Bicentennial in 1976. 

<p>Security will be tighter than ever before too: FBI offices around the country 

are already on high alert -- and, with more than one million people expected in 

Philadelphia, where the Declaration of Independence was signed, gun-toting police 

are to guard historic landmarks such as the Liberty Bell. In Boston, a crowd of 

more than 500,000 people is expected and access to events will be restricted. 

Hey, even the coolers holding the beer will be searched.

<p>New York's official event will be a far larger and notably more solemn occasion 

than usual. New mayor Michael Bloomberg has had to lift a fireworks ban, in place 

since September 11, for an event billed A Time For Heroes. More than 20,000 fireworks 

will be set off from barges moored in the East River.

<p>'There is a surge of real patriotism in America. Heroism has been redefined 

for many of us and liberty and freedom have a new immediacy,' explains Robin Hall, 

the event organizer. 'Given what is going on in the world, this will be a very 

special year for our fireworks, because the true meaning of the celebration will 

resonate more with people.'

<p>In Washington, a double fence is being thrown up around the Mall, a huge grassy 

area from where picnicking crowds will watch the capital's official fireworks 

display. The widows of the generals killed in the September 11 attack on the Pentagon 

will review the festivities -- but revelers will have to pass through checkpoints 

first.

<p>

<p>Oddly enough, a ruckus over patriotism broke out last week -- not because of 

the tone of the celebrations but because an appeals court ruled that one of America's 

most beloved institutions, the Pledge of Allegiance, was illegal. The phrase 'under 

one God', part of the pledge chanted by children at the start of each school day 

across America, violates the constitutional separation of church and state, ruled 

the court at the culmination of a suit brought by an atheist father. 'God-Awful!' 

screamed the conservative New York Post, which is selling 'Land of the Free, Home 

of the Brave' T-shirts and mugs.

<p>On CNN, news anchor Connie Chung could barely contain herself when she interviewed 

the godless father himself, one Michael Newdew. 'Are you proud to be an American?' 

she asked, her voice dripping with poison. 'Aren't you concerned about the impact 

on your daughter?'

<p>This July 4, with patriotism and commercialism as central to the American way 

as ever, the Land of Hype and Glory is in full swing. There are some lower notes 

too, as might befit an America at war. Nowhere is that clearer than in Baton Rouge, 

Louisiana. The city has cancelled its mock second world war air-sea battle on 

the Mississippi River, a fixture for the last 15 Independence Days. The wargames, 

said the city fathers, would be too much of a reminder of the real thing.
