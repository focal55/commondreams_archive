<p>They came for Hussain Abdul Qadir on 25 May. According to his wife, there were 

three American agents from the FBI and 25 men from the local Pakistani CID. The 

Palestinian family had lived in the Pakistani city of Peshawar for years and had 

even applied for naturalization.</p>

<p>But this was not a friendly visit to their home in Hayatabad Street. "They 

broke our main gate and came into the house without any respect," Mrs Abdul Qadir 

was to report later to the director of human rights at Pakistan's Ministry of 

Law and Justice in Islamabad.</p>

<p>"They blindfolded my husband and tied his hands behind his back. They searched 

everything in the house &#150; they took our computer, mobile phone and even our 

land-line phone. They took video and audio cassettes. They took all our important 

documents &#150; our passports and other certificates &#150; and they took our 

money too," she said.</p>

<p>Where, Mrs Abdul Qadir asked Ahsan Akhtar, the director of human rights, was 

her husband? <i>The Independent</i> has now learnt exactly where he is &#150; 

he is a prisoner in a cage on the huge American air base at Bagram in Afghanistan. 

He was kidnapped &#150; there appears to be no other word for it &#150; by the 

Americans and simply flown over the international frontier from Pakistan. His 

"crime" is unknown. He has no lawyers to defend him. In the vacuum of the US "war 

on terror", Mr Abdul Qadir has become a non-person.</p>

<p>His wife has now received a single sheet of paper from the Red Cross which 

gives no geographical location for the prisoner but lists his nationality as "Palastainian" 

(sic) and the following message in poorly written Arabic: "To the family and children 

in Peshawar. I am well and need, first and foremost, God's mercy and then your 

prayers. Take care of your faith and be kind to the little ones. Could you send 

me my reading glasses? Your father: Hussain Abdul Qadir."</p>

<p>The sheet of paper is dated 29 June and the Red Cross has confirmed that the 

prisoner &#150; ICRC number AB7 001486-01 &#150; was interviewed in Bagram.</p>

<p>Needless to say, the Americans will give no information about their prisoners 

or the reasons for their detention. They will not say whether their interrogators 

are Afghan or American &#150; there are increasing rumors that Afghan interrogators 

are allowed to beat prisoners in the presence of CIA men &#150; or if, or when, 

they intend to release their captives. Indeed, the Americans will not even confirm 

that prisoners have been seized in Pakistan and taken across the Afghan border.</p>

<p>Fatima Youssef has also complained to the Pakistani authorities that her Syrian 

husband, Manhal al-Hariri &#150; a school director working for the Saudi Red Crescent 

Society &#150; was seized on the same night as Mr Abdul Qadir from their home 

in Peshawar, again by three Americans and a group of Pakistani CID men.</p>

<p>"I have the right to ask where my husband is and to know where they have taken 

him," she has written to the Pakistani authorities. "I have the right to ask for 

an appeal to release him now, after an interrogation, I have the right to ask 

for the return of the things which they took from my house."</p>

<p>An Algerian doctor, Bositta Fathi, was also taken that same night by two Americans 

and Pakistani forces, according to his wife. "I don't have any support and I am 

not able to go anywhere without my husband," she has told Mr Akhtar in Islamabad. 

Both Mr Hariri and Dr Fathi are believed to be held at Bagram, which is now the 

main American interrogation center in Afghanistan. "From there," one humanitarian 

worker told <i>The Independent</i>, "you either get released or packed off to 

Guantanamo. Who knows what the fate of these people is or what they are supposed 

to have done? It seems that it's all outside the law."</p>

<p>Many Arabs moved to Peshawar during the war against the Russians in Afghanistan 

and remained there as doctors or aid workers. The Abdul Qadirs, for example, asked 

for naturalization. in January 1993 &#150; Mr Abdul Qadir holds a Jordanian passport 

&#150; long before Osama bin Laden returned to Afghanistan and founded his al-Qa'ida 

movement.</p>

<p>"I don't know why all this happened to us because we are Muslims and Arabs," 

Mrs Abdul Qadir says. "I want to know about my husband. We will leave Pakistan 

if the government wants us to leave. We will do anything the government wants 

but in a human and civilized manner."</p>

<p>* At least 15 people have been killed in a shoot-out between Afghan police 

and what witnesses said was a group of Arabs and Pakistanis south of Kabul yesterday. 

Omar Samad, a foreign ministry spokesman described the gang as "determined and 

suicidal".</p>
