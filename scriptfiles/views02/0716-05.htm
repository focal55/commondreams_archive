<p>Why are George W. Bush's business dealings relevant? Given that his aides tout 

his "character," the public deserves to know that he became wealthy entirely through 

patronage and connections. But more important, those dealings foreshadow many 

characteristics of his administration, such as its obsession with secrecy and 

its intermingling of public policy with private interest. </p>

<P> As the unanswered questions about Harken Energy pile up — what's in those 

documents the White House won't release? Who was the mystery buyer of Mr. Bush's 

stock? — let me now turn to how Mr. Bush, who got by with a lot of help from his 

friends in the 1980's, became wealthy in the 1990's. He invested $606,000 as part 

of a syndicate that bought the Texas Rangers baseball team in 1989 — borrowing 

the money and repaying the loan with the proceeds from his Harken stock sale — 

then saw that grow to $14.9 million over the next nine years. What made his investment 

so successful?</p>

<P> First, the city of Arlington built the Rangers a new stadium, on terms extraordinarily 

favorable to Mr. Bush's syndicate, eventually subsidizing Mr. Bush and his partners 

with more than $150 million in taxpayer money. The city was obliged to raise taxes 

substantially as a result. Soon after the stadium was completed, Mr. Bush ran 

successfully for governor of Texas on the theme of self-reliance rather than reliance 

on government. </p>

<P> Mr. Bush's syndicate eventually resold the Rangers, for triple the original 

price. The price-is-no-object buyer was a deal maker named Tom Hicks. And thereby 

hangs a tale. </p>

<P> The University of Texas, though a state institution, has a large endowment. 

As governor, Mr. Bush changed the rules governing that endowment, eliminating 

the requirements to disclose "all details concerning the investments made and 

income realized," and to have "a well-recognized performance measurement service" 

assess investment results. That is, government officials no longer had to tell 

the public what they were doing with public money, or allow an independent performance 

assessment. Then Mr. Bush "privatized" (his term) $9 billion in university assets, 

transferring them to a nonprofit corporation known as Utimco that could make investment 

decisions behind closed doors.</p>

<P> In effect, the money was put under the control of Utimco's chairman: Tom Hicks. 

Under his direction, at least $450 million was invested in private funds managed 

by Mr. Hicks's business associates and major Republican Party donors. The managers 

of such funds earn big fees. Due to Mr. Bush's change in the rules, these investments 

were hidden from public view; an employee of Utimco who alerted university auditors 

was summarily fired. Even now, it's hard to find out how these investments turned 

out, though they seem to have done quite badly. </p>

<P> Eventually Mr. Hicks's investment style created a public furor, and he did 

not seek to retain his position at Utimco when his term expired in 1999.</p>

<P> One last item: Mr. Bush, who put up 1.8 percent of the Rangers syndicate's 

original capital, was entitled to about $2.3 million from that sale. But his partners 

voluntarily gave up some of their share, and Mr. Bush received 12 percent of the 

proceeds — $14.9 million. So a group of businessmen, presumably with some interest 

in government decisions, gave a sitting governor a $12 million gift. Shouldn't 

that have raised a few eyebrows? </p>

<P> All of this showed Mr. Bush's characteristic style. First there's the penchant 

for secrecy, for denying the public information about decisions taken in its name. 

So it's no surprise that the proposed Homeland Security Department will be exempt 

from the Freedom of Information Act and from whistle-blower protection. </p>

<P> Then there's the conversion of institutions traditionally insulated from politics 

into tools for rewarding your friends and reinforcing your political control. 

Yesterday the University of Texas endowment; today the Federal Energy Regulatory 

Commission; tomorrow those Social Security "personal accounts"?</p>

<P> Finally, there's the indifference to conflicts of interest. In Austin, Governor 

Bush saw nothing wrong with profiting personally from a deal with Tom Hicks; in 

Washington, he sees nothing wrong with having the Pentagon sign what look like 

sweetheart deals with Dick Cheney's former employer Halliburton. </p>

<P> So the style of a future Bush administration was easily predictable, given 

Mr. Bush's career history.</p>
