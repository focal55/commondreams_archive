<p>There can be few more spectacular sights in Latin America than El Reventador, 

the volcano that has been erupting so furiously over the past few weeks that it 

has cast its dust over the streets of Quito 60 miles away. Now the capital of 

Ecuador is experiencing the latest in a series of Latin American eruptions of 

a different nature: the peaceful election of a leftwing president whose declared 

enemies are corruption and poverty and who looks like the antithesis of the kind 

of leader the United States would like to see in the region. 

<P>The weekend victory of the 45-year-old former colonel Lucio Gutierrez encapsulates 

the change of mood throughout Latin America. On Monday, a general strike is planned 

in Venezuela as part of an attempt to oust the president, Hugo Chavez, a man whose 

path to power was similar to that of Gutierrez, and the country teeters on the 

edge of civil war. In Argentina, economic catastrophe could also herald seismic 

political change within the next few months. 

<P>Before the dust settles, Gutierrez's achievement deserves to be recognized. 

He easily defeated Alvaro Noboa, the Bonita banana billionaire and the country's 

richest businessman. The contrast could not have been greater. While Gutierrez 

had the backing of the indigenous Indian population, came from a humble background 

and was a former Latin American military pentathlete champion, Noboa was a chum 

of Charlton Heston, a polo player and the owner of a home on New York's Park Avenue 

who heavily outspent his rival. On the walls of the city over the past few weeks, 

a piece of graffiti perhaps captured the national mood. It used Noboa's initials 

to spell out in Spanish the slogan: Not Another Dumb Oligarch in Power. 

<P>The success of Gutierrez fits into what is now a clear pattern in Latin American 

politics. It follows the landslide victory of Lula da Silva in Brazil, which was 

also based on a platform of battling inequality. In March, Argentina goes to the 

polls and the current frontrunner is Adolfo Rodriguez Saa, another populist who 

has challenged the authority of the IMF and the rule of the market. And it coincides 

with recent advances for the left in Bolivia and Peru. 

<P>Ecuador is a small country of 12 million people but it has - in common with 

its larger, less tranquil neighbors, Colombia and Peru, and with most of Latin 

America - the massive problems of debt repayment, poverty, inequality, unemployment 

and government corruption. Like other Latin Americans, Ecuadoreans were led to 

believe that neo-liberalism, the global marketplace and the adoption of IMF policies 

would lead to better days. But like their counterparts, they have found that life 

for most over the past decade has not improved and may even have worsened. Many 

who voted for the untried Gutierrez and Da Silva felt they had little left to 

lose. 

<P>The most explosive countries are clearly Venezuela, where the radical Chavez 

faces opposition from all sides, including parts of the military, and Argentina, 

where popular discontent with free market policies grows sharper every day. Crucially, 

the US has signaled its disapproval of Chavez, a man they see as too close to 

Fidel Castro, and those who seek to remove him before his elected term of office 

have been left in little doubt that they will do so with the tacit agreement of 

Washington. But the US now has to recognize that it cannot impose its preferred 

candidates on countries impatient for change. 

<P>Gutierrez has already made it clear that he does not seek confrontation with 

either the US or the IMF. He may not have been as enthusiastic as his rival in 

welcoming the US troops stationed in their "anti-drug" base in Manta in Ecuador, 

but he has made clear that they can stay and that the oil companies can continue 

to export his country's resources. The Wall Street Journal declared him last week 

someone with whom the financial establishment could do business, and halfway down 

his list of qualifications is a diploma from the Inter-American Defense College 

in Washington. 

<P>"This is the most difficult time because now we have to start to turn what 

the people want into reality," Gutierrez said after his election. He knows that 

his room for maneuver is tiny, the obstacles in his way huge and that the effect 

the new president will have on corruption and poverty may be less than volcanic. 

Pragmatism, not revolution, is the word of the day. 

<P>Last week Gutierrez jokingly promised that if he was elected, there would be 

no more volcanic dust in Quito. He may have already failed on that promise, but 

he is still part of a wind of change - born of hope rather than resignation - 

that is blowing through Latin America. Many neighboring countries will be watching 

to see how the new presidents ride that wind.</p>
