<p>The Democratic party is coming out of its coma, but the patient is still not walking so well. On 11 September, the Party leadership in Congress collapsed. Even before, the Republicans, losers of the popular vote in 2000, strutted around like winners, claiming a mandate as if to the White House born, while the actual ballot-box winners staggered around unnerved, and Al Gore vanished. Last summer, even some Democrats could not resist a vote for Bush's tax cuts, disproportionately wealth-friendly. Bush unilateralism aroused some vocal opposition on the environment, missile defense, and other fronts, but came 11 September and the Democrats enforced a gag rule on themselves. After a shaky start, George W. Bush walked away with the helmsmanship of a 'war on terror' whose rationale was as popular as its extent and precise goals were indistinct. 

<P>In post-World War II America, Republicans in power first grab, then relish 

the use of a bludgeon whose name is bipartisanship, while Democrats fail to be 

accorded any equivalent magic when they accede to the White House. Democrats feel 

they must tiptoe around Republican power, as if the Republicans held natural title 

to the flag. So the Democrats were - and continue to be - fearful of making too 

much of the fact that Bush's team, directly upon coming to office, derailed Bill 

Clinton's anti-terror programs. They clammed up on Attorney General John Ashcroft's 

anti-subversive measures - and the fact that he, too, as late as 10 September, 

preferred fighting pornography and other pet hates of the Christian Right to fighting 

terrorism. 

<P>Nor were most Democrats heard from about the post-11 September round-up of aliens, not one of whom, by the way, has yet to be connected with terror attacks past or future. Democrats were acutely aware that while they polled strongly on economic and environmental issues, this did not erode Bush's personal popularity, though Bush's team were often inept when it came to converting fuzzy feelings toward the commander-in-chief into hard achievements.  

<P>What summoned the Democrats back to life was economic distress - an inauspicious 

development for an administration proud of its all-business-all-the-time credentials. 

The Republican theme song, 'Market Good, Bureaucracy Bad', sounds more than a 

bit tinny when the 'market' turns out to harbor lots of crooked conglomerates, 

shell-games run for the enrichment of a stupendously greedy corporate aristocracy. 

Not only were crooks running some major companies, but giant brokerages, investment 

banks, and accountancy firms were so deeply enmeshed in the fraud as to take down 

the whole stock market with them. With more than half of Americans owning at least 

a few shares of stock, the corporate kleptocracy becomes the b&#234;te noire du 

jour. Trickle down was not supposed to trickle away. Democrats were slow to point 

fingers, but an administration heavy on corporate top-dogs - even the chief executive 

himself - was a target that targeted itself. 

<P>Now, a scant three months before the mid-term elections, Democrats don't feel so feeble after all. At least they can graduate from life-support emergency measures to - well, what? They're not sure.  

<P>As surpluses melted away and deficits returned after 11 September, Republican 

poll numbers tailed off, too. Smart party professionals, who had thought the Republicans 

shoo-ins to hold onto the House of Representatives in the mid-term elections this 

November, started doubting it. The Democrats now have a decent chance of holding 

onto the Senate, if by a narrow margin. Bush's personal popularity holds up, but 

this is hard to interpret, one of these polling mysteries whose consequences are 

imponderable. In any event, Democrats cheer themselves by recalling George Bush 

I's 89 per cent popularity at the end of the (first?) Gulf War, shrinking to a 

meager 38 per cent in the 1992 presidential vote 20 months later. 

<P>The American press remains reluctant to note Bush's less than impressive following abroad - anywhere - but they do enjoy scandal stories, and there is some real reporting going on, for a change. Major newspaper columnists have resurrected charges that Mr Bush had played fast and loose with his oil company holdings before ascending to the governorship of Texas. Although Democrats have been too deferential to dwell on the fact, Republicans remain (despite years of the Democrats playing catch-up) the party of Big Business - and, in particular, oil. After months of sycophantic coverage, during which the president's occasional delivery of whole sentences was treated as a sign of Mature Leadership, even inspiration, we have recently been treated to less-than-flattering revelations about Bush's inner circle. The thundering hoofbeats of public opinion have got the attention of Republican legislators, who flocked to the banner of corporate reform as if they hadn't been opposing such invasions of laissez faire most of their lives. In recent weeks, Republican Senators suddenly found it seemly to vote unanimously for a reform bill on accountancy practices - a bill they had just been opposing, and that Bush now signed with scarcely a sign of embarrassment. On its face, the scandalous news about corporate malfeasance was a tremendous gift to the Democrats. Al Gore seemed to think so, breaking a long political silence with a New York Times opinion piece last week in full-throated populist mode, taking issue with his recent vice-presidential running mate, Senator Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, who had been heard to opine that Gore had run too far to the Left in 2000.  

<P>Not all Democrats were pleased with Gore's return, and among the conspicuously 

displeased was Lieberman himself, a long-time defender of the accounting industry 

- a position harder to sustain than it used to be. Lieberman has been saying that 

too much reform was as bad as too little and that further reforms in the ways 

stock options are treated would hurt little guys. This Republican-style protectiveness 

loses some of its heart-rending appeal when you realize that stock options are 

almost exclusively benefits for the wealthiest. 

<P>On foreign policy, the Democrats remain squeamish, as if they are not so troubled to be out of power. With the interesting exception of Senator John Kerry, who is running for the presidential nomination from Massachusetts, an unlikely launch spot these days, they do not thunder against oil dependency. They do not follow Bill Clinton's idealistic appeal for a sort of Marshall Plan to dry up the swamps of terrorism. They don't like Bush's unilateralism but they don't much feel like denouncing it either. On the shape of post-Taliban Afghanistan, they do not stick their necks out. On Israel-Palestine, ditto. As for Iraq, in the name of what principle can they oppose Bush's evident intention to go to war? The Democrat-led Senate Foreign Relations Committee held hearings on Iraq the week before last, but softly.  

<P>Tactically obsessed, they did not deeply question the purposes of an Iraq war, 

did not hear from witnesses who either oppose war on principle or, for that matter, 

support it because they think it would revolutionize the Arab world in a revolutionary-democratic 

direction. In short, wishing the question of war would go away, they are hedging 

their bets. As New Yorker writer Hendrik Hertzberg put it: 'In Washington, one 

side wants war; the other wants debate about war.' The opposition, if that is 

the right word for it in Washington, 'is not so much anti-war as maybe war'. 

<P>Here wobbles America, then, plutocracy rampant, 11 months into shadowy war, economically troubled, suspicious of allies, suspected by allies, hated - and American politics remains becalmed and unready. A lot of weak wills wait for events to take the initiative they're not taking.
