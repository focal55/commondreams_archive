From a distance, an anthill looks like an inanimate mound of earth.  Yet 

when from up close, you see movement - ants busily working for the greater 

good of their ecosystem, ants who bear the brunt of hard labor, carrying 

many times their body weight in food for the colony, working in unison.



<p>From a distance, Santa Barbara looks like this anthill.  We might appear 

comfortably inert, insulated from the economic injustices which have 

plagued nearby areas like Ventura and Los Angeles Counties, but looking 

closely, we are a community in motion.



<p>The agricultural laborers, workers and pickers who sustain the local 

economy are like the ants: diligently working, yet often out of sight or 

unappreciatedly trampled underfoot.  The People's March for Economic 

Justice scheduled for Saturday, April 27 here in Santa Barbara will 

highlight the diverse groups working toward achieving a sustainable 

economy, a living wage and workplace justice in our community.  This march 

aims to show the commitment, the momentum and the ongoing winnable 

struggles which affect everyone.



<p>Among the groups involved are the United Farm Workers, the Coalition for a 

Living Wage and two groups looking to challenge the role of the University 

of California's involvement in less-than-humanitarian endeavors - the UC 

Nuclear Free Campaign and Students for a Free Tibet.



<p>Nearly fifty local groups have endorsed this march, overwhelming evidence 

that many people in Santa Barbara County are interested in economic justice 

and informed about the issues.  Yet many people still live at a distance, 

believing that our anthill is just fine as is.



<p>Student groups disagree.  Students for a Free Tibet and the student members 

belonging to the UC Nuclear Free Campaign support the local struggles for 

economic justice by challenging the UC school system's involvement with BP 

Amoco petroleum investments in Tibet and the inappropriate relationship 

between the University of California and the Department of Energy regarding 

oversight and management of the nuclear weapons research facilities and 

laboratories.



<p>Michael Coffey of the Nuclear Age Peace Foundation says that "these issues 

- human rights in Tibet and the military-industrial-academic complex - 

directly affect what goes on locally in the Santa Barbara Community."  He 

continued by saying, "We must support those who sustain our local economy 

by challenging the fundamentally undemocratic policy and practice of 

overseeing nuclear weapons research and development by the largest employer 

in Santa Barbara County, UCSB."



<p>The need to de-link the University of California from the nuclear weapons 

industry is inextricably linked to the People's March for Economic 

Justice.  More than $6 billion in taxpayer dollars supports the 

relationship between UC and DoE, money which would be much more wisely 

spent on education, healthcare and social services infrastructure.  Rather 

than funding the machinery of death, we should allocate our resources 

toward promoting a better quality of life for all people.



<p>The United Farm Workers from Ventura County will be present at the march to 

explain the situation with their employer, mushroom mogul Pictsweet, owned 

by United Foods, Inc.  For nearly fourteen years the workers have tried to 

gain a contract, and in September 2000 initiated a boycott of Pictsweet 

products hoping to influence the management to come to the negotiating 

table.  The workers want safer working conditions, a raise to accommodate 

the rising cost of living, a forum for mediating conflicts on the job and 

most of all, respect.



<p>The Pictsweet workers are encouraged and excited to be participating in 

this march.



<p>"Our community is in movement," says United Farm Workers organizer Brendan 

Greene.  "We are working to change our community, to better our community 

for ourselves and our families.  We want everyone in Santa Barbara to see 

our struggles and our hard work and to become a part of our campaigns for 

justice."



<p>A living wage for Santa Barbara County residents is tremendously 

important.  UCSB instructor and Ph.D. candidate Keith Rosendal analyzed 

local data about the economic structure of our community and found that 

rents in Goleta have increased by 33% and over 20% in Santa Barbara, 

highlighting a need for affordable housing for all local residents.  He 

learned that since 1996 more than 21% of people living in Santa Barbara 

County have no health insurance, compared to the national figure of 13%, 

and that the growth of jobs in Southern California has occurred in areas 

which pay very little - in the service and agricultural sectors.  These 

statistics are a mirror held up to our faces: what kind of a society can 

accept the disparity of allocation of resources and access to important 

things like healthcare, decent wages and respect!



<p>Marches symbolize motion, movement, progress.  Our community Economic 

justice ought to be attainable for all members of our society, which will 

require support and solidarity in Santa Barbara.



<p>The power in nonviolent action is unity, diversity and recognition of the 

delicate web of interconnectedness which binds all the issues together at 

the People's March for Economic Justice.
