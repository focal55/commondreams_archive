<p>Was the election just a week ago? Hard to absorb all the news in a few days, 

let alone adjust to the realities of the day. What are those realities? 

<p>The first and most obvious is that our government has never before been taken 

over by an extremist group of ideologues. Some remember when Eisenhower was president 

and both houses were Republican. But they forget we had a Supreme Court that was 

in no way subservient to Republican doxology, and the Republicans in control were 

more Jim Jeffords than Trent Lott. In fact, in 1952, many regular readers of this 

paper were Republicans who followed the La Follettes into the Republican Party. 

<p>Despite the occasional Joe McCarthy, the 1950s debates were generally more 

civil. Differences in party affiliation had as much to do with foreign policy 

as domestic, and our president was a war hero not a warmonger. In fact, we can 

now look back with warm feelings for Ike, who warned that big money in the defense 

industry threatened our democracy and who appointed Earl Warren as chief justice. 

Can you imagine President Bush appointing Earl Warren? It was unclear whether 

Ike would run for president as a Democrat or a Republican. Today he would not 

be allowed to speak at a Republican convention. 

<p>During the Reagan-Bush administration, candidates for the judiciary were given 

a take-home exam before they could be vetted in person for appointment. Two of 

the questions tell the story: &#034;Do you believe Roe vs. Wade was correctly 

decided and if not, why not?&#034; And, &#034;Do you believe that Brown vs. Board 

of Education was correctly decided and if not, why not?&#034; You get the drift. 

<p>And Reagan was a moderate compared to this crowd. John Ashcroft, a religious 

and political fanatic, will now offer up the judicial appointments after consulting 

with Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson to make sure that the choices are &#034;good 

Christian men.&#034; We are in for some tough times with the judicial branch of 

government. Can&#039;t sugarcoat that reality. (While Wisconsin&#039;s system 

of electing judges does not guarantee a sound judiciary because of the money boys, 

it is a hell of a lot better than the federal system, where the nuts can take 

over and make lifetime appointments that threaten the right of women to exercise 

control over their own bodies, eviscerate what is left of the Americans With Disabilities 

Act, and do irreparable harm to our environment.) Scary times. 

<p>Jim Hightower called to suggest that you know it is a bad night when the best 

news for progressives is that &#034;the voters of Oklahoma outlawed cockfighting.&#034; 

<p>So why did it happen? Was it the popular Bush or was it the constant drumbeat 

of the talk-show hosts, Fox &#034;news&#034; and the other conservative media? 

All of the above. Was it the excessive money poured into the Republican campaigns 

and their effort to hold down turnout with negative commercials that would have 

made Bob Kasten blush? Yes. Was it Terry McAuliffe? C&#039;mon. No one in America 

other than insiders has ever heard of this guy. It wasn&#039;t McAuliffe, bad 

as he is. He simply represents the big-money boys and the DLC (Democratic Leadership 

Council or &#034;Democrats for the Leisure Class,&#034; as I refer to them). 

<p>The DLC was formed by the white Southerners to join with big money to take 

the Democratic Party away from dangerous lefties like Gaylord Nelson, Bob Kastenmeier, 

George McGovern and the reach of Bobby Kennedy loyalists. And they succeeded beyond 

their wildest dreams. They have blurred the distinction between the two main political 

parties in order to offer a safe haven for the big contributors. They eliminated 

any reason to get excited about politics. They are the ones who get nervous when 

Democrats express real emotion and passion for the downtrodden, those without 

health insurance, and those who are unemployed. They castigated the speakers and 

audience at the Wellstone celebration of life. They would have us believe that 

Walter Mondale lost because of the incredible outpouring of emotion for Paul and 

Sheila Wellstone. Were the speakers responsible for electing the Republican governor 

as well? Did they defeat Max Cleland and Rod Moen? 

<p>But how about our victories in Wisconsin: Jim Doyle/Barbara Lawton, Peg Lautenschlager, 

and Sondy Pope-Roberts? Oh yes, the Republicans and Wisconsin Manufacturers & 

Commerce finished the job of taking over the Legislature and setting the agenda 

for the next two years if not four, but what the hell. Let&#039;s celebrate the 

end of one-party rule. Some of the damage can be corrected, but before the helium 

was out of the balloons at the Democratic celebration, the Republicans - who brought 

us 16 years of fiscal and policy mismanagement under Tommy Thompson, Scott McCallum 

and Scott Jensen, and a deficit that may be the worst in the nation - demanded 

&#034;no new taxes.&#034; No new taxes? How are we going to deal with the Thompson/McCallum 

gifts? You know, squandering the tobacco money, overcrowded jails, too many prisons, 

insufficient funding for special education, a university in crisis. How do we 

find shelter for the homeless and provide health care for all our citizens without 

at least &#034;shifting&#034; taxes from the middle class to big business? 

<p>One marvels at the chutzpah of the right wing. They take government in Wisconsin 

and Michigan into huge deficits by giving incredible tax breaks to big business, 

and then wag fingers at the incoming Democrats while shouting &#034;No new taxes 

or else!&#034; They might as well say, &#034;Enjoy your four years. We will be 

back.&#034; 

<p>In an almost humorous moment, the Wisconsin Education Association Council declared 

&#034;the war on teachers is over.&#034; Really? Where will the end of the qualified 

economic offer begin? Will it be in the Assembly or the Senate? Could we get serious 

for a moment? 

<p>So, as we prepare for a Wellstone memorial here in Wisconsin, it is time to 

do some soul-searching. Kevin Phillips and Bill Moyers have it right. We are a 

plutocracy, not a democracy. Can we just acknowledge that reality and follow the 

advice of Panglos to hoe our own garden? Only if we don&#039;t have children, 

grandchildren or a conscience.
