<p>If the Bush administration lets large media conglomerates and local telephone 

companies have their way, the Internet as we know it--that free-flowing, democratic, 

uncensored information superhighway--could soon be a thing of the past. 

<p>The Internet itself is not going away. Rather, technological advancements, 

changes to the rules governing its use and the continued consolidation of media 

empires are combining to turn it into a conduit of commerce, booby-trapped with 

barriers and incentives designed to keep users where dollars can be wrung from 

them. As a result, a lot of freely accessible information and websites may become 

difficult or impossible to connect to--hindering the efforts of those posting 

that information to reach others.

<p>At a time when a handful of large media corporations produce most of the news 

people get, the television and movies they watch, the books they read and the 

music they listen to, the Internet offers a refreshing oasis of uncontrolled information 

and innovation. This network of networks, as Stanford University law professor 

Lawrence Lessig describes it, is an information commons, a place where anybody 

with a computer, modem and connection to a telephone line can log on and receive 

information from any of the more than roughly 3 billion (and growing) web pages 

posted worldwide. Internet users can also create their own websites, giving them 

the potential to communicate to millions of individuals around the world. (According 

to the Internet research firm Jupiter Media Metrix, an average of 80 million people 

use the Net on any given day.)

<p>The Net's open platform has spawned a wide range of innovation. People have 

started email lists and online chat rooms on just about any topic imaginable. 

Individuals have created new ways to distribute books, music and other products 

online. Independent online journals and news services offer hard-hitting alternatives 

to corporate media. Many independent radio stations now webcast, extending their 

range to anybody around the world who logs onto the station's website.

<p>This unprecedented ability of ordinary citizens and nonprofit groups to communicate 

with so many others has given them voice and power they otherwise would not have. 

Take, for example, the Organic Consumers Association, a citizen activist group 

that focuses on food safety and environmental issues. OCA executive director Ronnie 

Cummins says 85,000 people receive the association's action alerts and newsletter, 

BioDemocracy News, via e-mail; about 4,000 people a day visit its website and 

download an average of 10 pages of material. 

<p>"A lot of our activist clout is being able to communicate cheaply to people," 

Cummins says. "If we had to revert back to telephones, faxes, the mail and leafleting, 

it would reduce our campaign power considerably." OCA is not unique in its use 

of the Internet. A wide variety of nonprofit groups make savvy use of cyberspace 

to get their message out and spur ordinary citizens to take action.

<p><B>Open and neutral</B>

<p>When the Internet was first developed, its designers had no idea how it would 

evolve, Lessig wrote in his book <I>The Future of Ideas: The Fate of the Commons 

in a Connected World</I>. Nor did this community of communications researchers, 

computer engineers and programmers--many of whose efforts were voluntary--want 

to control it. They were fiercely committed to keeping the Net open and neutral, 

specifically so that innovation could flourish. 

<p>Initially, the Internet used phone lines, which government regulation subjects 

to "common carrier" rules. This means the telephone network operator must open 

its lines to all comers, and cannot interfere with the message or who sends or 

receives it. Most Internet users still access the Net through conventional phone 

lines. But as cyberspace becomes more populated with users, and as new multimedia 

applications require more bandwidth, these lines are increasingly too slow and 

inadequate to handle the traffic.

<p>The Net is in the early days of migrating to another platform--broadband--which 

is much faster and has potentially limitless capacity for data transmission. Besides 

dramatically expanding the Internet's functions, broadband's additional capacity 

also allows different media to converge: The same wire or wireless technology 

will be able to deliver television, phone, radio, the Internet and other kinds 

of multimedia applications to homes and businesses. With the Federal Communications 

Commission's further relaxing of media ownership limits, we will see greater consolidation 

of media, so that even fewer large media conglomerates offer these services. 

<p>Broadband--also referred to as "fat pipe"--is currently available through cable 

modems provided by cable television companies. Local telephone companies offer 

broadband through digital subscriber lines (DSL), a range of data-carrying frequencies 

split off from conventional phone lines. Broadband will also be available from 

satellite and other wireless technologies. Currently about 80 percent of U.S. 

households and businesses have access to broadband via cable or DSL, though only 

about 10 percent of Internet users have switched to these generally more expensive 

services.

<p>FCC chair Michael Powell has declared "the great digital broadband migration" 

as the agency's top priority. The information technology revolution "will have 

enormous consequences for our world and the manner in which business is conducted 

and how economies flourish," Powell told the U.S. Chamber of Commerce at its Broadband 

Technology Summit in Washington, D.C. at the end of April. "Those nations that 

harness its power and the opportunities it presents will stand tall as great powers, 

and those that do not will shrink in every aspect of civilization--commerce, politics, 

philosophy, art, education and war. If we hope to take our place on the medal 

podium of the Information Age, as we did in the Agricultural and Industrial Ages, 

we must make every effort to embrace and advance the tools necessary to build 

information prowess among our citizens and institutions."

<p>Using the rationale of attracting private investment to build and expand broadband 

networks, the FCC is moving aggressively to lift requirements for open access. 

To the great delight of the cable industry, in a 3-1 vote in February, the FCC 

issued a far-reaching declaratory ruling classifying cable modems as an "information 

service" rather than a "telecommunications service" or a "cable service." Neither 

cable nor information services are subject to common carrier rules. The agency 

has also declared its intent to deregulate DSL, which currently operates under 

common carrier rules, and has embarked on a series of decisions designed to "build 

the foundation for a comprehensive and consistent national broadband policy." 

These decisions are expected to be finalized sometime this fall. 

<p>Action is heating up in Congress, too. A bill that would remove open access 

requirements from DSL, Tauzin-Dingell, has already passed in the House of Representatives. 

Citing concerns over continued media concentration and consumer protection, Senate 

Commerce Committee chair Fritz Hollings (D.=S.C.) has vowed to defeat this legislation. 

However, a version of it was recently introduced in the Senate by John Breaux 

(D.=La.). Hollings has introduced his own broadband legislation that would preserve 

open access for DSL. And more recently John McCain (R.=Az.) introduced a bill 

intended to break the stalemate between the two sides.

<p><B>Digital futures</B>

<p>Jeff Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, sees 

the exemption of broadband Internet platforms from open access requirements as 

a government giveaway of valuable public resources to powerful corporations--one 

that strikes at the very heart of our political culture. "We're talking about 

public policy for media and telecommunications--critical aspects of our democracy 

that help encourage the free flow of information and contribute to the institutions 

of journalism," he says.

<p>Without public policies mandating open access, both Chester and Lawrence Lessig 

predict that our newfound information commons will become little more than an 

extraordinarily persuasive marketing tool. "The promise of many-to-many communication 

that defined the early Internet will be replaced by a reality of many, many ways 

to buy things," Lessig wrote. "What gets offered will be just what fits within 

the current model of the concentrated systems of distribution: cable television 

on speed, addicting a much more manageable, malleable and sellable public." One 

glimpse of what this might look like comes from England, where Sky TV's movie 

channels contain a picture-on-picture facility of interactive menues that link 

the content on screen with products that viewers can buy while they are watching 

TV. 

<p>The public's loss, however, is the industry's gain. Both the cable industry 

and the large, regional local phone companies--Verizon, SBC Communications, BellSouth 

and Qwest--lobbied long and hard to prevent nondiscriminatory open access rules 

on broadband. Blair Levin, a telecommunications industry analyst with Legg Mason 

who was chief of staff to Clinton's FCC chair Reed Hundt, says it's a question 

of pure economics. "If you own the pipe, you can make a certain amount of money," 

he says. "If you own the pipe and the content, you can make more money."

<p>Cable companies currently have monopoly control over their channels. But if 

they have to open up their systems to competing Internet service providers (ISPs), 

they fear losing out on the revenue they would collect from additional services 

like pay-per-view movies. "It's a question of who owns the customer--who gets 

the customer dollar and how it's divided up between the different content providers: 

cable, digital, movie studios and the recording industry," Levin said.

<p>Those who advocate corporate dominion over broadband services dismiss the notion 

that consumer choice will be curtailed. Marc O. Smith, spokesperson for the National 

Cable Television Association, says cable companies have begun to offer multiple 

ISPs and are finding it good for their bottom lines: "We think that's enough of 

an incentive for it to happen, as opposed to the government telling us how and 

when to do it." He insists that mandating nondiscriminatory open access "is a 

prescription for unintended consequences," giving competitors grounds to manipulate 

the marketplace by mounting costly content discrimination challenges.

<p>Smith adds that restricting where Internet users can go on the Net doesn't 

make economic sense for the companies, because it would alienate their customers. 

"That's like saying AOL/Time Warner Cable will only allow you to watch AOL/Time 

Warner channels," he says. "But they also let you watch ESPN, which is owned by 

Disney, and MTV, which is owned by Viacom." There is, however, a big difference 

between handpicking the channels that appear on a cable service and opening up 

broadband lines to all comers. </P>

<P>Chester suggests that the open platform of the internet is being transformed 

into a landscape of "walled gardens," content with various barriers meant to keep 

people within their confines. He worries that those who don't make deals with 

the companies controlling the broadband pipe -- particularly citizen and community 

groups -- will find themselves walled out, facing exorbitant charges for carriage.

<p><B>The only game in town</B>

<p>Garry Betty, CEO of Earthlink, the nation's third largest ISP, suggests a certain 

amount of hypocrisy among cable companies that reject open access as regulation. 

"Stop for a moment and consider what's being regulated," he said in testimony 

before the Senate Judiciary Committee on the AT&amp;T Comcast merger on April 

23 this year. "Throughout the country, cable companies have had exclusive local 

franchises to operate the cable system in any given area. These franchises were 

created by government regulations. Actions that seek to limit cable monopoly power 

created by these regulations, and to give consumers increased choices in broadband 

services are, by definition, deregulatory."

<p>By comparison, Betty pointed out, the more than 6,000 ISPs across the country 

show that Internet access has always been competitive. In 96 percent of the country, 

he said, Internet users in even the smallest towns and rural areas can select 

from at least four ISPs, while city dwellers can choose among hundreds. "Compare 

this to cable, where over 96 percent of customers throughout the country have 

no choice in who their cable company is." 

<p>Betty, who has negotiated deals for Earthlink to offer broadband service on 

AT&amp;T Broadband, the nation's largest cable operator, dismissed the argument 

that competition from DSL would negate the need for open access. That's because 

DSL service is essentially unavailable for people more than three miles from a 

telephone central office. Therefore, he said, for more than a third of the country, 

cable will offer the only option for broadband Internet access over the next five 

years.

<p>Like many new industries, broadband is experiencing some growing pains as it 

develops, works the kinks out of the system and figures out how to deal with Wall 

Street's impatient expectations. A recent survey by Jupiter Media Metrix indicates 

that three-quarters of Internet users are, for now, content to stick with their 

dial-up access.

<p>But Sue Ashdown, president of the American ISP Association, which represents 

thousands of mostly very small independent ISPs across the country, doesn't believe 

people will remain satisfied with slow dial-up connections. She says the regional 

phone companies have been very belligerent with ISPs who have attempted to offer 

DSL. And she worries about FCC plans to revisit regulations that give companies 

like MCI, Cavalier and AT&amp;T, who competitively supply bulk voice lines to 

ISPs, access to the phone lines. Ashdown considers that a direct threat to ISPs 

continued ability to provide even dial-up access. 

<p>The Center for Digital Democracy's Jeff Chester urges the public, especially 

those in the progressive community, to become engaged in this issue: "The infrastructure 

and rules for the next media system are being established now. We may not see 

the ultimate outcome of these decisions for 10 or more years," he says. "But if 

we want to ensure that we have as open a system as possible with progressive voices 

playing a prominent role, we have to shape that system now."
