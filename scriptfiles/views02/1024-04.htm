<p>NEWS THAT CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS had discovered his inner imperial self was greeted 

exuberantly by the Washington Post, which gave him Kissingeresque space to lash 

out at his former comrades on the left. Coincidentally with proclaiming the Birth 

of Chris (although so far with no disciples in sight), the paper devoted even 

more space to a desperate but ultimately futile examination into how anyone could 

possibly be as morally consistent as Scott Ritter. The Post simply couldn't understand 

it. 

<p> As I read Hitchens' piece, two things came to mind. The first was Elmer Davis' 

comment about those on the hard left who had taken a hard right turn: it never 

seemed to occur to them that they might be wrong both times. The second thought 

was of a Sunday long ago when one of my sons was being confirmed in the Episcopal 

Church so he would not later, as my friend Warren Myers once said, miss the exquisite 

pleasure of losing one's faith. The bishop did his job perfunctorily and then 

turned towards the altar. Just a moment, our minister said, "We also have one 

to be received." The bishop suddenly brightened because those simple words signified 

true triumph: he was about to grab for his church a former servant of the Pope. 

It is one thing to get little boys to pretend for a morning that they understand 

the Apostles' Creed; quite another for a real Catholic to defect. The editor of 

the Post Outlook section probably felt the same joy. 

<p> I, however, was troubled by a matter that lay beyond Christopher's view on 

Iraq, arguable as that was. Once again "the left" was being defined by the habits, 

opinions, and proclivities of a tiny minority with whom the author had some familiarity. 

This tendency, predominant among writers at either end of the New York shuttle, 

is so misleading that it brings into question the other matters being discussed. 

<p> In fact, there are a number of lefts. There is an ideological left centered 

in New York City, which seems barely aware that the socialist factionalism of 

the 1930s and 1940s is no longer relevant. If these leftists were baseball announcers, 

they would spend their time debating the relative virtues of Babe Ruth and Ted 

Williams rather than describing what was happening on the field. They tend to 

be tedious, trivial, and anachronistically tendentious. They are also, no matter 

what Hitchens and the Nation magazine say about it, largely irrelevant. 

<p> The intellectual left, in its academic variety at least, has also dried up, 

similarly a victim of too much discussion of archaic matters that leaves little 

time for today's work. It is probably not accidental that the best idea to revive 

black politics that some professors could come up with was the reparations issue; 

it is just so much more comfortable discussing slavery rather than the mass imprisonment 

of young black males, housing discrimination or the role of the black soldier 

in imperial America. There are exceptions such as Howard Zinn and those medical 

professors working on national health care. But the campus has been corporatized 

and specialized like everything else and to the extent that there is a living 

left, it is one that has yet to graduate. 

<p> The institutional left, much of it headquartered in Washington, is largely 

engaged in sterile, ritualistic reiteration of what were once vibrant mechanisms 

for hope. Then there is what might be called iconographic left, which uses the 

power of images, sounds and words. It can be as useful as Rage Against the Machine 

and as stupid as Barbra Streisand. But it is rarely more than the semiotic quartermaster 

corps of a larger movement. The most important exception is when the images, sounds, 

or words serve as a catalyst - a writer offering a new idea, a rock musician catching 

just the right lyrics, and so forth.

<p> Even at their best, these lefts -- ideological, intellectual, institutional, 

iconographic -- represent but a final fraction of what is needed for significant 

social and political change. The really important left -- the idiomatic, colloquial 

left of people who never read the Nation, let alone have a column in it -- is 

what really makes things happen. And unless you happen to be Betty Friedan or 

Martin Luther King Jr. saying just the right words at just the right moment, the 

truth is that the left to which Hitchens alludes simply isn't that important. 

<p> I have always been far closer to the idiomatic, colloquial left than to the 

more elite varieties. In fact, I missed much of the conventional 60s because I 

was working with SNCC and running a newspaper in a community on the edge of riot, 

and helping to start a progressive third party that would actually elect people 

to office. I have never gotten on that well with the Hitchens' former pals in 

the elite left because I never could find the time to straighten out my paradigm. 

<p> It turns out it wasn't all that important anyway, because the people who made 

the difference were not the famous talkers but the little known doers, ordinary 

people, who in Conrad's phrase, for one brief moment did something out of the 

ordinary. They were people who had not studied Marx and Hegel and couldn't tell 

a Trotskyite from a troll. But they knew, in Pogo's words, when to "stand on the 

piano and demand outrage action." These are the people of whom Carl Sandberg wrote: 

<p> <i>I am the people--the mob--the crowd--the mass.<br>

Do you know that all the great work of this world is<br>

done through me?<br>

I am the workingman, the inventor, the maker of the world's food and clothes.<br>

I am the audience that witnesses history. The Napoleons come from me and the Lincolns.<br>

They die.<br>

And then I send forth more Napoleons and Lincolns... </i>

<p><i> Sometimes I growl, shake myself and spatter a few red drops for history 

to remember.<br>

Then - I forget.<br>

When I, the people, learn to remember, when I, the People<br>

use the lessons of yesterday and no longer forget<br>

who robbed me last year, who played me for<br>

a fool - then there will be no speaker in all the world say the name: "The People",<br>

with any fleck of a<br>

sneer in his voice or any far off smile of derision.<br>

The mob - The crowd - The mass - will arrive then.</i>

<p> Consistently, the east coast shuttle left from which Hitchens has departed 

has been indifferent about, ignorant of, or even in opposition to the issues of 

the idiomatic, colloquial left. The people who are changing the way other people 

think about things are found scattered around the nation. And when some of them 

came together in the most effective progressive political organization of modern 

times -- the Green Party -- they were not only not welcomed into the club, they 

were frequently excoriated. And as for the critics of an Iraqi invasion, they 

are typically just ordinary citizens who have learned without the help of Ramsey 

Clark to be scared to death of what their leaders are about to do to them. 

<p> Hitchens and his ilk will continue to have their little debates, all carefully 

framed in a manner that excludes most of the people they claim to care about and 

most of the people who actually produce change. It worked at university and it 

works now. But it has little to do with either America or the left as it really 

is.</p>
