<p> WE CELEBRATE beginnings, whether of persons or nations, as a way of honoring 

our place in time. The joyful rituals of July Fourth, observed nowhere more happily 

than in Boston, remind us of the day on which our country came into being. This 

week we feast on summer food, listen to patriotic music, send up flares, and, 

perhaps, choke for a moment on the high emotion of love for this country. 

<P> 

<P>But to acknowledge that the United States of America has a beginning, and is 

thus bound by the rules of time, is implicitly to recall that this nation will 

equally have an end. What the Fourth of July celebrates at bottom is American 

mortality. Like every birthday celebration, it defies the human temptation to 

imagine oneself as living forever. There is a time past when we did not exist, 

and there is a time future when again we will not exist. To remember the one is 

to anticipate the other. And everything America accomplishes and signifies must 

be measured, finally, against this radical transience within which it all occurs.</P>

<P>What could be more obvious, you ask? And yet, the truth of our national mortality 

eludes us. The ultimate demise of the United States is deeply unsettling, even 

if only in prospect. This is more true of our nation, perhaps, than of others, 

precisely because we define ourselves in terms more of the future than the past. 

The greatness of Britain or Greece is tied to what it was, which is why immigrants 

to those countries, not sharing the past, take on national identity with difficulty. 

American greatness is always tied to what the nation is becoming, which is why 

immigrants here feel readily commissioned to create that greatness. The American 

future belongs equally to everyone.</P>

<P>But what if the future is finite? Which is another way of asking about death. 

At Gettysburg, Lincoln suggested that our hallowed dead will not have died ''in 

vain'' only if, in the future, ''the great task remaining before us'' is accomplished. 

Lincoln thus gave voice to a basic American assumption - that present experience 

is justified only by future outcomes. But if ever the Union ''perishes from the 

earth,'' will all those who died for it in the past have died ''in vain?'' In 

a world that remains bound by the rules of time and mortality, no matter how cloaked 

by patriotic fervor, is the characteristically American idea of boundlessness 

inevitably self-defeating? If America has defined the future as its only absolute, 

what happens when the future, too, is revealed as relative? This forward-looking 

ideology has been an engine of industry and social justice both, but is it nevertheless 

built on a contradiction? And why shouldn't Americans have looked for ways to 

avoid the bite of such questions?</P>

<P>Enter God. Here is the context in which to understand the use to which we have 

put our civic religion. When we claim to be a nation ''under God'' - and it was 

Lincoln who first used that phrase, at Gettysburg - or when we blithely pray ''God 

bless America,'' assuming that God's blessing for this country is unique, we are 

appropriating for ourselves divine attributes of infinity and immortality that, 

in fact, have no place on earth. And notice, we do this (1863, 1954, 2001) when 

our future seems most at risk, the American variation on faith in foxholes. </P>

<P>It should be no surprise that in the current period of acute national anxiety, 

we have resumed our emphatic dependency on God-talk, and no surprise that a court 

that presumed to question it should have been so efficiently slapped down last 

week. We Americans feel vulnerable enough without surrendering the sense of transcendent 

protection that derives from public expression of our felt-connection to God. 

</P>

<P>Thus, much more is at stake in our public appeals to ''God'' than constitutional 

questions about church and state. Every nation has a way of invoking the divinity, 

and every army goes into battle under the patronage of some god or other. Nothing 

new in that. But the American appeal is different because of the function ''God'' 

serves as a solution to the American problem. We yearn to think of ourselves as 

''the indispensable nation,'' hoping to postpone the inevitable reckoning with 

an opposite truth for as long as we can. ''God'' is our postponement. </P>

<P>On this earth, within the limits of time, no nation is indispensable. No nation 

is forever. When it comes to the human condition, no nation is exceptional. And 

if one nation is ''under God,'' it is only because every nation is. Therefore, 

the joy with which we celebrate our nation's beginning must inform, equally, a 

sense that our nation's eventual end marks us as part of the human family, which 

remains America's true glory.</P>
