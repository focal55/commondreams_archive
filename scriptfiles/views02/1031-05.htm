<p>George W. Bush wants war. He makes

no bones about it. Right now his biggest

concern is to get a UN Security Council

resolution that would provide political cover for

his planned war against Iraq, and he wants it

before our November 5 election.



<p>Why? Because after the election, some

more Congressional Democrats might pick up

their spines from the Capitol cloak-room where

they surrendered them before voting to

authorize this war. We might then see more

vocal opposition from politicians here at home.



<p>President Bush's motivation, and that of

his party, has been obvious from the start. They

needed to change the subject of political

coverage for the November elections. Otherwise

the newspapers and TV would have reported on

some issues that favor Democrats: the jobless

economic recovery, the millions who lost their

retirement savings in the stock market, a

Medicare prescription drug benefit.



<p>Not to mention the pile of scandals that

have dogged the Bush administration, any one

of which is potentially fatal: President Bush's

Harken Energy Corporation, Cheney's

Halliburton, Enron and the corporate accounting

fraud, the 9-11 intelligence failure.



<p>President Bush's decision to change the

channel, however cynical and depraved, has

been a brilliant political success. It remains to

be seen whether it will win the Congress for his

party. But his gambit completely transformed

media coverage for the 2002 election season.



<p>The more difficult thing to explain is:

Why did the Democrats let him get away with

it? First, in fairness, it is important to note that

more than 60 percent of the Democrats in the

House of Representatives actually voted against

the resolution that gave the president a blank

check to start a war. Those who led the fight

against their party leadership -- Representatives

Barbara Lee (CA), Dennis Kucinich (OH),

Lloyd Doggett (TX), and Pete Stark(CA) --

deserve the highest praise.



<p>The Senate was much worse: Democrats

voted 29-21 for the war resolution.

The biggest problem in both chambers is the

leadership: Dick Gephart, House Minority

Leader, and Tom Daschle, Senate Majority

Leader, both supported the war. Both have

presidential ambitions, and this is commonly

cited as the reason for their stance, as well as

that of other Democrats -- Senators Hillary

Clinton (NY) and John Kerry (MA) -- who

supported Bush.



<p>But the problem is deeper than that: the

Democrats who supported the war, including the

leadership, made some cynical calculations.

Some figured their consent to the war would

remove one issue from their election campaign,

where they were facing a pro-war Republican.



<p>That was the leadership strategy, and

what a blunder it turned out to be. Daschle and

Gephart seemed to believe that if they gave

Bush what he wanted, they could move on to

other issues. But Bush played them like a violin,

and kept Iraq on the front pages almost every

day up to November.



<p>The Democratic leadership's extreme

opportunism must be distinguished from simply

bowing to public pressure. Although polls have

shown a majority of people favoring military

action, this falls quickly to a minority when

casualties are mentioned.



<p>And these polls have been taken among

people who have mostly heard only one side of

the story. The media -- especially TV and radio

-- tend to ignore opposing views when the

leadership of both parties is in agreement. With

an ounce of courage, Democratic leaders could

easily move public opinion against the war.



<p>Whatever the outcome of the election,

Daschle and Gephart should resign from their

leadership positions. This is a matter of life and

death, war and peace, with untold and

unpredictable consequences. No elected official

should ever dishonor their oath, and betray their

constituents, by deciding such issues on the

basis of the most unprincipled political motives.
