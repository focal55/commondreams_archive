<p>Corporate scandals, the threat of war in the Middle East and a sagging

stock market are squeezing the flow of funds from foundations and other 

charitable donors across the nation. As a result, many worthwhile non-profit

enterprises that depend on the generosity of these donors for survival

are facing perilous times.

<p>One of these organizations is Whirlwind Wheelchair International, a

true jewel among the non-profits which is giving new hope and mobility

to millions of disabled persons in the Third World.

<p>Whirlwind is the brainchild of Ralf Hotchkiss, a MacArthur Genius Award

winner. Working out of the WWI Center at San Francisco State University,

Hotchkiss has traveled around the world setting up workshops and

training workers to make low-cost durable wheelchairs out of

locally-available materials.

<p>Hotchkiss, himself rendered a paraplegic in a motorcycle accident in 

high school, recognized that providing U. S. manufactured wheel chairs was

impractical and unworkable for third world countries. First, the

wheelchairs were too expensive, most costing $1,000 to $2,000. Secondly,

the standard wheelchairs were built for paved sidewalks and ramps, not

the rough rocky and steep paths of third world countries. Thirdly, parts

for the wheelchairs were unavailable or prohibitively expensive making

repairs virtually impossible.

<p>In his travels, Hotchkiss is constantly designing and redesigning to

meet special needs in the developing countries. He has come up with new

specifications for wheelchairs that can provide mobility in mountainous

regions. He has designed special wheelchairs for women and a separate

configurations for children. And most importantly, he searches out

available local materials that are affordable and easily adapted to

wheelchairs.

<p>Currently, Hotchkiss is completing the design and testing of an

off-road chair designed for ultra-rugged terrain. It meets all the

standard indoor and outdoor criteria, but it can travel on slopes twice

as steep as those deemed safe for a standard chair. A unique X-brace

feature allows height/width flexibility so that the chair can "grow" as

its owner grows from child to adult.

<p>Hotchkiss explains the importance of using local components this way:

"...it's much much better to start with wheelchairs built in the

country made out of bicycle parts that are available locally, tubing

that's available locally, canvass, and then whenever anything breaks you 

don't have to send it to the factory for spare parts, you just go to the 

local blacksmith and while you wait they can make any part."

<p>Workshops with citizens trained by Hotchkiss are operating in two

dozen developing countries including Zimbabwe, Sri Lanka, Uganda,

Vietnam, Cambodia, Palestine, Guatemala, Honduras, among others. And

Whirlwind Wheelchair is continuing to reach out-and to liberate-the

disabled in remote parts of the world.

<p>The need for wheelchairs-affordable, durable and easily repaired

wheelchairs-is staggering, particularly in countries ravaged by polio 

and preventable amputations. Whirlwind Wheelchair International 

estimates that twenty million people in developing countries need 

wheelchairs. Yet, only one percent own or have access to such transport. 

<p>In many of the countries which lack adequate supplies of workable 

wheelchairs, the disabled must be dragged, carried or left behind.

<p>Whirlwind Wheelchair International at San Francisco State College has

proven its worth. It has what is perhaps the world's most creative and 

imaginative designer and technical director of wheelchair technology in Ralf

Hotchkiss. And WWI is fulfilling a clear and demonstrated need to

provide mobility for the disabled-a necessity for a full and productive

life for our fellow citizens around the world.

<p>Yet this great success story may have a sad final chapter unless

funding can be maintained. Not only does the Whirlwind Wheelchair face

a fall off of contributions from foundations and other donors as the

stock market drops and economic uncertainties mount, but its home base 

of San Francisco State University has been hit by cuts in the California 

state funding of education. That means funding cuts for Whirlwind 

Wheelchair International as well.

<p>Despite the concern about the stock market and other economic

uncertainties, it is inconceivable that this rich nation would let such

a wonderful and successful project as "liberation for the disabled" 

wither for the lack of funds.
