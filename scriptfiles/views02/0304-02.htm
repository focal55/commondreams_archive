THE UPROAR lasted less than a week. Just days after the New York Times 

disclosed a Pentagon plan to spread disinformation to foreign media through 

the Office of Strategic Influence, top administration officials closed the 

office and supposedly scrapped the idea.

<P>A lingering question is: Why did the Pentagon even bother to admit its 

intention to spread disinformation? After all, the United States routinely 

disseminated propaganda and disinformation throughout the Cold War. So why not 

just do it?

<P>We could, of course, simply blame bureaucratic bumbling. Perhaps the White 

House was blindsided by the Pentagon's disclosure.

<P>But I think the answer is more complicated. The Bush administration is 

trying to prepare us for a war without end. The Office of Strategic Influence, 

created last fall, was supposed to spread propaganda to help topple the 

Taliban in Afghanistan. Proposing its continued use, like the president's 

declaration of an axis of evil, was a way of signaling that this country, for 

the foreseeable future, will remain in a constant state of war.

<P>Those who've read Orwell's dystopian novel "1984" will recall that 

perpetual war is precisely what justified Big Brother's official repression, 

as well as the disappearance of civil liberties.

<P>No, we're not living in a totalitarian state. But the declaration of 

endless war has justified extraordinary government surveillance, as well as a 

crackdown on public records. The USA PATRIOT Act, for example, allows federal 

agents to gain access to stored voice mail and to intercept information from 

Internet traffic. Attorney General John Ashcroft has discouraged federal 

agencies from granting Freedom of Information Act requests. President Bush, 

through an executive order, has given himself the power to seal past 

presidential papers. He has also excluded his gubernatorial papers from public 

access by depositing them among his father's presidential papers.

<P>Nearly all Americans support the legitimate national effort to defend 

ourselves against al Qaeda terrorists. But that is different from the 

president's more elusive "war on terrorism," which appears to include multiple 

battlefronts and pre-emptive military strikes against any country that may 

develop weapons of mass destruction, or threaten our control over oil 

resources. It may even include pre-emptive, covert sabotage of domestic or 

foreign political activists, who are redefined as terrorists.

<P>The political impetus for creating a state of perpetual war can't be 

ignored. George W. Bush has never forgotten his father's precipitous fall 

after the Persian Gulf War. Despite his currently high approval ratings, Bush 

also knows that a majority of Americans still favor the Democrats' domestic 

policies.

<P>Congressional outrage and scathing media commentary caused the demise of 

the Office of Strategic Influence. But realists know that its propaganda 

functions will be folded into some other agency, perhaps the newly funded 

Information Awareness Office, which John M. Poindexter (Ollie North's partner 

in the Iran-Contra scam) will now head.

<P>Meanwhile, the prospect of perpetual war justifies an orgy of military 

spending, deeper cuts in civilian services and further encroachments on our 

civil liberties.

<P>Angered by the media's relentless criticism of disinformation, Secretary of 

Defense Donald Rumsfeld impatiently asked a group of reporters, "What do you 

want, blood?" No, Mr. Secretary, we want the truth, not a growing credibility 

gap -- which, in case you've forgotten, always returns to haunt those in high 

office.
