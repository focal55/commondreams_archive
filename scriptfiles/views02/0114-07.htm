IN EVERY WAR, people suffer. Americans have proved that they are willing to 

sacrifice blood, money and time for their country. When asked, they have even 

gone shopping.

<P>At the same time, these same folks expect their government to care about 

their rights and needs as workers.

<P>That's why working women are gearing up to fight the Bush administration's 

proposal to eliminate the 10 regional offices of the U.S. Department of 

Labor's Women's Bureau.

<P>The decision to close these regional offices is not about the budget. Only 

three people staff each office, which is geographically responsible for five 

to eight states. Cutting these 10 offices would save $3 million.

<P>No, this is part of Bush's political payoff to his right-wing flank. In 

January 2001, the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think-tank, wrote the 

playbook for the Bush administration. They called it "A Budget for America." 

Among its many recommendations are the elimination of the Bureau of 

International Labor Affairs, the Women's Bureau and the Civil Rights Office. 

In other words, the hit list targeted labor, women and minorities.

<P>Should you care? Yes, and here's why. Every working woman should understand 

the debt she owes to the Women's Bureau.

<P>Created by Congress in 1920, the Women's Bureau has played a central role 

in representing and protecting the needs of wage-earning women for 81 years.

<P>During the Great Depression, the bureau fought for the Fair Labor Standards 

Act. During World War II, it helped ease women's transition into the war 

industry. In the early 1960s, the Women's Bureau played a decisive role in 

establishing President Kennedy's Commission on the Status of Women and in 

shepherding the 1963 Equal Pay Act through Congress.

<P>In the 1970s, the bureau fought for women's right to enter nontraditional 

occupations. During the 1980s and 1990s, the bureau campaigned for such family-

friendly policies as the Family and Medical Leave Act, passed into law in 1993.

<P>Conservatives would like us to believe that these regional offices are 

unnecessary and obsolete. But they're not. In recent years, the bureau's local 

offices have been educating women about their rights in the workplace, 

assisting employers with establishing child care and flexible hours, and 

encouraging employees to advance in high-tech careers. They have also worked 

closely with unions and the private sector and acted as a conduit of ideas to 

the national office.

<P>Closing the regional offices of the Women's Bureau will just fulfill a 

campaign debt. It may also make the real goal -- closing down the Women's 

Bureau itself -- that much easier.

<P>The fact is, we've still got a long way to go. In 1963, women made 59 cents 

for every dollar earned by men. By 1999 that number jumped to 72.2 cents, 

largely due to the Equal Pay Act of 1963. Clearly, working women have hardly 

achieved equality. We still earn less, more women than men still return home 

to a second shift, and working mothers still bear a disproportionate financial 

cost of raising the next generation.

<P>Until that's changed, we still need the expertise and oversight of the U.S. 

Department of Labor's Women's Bureau.
