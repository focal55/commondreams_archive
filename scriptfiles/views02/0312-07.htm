Now that the US recession is over (Federal 

Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has 

pronounced it), it is worth glancing back at the 

widespread concerns of a global economic 

slowdown that prevailed just a few months ago. 

These fears turned out to be overblown, and 

there's a reason for that: the "global economy" is 

itself somewhat of an exaggeration.



<p>Last year, when the economies of the 

United States, Europe, and Japan were all slowing 

at the same time, many people took this as further 

evidence that globalization had finally put us all 

in the same economic boat. But the slowdown of 

the three major economies -- which together 

account for more than three-fourths of the world's 

output -- was, more than anything, a coincidence. 



<p>The downturn had different, mainly 

internal, causes in each of these economies. In the 

United States, it was the partial bursting of the 

stock market bubble that ended the longest 

economic expansion in our history. Europe is 

constrained primarily by the tight monetary policy 

of its central bank: it is holding short-term interest 

rates twice as high as ours, despite much higher 

unemployment there. And Japan is caught in its 

own unique deflationary slump -- with consumers 

and businesses holding back on spending -- that 

has persisted for most of the last decade.



<p>More importantly, any one of the Big 

Three economies can pull itself out of its own 

slump without help from the others. This is 

especially true for the United States, where more 

than 88 percent of the goods and services we 

produce are still sold right here at home.



<p>The larger-than-life portrayal of our global 

economic inter-connectedness is but one of 

numerous exaggerations that have come to 

dominate the discussion of globalization. Think of 

it as a marketing strategy: our political leaders, 

backed by most economists at major think tanks, 

are trying to sell a particular brand of 

globalization to an increasingly skeptical public. 

Call it "the Washington Consensus," for its place 

of origin.



<p>This brand is marketed as an inexorable 

march of progress, driven by technological 

advances in such areas as communications and 

transportation. If the majority of Americans have 

actually lost out in this process -- as economic 

research and wage data for the last quarter-century 

clearly show -- well, they will just have to adapt 

better to the "global economy." 



<p>To question the consensus is portrayed as 

futile and senseless, like opposing the weather. 

But in reality, the rules that govern global 

commerce are made by people -- mostly 

politicians. These rules can be changed so that the 

majority of people -- in the world as well as here -

- benefit from globalization. 



<p>That certainly hasn't happened yet. 

Contrary to the mythology of the global economy, 

the vast majority of low and middle-income 

countries have suffered a drastic decline in 

economic growth over the past 20 years. From 

1980-2000, the per capita income of the low and 

middle-income countries grew at less than half the 

rate of the previous two decades. This is World 

Bank data, and any economist who is literate in 

this area knows what happened -- but few are 

willing to even talk about this profound economic 

failure. They do not want to be seen as spoiling 

the overall effort to market the Washington 

Consensus.



<p>Meanwhile, in the United States, we are by 

no means out of the woods just yet, despite 

positive growth in the fourth quarter of last year 

and the current quarter's expected improvement. 

US consumers, with their debt at record levels, 

cannot continue to drive the engine of recovery by 

themselves. And there is no indication so far that 

business investment, down 9 percent from its peak 

a year ago, is coming back. Exports could help, 

but not so long as the US dollar remains over-

valued. 



<p>That leaves the government. But the bond 

markets are already anticipating that the Fed will 

raise interest rates as early as May (the Fed has 

never been all that comfortable with 

unemployment below 6 percent).



<p>And sadly, more than 60 years after 

World War II pulled this country out of the Great 

Depression, military Keynesianism is still the only 

expansionary fiscal policy that can command a 

majority among our political class. Hence the real 

economic stimulus package of the Bush 

Administration, whether calculated as such or not: 

the War Without End. It seems that globalization 

is not only area of economic debate where 

ideology has crowded out reason.
