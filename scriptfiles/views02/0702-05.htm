<p>A case can be made against the international criminal court, which came into 

being yesterday. The best shot came from Douglas Hurd. In a recent lecture he 

offered the classic conservative defense of shapeless evolution over the reformer's 

formulaic rigidity. 

<P>South Africa, Northern Ireland and Palestine were examples he cited to show 

that politics rather than law provide the effective route away from criminality 

towards democratic change. Judges could never compromise, never bend to reality. 

Criminal indictments against apartheid politicians, for example, would have been 

disastrous. "Policy can be selective; law has to be universal," said Lord Hurd. 

So the ICC "is an institution too far". 

<P>This is the acceptable face of the anti-ICC position. Hurd, after all, is an 

internationalist. The face that matters, however, is quite different. It is ugly, 

brutish and self-regarding, to the point where it sees only beauty, justice and 

irreproachable rectitude in the mirror. This is the face of American exceptionalism, 

shown first by Bill Clinton's narrow-eyed aversion to the ICC, and now in the 

full-frontal harshness of the Bush regime, threatening to scupper both the court 

and, failing that, UN peace-keeping operations in Bosnia and anywhere else the 

US might have forces deployed on such work. 

<P>There are many disagreements these days between the great power and the great 

majority of powers. None seems to me more precise, more pointed, or more philosophically 

complete than their differences over the international criminal court. 

<P>The great power has opposed the setting up of an ICC from the start. This wasn't 

on Hurdite grounds, so much as on the basis of age-old resistance, going back 

past the second world war, to American troops being vulnerable to any foreigner's 

jurisdiction. So at one level it's a troops matter. High Pentagon officers - not 

politicians - have been tooling round Britain, France and Canada for two years 

demanding, with improper ferocity, that these major peacekeeping allies also repudiate 

the ICC. At another level, the campaign is the highest of high politics: an assertion 

that no US official shall be put at even the remotest risk of charges, by some 

pesky foreign magistrate or judge, of war crimes, genocide or serious human rights 

abuses. 

<P>As originally conceived, the ICC might have presented such a risk. Who could 

doubt that, under a loosely framed statute, officials of the great power would 

become the target of choice for a radically politicized functionary from any of 

the great majority that signed up to the court? In reality, no such possibility 

exists. As finally negotiated - by the great power that, having secured its victories, 

tossed the ICC scornfully back in the face of the majority - every lurid hazard 

has been removed. 

<P>The court cannot act retrospectively. Henry Kissinger is safe, as, for that 

matter, is Margaret Thatcher. Possible rogue prosecutors are screened behind a 

three-judge panel, with the UN security council retaining ultimate powers to stop 

the case. National courts will always be able to forestall the ICC by taking up 

the case themselves. The chances of any American, from soldier to president, being 

indicted for their actions in Afghanistan or Bosnia are zero - as France and Britain, 

equally engaged in peacekeeping and other sharp-end activities, have recognized 

by their consistent support, through every American tantrum, for the ICC. 

<P>The tantrums have been startling to behold. The veto on further UN operations 

in Bosnia, suspended for a couple more days, is only the most recent and ruthless. 

So repelled was Congress by the court that it empowered the president to send 

in the military to rescue any future American soldiers held at ICC headquarters 

in the Hague: the Netherlands Invasion Act, as it is known in Europe. Senators 

and Congressmen have lined up to assert a case for national sovereignty by elevating 

this largely phantom enemy into an irresistible global force of anti-Americanism 

sufficient to justify the institutional paranoia that has most of Bushite Washington 

in its grip. 

<P>I try to understand the American position, placing it in an existential context. 

The court involves some mitigation of power politics. It's therefore bound to 

be an uncomfortable presence. In reality the big power-players - China and Russia 

are also non-signatories - will find almost as many ways of fixing it as they 

do the UN itself, but the ICC's very existence, now ratified by nearly 80 states, 

declares for a world order not entirely dictated by military and economic might. 

<P>It was finally brought to birth against American resistance, despite a large 

contribution from the vast well of US expertise in international law. If not anti-American 

in conception, it has acquired that attribute through the actions of America itself. 

This therefore becomes a self-reinforcing political reality, just as the court 

itself, deprived of US influence, will less reliably observe American norms. 

<P>In a Congress many of whose members take the wisdom of Senator Jesse Helms, 

anti-UN man incarnate, as the output of a latter-day philosopher-king, the ICC 

can only be an affront to the country that won the war, to be the last great power 

left standing. To place oneself, even hypothetically, in the hands of prosecutors 

and judges who, for all the safeguards, might form a praetorian guard of juridical 

aggressors fashioned in Syria, Vietnam and the Congo Republic, is a fate perhaps 

best avoided. 

<P>What a pitiful world view this represents, however. The court may be an experiment, 

but it's an intensely honorable one. It offers a less political, less invidious 

and therefore better possibility of bringing genocidal leaders to justice than 

the ad hoc tribunals now trying Rwandan and Balkan crimes. 

<P>It has problems to resolve, growing out of the usual inadequacies of UN majority 

rule: how will it ensure the best lawyers are chosen, how will it be financed, 

how will it recruit its investigating force? But many great nations, the great 

majority, have labored to produce a realistic expression of the international 

will to see a world governed, in this respect at least, according to the kind 

of value system that America once upon a time was not frightened to express: lawful, 

internationalist, and defending the equality of human rights. 

<P>Tony Blair put up a robust defense of this yesterday: there are, thank goodness, 

some causes on which he disdains to play the proxy American. But it's probable 

that the US veto re Bosnia will stand, which means the EU taking over the UN policing 

responsibilities sooner than intended. 

<P>Will Washington sacrifice other UN peacekeeping operations - Lebanon, West 

Sahara, Sierra Leone, all up for renewal soon - to the hubris that cannot tolerate 

the ICC? Unless there is an outcry, it seems likely. At home, criticism remains 

muted, though not silent. The obligation on the great majority outside, to be 

unmistakably heard, has seldom been greater.</p>
