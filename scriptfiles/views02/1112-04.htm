<p>A date which ought to live in infamy for the Democratic Party is Jan. 24, 1992. 

That's the day Rickey Ray Rector was executed in Arkansas while Gov. Bill Clinton 

stood by and did nothing. 

<P>On that day in Arkansas, the Democratic Party also died. Its body is still 

with us, to be sure, but its heart and soul died 10 years ago. 

<P>Rickey Ray Rector, for those who would like to forget, shot and killed police 

officer Bob Martin in Conway, Ark., in 1981. After firing on Martin, Rector shot 

himself in the head. He botched the job, succeeding only in turning himself into 

an idiot. 

<P>His brain was so wrecked that before going to the execution chamber, Rector 

saved part of his last meal "for later." 

<P>Bill Clinton was running for president in 1992 when Rector was put to death. 

Clinton ran as a Democrat. In those days, only 10 years ago, most Democrats opposed 

capital punishment. It is safe to say that nearly all Democrats then were opposed 

to executing retarded people, no matter how severe their crimes. 

<P>But Clinton remembered the downfall of one Michael Dukakis four years earlier. 

Dukakis, the Democratic governor of Massachusetts, saw his presidential aspirations 

go up in smoke partly because he was perceived to be soft on crime. 

<P>In politician-speak, and particularly Republican-speak, any public official 

who doesn't have a brutish attitude toward society's losers is soft on crime. 

In Dukakis' case, rapist-murderer Willie Horton was rather stupidly furloughed 

from a Massachusetts prison, only to escape to Maryland to rape again. He was 

caught and quickly became a political liability to Dukakis, who was castigated 

in the 1988 Democrat primary by one Albert Gore Jr., another failed presidential 

aspirant of recent fame. 

<P>Willie Horton went on to become a legend in dirty politics when the friends 

of George H.W. Bush used him in campaign ads against Dukakis. As you'll recall, 

the tactic was successful, so King George I had the opportunity over the next 

four years to wreck the American economy, a job his son is now seeking to finish 

while conquering the world in his spare time. 

<P>In any case, Bill Clinton was resolved in 1992 not to face a "soft on crime" 

rap, so -- although he had it within his power to grant executive clemency -- 

he stood by and did nothing while an idiot was deliberately put to death in his 

state. 

<P>Clinton's success as a politician was not lost on other Democratic hopefuls, 

nor on Democratic voters, so they followed his lead in abandoning all liberal 

principles in favor of expediency. 

<P>Tired of losing to criminals like Richard Nixon and Spiro Agnew, or amiable 

clowns like Ronald Reagan, or ex-CIA chiefs like George H.W. Bush, the Democrats 

decided that the only way to beat 'em was to join 'em. 

<P>So they did. In 1999, when Bill Clinton sent our frighteningly eager military 

machine off to ravish Yugoslavia, nary a discouraging word was heard from the 

Democrats. A few months earlier, ironically, Serbs in Belgrade had met and shared 

memories with a few of the hundreds of shot-down American airmen they had rescued 

during World War II. 

<P>There is no word on whether our old Serb friends survived the 1999 bombings, 

but best estimates are that 3,000 Yugoslav civilians did not. 

<P>And the Democrats, not wanting to appear soft on tyrants, cheered Clinton's 

war, which was billed as "a just war." 

<P>(They got it wrong. It wasn't a just war; it was just a war.) 

<P>Part of the reason Clinton was so roundly hated by conservatives was his knack 

for stealing all their issues. He was so "hard" on crime that he appeared regularly 

in photo ops with uniformed officers behind him as he proposed or signed legislation 

narrowing civil liberties or expanding federal punishments. 

<P>Clinton didn't make up stories about ungrateful welfare recipients the way 

Reagan did, but he did propose, as a candidate, that anyone deemed capable of 

working be kicked off welfare after two years. 

<P>(Most liberals wouldn't object to that if it included the provisos that living-wage 

jobs be available and the hapless welfare recipients be trained to fill them.) 

<P>In short, many of Clinton's views and policies were just a little to the right 

of those once espoused by Barry Goldwater, who in his day was considered a right-wing 

extremist. Now, he'd be a middle-of-the-roader. 

<P>So, in this election season, which ended last Tuesday with a magnificent victory 

for the forces of darkness and a solid defeat for the Democrats, the Democrats 

presented themselves as . . . nothing. 

<P>Instead of presenting a vision for the future, their strongest selling point 

was that they were not as bad as the Republicans. In California, that worked. 

Even though the Democratic candidate for governor was an abomination, the Republican 

seemed worse, a man determined to lead us back into the Dark Ages, if we were 

dumb enough to elect him. 

<P>But California was the exception, and elsewhere in the country the Democrats 

came across as unconvincing mini-conservatives. 

<P>They deserved to lose. They didn't offer a choice. So they were defined by 

their opponents, who zeroed in on the excesses of liberalism. The candidates themselves 

rarely made a case for the finer points of liberalism. 

<P>This week, as the Democrats lick their wounds and try to regroup, it seems 

they'll be trying to figure out how to be even more like their Republican conquerors. 

<P>This does not bode well for the republic. And, if you like, you can blame Clinton 

for it.
