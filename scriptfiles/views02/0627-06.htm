<p>We have now seen President George W. Bush's plan for peace in the Mideast. 

It is a vision for indefinite war.

<p> The new Bush doctrine has achieved something remarkable. That is, agreement 

among the hateful combatants in the Israeli-Palestinian quagmire. They concur 

that there is no short-term hope, and probably no medium-term hope, of achieving 

for the Palestinians the Jeffersonian political system the American president 

says is required before creation of a "provisional" state of Palestine.

<p> Despite the president's desire to be rid of him, Yasser Arafat - murderous, 

corrupt, ineffectual - would be elected overwhelmingly if balloting were held 

today, opinion polls show. Those Palestinians disgruntled with Arafat tend not 

to gravitate toward reformers who've won the American seal of approval.

<p> Polls indicate that Arafat's closest rival as the most trusted Palestinian 

leader is Sheik Ahmed Yassin, spiritual leader of the radical Islamic group Hamas. 

Another popular figure is Marwan Barghouti, now in an Israeli jail for masterminding 

terror attacks.

<p> There is also the problem of holding elections in a war zone. Would-be voters 

are confined to their homes under round-the-clock curfew. But this is a detail 

to be worked out later.

<p> Who could argue with the idea that the Palestinians, like Americans, have 

a right to honest government, a market economy and a leader who is respected and 

not reviled on the world stage? It will just take time.

<p> That is the trouble. In the Mideast, time is measured in blood.

<p> The Bush administration sees the buses blown into shells of twisted metal 

and the office workers and schoolchildren murdered in the heart of Jerusalem. 

The president is troubled by the Palestinian mothers who boast of sending their 

children off to murder other children, preening for the video cameras about their 

sons' own suicides.

<p> The president sees incomprehensible horror, and he offers accountants. No 

kidding.

<p> This is a promise he's made. The United States and international financial 

institutions, the president said in his speech Monday, will gladly oversee economic 

reforms and ensure that a new Palestinian political entity has "independent auditing." 

Perhaps Arthur Andersen could be revived to take on the task.

<p> The usual and customary goal of American foreign policy is peace. That is 

what presidents are supposed to want. Achieving peace, at least promoting it, 

is a yardstick by which they are often measured.

<p> Bush is a different kind of president. He is comfortable with unending war 

on a global scale.

<p> The Israelis and Palestinians can kill one another indefinitely, so long as 

there has been a speech outlining the problem but proposing no U.S. action to 

help solve it.

<p> The Iraqis can expect their leader to be ousted. The role of the Iraqi people 

is to brace for some 250,000 American troops moving against Saddam Hussein. As 

for the aftermath? Don't ask, don't tell.

<p> The president promises to strike preemptively against any nation harboring 

terrorists or unfriendly nations possessing chemical, biological or nuclear weapons. 

Officials say the military operation in Afghanistan has dispersed al-Qaida terrorists, 

who are now believed to have formed alliances with other extremists throughout 

North Africa and Southeast Asia.

<p> So how many nations are in our sights? How many American servicemen and women 

are to be asked for sacrifice? Will there be an effort, however quaint it sounds, 

to talk first and bomb later?

<p> The American public likes wartime presidents. Commander-in-chief is the presidential 

role that most commands respect. Bush hopes for a place in history alongside Lincoln 

and FDR. He might secure it.

<p> Every once in a while, though, we get a Lyndon Johnson - a war president who 

can't figure out when it's time to try for peace. Johnson's tragedy wasn't his 

alone. It was all the greater for our nation and those who died as we watched 

it slowly unfold. </p>
