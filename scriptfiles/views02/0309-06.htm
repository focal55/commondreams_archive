<P>

There were two items during the week that included March's first day that bring joy to the hearts of the dyed-in-the wool capitalist. The first came from Aetna, Inc., the nation's largest health insurer. Aetna has fallen on hard times of late. It reported a loss for the fourth quarter, a loss attributed in part to the fact that medical costs were rising faster than Aetna could raise premiums. That probably came as a pleasant surprise to those who were unaware that health insurance company premium rises were in a competition with anyone and that Aetna, at least, was losing the race. 

<P>

Aetna reported a loss of $187.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2001 (which though bad compared with a loss in 2000 for the same quarter, of $406.3 million thus ameliorating the bad news somewhat.) . Medical costs rose 17 percent to 18 percent in the fourth quarter and premium increases rose only 13 percent, a distressing fact to the company and its stockholders. The increase in medical costs was attributed to the fact that Aetna's insureds were seeing their doctors more often and using more prescription drugs. Notwithstanding this bad news, on the day the fourth quarter results were announced, the stock price rose 5.1 percent. That was because the bad news about fourth quarter results was accompanied by a piece of news that was better than the bad news. 

<P>

Aetna's chairman and chief executive, John W. Rowe, said that Aetna's turnaround was on track. He attributed investors' enthusiasm for the stock to the company's announcement that it had been able to get rid (my words, not his) of 1.2 million high-cost members in the January renewal period. That does not mean that it had them done in. It means that it refused to renew their policies. By no longer insuring those who were unnecessarily frail (from a business point of view) the company was able to keep a higher percentage of the premium dollars it was charging than would otherwise have been the case, a result that pleased shareholders and company executives alike. 

<P>

The only people who were displeased with that result were those who learned in January that Aetna would not be insuring them in the future. Their displeasure was not compensated for by the fact that the termination afforded them the opportunity to shop for new doctors in order to accommodate the physician preferences of the new companies through whom they were insured. (It is not unusual for someone who changes health insurers to simultaneously change doctors in order to show the insurance company that it is willing to do whatever the insurance company wants in order to make it happy.) The good news from Aetna was accompanied by good news from the IRS, news that was designed, one assumes, to bring cheer to the wealthy who are starting to think about their annual outings with the IRS' form 1040. 

<P>

Last year the IRS increased its audits of the working poor while at the same time reducing to record low levels its audits of the highest-income Americans and big companies. Audits for the working poor increased 48.6 percent. The affluent are pleased to have the IRS devote its attention to the poor knowing that it is they who are all to quick to take advantage of their poor circumstances by not paying their fair share of taxes or, worse yet, claiming credits to which they may not be entitled. The affluent and big companies, by contrast, know that they are what make America great and they should not be rewarded for their contribution to society by being the subject of audits. The IRS agrees. 

<P>

Of particular interest to the IRS were the actions of the working poor with respect to the earned-income tax credit. The credit is a form of negative tax, the goal of which is to encourage the poor to leave welfare. When a poor person's tax reaches zero, a single poor person is entitled to a refund of $364 and a family with children may be entitled to $4008. 

<P>

Because of the increase in audits of the working poor, the commissioner of Internal Revenue Service, Charles O. Rossotti, said that he had stopped a long-term decline in efforts to ensure that taxpayers obeyed the law. 

<P>

In 2001, the IRS audited 403,506 tax returns filed by the working poor who applied for the earned-income tax credit and 295,002 tax returns filed by others. The odds of being audited if a person was a member of the working-poor class were 1 in 315 whereas the odds for everyone else were 1 in 431. 55 percent of all audits conducted were audits of the working poor. 

<P>

Audits of those earning $100,000 or more fell to a record low of 1 in 208 in 2001 down from 1 in 164 in 2000 and 1 in 9 in 1988. Corporations were similarly favored by the IRS. The audit rate for companies with more than $10 million in assets (which pay nearly all corporate income taxes) fell to a record low of 1 in 6, down from 1 in 4, five years earlier. The IRS paid more attention to companies with gross sales of less than $25,000 in 2000 than it did to those with revenue of $100,000 or more. Approximately 5 percent of all taxpayers earn more than $100,000 but everyone knows that people with lots of money are not apt to cheat the government. 

<P>

It was a week with good news for Aetna shareholders. It was a week with good news for the affluent taxpayer. It was a bad week for the frail and the impoverished. So are many of the other weeks. What else is new?
