As the daily political and military atrocities magnetize our attention, it 

does us good now and then to take a step back and try for some longer-range 

perspectives on the world situation, and politics in the U.S. of A. So here, 

in short takes, are some reflections on four areas that could use some deeper 

examination: political despair, Bush's coming downfall, the new face of 

warfare, and America's response to Islam.  



<p>1.  Pendulum Soldiers



<p>Shadow forces have been let loose across the globe. Every so often, it 

happens. The center, for a variety of sociologic/spiritual/political reasons, 

doesn't hold and suddenly wild, crazy, bad people take over key areas of the 

world, wreaking havoc and destruction. For awhile, people of good will and 

humanistic tendencies are frightened to death, not being all that familiar 

with how to relate to extremist leaders. Invariably, the bad guys, because 

they don't  operate well within rational boundaries, go too far with their 

arrogant, brutal behavior and ambitions, and the pendulum swings back the 

other way. The bad guys are gone, or at least are in the descendancy, and the 

center begins to hold again. It's the old political/cultural see-saw.



<p>In our time, it's not clear whether Bush is a symbol or cause of this shadow 

ascendancy on the world scene. Certainly, his administration's arrogant, 

in-your-face, take-no-prisoners, us-vs.-them style, has encouraged other 

political leaders to act reprehensibly as well around the globe, be it in 

Italy or France or Africa or Arabia or Israel.  



<p>We're living in a political world that threatens to increase our sense of 

despair, with more than our fair share of horrible news each day. And so we 

gird our loins for political battle, knowing we're going to get verbally 

pummeled, called names, have our patriotism questioned, maybe even face 

violence or official surveillance. But we also keep this long-term knowlege 

in our hearts: that tides do change. Keeping the faith during the bad times 

is so all-important, laying the foundations, the momentum building, for that 

inevitable pendulum-swing later. So, dear reader, think of yourself as a 

Pendulum Soldier, actively working to bring peace and justice and proper 

balance to this country, this planet, ourselves. We accomplished a lot with 

the Civil Rights Movement, helping to stop the Vietnam War, setting up 

environmental safeguards; we warned of the dangers of globalization, we 

founded institutions to combat the worst of the hardright's plans. We can do 

it again. Eyes on the prize. Don't let the bastards drag you down; 

falldowngetup -- one word.



<p>2. Cracks in the Facade



<p>For awhile, it looked like the Bush Administration was invincible. In the 

wake of the horrific 9/11 crimes against humanity, nobody seemed to have the 

courage to put up much of a fight when Bush quickly responded in ways that 

never would be accepted in normal circumstances.  This band of mean-spirited, 

greedy, determined power-seekers ran roughshod over the Constitution, the 

institutions of democracy, over real and imagined "enemies" abroad, etc. 

Instead of governing from the middle and seeking consensus in this new 

struggle  -- which would have been appropriate anyway, given that Bush lost 

the presidential popular vote by half-a million ballots and reached his 

office only through a political maneuver on the Supreme Court -- Bush behaved 

as if he had an enormous mandate and didn't need to consult anybody, on 

anything. It was full speed ahead in enacting long-range tax cuts for the 

wealthy, ignoring Congress, making secret anything that might prove 

embarrassing or potentially criminal, freezing out Democrats, retrenching on 

environmental progress, behaving like a rampaging cowboy in foreign affairs, 

etc. etc. 



<p>The point here is not to examine the details of Bush's program, but to 

indicate, as per #1 above, that such arrogant behavior cannot, and will not, 

continue forever. Every action carries within itself an opposite reaction. 

Bush&Co. is behaving like a secret corporation, motivated by greed and the 

desire for monopoly power, and is so outrageous in its open assaults that 

even those normally in support find their mouths hanging open in astonishment 

at times, both at the ignorance of the man in charge and in some of the 

policies they're expected to champion.



<p>The cracks already are starting to show in domestic policy, with moderate 

Republicans and most Democrats joining forces more often these days to stop 

some of the more reckless and dangerous policies propounded by Bush&Co. Even 

the quiescent Democrats -- forced into silence lest they be considered 

unpatriotic during "wartime" -- are starting to locate their spines, and are 

beginning to offer more in the way of opposition. 



<p>In foreign policy, the veteran team surrounding Bush thought itself 

unchallengeable as well, representing the only superpower in the world.  

Until it started to falter again and again, when running up against the 

many-layered complexities of the real world, as opposed to Bush&Co.'s 

simplistic black-and-white-you're-with-us-or-with-the-terrorists point of 

view. They've managed to alienate most of Europe,  many of their reluctant 

allies in the Muslim world (Cheney batting zero on his recent trip is a good 

example), and now, as a result of its unconscionable and sloppy  meddling in 

the internal affairs of Venezuela, a good share of Latin America as well.  



<p>In short, in areas domestic and foreign, Bush&Co. are showing signs of 

inconsistency, incompetency and behavior unbefitting the "leader of the free 

world." And beginning to suffer some defeats, finally. Consider: No drilling 

in the Arctic Refuge, federal and state courts slapping Ashcroft's hands for 

over-reaching in his police-state desire to control everything and everyone, 

large public rallies in the streets against Bush policies, editorials from 

normally-Republican newspapers are starting to get critical; Bush's approval 

ratings are slipping fast. When the final unraveling comes, when critical 

mass occurs and the whole deck of cards begins to collapse -- fed by the 

discovery of all sorts of embarrassing and possibly criminal secrets 

currently being hidden by the administration  -- the end-slide is going to be 

fast and vicious.  Resignation or impeachment is not out of the question. 

Keep the pressure steady and building. 



<p>3. The New Face of War



<p>America doesn't want to fight fullscale, front-on, long-running wars anymore; 

too many body bags get shipped back to the States and then there's all hell 

to pay politically. So, as we've seen recently, the U.S. prefers a more 

high-tech approach: smart bombs dropped from high altitudes, insertion of 

special forces for quick missions, unmanned drone aircraft for reconnaisance 

and firing of missiles, night-patrol goggles, etc. etc. 



<p>So, on one hand, the wealthy, technologically superior U.S. can, and wishes 

to, engage in what it laughingly thinks of as a "clean" war, with minimal 

casualities and "collateral damage."  But the new enemies of the U.S. and the 

developed world don't need all that highfalutin', expensive technology. All 

they need is some plastique and nails, suicide martyrs, computer skills, 

biological agents, chemical compounds, "dirty" radiation bombs, and the like. 

We've been given enough visions of the future -- airplanes used as bombs, 

young warriors wearing TNT jackets, release of anthrax spores in public, 

massive viral attacks delivered by email, missing plutonium from labs, etc. 

-- but tend to see them as one-off events. It may not be what many of my 

lib-rad comrades want to hear but we'd better get used to the coming world of 

large terrorist attacks, and smaller terror happenings -- largely at this 

point from Islamic extremists -- and the panic and economic disasters that 

will follow. 



<p>So we should know what's coming, but the military expenditures tend still to 

go to fighting the last war. Partly, it's ignorance and head-in-the-sandism. 

(Bush even CUT funds for beefing up security of nuclear power plants!)  

Partly, more money gets made by corporations building large pieces of 

machinery -- planes, tanks, missiles (and, of course, missile-defense 

boondoggles) -- and that's the green fuel for political campaigns.  



<p>It'll probably take another huge terrorist attack, something on the scale of 

9/11, or bigger, to serve as our final wake-up call. Then maybe we'll cancel 

the "Star Wars" missile-defense shield R&D, maybe we'll even cancel Bush's 

huge tax-cut giveaway (mostly to the wealthy, of course)10 years into the 

future. If so, we'll be able to use those freed-up monies so that we can pay 

for effective anti-terrorist programs -- and a wide variety of human-need and 

infrastructure-repair projects -- without robbing Social Security and 

Medicare trust funds, as Bush is currently doing.



<p>And, maybe, just maybe, we'll start thinking about revising our foreign 

policies so that we can alter the chemistry of the soil in which young 

potential terrorists grow. Prevention is always cost-effective in the long 

run. 



<p>4. The Paucity of Understanding: Islam & the West



<p>Imagine yourself a practitioner of Islam in the Middle East. The mainly 

Christian West, especially in Europe and America, demonstrates total 

ignorance about your faith, and appears to be engaged in a crusade against 

your religion. Partly, that "crusade" (a loaded term employed by Bush, let us 

remember) is geopolitical in nature, tied mainly to access to cheap oil&gas. 

But partly that crusade seems to grow out of a hearty disdain for the 

religion itself, based on prejudice and ignorance of Islam. 



<p>Western leaders are constantly getting caught with their religious blinders 

on. Italy's premiere Burlusconi blurting out that European civilization is 

far superior to any other in the world; Bush's "crusade" remark; House 

Republican Whip Tom DeLay's inflammatory statement that only Christianity 

"offers a comprehensive worldview that covers all areas of life and thought, 

every aspect of creation. Only Christianity offers a way to live in response 

to the realities that we find in this world -- only Christianity."



<p>There's such a paucity of understanding of Islam in the West, and perhaps 

much the same is true about Christianity/Judaism in much of the Islamic 

world. I know this lack of knowledge about Islam  is true for me and many of 

my friends, though we are quickly trying to catch up. When our elected 

leaders make disparaging remarks about the religion, openly, you know that 

anti-Islam bigotry and ignorance runs deep in our Western societies. (At 

least, Nixon and Rev. Billy Graham tried to hide their anti-Jewish bigotry.)



<p>Now, having said that, it is also true, as many Moslem commentators have 

pointed out, that contemporary Islam is greatly divided and troubled, not 

quite deciding how to incorporate its old, revered religious teachings into 

the modern world of democracy and free-markets. Many Moslem societies are in 

the process of making the transition -- such moderate states as Egypt, 

Jordon, Indonesia, et al. -- but others are still not sure how much, or in 

some cases even whether, to relate to the non-Islamic world. And that 

division runs deep in individual societies, Iran being one clear example, 

with its more worldly younger population anxious for reform and more open 

access to the outside world but the conservative mullahs constantly standing 

in the way with prohibitive restrictions. 



<p>Given this conflicted point of view, which reflects the chaos and confusion 

of modern life, it is no wonder that Islamic fundamentalism has risen more 

and more to the fore, bringing with it not only answers to the seeming chaos 

of life but, concomitantly, an antagonism to the forces regarded as bringing 

moral impurity into the healthy spiritual body of Islam: Western values 

derived from non-Islamic cultures, which threaten to confuse and tempt 

practitioners of Islam. Of course, there will be Osama bin Ladens, and 

fatwas, and calls to jihad in such a culture clash.



<p>Not all Moslems, of course, are extremists. Most are, or would be, content 

being allowed to practice their faith, much as their forefathers did, while 

interacting with the non-Islamic world in minor but pleasant-enough ways: 

buying products from the West, enjoying Hollywood movies, listening to 

hip-hop, etc. But the East/West conflicts, and the seemingly intractable 

Israel/Palestine dispute, keep intruding -- as do the inane comments about 

Islam from Western leaders like Bush and Burlusconi and DeLay -- and thus the 

pot continues to boil.  (I haven't even mentioned how Arab-Americans consider 

themselves put upon by the general U.S. population, but in particular by the 

Bush Administration, which seems intent on targeting them for "special 

consideration," which further isolates them and puts them at risk.)



<p>Also forcing Moslems into a united front of suspicion against the U.S. is 

America's clear support of the current Israeli government's terror campaign. 

Granted that there are good and decent reasons why the U.S. might want to 

support Israel's right to exist in a hostile Arab environment -- the only 

democracy in the region, affinity and familiarity with the main religion 

practiced there, Israel supports U.S. policies, etc. -- but there is no 

excuse, especially after the recent horrors associated with Israel's invasion 

of the West Bank, for Bush referring to Ariel Sharon as "a man of peace." 

What has Bush been smoking?



<p>If the U.S. wants to maintain good relations with the Arab Moslem countries, 

it must mobilize a global peace coalition -- with the same dedication and 

passion with which it has organized its "war on terrorism" coalition -- to 

work mightily to bring about a peace settlement between the Israelis and 

Palestinians. If the U.S. isn't willing to do this, and there is no evidence 

to date that Bush is even considering it, all we can expect is a slide into 

more slaughter, more regional instability, more terrorists fluorishing, more 

disasters. Israel and the U.S. will have "won" the battle, but risk losing 

the war. And the gap between the Christian/Jewish West and the world of Islam 

will grow wider and wider, and ever more dangerous.
