<p>When the revelations of crime and deception poured out of the executive 

suites of Enron, Tyco, WorldCom and other corporations earlier this 

year, politicians-particularly sitting members of the Senate and the

House of Representatives-unleashed a blizzard of news releases to

denounce corporate crime.

<p>Never mind that many of these same politicians long had been neck-deep 

in schemes to weaken (if not outright eliminate) regulation and remove 

the regulatory cops needed to uncover and stop the kind of corporate 

shenanigans that destroyed the Enrons and left thousands of workers 

without jobs and pensions-and investors holding worthless stock of

bankrupt companies.

      <p>The politicians were betting that some well-honed news releases and a few speeches 

        expressing outrage back home would be enough to take voters' minds off 

        the scandals and the human misery left in the wake of the corporate excesses. 

      <p>Unfortunately, it is probably a good bet. Too often in the past, that 

        has been the case-a quick outburst of anger and concern and then back 

        to business as usual. 

      <p>When hundreds of savings and loans failed in the 1980s followed by the 

        greatest rash of bank collapses since the depression, there was a national 

        uproar and a string of Congressional investigations. Some regulatory reforms 

        did get through Congress, but less than a decade later the financial industry 

        was back on Capitol Hill demanding deregulation once again. Despite the 

        recent financial disasters, Congress agreed to the new deregulation in 

        1999-and many of the financial combinations created by that deregulation 

        are intertwined in the current corporate scandals. 

      <p>Are we about to repeat this same sad cycle in dealing with the current

corporate fraud and crime wave that has cost millions of Americans 

trillions of dollars? Will this year's headlines, a few limited reforms 

and a tap on the wrist be the end result-with no real protections in 

place for the public, investors, workers and the economy?

We should not allow such a result. We need to prove that our political

and economic system is better than that. We can make 

lasting-effective-change as citizens. This time, we need to keep the 

issues on the front burner until we have true reforms, not fake 

facsimiles that do nothing but lull the public into a false sense of 

security.

<p>As part of that effort, I am asking candidates for the U. S. Senate and

the House of Representatives this year to sign a 10-point pledge which 

contains provisions that will put teeth in the crackdown on corporate crime.

The pledge includes a promise that the candidate will support 

legislation which would give shareholders the right to democratically 

nominate and elect the board of directors and approve all major business 

decisions such as mergers and acquisitions above $1 billion in value and 

the compensation packages of top executives. The pledge would also 

promise support for a ban on corporate criminals obtaining government 

contracts and banning government contracts for companies that relocate 

their headquarters offshore to avoid taxes.

<p>Signers would also pledge to strengthen pension reforms and rein in

excessive pay for corporate chief executives as well as establishing a

federally-chartered non-profit Financial Consumers Association joined by

millions of American investors that would represent consumers before

legislative and regulatory bodies.

<p>The pledge also contains a promise to repeal the notorious Private

Securities Litigation Reform Act (1995) which shields the aiders and

abetters of corporate crime, such as accounting and law firms, from 

civil liability. The pledge also calls on signers to support the 

regulation of derivatives trading.

<p>Candidates would also pledge to support the establishment of a

Congressional Commission on Corporate Power to explore various legal and

economic proposals that would rein in unaccountable giant global 

corporations. The commission would seek ways to improve on the current

state corporate chartering system and propose ways to correct the unfair

legal status of corporations such as the doctrine of corporate personhood.

<p>In addition to holding political candidates' feet to the fire on 

corporate crime, we need to continue to energize and enlist citizens in 

the effort to crackdown on corporate crime. An upcoming effort in 

mobilizing citizen support will be a rally on Wall Street on Friday, 

October 4.

      

<p>The rally, sponsored by Democracy Rising (see <a href="http://www.democracyrising.org" target="_new">www.democracyrising.org</a>) 

is designed to focus attention to ongoing corporate crime and to propose remedies 

to help shareholders, taxpayers, workers and consumers. The rally will be on the 

steps of City Hall directly facing the New York Stock Exchange. Reformers are 

going to take the issue right to the New York Stock Exchange. 

<p>Citizens across the nation have the power to change corporate behavior 

if they will stick with the issue over the coming weeks and into the

next Congress. We will be pushing forward with the "The Candidate's

Pledge To Crackdown on Corporate Crime," but citizens should raise the

issue of corporate crime directly with Congressional candidates in their

hometowns and demand that they produce more than news releases and

speeches. This time we need to get real reform before the issues fade

and the politicians find another convenient rug under which the crimes

can be swept.</p>
