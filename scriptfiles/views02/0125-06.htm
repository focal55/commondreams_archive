The U.S. military is coming under fire for its treatment of detainees at the 

Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba. Human-rights organizations charge that 

the United States is treating the soldiers, captured in Afghanistan, 

inhumanely and in violation of international law.



<p>During their 20-hour flight from Afghanistan to Guantanamo, the prisoners 

were hooded, shackled and some were reportedly sedated. Hooding is a 

violation of the 1984 Convention Against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or 

Degrading Treatment. Further, the men's hair and beards were shaved, a 

violation of human dignity under the 1966 International Covenant on Civil 

and Political Rights.



<p>Once they arrived in Cuba, the prisoners were placed in 6-by-8-foot cages 

and exposed to the elements. Jamie Fellner, director of the U.S. Program at 

Human Rights Watch, called this "a scandal," adding, "The United States 

should not be transporting detainees to Cuba until it can provide decent 

shelter."



<p>Photographs of the prisoners caused international outrage. They were shown 

kneeling and bound in shackles and manacles, with masks covering their 

mouths and noses, and goggles with black tape blinding their eyes. The 

International Committee of the Red Cross says the United States might have 

violated the Geneva Convention by distributing photos of the prisoners to 

the international media.



<p>The Pentagon maintains the detainees are treated humanely, receiving 

"culturally appropriate" meals, medical treatment, showers and exercise. And 

military officials justify their actions on the grounds that some detainees 

have threatened to kill their American captors.



<p>According to U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, the detainees "will be 

handled not as prisoners of war, because they are not, but as unlawful 

combatants." This is an important distinction, given that under the Geneva 

Convention, POWs must be tried "by the same courts according to the same 

procedure as in the case of members of the armed forces of the detaining 

power." And unless they are charged with specific war crimes or crimes 

against humanity, POWs are to be released upon the cessation of hostilities.



<p>"The secretary seems unaware of the international requirements of 

international humanitarian law," says Fellner. "As a party to the Geneva 

Conventions, the United States is required to treat every detained combatant 

humanely, including unlawful combatants. The United States may not pick and 

choose among them to decide who is entitled to decent treatment."



<p>Javier Solana, foreign policy chief for the European Union, agrees, saying 

that "the Geneva Convention must be applied to everyone who is detained in 

similar circumstances." Despite Sept. 11, "changing our values and our way 

of life would be terrorism's first victory," Solana said.



<p>Even in Britain, America's closest ally, there is growing concern over the 

treatment of the detainees held at Guantanamo, although the British 

government's support of the United States on the issue has been unwavering. 

The Church of England has made a plea to the United States to apply 

"proportionate and measured justice," and treat the prisoners with "humanity 

and dignity." Kevin McNamara of the Labor Party warned that the West is "in 

danger of losing the moral high ground."



<p>Mary Robinson, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, said that the 

legal status of the detainees must be clarified, but in the meantime they 

should be treated as POWs. "They were combatants in an international 

conflict. It may be that some of them have also been involved in the 

al-Qaida conspiracy, that's quite likely, but they are entitled to POW 

status or, if that is defeated, there is provision in the Geneva Convention 

that it goes before a tribunal."



<p>Rumsfeld says that he does not "feel the slightest concern about (the 

prisoners') treatment. They are being treated vastly better than they 

treated anybody else."



<p>He misses the point: Every person around the world is entitled to basic 

standards of treatment as mandated by international law. Merely being better 

than Osama bin Laden should not be our standard.
