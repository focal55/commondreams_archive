<p>Amazement has been our typical response to the extent of corporate self-dealing, 

opaque bookkeeping and conflicts of interest brought to light by the Enron debacle 

and subsequent scandals of 2002. 

<P> But not for Greg LeRoy, founder-leader of a Washington-based policy group 

called <a href="http://www.goodjobsfirst.org/gjf.htm" target="_new">Good Jobs 

First</a>. LeRoy, a former union official and community organizer, is becoming 

America's No. 1 watchdog of how subsidy-hungry corporations are putting the squeeze 

on state and local governments &#151; and all of us as taxpayers. 

<P> The record is enough to curl your hair. LeRoy's reports have highlighted a 

near tidal wave of tax abatements or outright payments that states and localities 

feel obliged to make to land footloose businesses &#151; or sometimes just to 

convince the ones they have to stay put. 

<P> Just one recent example: the New York Stock Exchange demand of $400 million 

to stay in Manhattan, offering, in LeRoy's words, a "laughable threat to move 

to New Jersey, even though most of its major member firms have already been paid 

to stay in New York!" 

<P> All too often, LeRoy complains, companies simply fail to create the jobs or 

pay the wages or invest the dollars they promised in return for their tax breaks 

or subsidies. 

<P> States and localities, he charges, are grossly negligent in monitoring and 

evaluating the effectiveness of the massive incentives they offer. He highlights 

a finding by the U.S. Economic Development Administration that only two states 

(Maryland and New York) have created models to figure how well subsidies work. 

The other 48 collect no data on effectiveness, or rely on data from client companies 

&#151; leaving the fox, as it were, in charge of the chicken coop. 

<P> Last month in Baltimore, LeRoy's Good Jobs First, formed in 1998, held its 

first-ever national conference, 300 people from 36 states involved in community-based 

organizations, labor organizations, state tax and budget watchdog groups, environmental/smart 

growth organizations and academia. 

<P> Whether from the left or right, the attendees agreed that state and local 

economic development efforts should be fully accountable &#151; "to fix the candy 

store mess," as LeRoy puts it. 

<P> The anger doesn't seem so much targeted at local governments, however. All 

too often they find themselves beaten down, abused by businesses playing one state 

or locality against another. 

<P> Says LeRoy, it's simply wrong to hand out corporate subsidies when the recipient 

businesses often turn out to be paying poverty-level wages, denying health-care 

coverage to employees, polluting the environment, fueling sprawl by fleeing inner 

cities and older suburbs, or "merely moving jobs from one city to another." 

<P> The case for relocation subsidies is getting all the weaker, he notes, because 

today's big challenge isn't capturing footloose jobs. Instead, it's building people's 

skills. With the graying of America, the country's workforce growth is projected 

to decline to a bare replacement rate. Skilled labor will be scarce for a generation 

or more to come. 

<P> Conclusion? Education is of indisputable, paramount importance. That means, 

LeRoy argues, that monies flowing to property-tax abatements or corporate income-tax 

cuts are devouring public budgets far better spent on building Americans' skills 

for the 21st century. 

<P> What is looking up &#151; at least a little &#151; is the battle for accountability. 

Largely due to grass-roots campaigns by the types of people at the Good Jobs First 

conference, the number of states with "clawbacks" &#151; requirements for return 

of subsidies if a firm tries to leave, or doesn't provide the new jobs it promises 

&#151; has risen from nine to 17 in the past decade. In 1992, only eight states 

attached job-quality standards to their subsidies; today, 37 do. 

<P> Still, across the country, state and local economic-development offices remain 

instinctively secretive, even with vast sums of public money at stake. New state 

accountability systems &#151; like the ones from Maine, Minnesota and North Carolina, 

highlighted at the Good Jobs First conference &#151; are still rare. 

<P> What is different is the start of a coherent, connected national constituency 

to exchange experiences, highlight accountability measures, and fight for reform. 

The Baltimore conference, first of its kind, may start that ball rolling. 

<P> Ironically, it's a cause likely to be bolstered by accounts of juggled books 

and abuse of shareholders by some of our most gigantic publicly traded corporations. 

In this climate, calls for broad-based reform, for honest and open accounting, 

for putting the <i>public</i> interest first, should be gaining new resonance 

coast to coast.
