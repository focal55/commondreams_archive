<p>A friend said not to worry about George W. Bush ordering an invasion 

of Iraq. "He's like a child who wants ice cream," she said. "He'll be 

satisfied with something smaller, like a cookie."

<P>My friend has never had children.

<P>I've never had children, but I've taught children. No kid who wants ice 

cream gladly takes a cookie, and few adults either. I've got a feeling young 

Bush is going to scream "evil" until he gets to lick Saddam Hussein. He won't 

take some stinking cookie from U.N. weapons inspectors.

<P>This is not to imply that Bush is childish, although he does call Vladimir 

Putin "Pooty-poot." This is to say he's stubborn. He's going to invade Iraq, 

and that's that.

<P>The campaign may involve thousands of casualties beyond the handful allowed 

in modern American wars, but no doubt the U.S. military can beat So Damn 

Insane, as a woman I know calls Hussein. He's so damn insane he frightens many 

Iraqi officers, and they could turn on him, if they think Bush will follow 

through on his threats.

<P>I sure hope the invasion plan works, whatever the plan is, if there is a 

plan, and I doubt it.

<P>The problem is Bush is engaged in too many wars right now to start another 

one. 

<HR>

Bush's buddies in business have been waging war on our retirement accounts. 

The president has been pretending he never met Ken Lay, while talking about 

holding executives accountable. But he still doesn't want more government 

regulation of business, and would like to hand Social Security over to Wall 

Street.

<P>This is the worst kind of guerrilla combat for Bush. He's in a free-fire zone, 

wearing regular-guy camouflage over his pinstriped CEO uniform. It isn't Bush's 

fault that the economy has tanked, but sending tanks to Iraq won't help. 

<HR>

Bush is waging war on the environment. He wants more SUVs and fewer trees 

in those outdoorsy SUV commercials. He wants to drill for oil in unspoiled 

land in Alaska. When the wells of Iraq are burning, he'll have another 

argument for that policy.

<P>Naturally, he didn't attend the Earth Summit. As one clerk at my grocery store 

said, "I guess you have to be an earthling to attend." 

<HR>

Bush is waging war against the middle and working classes, giving tax cuts 

predominantly to the rich. This class war has been going on under quite a few 

administrations of both parties. As Kevin Phillips shows in "Wealth and 

Democracy," between 1950 and 2000, corporate taxes as a percentage of total 

tax receipts fell from 27 percent to 10 percent.

<P>Bush is just the latest president to be driven by huge increases in business 

contributions to politicians of both parties. Whatever else their differences, 

Bush and Bill Clinton went to Yale and hang out with people whose money hangs 

out in the Caymans. 

<HR>

Bush and John Ashcroft are waging war on our civil liberties. Sorry, I've got 

to make this quick because the Patriot Act allows them to break into my house 

while I'm away. 

<HR>

The most publicized Bush wars lately have been political brushfire wars. 

Democrats, heads of friendly nations and some respected Republicans think 

we're strong enough to deter Hussein from using weapons of mass destruction. 

They don't think pre-emptively invading Iraq is such a great idea. Let us 

count the ways it may not be a great idea.

<P>Wars cost lots of money and the country is already in the red.

<P>Every oil-producing country in the world, including Russia, could get mad 

and force us to ride bikes.

<P>If threatened with overthrow, Hussein may use germ warfare on our troops. 

He's so damn insane he may decide to go down in a toxic cloud of murder-

suicide.

<P>If we win, we own Iraq, but we still haven't figured out what to do with 

Afghanistan. Look, running Baghdad-by-the-Bay is hard enough. Who wants 

Baghdad?

<P>Oh, yeah, it may not be right to overthrow foreign officials. Sure, it's 

been done to Guatemala, Iran and the Florida Supreme Court, but no good ever 

came of those interventions.

<P>None of this matters. Bush wants to invade Iraq. He got into Yale. He got 

into the Air National Guard. He got a baseball team. He got the Oval Office. 

He gets what he wants. He gets to invade Iraq.</p>
