<p>ELECTIONS IN TURKEY, Pakistan and Bahrain, and an electoral crisis in Israel 

&#8212; seemingly unrelated events &#8212; give a glimpse into our paradoxical 

relationship with the Muslim world. So do two other issues: Chechnya and American 

ethnic profiling. 

<P></P>

Take the last first. Shame on Bob Runciman, Ontario's minister for public safety 

and security, for applauding the U.S. policy of fingerprinting and photographing 

Canadians born in selected Muslim nations upon their arrival in the United States. 

Good for Foreign Affairs Minister Bill Graham for forcing Washington to back off. 

Even legitimate American safety concerns cannot justify singling out those already 

given security clearances here before being granted citizenship.

<P></P>

In standing up for the principle that "a Canadian is a Canadian for all purposes," 

Graham has served a greater purpose: signalling that the West and its allies are 

at war with terrorists, not Muslims. 

<P></P>

We cannot be prescribing democracy for Muslim nations while violating the basic 

rights of our own Muslim citizens. That's what the Bush administration has been 

doing, and paying the price in devalued moral currency. 

<P></P>

Canada's stance will, in a small way, help assuage the universal Muslim grievance 

that they are victims of double standards, in lost rights and lost lives, from 

Chechnya (100,000 dead) and Kashmir (60,000 dead) to Palestine (35 years of occupation).

<P></P>

That sense of injustice partly explains willing recruits for Al Qaeda and other 

groups.

<P></P>

Beyond the war on terrorism, we need a political strategy, not merely a marketing 

campaign to soft sell American virtues, as the State Department is trying to do 

with its $255 million propaganda blitz, launched in Indonesia last week. Diffusing 

anti-Americanism needs real policies &#8212; helping to find political, not merely 

military, solutions to the bloody crises feeding Muslim despair, and being more 

consistent in our dealings with Muslims.

<P></P>

As much as we need to bring Russia within the Western orbit, and George W. Bush 

needs Russian support for his planned war on Iraq, neither should come at the 

expense of permitting Vladimir Putin to "wipe out" the secessionist Chechens. 

Even while allowing him room to deal with terrorists forcefully, Putin must be 

encouraged to abandon Stalinist ethnic cleansing and to participate in the French 

and Danish efforts at political negotiations<b>.

<P></P>

</b>There is even less chance of a military solution to the Israeli-Palestinian 

crisis. Labour leader Binyamin Ben-Eliezer said so in pulling out of Ariel Sharon's 

coalition government. 

<P></P>

Sharon has been deploying force for 20 years, starting with the 1982 invasion 

of Lebanon to stop "PLO terrorism." He has brought nothing but misery to innocent 

Israelis and Palestinians alike, notwithstanding Yasser Arafat's bankrupt leadership 

and the rise in vile suicide bombings. 

<P></P>

The collapse of the Likud-led government has reduced, not improved, the immediate 

prospect of a peaceful solution. Sharon faces a vote of non-confidence tomorrow. 

Should he lose, he must call an election, which he might win. If he survives the 

parliamentary test, he will do so with the support of rightist or religious parties 

even more hard line than he. <b>

<P></P>

</b>Such is the ebb and flow of electoral politics in Israel. But in Turkey, where 

voters go to the polls today, democracy will not be allowed to unfold as it should.

<P></P>

The mildly Islamic Justice party may win the most seats, but its popular leader, 

Tayyip Erdogan, has been barred from contesting a seat. He was once convicted 

and jailed for reading a protest poem in public. His party, too, may be banned, 

as was its predecessor, the Welfare party.

<P></P>

"Secular" Turkey prosecutes people of faith in politics. If church-going Bush, 

Tony Blair or Stockwell Day, or members of Israel's religious parties, were citizens 

of Turkey, they would be barred from public office for life. 

<P></P>

Yet we hold up Turkey as a model of a "moderate" Muslim state. Ironically, it 

remains too Muslim for entry to the European Union! 

<P></P>

The paradox is partly explained by the West's historic and contemporary reluctance 

to deal with political Islam. This led to crushing or diluting democracy through 

puppet regimes. The policy has fanned the very militancy it was designed to arrest.

<P></P>

In Pakistan, where Gen. Pervez Musharraf is emulating the Turkish model, Islamic 

parties had their best showing ever in an election after campaigning on nothing 

more concrete than anti-Americanism. 

<P></P>

They had never won more than 16 per cent of the vote. Last month, they garnered 

25 per cent.

<P></P>

In tiny Bahrain, home of the U.S. Fifth Fleet, the majority Shiites boycotted 

the recent election, protesting the impotency of the advisory parliament. As welcome 

as the vote was, it was not the democratic revolution the American media made 

it out to be. 

<P></P>

None of this is to say that Muslims are blameless for failing to produce a single 

workable democratic model, failing to come to terms with pluralism, and failing 

to abandon some of the most barbaric practices against each other, especially 

women. Rather, it is to suggest that we, too, must rethink our approach if we 

hope for sanity to prevail.
