Ohio is looking down the barrel of a nuclear apocalypse.  Its name is 

Davis-Besse.  Reopening it---as its owner wants to do---can be viewed as 

nothing more than an act of terrorism.  



<p>The 900-megawatt atomic reactor near Toledo has shocked even the industry's 

staunchest supporters.  An unexpected leak of boric acid has eaten through 

nearly six full inches of solid high-grade metal in a critical internal 

component.  Only 3/8 of an inch of carbon steel protection was left in tact 

when the hole was discovered in February.    Soon thereafter a second hole 

was discovered, raising widespread fears that the reactor could be riddled 

with untold other seriously deriorated sites.



<p>Boric acid is laced throughout the water that circulates through all 

Pressurized Water Reactors.  Similar structural problems have long been known 

in the much-vaunted French nuclear industry, whose 55-plus PWRs suffer from a 

syndrome known as Vessel Head Penetration Cracking, which threatens the 

entire industry.    



<p>As it always does, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which is supposed to 

protect the public, says there is no real danger.  But in the same releases 

it pointed out that the acid has compromised an extremely important safety 

feature common to all pressurized water reactors, the world's most widespread 

model.  There are 68 other reactors with similar designs in the US alone.  



<p>The NRC gets its funding from the industry it regulates, and has long been 

viewed as little more than a lapdog giving public relations cover to a 

corrupt, decayed plutocracy.  Critics generally refer to it as "No Real 

Chance" and "Nobody Really Cares."  Its chairman, Richard Meserve, recently 

launched a vicious personal attack against one critic who dared point out 

that America's reactors are still vulnerable to a terrorist attack from the 

air.  



<p>In the wake of September 11, a global debate led the industry itself to 

concede that no reactor containment on any commercial nuclear plant could 

withstand the crash of a jet the size of the ones that brought down the World 

Trade Center.  But while ground security has been increased at most reactor 

sites, there has been no significant upgrade in the ability of any commercial 

reactor to survive an attack from the air.  When Paul Leventhal of the 

Nuclear Control Institute, among others, pointed this out, Meserve went over 

the deep end.  



<p>Which is where all of Lake Erie and northern Ohio would go in the event of an 

attack or an accident at Davis-Besse.  FirstEnergy's aging atomic clunker has 

been likened to a radioactive jalopy, patched together with twine, hurtling 

down a steep hill.  At the bottom is the prospect of a literal apocalypse, 

whose radioactive releases could permanently destroy all of northern Ohio and 

the Great Lakes, the world's largest single reserve of fresh water.  A 

melt-down or terrorist-prompted explosion could kill millions, including much 

of the populations of Cleveland, Toledo and Detroit.  



<p>Davis-Besse is a deteriorating Three Mile Island-style relic which in the 

1980s ate millions in funky patches just to keep it on line.  Its latest 

safety shutdown has caused no blackouts or other noticeable strains on the 

grid that supplies northern Ohio with electricity.  FirstEnergy is now buying 

power from other sources, which are readily available.  



<p>The company is also demanding the right to slap in still more cheap fixes and 

throw Davis-Besse back on line as fast as possible.  FirstEnergy has its 

financial reasons.  But even the NRC has started to balk at the profound 

irresponsiblity of pasting on a few bandaids and then re-firing such an 

infernal machine.  There is talk of replacing some large internal components 

altogether.  But that would take FirstEnergy until 2004, by which time much 

of the public will have figured out there's no need for this radioactive Rube 

Goldberg contraption.  



<p>Last year nearly 1700 megawatts of windpower were installed in the US alone, 

more than twice as much capacity as is theoretically provided by Davis-Besse. 

 By 2004 far more capacity could be provided cheaply, cleanly and safely by 

natural gas or Great Lakes wind machines than by a reopened nuke.  



<p>Safety experts have now called for a thorough x-ray examination of every 

component of Davis-Besse and the scores of other reactors with similar 

designs.  But the attitude of the Bush Administration and the NRC has been 

that if this might cost FirstEnergy and other reactor owners a few extra 

dollars, then they won't do it, even if it endangers the future of the 

planet.  



<p>This is a profoundly important moment in this nation's history.  This kind 

grotesque risk being taken with the public safety cannot be tolerated.  

Davis-Besse must stay shut and the alternatives put in place.  To do 

otherwise would be an unparalleled act of terrorism, pure and simple.
