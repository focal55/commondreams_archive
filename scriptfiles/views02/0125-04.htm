Politicians and journalists have interpreted 

widespread support for the military actions in 

Afghanistan as a significant shift in Americans' 

attitudes toward war. In the weeks following the 

massacre of September 11, Vice President Dick 

Cheney described the crowd's reaction to a speech 

he made in New York: "There wasn't a dove in the 

room," he said with a smile.



<p>This isn't the first time in the post-Vietnam 

era that our leaders have made such 

pronouncements. "By God, we've kicked the 

Vietnam syndrome once and for all," President 

George Bush the First declared in 1991, in the wake 

of the Persian Gulf War.



<p>But their words are starkly contradicted by 

their own actions. In every military action since 

Vietnam, our politicians and generals have been 

extremely reluctant to risk American military 

casualties. In the Persian Gulf War, there were more 

soldiers killed in training and accidents (including 

"friendly fire") than at the hands of enemy troops. 

In the war over Kosovo we did not lose even a 

single pilot.



<p>The murder of thousands of civilians in the 

worst terrorist action ever on American soil seems 

not to have changed this part of the "Vietnam 

syndrome" at all. The US military has fought this 

war, like the others, from the air. Our planes now 

bomb from altitudes so high that they cannot even 

be seen by the fighters and civilians below. 



<p>When it came time to search the caves of 

Tora Bora for Osama and his friends, US officials 

started talking about "the right mix of incentives" 

(money, weapons) to get Afghans to do the job.



<p>From the safety and calm of their armchairs 

and op-ed pages, pundits have argued vehemently 

that American troops should take on these tasks. 

But this isn't likely to happen any time soon. 



<p>What our politicians fear, but nobody wants 

to talk about, are the political consequences of 

American casualties. This is not because Americans 

are lacking in courage; as the heroic actions of the 

firefighters and others at the site of the World Trade 

Center showed, there is no shortage of people who 

are willing to risk their lives for the sake of their 

fellow citizens.



<p>But since Vietnam, there has been a 

widespread mistrust of American foreign policy. 

During the war, we were told that we were helping 

the Vietnamese -- saving them and the world from 

communism. This turned out to be a huge lie, with 

terrible consequences. Millions discovered that the 

United States was really fighting a dirty colonial 

war that the French had abandoned. 



<p>Recent revelations have only reinforced this 

mistrust, as well as the worst picture imaginable of 

that war: the atrocities committed by former Senator 

Bob Kerrey, for example, or historian Michael 

Beschloss's analysis of President Lyndon Johnson's 

tapes, showing that he knew as early as 1965 that 

the war in Vietnam could not be won -- yet 

continued to send tens of thousands of Americans to 

die there.



<p>In the post-Vietnam era, Washington has 

mainly contracted out the dirty work -- mass murder 

in Guatemala and El Salvador, or trying to 

overthrow the government of Nicaragua in the 

1980s. But whether the US military was directly 

involved -- as it was in the invasions of Grenada 

and Panama, the Persian Gulf War and Kosovo -- or 

not, it is a sordid record. In general, US officials 

lied about the purpose of their interventions, and 

none of them had much to do with US national 

security.



<p>For these reasons, public support for the 

"War on Terrorism" is miles wide but only an inch 

deep. Our political leaders want to use this crusade 

the way they used the "War Against Communism," 

and more recently, the "War on Drugs" in 

Colombia: as an excuse for the violence and 

brutality that are necessary to police a worldwide 

empire.  



<p>It remains to be seen how much of this they 

can get away with, or whether they will expand the 

current war to countries such as Iraq, Somalia, Iran 

or elsewhere. But they know one thing very well: 

they cannot allow the US casualty count to rise very 

high before people begin to question their motives.



<p>This "Vietnam syndrome" will not be 

reversed. It is a permanent change in American 

consciousness, like those that followed the abolition 

of slavery or the victories -- however partial and 

incomplete -- of the civil rights movement. What 

will fade, eventually, is our leaders' addiction to 

empire. But when that goes, America will not have 

much need for foreign military adventures.
