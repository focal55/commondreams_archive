<p>Three years ago Time magazine carried an article by James Cramer, the founder 

of TheStreet.com, an online magazine fully dedicated to the worship of mammon. 

Extolling the virtues of a life dedicated to buying and selling shares from home, 

it was called "Yeah, Day Traders!" Cramer's message was simple. Forget teaching, 

forget tilling the land, forget making trucks or mending bones; instead make a 

living from speculation. There had, the article insisted, never been a better 

time "to trade for a living". 

<P>In his splendid book on the triumph of extreme capitalism*, Thomas Frank called 

1999 the summer of corporate love, and he was spot on. Just as in 1967, the promise 

was of liberation from the straight world of the past; the difference was that 

the drug of choice was not LSD but money. And the gurus of the revolution were 

not the Beatles and the Stones, but men like Cramer and James Glassman, who predicted 

that the Dow Jones industrial average would not stop at 10,000 but rise inexorably 

to 36,000. A suitable epitaph for the summer of corporate love would be John Lennon's 

for the Beatles when they split up three years after Sgt Pepper: "The dream is 

over." 

<P>Today the talk is not of when the Dow will hit 36,000 but how low it will go. 

Today, a magazine that used the headline "Yeah, Day Traders!" would be in danger 

of being torched by the small army of investors who have seen the value of their 

portfolios shrivel since the bubble burst in the spring of 2000. Today, the issue 

is whether the price of collective market insanity will be a serious global recession 

or, even worse, a full-blown slump. 

<P>There is an army of pundits out there willing to say that there is little to 

worry about. Policy makers everywhere are oozing reassurance, intoning the mantra 

that the economic vibes are good. Lawrence Lindsey, George Bush's economic adviser, 

was at it in the Financial Times yesterday, insisting that a recession in the 

US was "unlikely". 

<P>In reality, of course, nobody knows for sure what is going to happen. Financial 

analysts have their charts which are supposed to be able to predict the future 

from the past, and these now spell trouble. Economists who look at the hard economic 

data say that cheaper money and higher spending means things are getting better. 

But both presuppose that economics is a science rather than a modern form of alchemy, 

and that the practitioners in its black arts are anything more than highly-paid 

witch doctors. The only theory that is really relevant to the stock market is 

chaos theory. The recent history of the dollar is a case in point. For at least 

the past five years, the strength of the US currency has been eating into corporate 

profitability and contributing to a record trade deficit. Markets knew that the 

dollar was overvalued, but kept on buying it regardless. Over the past two months, 

the mood has changed and the dollar has fallen by 14% against the euro, breaking 

through the one-for-one parity level yesterday for the first time in more than 

two years. When will the fall be arrested? Who knows? On some estimates, the dollar 

is still 30% overvalued, but a rapid fall of that size would feed back into the 

equity markets, with foreign investors rushing for the door. 

<P>All of which explains why policymakers are a lot more concerned about the recent 

downward spasm in share prices than they are letting on. The sharp fall in American 

consumer confidence reported last Friday was a clear indication that the public 

mood has been affected by the declines on Wall Street triggered by the $3.8bn 

accounting fraud at WorldCom. Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, 

America's central bank, is giving testimony to Congress today but his words will 

be less important than the Fed's actions when it meets next month to set interest 

rates. 

<P>Greenspan's real fear is that the US economy will become locked in a downward 

spiral in which falling share prices lead to weak consumption, which in turn puts 

pressure on company profits and - eventually - the financial system itself. Asset 

prices would collapse and corporations be forced to slash prices in order to generate 

cash flow, leading to a period of deflation in which lower interest rates failed 

to stimulate growth. It could never happen, say the optimists. In fact, it already 

has - in the world's second largest economy, Japan. There, the country has had 

four recessions since its bubble burst at the end of the 1980s. Prices are falling, 

consumers are hoarding cash; it would take but one more shove to push the banks 

over the edge into systemic crisis. Greenspan has been studying a voluminous report 

he ordered into the Japanese experience; that's how worried he is. 

<P>The best that can be hoped for is that there are no more stories of boardroom 

wrongdoing over the coming weeks, and that some better (and honest) figures from 

some of the titans of corporate America produce a rapid recovery in share prices, 

which then boosts consumer spending. This would not provide a cure for the economy's 

ills, which are caused by excessive hi-tech investment and excessive borrowing 

during the bubble years, but it would at least buy Greenspan some time. 

<P> F ar more worrying would be a continuation of the falls in share prices over 

the next couple of weeks. In those circumstances, the Fed would then come under 

strong pressure to cut interest rates at its August meeting, and would almost 

certainly bow to it. There is, however, no guarantee that it would be effective 

in restoring confidence. Why? Firstly, it would be a small cut of only 0.25 percentage 

points from the already low level of 1.75%. Secondly, it might be counter-productive, 

seen as a sign that the Fed was panicking (which it would be). Finally, the relevant 

level of interest rates is the one being paid by companies and consumers on their 

loans. These have not been coming down nearly quickly enough to prevent financial 

distress. 

<P>The underlying problem is that since the mid-1990s, share prices are up by 

200% but corporate profits - as measured by sober government statisticians rather 

than dodgy auditors - have risen by 40%. It is conceivable that Greenspan would 

have to cut, cut and cut again before Wall Street responded. Even then (and assuming 

there is no invasion of Iraq to complicate matters), there is a risk that the 

easing of policy will simply lead to a re-run of this year - a short-lived burst 

of euphoria followed by the realization that companies cannot produce the earnings 

expected of them. Greenspan and Bush would then be in an even worse quandary than 

they are now, having used up nearly all the shots in their locker. Meanwhile, 

Europe and Japan - heavily dependent on a US recovery to keep their economies 

ticking over - would be faced with the prospect of deep, prolonged recession. 

<P>If this sounds gloomy, that's because it is. It would be the most critical 

moment for the global economy since the 1930s. There would, however, be one silver 

lining: people would ask how we got into this mess in the first place. The answer 

is that policy makers, dazzled by Cramer, Glassman and their friends in the financial 

markets, deliberately removed the brake pedal from global capitalism. And, as 

any engineer knows, the brake pedal is what allows the machine to travel safely 

at speed. Without it there are only two speeds - dangerously fast and dead slow.
