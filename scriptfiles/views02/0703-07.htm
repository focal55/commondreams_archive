<p>This Fourth of July, many American parents will no doubt be reading Lynne Cheney's 

alphabet book, <i>America: A Patriotic Primer</i>, to their children. 

<p>If kids pay close attention they will learn a lot, but unfortunately it 

will be a lesson in obfuscation and distortion. Cheney --the wife of the 

vice president, former chairman of the National Endowment for the 

Humanities and a noted conservative intellectual -- offers a whitewashed 

version of U.S. history that is morally and intellectually offensive.



<p>Note, for example, the letter T, for tolerance: "Free to think and believe 

and pursue happiness in our own way, we recognize the right of others to do 

the same." No argument with that sentiment; I'm all for tolerance.



<p>But skip back a few pages, to the letter N, "for Native Americans, who came 

here first," on a page adorned with drawings of American Indian notables 

and names of tribes.



<p>Even allowing for the fact that it is an illustrated children's book and 

not a detailed history, her N page leaves out some rather significant facts 

that could be easily summarized. Yes, the Native Americans came here first. 

Then the Europeans came. Then the Europeans killed almost all the Native 

Americans and took almost all the land.



<p>I suppose one could claim that the Europeans were T-is-for-tolerant of the 

Native Americans, at least tolerant of those who accepted less-than-human 

status and did what they were told. American Indians were free to think and 

believe and pursue happiness in their own way, so long as they got out of 

the way of the white folks who wanted the land and resources.



<p>And along the way, those white folks carried out the one of the most 

successful genocides in recorded human history. Depending on the size of 

the indigenous population in North America at the time of Columbus' arrival 

(12 million is a conservative estimate), 98 to 99 percent of that 

population was dead by the end of the 19th century.



<p>As native scholar Ward Churchill has pointed out in his book, <i>A Little Matter 

of Genocide</i>, the fact that a large number of those indigenous people died 

of disease doesn't absolve white America. Sometimes those diseases were spread 

intentionally, and even when that wasn't the case the white invaders did nothing 

to curtail contact with Indians to limit the destruction. Whether the Indians 

died in war or from disease, starvation and exposure, white society remained culpable. 

<p>I review that history not so all us white people can sink into a state of 

guilt; one can't be guilty for what was done before one was born. The point 

of telling the truth about the history -- of naming this original sin of 

the United States -- is to both establish some minimal level of 

intellectual honesty and enrich contemporary political debate. So long as 

Americans lie to themselves (or in the case of Cheney's book, lie to our 

children), there is little hope that white America and the United States 

government can deal honestly with the consequences of that genocide. White 

Americans shouldn't feel guilty about a depraved past we did not create; 

instead, we should take moral and political responsibility for the 

resulting inequities and injustices that remain in a society that accords 

us great privilege.



<p>That kind of honesty would lead us to question why the list of Indian 

notables on the page includes only one who fought the United States, 

Tecumseh. Even then, Cheney mentions only his attempts to create a 

confederation of Indian nations, deliberately excising the fact that 

Tecumseh's goal was to expel the white settlers. Don't bother looking on 

the N page for a mention of Crazy Horse or any other Indian who resisted 

the genocide. Apparently, they aren't part of Cheney's Native Americans. 

(To be fair, Sitting Bull appears on another page, though with no mention 

of his historical importance).



<p>This rendering of the Native American is particularly ironic coming from 

Cheney, who wrote another book called Telling the Truth: Why Our Culture 

and Our Country Have Stopped Making Sense--And What We Can Do About It. 

Apparently the truth should be told, except when it interferes with the 

task of cultivating patriotism in children.



<p>In Cheney's patriotic primer, H is for heroes and I is for ideals. In my 

assessment of her primer, H is for hypocrisy and I is for ideologue. Our 

children, deserve better.
