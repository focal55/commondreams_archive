Six months ago this Tuesday, al-Qaeda attacked the United States. In the days that followed, it became a commonplace to say that the world would never be the same. The war on America, America's friends agreed, was an attack upon us all. Now, the true nature of that changed world is finally being revealed. 

<P>Unlike the previous September that shook the world in 1939, whole populations have not been mobilized for total war. Instead, the change in our international order, like the shifting of tectonic plates, has been gradual, massive and dangerous. Simmering regional and local conflicts - in the Middle East and Asia, in the Philippines and in Colombia - have been brought closer to the boil by some governments borrowing the language and tactics of America's 'war on terror' for their local problems. Collaborative institutions, such as NATO, the European Union and the United Nations, are in danger of being sidelined or short-circuited by the United States.  

<P>The biggest change of all, however, has also been the most difficult to see. It is the way in which America, the world's only remaining superpower, has begun to think about itself. A state unrivaled in political, military and economic power has come to feel itself singularly vulnerable.  

<P>George Bush has determined that the world must be safe for Americans to live in. To this end, he and his allies undertook the 'war on terrorism' in Afghanistan. While that war has not finished, Mr Bush can still count his successes. The Taliban regime was quickly removed. A new government, albeit a fragile one with insufficient aid and assistance from outside, has been installed. Afghanistan as the functioning factory of al-Qaeda's export of terror has largely been closed down.  

<P>So far, so good. However, for all his determination to root out terrorism in Afghanistan, Mr Bush has still done too little in the business of winning hearts and minds outside the military arena. America and her allies, with the honorable exception of Tony Blair, have done too little to attack the root causes that produced al-Qaeda and the widespread feeling, particularly in the Islamic nations, that the world is ordered at the West's behest. Mr Bush's opportunistic - and wrong - decision to impose steel tariffs last week ridicules his own rhetoric about a free world founded on free trade.  

<P>Perhaps most worrying in our re-ordered world is the President's desire to expand the scope of the 'war on terror' to include the removal of Saddam Hussein. It is an understandable function of America's new sense of vulnerability that it has identified threats elsewhere, in countries such as North Korea and Iran. Washington fears a threat to American interests in the future. For different reasons, Mr Bush and Mr Blair, the latter despite considerable reservations from some members of his Cabinet, have agreed that Saddam must go. But even in America, where Secretary of State Colin Powell is signally cautious, there is not unanimity. And we await the publication of evidence of the claimed link between Iraq and 11 September.  

<P>For the Prime Minister, this is a visceral and moral issue, and almost none would mourn the passing of Saddam. However, the crucial test of extending the war to Iraq is whether it would make the world a safer place. Saddam could certainly be removed by military power, but no obvious successor currently exists. Instead, there is a danger of removing one regime without finding a replacement, leaving Iraq vulnerable to internal factional conflict. Any action against Iraq needs to be certain to yield the long-term stability that that country desperately needs.  

<P>For all the horror of Saddam's rule, a pre-emptive war against an unspecified potential threat, even one assiduously framed in UN resolutions, would be a war of aggression. It could be justified by the new doctrine of 'humanitarian intervention' forged in Kosovo and elsewhere. Nonetheless, there remains a risk of how it might be perceived in the same alienated and disenfranchised Islamic communities across the world that threw up the suicide hijackers of 11 September and the membership of al-Qaeda. Far from draining the swamp of terror, it could create another cause, like the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan, around which malcontents could rally.  

<P>That remains the most important lesson for us six months after 11 September. That tragedy has tutored the public in a - perhaps complacent - West that what happens in the rest of the world has, more than ever, implications for our own security.</p>
