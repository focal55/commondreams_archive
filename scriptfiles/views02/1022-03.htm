<p>The Bush team's ridiculous and wildly inflammatory anti-drug ads are still 

running in heavy rotation. You know the ads: innocent-looking, middle-class teens 

admitting their culpability for the vicious consequences of the drug trade. "I 

helped blow up buildings," says one doe-eyed youth.

<p>So if that is legitimate logic, and our president says it is, perhaps we should 

start a little ad campaign of our own to sabotage another misguided Bush campaign: 

the war on conservation.

<p>The idea sprang forth after the startling announcement that the administration 

was taking precious time off from an actual, necessary war -- the one on terrorism 

-- to sue the state of California for daring to require that car makers put more 

energy-efficient models on the road.

<p> Turning the letter of the Federal Clean Air Act against its clear intent, 

Department of Justice lawyers lined up on behalf of the administration's friends 

in the hydrocarbon-loving auto manufacturing industry and argued that as long 

as California's cars were in compliance with federal standards, the state could 

not impose tougher ones.

<p>For those keeping score, the Bush administration is in favor of states' rights 

when the states want to weaken federal safety standards of any kind and against 

states' rights when the states want stronger measures.

<p>So how about using the same shock tactics that the administration uses in the 

drug war to confront the public with the ultimate consequences of its energy wastefulness. 

Imagine a soccer mom in a Ford Excursion (11 mpg city, 15 mpg highway) saying, 

"I'm building a nuclear bomb for Saddam Hussein." Or a mob of solo drivers tootling 

down the freeway at 75 mph shouting in unison: "We're buying weapons that will 

kill American soldiers, Marines and sailors! Yahoo!"

<p>Scott Burns, co-creator of the "Got Milk?" campaign, already has two ad scripts 

ready to go.

<p>The first one feels like an old Slim-Fast commercial. Instead of "I lost 50 

pounds in two weeks," the ad cuts to different people in their sport utility vehicles: 

"I gassed 40,000 Kurds," "I helped hijack an airplane," "I helped blow up a nightclub," 

and then in unison: "We did it all by driving to work in our SUVs."

<p>The second ad, which opens on a man at a gas station, features a child's voice-over 

throughout: "This is George." Then we see a close-up of a gas pump. "This is the 

gas George buys for his car." Next we see a guy in a suit. "This is the oil company 

executive who makes money on the gas George buys." Close-up on Al Qaeda training 

film footage: "This is the terrorist organization supported by money from the 

country where the oil company does business." It's followed by footage of 9/11: 

"We all know what this is." And it closes on a wide shot of bumper-to-bumper traffic: 

"The biggest weapon of mass destruction is parked in your driveway."

<p>Can the administration seriously deny that oil dollars finance a spreading 

slick of evil in the world today? In Iraq, oil money has kept Hussein's repressive 

regime afloat even in the midst of tough U.N. sanctions.

<p>In Saudi Arabia, our second-largest foreign supplier of oil, the money spent 

at U.S. pumps pays for a feudal monarchy that has gorged itself on excess while 

supporting suicide bombers.

<p>Even our close ally Kuwait, our 11th-largest oil supplier, manifests an ambivalence 

toward the U.S. that, if you accept the Bush administration's drug war arguments 

about the validity of remote effects, resulted in this month's assassination of 

an American Marine while he was on a military exercise. Thank you, Exxon.

<p>Would it be so painful for us to slow down the intravenous drip of oil that 

keeps these hideously anti-American regimes alive? Some simple conservation measures 

-- chief among them increasing our fuel-efficiency -- would greatly reduce our 

dependence on foreign oil. There are car companies with electric and hybrid cars 

already on the market. And a little pressure on our wasteful ways could unleash 

a new wave of good old American inventiveness. 

<p>Bush Inc. has sided with the Enrons of the world to stifle energy-saving technology 

and keep the U.S. in an artificially prolonged state of dependence. Of course, 

waiting for the Bush administration to get religion on energy conservation would 

be about as fruitful as waiting for Hussein to welcome U.S. inspectors into his 

palaces. It ain't gonna happen. Unless, that is, the public makes it happen.</p>
