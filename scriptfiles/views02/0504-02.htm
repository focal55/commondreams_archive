<p>The General Motor Corp. just paid $1.2 billion to buy crucial parts of South 

Korea’s Daewoo Motor Corp. An April 30 AP article noted that the deal “has 

symbolic significance for the South Korean government.”  It has made good on 

its vow “to attract foreign investment to restructure the corporate sector 

following the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis.”



<p>“This is the market we need to be in,” said GM Chairman John F. Smith. The 

newly formed operation will include GM’s purchase of three Daewoo 

factories—one Vietnamese and two South Korean.  The world’s biggest 

automaker is centralizing its production by swallowing up a rival.



<p>For more details, we return to Smith.  He praised the combining of GM’s 

research and development with Daewoo’s ability “to develop new products in a 

very fast manner.”  Translation: Increased mechanization in GM’s new Asian 

factories will increase the exploitation of workers.



<p>Their hourly output, or productivity, will rise.  In other words, the 

workers’ labor will create more value.  It will, in turn, flow away faster 

from them to the owners of GM.



<p>GM’s centralization of production in the U.S. between 1996 and 2001 

foreshadowed its current move in the Asian market.  Fortune Magazine 

reported that GM had 365,000 U.S. employees in 2001, down from 647,000 in 

1996.  However, GM's revenues grew five percent between 1996 and 2001.



<p>On one hand, centralization of production makes workers more productive.  On 

the other, it also increases the number of workers out of a job.  This helps 

to depress the wage demands of those who remain employed.



<p>Daewoo car dealers understand this.  They held an April 30 protest against 

the GM takeover.  GM also plans to transfer South Korean sales subsidiaries 

abroad.



<p>Prosperity for a few means poverty for many.  As centralized production 

forces workers to compete for jobs, companies must also compete for markets. 

  The credit system facilitates this competition.



<p>Take Daewoo.  It declared bankruptcy two years ago.  Daewoo had “an 

estimated debt of $17 billion after years of reckless expansion on borrowed 

money,” according to the AP article.



<p>Before the financial crisis that began in 1997, South Korean firms like 

Daewoo were part of the booming “Asian tiger economies.”  Praise for them 

was loud from the officials sources.  Here was “proof” of capitalist 

success.



<p>The fact of the matter is that “reckless expansion” is a way of saying that 

Daewoo made more cars than it could sell.  However, overproduction by 

corporations is nothing but the normal functioning of the capitalist system. 

  Production booms cause production busts.



<p>Consider for a moment the U.S. telecommunications industry.  It flew high 

until overproduction hit, leading to crushing debt loads, employee layoffs 

and plunging stock prices.  WorldCom is a recent case in point.



<p>In addition, “reckless expansion” by corporations begets the monopolization 

of production.  Accordingly, corporations in stronger financial positions 

take over those with weaker balance sheets.  GM ate and Daewoo was eaten.



<p>GM’s centralization of production is nothing nice for the working-class in 

the U.S. or Asia.  Such is the system in 2002!
