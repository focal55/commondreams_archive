<p>HONOLULU &#151; A dozen young journalists from across Asia listened carefully 

to the words of President Bush as he addressed Americans on his need for congressional 

authority to go to war against Iraq. For most, it was their first visit to this 

country. The journalists are Jefferson Fellows at the East-West Center in Honolulu, 

beginning a month-long introduction to U.S. policies, politics and media. 

<p>Initial reactions were measured, in the polite manner of Asians &#151; even 

journalists. A day later, they reflected on what they heard and what they knew 

of their own countries. The reflections are not encouraging for hawkish elements 

of American leadership. 

<p>No one was applauding, several were still noncommittal, but there was a strong 

air of concern. 

<p>An Indonesian reporter recalled Bush's words, "we will not live in fear," and 

suggested that others, too, had the right not to live in fear &#151; and many 

are fearful of this proposed war against Iraq. Put simply, much of Asia is afraid 

of us, our rashness and our lack of long-term staying power. 

<p>Shaheen Salahuddin, an outspoken Pakistani television reporter and anchor, 

was most forceful. There will be no support in Pakistan, she said, and radical 

movements will be encouraged. Three days later, hard-line Muslim factions were 

victorious in the Pakistani parliamentary vote. 

<p>Salahuddin was critical of American abandonment of Afghanistan after the Russian 

pullout, citing that as an underlying factor in the rise of the Taliban. Afghan 

refugees, more than a million, are a destabilizing factor in Pakistan, she said, 

and many will stay because conditions even in the worst parts of Pakistan are 

better than those in Afghanistan. 

<p>Pakistan is one of two Muslim nations with reporters in the Jefferson program 

this year. The other is Indonesia, largest Muslim nation in the world. 

<p>Bambang Harymurti, editor-in-chief of Tempo magazine and one of Indonesia's 

most-respected journalists, was a guest of the program, and discussed the threat 

of a Muslim backlash in Indonesia. He made his comments before the bombing Saturday 

in Bali. 

<p>In respect to Iraq, Harymurti said a "quick and clean" campaign could be positive, 

if it brought regime change and the destruction in Iraq was minimal. But he said 

he feared, instead, a "messy, another Vietnam" type of action, and that would 

be a serious blow for moderate Muslim nations such as Indonesia. 

<p>Indonesia, he told the group, houses radical Islamists but they are a minority 

and not supported by most Indonesians. Help democracies develop in nations such 

as Indonesia, he pleaded: "It's better for outsiders to let us create our own 

(democratic leaders). ... Americans want instant democracy and you cannot create 

instant democracy." 

<p>Harymurti believes Indonesia must be taken more seriously by Western powers, 

and could be a test of whether democracy and Islam can co-exist. Indonesia has 

moved throughout history from Buddhism to Hinduism to Islam, changes coming through 

trade with nations holding those faiths, he noted. The result is a largely secular 

country in its politics and government, although 90 percent of its population 

is Muslim. 

<p>Although journalists from Pakistan and Indonesia were most outspoken, having 

the most at risk as the U.S. confronts an Islamic state, other Asian journalists 

were skeptical of the Bush initiative. 

<p>Chit Win Maung, a soft-spoken magazine editor from Myanmar (Burma), expressed 

concern that the United States has never started a war in the past, that it was 

against the ideals that others believe Americans have. 

<p>Others are still dealing with the trauma of conflicts more horrific than 9/11. 

A young Cambodian reporter and editor, Thet Sambath, described how the trials 

of Khmer Rouge leaders still split his nation, which lost 2 million people to 

the ravages of Pol Pot. 

<p>In much of Asia, noted Indonesian reporter Ardian Gesuri, serious economic 

problems are the priority of governments that would be hard-pressed to deal with 

them if an American attack on Iraq creates an Islamic backlash. 

<p>One of the functions of the Jefferson Fellowships, an East-West Center program 

for 35 years, is to broaden the horizons of both American and Asian-Pacific fellows. 

Asian journalists, close to the pulse of their nations, could do much to broaden 

the outlook of Americans who believe invading Iraq is a slam-dunk without other 

repercussions. 

<p>You won't convince Pakistan's Shaheen Salahuddin, Indonesia's Bambang Harymurti, 

Myanmar's Chit Win Maung or most of the other dozen journalists in Honolulu that 

such is the case. They have seen plenty of terrorism, plenty of violence, and 

they know better.

Jefferson Fellowships.</i></p>
