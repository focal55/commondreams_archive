Has the 1996 welfare reform law helped poor people in America wean 

themselves from cycles of dependency?  President Bush thinks so.



<p>The nation’s old welfare system was "an enemy of individual effort and 

responsibility, with dependence passed from one generation to the next," the 

president said Feb. 26.



<p>A Feb. 27 New York Times article described Bush’s remarks partly as “vintage 

compassionate conservatism.”  Is this a little like the recent compassion of 

the president and Congress towards corporate America, including the $15 

billion bailout to big airlines?



<p>By 2007 Bush wants to more than double the number of welfare recipients 

mandated to work.  The unexamined assumption is that earning wages helps 

people to escape poverty.



<p>Reality is somewhere else.  Consider what the Economic Policy Institute 

found in a 2001 study, Hardships in America: The Real Story of Working 

Families.



<p>EPI researchers discovered that the basic family budget levels of 29 percent 

of U.S. families failed to cover their basic needs as set in their 

communities.  The basic needs were the costs of food, medical care and 

shelter, etc., with no money budgeted for dining out, entertaining, savings 

or vacationing (www.epi.org).



<p>There's more.  “The study showed that the number of poor people in this 

country is actually two and-a-half-times as many as the official government 

poverty line identifies,” noted economist John Rowntree.  Recall that 

America, the most militarily powerful nation now and in history, led the 

developed world in rates of child poverty before welfare reform.



<p>What’s the bottom line?  The president’s free market solutions to poverty 

are the problem because there are not jobs for all people that pay a livable 

wage.



<p>The free market is like no other.  How, you ask?



<p>People are free to enter into contracts to sell their labor-power to buyers. 

  The same sellers have also been freed from the ability to provide for 

themselves.



<p>Labor-buyers are free to keep the value they gain from purchasing 

labor-power.  The more people selling their labor-power the better for those 

who purchase it, since the sellers have no choice if they want to continue 

their existence.



<p>The starvation factor is a weapon against workers.  People don’t willingly 

starve themselves.



<p>Forcing more welfare recipients into the market for labor-power increases 

the number of people competing for jobs.  This is supposed to promote 

personal responsibility but actually boosts profitability for buyers of 

labor-power who hold the upper hand when two people are competing for one 

job.



<p>Freedom is illusory when people’s labor-power is a commodity.  This 

commodity is central to capitalism.



<p>A long-term goal is abolishing labor-power as a commodity.  This could place 

people in control of work instead of work controlling them, the current 

practice.



<p>In the short-term, however, we must support progressive changes to welfare 

reform, most of which ends this year and is set to be reauthorized and 

rewritten.  The first Congress of the U.S. Basic Income 

Grant, to be held in New York, March 8-9, may be a step in that direction
