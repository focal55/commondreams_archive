<p>A recent U.N. report flies in the face of Washington's mantra that free markets are the only path to economic growth and democracy.</p>

<p>The Human Development Report 2002 warns that many countries that took steps toward democracy following the Cold War are either stalling or ''slipping back to authoritarian rule.'' The application of free-market nostrums in the developing world in fact has aggravated poverty. It has led to declining standards of living and widening income disparities. By the end of the 1990s, 52 countries wound up poorer than at the beginning of the decade, according to the report.</p>

<p>Despite this, Washington has long proposed that countries should first focus on economic growth and trust that lagging social indicators will follow. In a speech delivered last year to Latin American leaders alarmed at the Argentine implosion, President Bush insisted that ``nationals throughout our hemisphere need to strengthen our commitment to market-based reform, not weaken it.''</p>

<p>Today 211 million out of Latin America's population of 510 million live in poverty, with 86 million too poor to purchase even the most basic necessities. Seventy percent of those polled for the report in the region complain of increasing levels of poverty, crime, corruption, drug trafficking and addiction.</p>

<p>Given that Bush has tied democracy with free markets, many Latin Americans' disillusionment with free markets is spilling over into their disillusionment with democracy.</p>

<p>Argentina's economic implosion several months ago is a perfect example of what happens when countries yield to Washington's demand that economic growth be prioritized over poverty alleviation. Having defaulted on its $141 billion in public debt late last year, the country faces political and social mayhem. President Eduardo Duharte is calling for early elections, and one in five Argentines is unemployed.</p>

<p>The economic malaise in Argentina has proved contagious, with the economies of Peru, Paraguay, Brazil, Venezuela and Colombia, among others, suffering painful contractions. In Peru, massive public protests have forced the government of President Alejandro Toledo to cancel the privatization of state-owned enterprises. Similar anti-privatization protests in Paraguay have led that country to declare a state of emergency.</p>

<p>In Brazil, stock markets continue to tumble as polls note the commanding lead of leftist labor leader Luis Inacio da Silva in the October presidential race. Da Silva has hinted that he may default on Brazil's $333 billion in public debt.</p>

<p>Venezuelan President Hugo Ch&aacute;vez faces the possibility of another coup as the gap between political divisions in that country widens. And in Colombia, a 38-year-old civil war pitting Marxist guerrillas against right-wing paramilitaries has begun to creep to the urban centers. Alvaro Uribe, who will take over as Colombia's president in August, has promised to form a one-million-man civilian militia to combat the guerrillas.</p>

<p>As the U.N. report demonstrates, millions of Latin Americans have found out the hard way that Washington's strategy has been too narrowly focused on free markets.</p>

<p>Growing discontent threatens the spread of democracy and thus, in the long run, U.S. security. Washington must work with countries to first tackle their social needs through aid programs before insisting on market structures.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the U.N. report of- fers little hope that Washington is learning from its mistakes. Comparing levels of aid in relation to the size of national economies, the U.S. ranks below any other developed nation.</p>
