the heck, let's bomb Baghdad. Sure, it's one of the more historically important 

cities in the world, and many of its more than 3 million inhabitants will probably 

end up as "collateral damage," but if George the Younger is determined to avenge 

his father and keep his standings in the polls, that's the price to be paid.

<p>George the Elder, it will be recalled, was a bit squeamish about leveling Iraq's 

capital, but his son, who has emerged as a big believer in "regime change," will 

stop at nothing in his drive to win foreign victories that distract from his startling 

domestic failures. If nothing else, a nightly CNN fireworks display will take 

our minds off pervasive corporate corruption and the Incredible Shrinking Stock 

Market.

<p>Unfortunately for those determined to wage war in Iraq, there is no logical 

connection between Saddam Hussein and the big political problems facing George 

W. domestically. In a very real way, Bush's key corporate contributors, beginning 

with Enron's likable "Kenny Boy" Lay, have savaged the U.S. economy--and even 

Teflon politicians pay during recessions.

<p> Meanwhile, the so-called war on terror, which boosted the president's poll 

numbers astronomically, is falling into a dismal bureaucratic morass, and this 

week's Time magazine carries an exhaustive report reminding us that indifference 

to the Al Qaeda threat by the Bush administration before 9/11 is another scandal 

waiting to explode.

<p>Bush's claims in the first days after the Sept. 11 tragedy that Iraq was complicit 

in the disaster have never been backed up by any real evidence. The existence 

of an alleged, unrecorded encounter between one of the 9/11 terrorists and an 

Iraqi official in Prague has been debunked, reaffirmed, debunked again and on 

and on. Yet, while there is no credible connection with Hussein, there is ample 

evidence that the biggest funders and most enthusiastic cheerleaders of the 9/11 

terrorists came from the very Persian Gulf states that were saved by the first 

Bush war against Iraq.

<p>So, back to the old gambit that Iraq poses a threat of unleashing weapons of 

mass destruction. Our allies aren't buying it, and even Scott Ritter, the ex-Marine 

who conducted on-site U.N. inspections in Iraq, has testified before NATO that 

the current alarm is politically motivated and not supported by facts on the ground.

<p>Among the skeptics is Richard G. Lugar, the ranking Republican on the Senate 

Foreign Relations Committee, who questioned the lack of evidence supporting the 

war push after last week's Senate hearings: "We're all saying today that we haven't 

found the evidence, but somebody has to ask, 'Why not?' "

<p>The consensus of experts expressed last week before the Senate is that there 

is no hard evidence that Iraq has a nuclear weapon and that its biological and 

chemical arsenal, almost totally destroyed during eight years of inspections, 

would be of only local military application. No serious observer suggests Iraq 

has the ability to spread infectious "weaponized" diseases like smallpox to the 

United States.

<p>Hussein is clearly a brutal bully, savage in the repression of his own people, 

but he does not conform to the madman caricature of U.S. policy. The madman theory 

does not explain Hussein's ability to survive for decades by never crossing the 

line that would invite his obliteration. Instead, he is a devious chameleon who 

was once a U.S. surrogate and defender of the Arab world in the long, bloody war 

against Iran--and then turned around and invaded his Arab neighbor Kuwait when, 

according to some reports, U.S. diplomats led him to understand he could get away 

with it.

<p>Nor did Hussein use chemical, biological or nuclear weapons against U.S. troops 

during the Gulf War that followed, even though subsequent inspections established 

that he possessed variants of the first two. He sacrificed his army and continues 

to force immense suffering on his people, but he has been quite effective in preserving 

the sanctity and comfort of his own nest.

<p>For that reason, Hussein is likely to follow up on last week's offer for talks 

on the resumption of inspections by accepting the conditions imposed by the United 

Nations. If that happens, the Bush administration will be in a truly tough spot, 

as its so-called axis-of-evil theory disintegrates. Secretary of State Colin L. 

Powell has already initiated contact with the North Koreans, desperate for aid, 

and the theocracy in Iran is gradually crumbling. 

<p>Bereft of a credible Evil Empire, the administration will have to finally hunker 

down and deal with those forces at home, including some of the president's Cabinet 

and business cronies, who so far have done far more than Hussein to damage America.
