<p> When the current Congress convened last year there were lots of promises to 

curb predatory lenders that peddle credit on outrageous terms to poor, elderly 

and unsophisticated borrowers. 

<p>Not only is Congress reneging on its promises, but it is rushing to reward 

the lenders whose scams have devastated low, moderate and middle income families 

and forced many into foreclosures and bankruptcies. 

<p>Congress' gift to the predatory lenders is a scam artists' dream under the 

guise of "bankruptcy reform." The sponsors hope that this "lenders' relief" bill 

can be shoved through Congress in the last days of the session--before the American 

public realizes its elected representatives are rewarding the banks, credit card 

companies, finance companies and other financial corporations which have provided 

the Congress nearly $30 million in campaign contributions to promote "bankruptcy 

reform" in recent years. 

<p>The financial industry-along with its allies like gambling casinos and car 

dealers-are attempting to convert the nation's consumer bankruptcy law-which has 

served consumers and business well for decades-into a punitive debt collection 

enterprise which will keep hard-pressed consumers in what amounts to "debtors' 

prisons" for years. 

<p>The lobbyists for the credit merchants have consistently resorted to the tactics 

of the "big lie" with claims that the long-standing consumer bankruptcy protections 

are being abused by "dead beats" attempting to escape their debts. The hard facts 

gathered from surveys of bankruptcy filings show that 90 percent of all bankruptcies 

are triggered by the loss of a job, high medical bills and divorce. 

<p>Bankruptcy law always has been based on the principle that debtors facing impossible 

financial situations be given an opportunity for a new start-a second chance-to 

regain their role as productive citizens rather than being thrown on a human trash 

heap to satisfy the demands of the creditors. 

<p>Not only is this sensible and humane for the family trapped in unforeseen financial 

troubles, but it makes the utmost economic sense for local communities and the 

nation as a whole. Crushing families through a harsh bankruptcy law means more 

people on welfare rolls, off tax rolls and dependent on already hard pressed local 

charities. 

<p>Congressional supporters of the repeal of bankruptcy protections know quite 

well that many of the money problems faced by families today are the result of 

runaway credit card schemes of the past decade which have duped so many unsuspecting 

consumers. Credit card offers have filled mailboxes with come-ons of easy credit. 

Introductory offers of a low interest rate are quickly converted into double digit 

charges plus a mounting list of fees. As the card holder falls deeper into debt, 

the card companies continue to up the ante by offering bigger and bigger credit 

limits. Ultimately, the consumer is sucked into cascading debt multiplied by high 

interest rates and hidden and deceptive charges and fees. 

<p>And Congress-now so anxious to enact a punitive consumer bankruptcy law-has 

consistently rejected efforts to reign in credit card abuses. Instead, they want 

to punish the poor to bail out the credit pushers. 

<p>Congress' timing adds an extra note of cruelty to the conversion of bankruptcy 

into a punitive anti-consumer device. Thousands of workers are losing their jobs, 

savings and pensions as a result of fraudulent management at Enron, WorldCom and 

other large corporations. Many of these workers are left with only a few hundred 

dollars in the bank, no jobs and facing outlays for mortgages, education, transportation 

and other necessities in an economy where unemployment is at six percent and rising. 

<p>Members of Congress have turned out reams of news releases and uttered thousands 

of words of lament about the workers caught in the whirlwind of massive corporate 

fraud. But, now many of these same Congressmen are ready and willing-and anxious-to 

enact a bankruptcy law which will truly clobber these same workers. Next time 

you hear your Senators and Representatives express sympathy for the victims of 

corporate fraud, ask how they voted on the repeal of consumer bankruptcy protections. 

<p>And you might ask them how they justify shredding consumer bankruptcy protections 

while leaving corporations free to continue to avail themselves of an easy route 

through bankruptcy, shedding investor equity and reorganizing as viable companies. 

An soft easy landing for corporate bankruptcy versus a harsh punitive rocky route 

for consumer bankruptcy-an atrocious double standard. 

<p>How serious is Congress about protecting citizens against corporate excesses 

and unfair, unscrupulous and deceptive lending practices? The vote on wiping out 

consumer bankruptcy protections will come up in both the Senate and the House 

of Representatives in September. It will be a major test of Congress' ability 

to summon the courage to stand up to the massed lobbying forces of corporations. 

Forget the well-honed news releases and speeches-watch for the actual vote of 

your Senators and Representatives--for or against repealing protections for consumers 

on bankruptcy. This will be the hard telling evidence of who your elected representatives 

really represent in Washington. 

<p>Let your Congressman and Senator know how you feel about wiping out consumer 

bankruptcy protections - <br>
