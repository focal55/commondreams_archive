<p>The full effects of the 2001 so-called ``USA Patriot Act'' have not yet 

been felt, fortunately. But one of its first effects has been to benefit the 

president's brother, Marvin.

    <p>Marvin P. Bush, one of George W. Bush's three younger brothers, is 

co-founder and partner in Winston Partners, a private investment firm in 

Alexandria, Va. Winston Partners in turn is part of a larger venture capital 

entity called the Chatterjee Group, headed by venture capitalist Purnendu 

Chatterjee. (Venture capital firms provide money to start-up businesses and 

other companies, usually in return for equity and some managerial say in the 

company.)

    <p>Through this and other business relationships, this Bush sibling is 

positioned to do very well in high-tech activities as a result of provisions 

of the Patriot Act.

    <p>Securities and Exchange Commission filings show that the Chatterjee Group 

consists of Winston Partners, L.P.; and a half-dozen other entities with 

addresses in the Cayman Islands, the Netherlands Antilles, the Isle of Man and 

Delaware.

    <p>Bush's partner is Scott Andrews, with whom he went to school. Winston 

Partners has two branches, hedge funds and private equity funds, engaged in a 

variety of investments, including global ``outsourcing'' and offshore 

information technology.

    <p>H.R. 3162, called ``The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing 

Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act'' (or USA 

Patriot), was designed to prevent money laundering and requires banks to 

``know their customers.''

    <p>Inevitably, many companies are aggressively marketing services to make 

businesses ``Patriot Act''-compliant: that is, they sell computer systems to 

enable banks to argue successfully to Uncle Sam that they're not laundering 

money for terrorists. One of the most aggressive is Sybase Inc., which 

developed a ``Sybase PATRIOT compliance Solution'' months ago. Sybase, which 

said it wanted foreign banks as customers (it already had a deal with the 

People's Bank of China), landed Sumitomo Mitsui Bank in time for the October 

2002 compliance deadline.

    <p>This is where Winston Partners comes in. The Chatterjee Group, including 

Winston Partners, owns 5.5 million shares in Sybase (Chatterjee businesses 

also have been paid thousands more shares in Sybase). SEC filings show that 

Winston Partners LP owns 1,036,075 shares in Sybase; Winston Partners LDC 

holds 1,317,825 shares; and Winston Partners LLC owns 1,221,837 shares. The 

shares owned by the subsidiaries are collectively managed in funds for Winston 

Partners by Pernendu Chatterjee. There is also a Chatterjee Charitable 

Foundation.

    <p>Business for Sybase is business for Bush, and the Patriot Act boosted 

business.

    <p>Not that the Patriot Act is Sybase's only federal conduit. The company is 

also a significant government contractor (especially nowadays), with contracts 

from the Agriculture Department, the Navy ($2.9 million in 2001), the Army 

($1.8 million in 2001), the Defense Department ($5.3 million in 2001), 

Commerce, Treasury and the General Services Administration among others. The 

federal procurement database lists Sybase's total awards for 2001 as 

$14,754,000.

    <p>Sybase is only one of the companies with federal contracts from which 

Marvin Bush's firm derives financial benefit. Winston Partners' portfolio also 

includes Amsec Corp., which got Navy contracts worth $37,722,000 in 2001.

    <p>The potential for abuse here can hardly be overstated. A branch of the 

military or other government agency that risked funding cutbacks, for example, 

could throw up a buffer by awarding a contract benefiting the First Family. 

Why spend money on a lobbyist in the industry, when you might have one in the 

White House?

    <p>Now let's step back and look at the big picture. The president's brother 

is marketing to offshore customers (shipping out American jobs, be it noted). 

He is closely linked to entities marketing ``outsourcing'' and ``global 

alternative investments'' yet more aggressively. Companies associated with 

them are doing other high-end versions of the same. And some companies in 

which they have a stake are involved in the most sensitive technology outside 

nuclear weapons - being marketed simultaneously to the U.S. government, to 

foreign banks and to the states (Colorado, Texas, Oklahoma, New Jersey and New 

York also purchase from Sybase). This is ``security"?

    <p>Nor is Marvin Bush the only family member in this picture. His brother Jeb 

Bush, Florida's governor, is also an investor in the Winston Capital Fund, 

managed by Marvin Bush's firm. And Indigo Systems Corp., another federal 

contractor ($2,629,000 in 2001 from Defense and NASA), is substantially backed 

by The Carlyle Group, the global finance company connected to George H.W. 

Bush.

    <p>As we used to say in Texas, son of a gun.

    <p>There is a crying need for oversight and accountability, but the need has 

yet to be met.
