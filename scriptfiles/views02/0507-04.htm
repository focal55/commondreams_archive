<p>Over the last several months news reports of Bush

      Administration plans concerning the invasion of Iraq and the

      toppling of Saddam Hussein have appeared with relative frequency

      in the mainstream media. However, with very few exceptions those

      reports have emphasized either that these are contingency plans

      that have not been operationalized or the target date has been

      postponed until next year. In light of some recent circumstantial

      evidence and on-going signals from the White House, the later

      story especially, published in the New York Times, now seems

      like a case of Pentagon disinformation. The invasion of Iraq

      may be sooner than we are being led to believe by the propaganda

      machine.</p><p>Among the more telling signals not discussed

      yet in the mainstream media is the revelation that a number of

      MASH units are being called up to report for duty in July. These

      same units will be committed up to a 6 month period from the

      July date, that is, through the fall congressional elections.

      Added to this is the increasing reserve call-up of troops and

      the deployment of more warships to the region, including war

      games in the coming weeks with India. Further evidence of a push

      for a late summer/early fall invasion is the churning out of

      weapons, including the so-called &quot;low-yield&quot; nuclear

      bunker buster bomb.</p><p>With the White House still publicly committed

      to a &quot;regime change&quot; in Iraq, is there any doubt that

      the Bush Administration is undeterred by the lack of support

      anywhere in the international community for a war against Iraq?

      Even the Blair government, with potential back-bench trouble,

      is nervous about a war with Iraq, especially because it was unable

      to generate any hard evidence against Saddam Hussein's complicity

      with Al-Qaeda networks. Given the continuing unilateralism of

      the Bush Administration, there is no reason to believe that the

      Pentagon hasn't been given a green light for its invasion plans.</p><p>Of course, the conflict in Israel/Palestine

      may be seen as a complicating factor. Certainly, Saudi Arabia,

      Egypt, and Jordan, all staunch US allies, have made very vocal

      their criticisms of the Sharon government and the need for a

      just settlement for the Palestinians. Nonetheless, several factors

      have further underscored the reluctance of the Bush Administration

      to push Israel into accepting the Saudi and Arab League peace

      proposal. Among those factors are the hard-line congressional

      supporters of Israel and the just completed pro-Sharon Joint

      Congressional Resolution. Also, Pentagon hawks see Israel as

      the key ally in the war of terror in the Middle East. Hence,

      it's just as likely that Sharon's visit to Washington will consider

      Israel's role in the invasion of Iraq since Israel's military

      power may be required to keep the Arab states occupied during

      a US full-scale attack on Iraq. In fact, a recently published

      story by an Israeli military analyst suggests that Sharon would

      attempt to capitalize on the war against Iraq to settle scores

      with other Arab states and even to begin a horrific &quot;transfer&quot;

      of Palestinians to Jordan.</P>



      <P>While Colin Powell and the State Department

      are making noises about an international summit on the Middle

      East, given the intransigence of the Sharon government, it's

      possible such a summit would provide a convenient forum to present

      dramatic new &quot;evidence&quot; of some violation by Saddam

      Hussein that would warrant a military response by the US. Given

      the recent involvement of the US in the attempted coup of the

      Chavez government in Venezuela, is it also not probable that

      a pretext to invade Iraq could be manufactured with the covert

      aid of US agents? This pretext would also provide a cover under

      the &quot;war against terrorism&quot; to circumvent the necessary

      Congressional debate and declaration of war. (Given the craven

      responses by the Congress in this area, it's hard to imagine

      there would be a majority to oppose such a war!)</p><p>The domestic fallout from a war against

      Iraq in the late summer/early fall would be to once more use

      the drumbeats of mindless militarism and punitive patriotism

      to dominate the political agenda and muffle any sound of dissent.

      Given the fact that some Democrats are beginning to criticize

      the Bush Administration on domestic policy, shifting the spotlight

      to waving the flag could effectively silence the Democrats and

      give the politically bankrupt Republicans the only forum through

      which they could effectively attempt to marginalize the electoral

      opposition. Of course, such a war could also potentially criminalize

      dissidents and a fledgling peace movement. Certainly, the Patriot

      Act has put in place all the repressive instruments for punishing

      anyone who gives aid and comfort to suspected terrorists.</p><p>While no one can predict any scenario

      with absolute certainty, there should be some clear understanding

      of why this Administration is hell-bent on a war with Iraq. Beyond

      the transfer of massive amounts of tax monies to the wealthy,

      the only real substantive imperative pushing policy for the Bush

      Administration is expanding the military and elaborating further

      the role of US hegemony throughout those areas of the world where

      oil is a fundamental resource. With so many members of the Bush

      White House bathed in the politics of oil (George W., Cheney,

      Rice, etc.), there is certainly an economic interest in taking

      out Saddam Hussein and putting in power a more pliant regime,

      ala Afghanistan. Also, given the conflicts of interest inside

      this Administration with the military-industrial complex (e.g.

      the Rumsfeld-Carlucci-Carlyle connection), there is an overwhelming

      push for deploying more and more weapons and troops around the

      world.</p>

<p>Of course, there should be no illusions

      that an invasion of Iraq would be an easy &quot;victory.&quot;

      One Pentagon study pointed to an &quot;acceptable&quot; death

      rate of 20,000-30,000 US soldiers. The arrogance of such chilling

      scenarios is further compounded by the lack of estimates of the

      number of &quot;acceptable&quot; Iraqi deaths. Given that this

      and previous Administrations have been willing to sanction the

      deaths of hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians by the withholding

      of vital medicines and materials, what number of actual deaths

      by missiles, bombs, and even potentially &quot;low-yield&quot;

      nuclear weapons would the Bush Administration tolerate? What

      level of disruption in the Middle East and potential blowback

      would be tolerable? Given the near-religious zeal of Pentagon

      hawks and evangelical fervor by Bush himself in fulfilling his

      destiny to rid the world of one of the linchpins the &quot;axis

      of evil,&quot; it's not difficult to imagine the moral blindness

      and near insanity of such policy-makers in their pursuit of war

      against Iraq.</p>

<p>The final question remains whether the

      citizens of the United States would tolerate such a maniacal

      war in their name. Certainly, the passions of the Middle East

      will be inflamed. No doubt what's left of the left in Europe

      will be in turmoil over an invasion of Iraq. How quickly and

      effectively an opposition will mobilize in the US will, to some

      extent, determine how homicidal the Bush Administration will

      be in its warmaking. Unfortunately, unless there is some totally

      unforeseen circumstances, there will be an invasion of Iraq sooner

      than later. And the sooner we plan to try to stop the war, or,

      at least, deter the worst ravages of such a war, the better for

      all concerned.</P>
