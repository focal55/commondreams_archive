As Israeli tanks and bulldozers pull back from their "incursions" into West Bank 

towns and refugee camps and humanitarian aid workers take their place, Americans 

are gradually seeing the other side of an Israel most have never imagined existed. 

The sight is not pretty. 

<P> For Americans schooled in film and worship for democracy, Israel has been 

the land of Exodus and kibbutzes, of dedicated and hard-working people who look 

like us and speak our language. 

<P> Now television images evoke entirely different images. Israeli troops have 

cleared some of the bodies (which army commanders wanted to bury in a mass grave 

until the Israeli parliament objected), but plenty of horror remains. And Americans 

are discovering the "camps." 

<P> Americans who go to the Holy Land see what we and our hosts want us to see. 

Jews see their high holy places in Jerusalem, visit a kibbutz and enjoy lively 

intellectual life and entertainment in Tel Aviv. They might see a Jewish settlement 

in the West Bank, but only if they have family there. Christians see Jerusalem 

and Bethlehem and visit their high holy places. Only Palestinian Americans might 

find their way to what we call a refugee camp. 

<P> Now, other Americans are seeing what they never saw before. 

<P> In 1982, on assignment for King Broadcasting, I was in camps in Lebanon, Jordan 

and the West Bank. It was an eye-opening experience, even 20 years ago. 

<P> The word "camps" is a misnomer. Some of these "camps" in the West Bank have 

been there since the establishment of Israel in 1947 and the subsequent Arab-Israeli 

war of 1948. Some 300,000 Arabs fled Israel and settled in camps in the West Bank. 

They are still there, or their descendants are, and they have developed small 

cities around the original camps. 

<P> But despite the permanence of their settlements, they consider themselves 

refugees, because they are stateless. These camps are not for tourists. They are 

cramped, crowded, often deficient in sanitary and health facilities, and full 

of people who are angry, humiliated and desperate. Unemployment and birth rates 

are high, and the result is a population with few good reasons to live and plenty 

of good reasons to die for a cause. 

<P> Camp children are educated in schools without a fraction of the resources 

of the excellent Israeli schools. Schools are filled with heroic images of Palestinian 

"martyrs," fighters who have died for the cause of a Palestinian state. 

<P> In these camp-towns, Palestinians who cannot escape to cities or go abroad 

live their lives. Descendants of farmers and laborers, poor people who lived in 

the area before the creation of Israel in 1947, are the people of the camps. They 

have businesses, services, schools, mosques and churches. 

<P> But because these settlements were originally built to be temporary, streets 

are as narrow as alleys, housing is concrete block at best, and public utilities 

are crude and easily disrupted. One is assailed by the sounds, sights and smells 

of a vibrant people in conditions we would call slums, making a life as best they 

can. 

<P> Masses of people, a majority very old or very young, live huddled together 

with no safe refuge from military force. Imagine a huge tank or bulldozer in the 

alley behind your home, crushing everything in its way and you can imagine these 

behemoths in a Palestinian camp such as Jenin. 

<P> Israel may be the world's first nation to use the bulldozer as a primary weapon; 

the devastation it can cause is staggering. The camps breed foot soldiers of the 

intifada, those who carry the bombs on their belts, because there is so little 

hope in life that a glorious death at least honors their family. Camps have the 

large families associated with poverty, and the raw emotions and anger associated 

with lack of education. 

<P> The camps, particularly Jenin, have proved to be a nastier assignment for 

the Israelis than anticipated. Palestinians in the cities backed off when the 

tanks rolled in; the camps fought back. The resistance is not entirely based on 

the presence of Palestinian fighters. It is also based on knowledge, engrained 

in every Palestinian, of what happened in the Sabra and Shatila camps in Beirut 

when the Israelis invaded in 1982. 

<P> Ariel Sharon, then the Israeli commander in charge, ordered his troops to 

stand aside while brutal Lebanese Phalangists cleaned out the camps. Some 3,000 

died before Sharon "discovered" a massacre had taken place. He was disciplined 

by the Israeli parliament; today he is in charge, and no Palestinian is unaware 

of the meaning of that. 

<P> American journalists entering the besieged camps are not yet calling Jenin 

a massacre, although the scale of the killing will surely be in the hundreds. 

European journalists, not as cautious in their language, may be expected to use 

the term. As for the Arab media, the pictures will be fodder for more anti-American 

actions. 

<P> Americans after Sept. 11 are no longer as shocked by the images of death, 

but the images we are beginning to see from what we call "camps" will forever 

change our image of Israel and, for both Israel and the United States, things 

will never be quite the same again. 

<P>
