<p>After meeting Vladimir Putin last year, President Bush assured the American 

people that he had looked into the Russian leader’s eyes and established that 

“he was a good man.” Whether Putin, who now expresses reservations about invading 

Iraq, retains that status is uncertain. It is clear that this President has extraordinary 

confidence in his ability as an opthamologist of the soul. Discerning obvious 

good and evil in the world, he moves singlemindedly with little tolerance for 

dissent. When political leaders of the left are motivated by such confident, singular 

visions, media portray them as mindless apostles of political correctness, demagogues, 

and utopians. When such a style emanates from the right, it becomes moral courage 

and political conviction. I believe that neither left nor right is well served 

by this mindset, but its dangers become all the more apparent as we approach war. 

<p>Though this Administration periodically invokes self defense, much of its rhetoric—and 

the evident contradictions in its case—belie this rationale. The case against 

Iraq rides on the Administration’s obsessive quest for “regime change.” Every 

state in that vital region must not only respect borders but deploy itself in 

such a way that it can never become a threat to US cultural, economic, or military 

interests. 

<p>The Guardian commented late last summer that” First the pretext was Iraq's 

non-existent links with… September 11. Then it was the anthrax attacks in the 

US, which turned out to be a domestic problem. Then it was the long-running dispute 

over Iraq's drastically depleted chemical and biological weapons capacity and 

its resistance to the return of UN weapons inspectors. But now that Saddam has 

begun to signal a climbdown on inspectors (apparently going a good deal further 

in private messages passed to the US administration via Jordan's King Abdullah), 

they seem to be something of a side issue after all. As John Bolton, the US undersecretary 

for arms control, blurted out, the "regime change" policy "will not be altered, 

whether inspectors go in or not".” 

<p>Responding to such criticisms, the Administration now seeks to resurrect the 

al-Qaida connection, but, as the Washington Post comments, even US intelligence 

officials discount such reports. The Administration’s further contention, that 

an al-Qaida official sought medical treatment in Iraq would, even if true, hardly 

constitute a role in sustaining terrorism even remotely equal to the part played 

by many prominent Saudis. 

<p>Iraq’s Arab neighbors fear a US attack on Iraq more than an Iraqi attack on 

them. One Israeli military analyst even comments: “there is no such thing as a 

long-range Iraqi missile with an effective biological warhead. No one has found 

an Iraqi biological warhead. The chances of Iraq having succeeded in developing 

operative warheads without tests are zero.” In any case, Saddam Hussein, a ruthless, 

secular tyrant interested in preserving his own power, is unlikely either to unleash 

biolgocal weapons or pass them to suicidal terrorists. As Middle Eastern expert 

Stephen Zunes points out, if Osama had such weapons, Saddam might be his first 

target. 

<p>Attacking Iran offers few certain benefits and poses open-ended risks. Even 

the bombing of the weak and despised Taliban network yielded much less than many 

now suggest. The New York Times reported in June that: “Classified investigations 

of the Qaeda threat now under way at the FBI and CIA have concluded that the war 

in Afghanistan failed to diminish the threat to the United States … Instead, the 

war might have complicated counterterrorism efforts by dispersing potential attackers 

across a wider geographic area.” 

<p>An attack on a far stronger Iraq both licenses and might catalyze war between 

Pakistan and India, Saddam’s use of his remaining arsenal against US forces or 

Israel, a possible Israeli nuclear strike, and dangerous responses by other Arab 

nations facing new domestic unrest in the wake of an intensified US presence in 

the Gulf. Terrorism on US soil, as even the CIA acknowledges, become more likely 

if the US threatens Saddam’s survival. 

<p>Defenders of pre-emptive strike against Iraq are right about one thing. Simply 

opposing this war is not enough. But there are better preventive strategies than 

war. In the seventies and eighties, grass roots mobilizations—often collaborating 

across borders-- encouraged democracy in formerly totalitarian societies, limited 

the testing and development of nuclear weaponry, enabled mutual security pacts, 

and forced more generous international economic policies. Contrary to views now 

widely held, activism both in the developed West and in many “Third World” states 

did inhibit the spread of nuclear weapons to many nations once expected to gain 

them. 

<p>It is time to enforce UN Resolution 687—in full. That resolution requires establishment 

throughout the Middle East of a zone free of weapons of mass destruction, which 

would eliminate not only Iraqi weapons but also nuclear and chemical stores likely 

held by Israel, Syria, and Egypt. Yet for these hopes to bear fruit, this Administration 

must be forced to acknowledge that it is not the sole source of and means toward 

a just world order.
