<p>The Democrats' loss in both houses of

Congress has prompted more than the usual debate

over what went wrong. It seems clear that the most

fundamental strategic error made by the Democrats

was to allow President Bush to displace their issues

by making Iraq dominate media coverage of the

election season.



         <p>It is important not to bury this lesson, as the history of this election is already being rewritten. Trent Lott, Senate Republican leader, claims a mandate for the President: "The American people said, 'Yes, we trust this man'," he said. And Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle, whose surrender to President Bush helped seal his party's fate, concurred, saying that the elections have given the President "an opportunity here to enact and proceed with the plan (on Iraq) as he has articulated it."



         <p>But 80 percent of the electorate did not vote

for Republican candidates. So it takes quite an

imagination to see this election as a mandate for

anything except fixing our broken-down

democracy.



         <p>Back in August, things were moving in the

Democrats' direction. Due to massive fraud and

corporate crime, millions of older employees had

lost their savings and began postponing their

retirement. By a lopsided margin of 55 to 25

percent, the public said that President Bush cared

more about the interests of large corporations than

about ordinary working people. Democrats led

Republicans on the economy, the budget, Social

Security, and almost all of the biggest election

issues except "national security and terrorism."



         <p>Then George W. Bush discovered Iraq.



         <p>The Democrats could have said, why now?

How did Saddam Hussein suddenly become a

national security threat just 8 weeks before the

election? Or more politely, they could have told

President Bush to bring this up after the election, as

his father did with the first Gulf War.



         <p>But they caved instead. What is most

amazing about this surrender is that it is not, as in so

many other cases, a result of the corruption of our

politics by campaign contributions. There was no

clamor from Wall Street or the Chamber of

Commerce for attacking Iraq. There may be oil and

gas companies that stand to profit from this war, but

they give most of their political contributions to

Republicans.



         <p>Of course corruption is still part of the story

here. Democrats could have pursued a whole set of

scandals that might topple the Bush administration.

The Democratic leadership has apparently decided

to tread carefully in the area of corporate

malfeasance for fear that some of their own

luminaries might wind up on the wrong side of an

investigation. Clinton's former Treasury Secretary

Bob Rubin, for example, might have to explain

some phone calls he made to Treasury last year,

asking whether they were going to intervene to

protect Enron's bond ratings.



         <p>But the Democrats' betrayal on the war is a

different story. It is the latest, and the most morally repugnant, of a series of crucial political decisions in which telling the truth would have been a much better strategy even from the standpoint of their own self-interest. When President Bush proposed his massive tax cut, with 40 percent of it going to the richest 1 percent of the country (average

income: $1.1 million), they could have opposed it

on the grounds of fairness. Instead they chose to

complain about its effects on the federal budget

deficit. They posed as the party of fiscal

conservatism, making up all kinds of gross

exaggerations about the effect of tax cuts on the

deficit and the economy.



         <p>Thus voters are increasingly left with a

choice between a party whose principles favor the

rich and powerful, and another that has almost no

principles at all. It is no wonder that most do not

bother to show up at the polls.



         <p>Fixing this problem will require a major

overhaul, including real campaign finance reform

that puts an end to the legalized bribery of our

elected officials. But in the mean time, the

Democrats might want to consider a novel strategy:

tell the truth once in a while, at least when it's in

your favor. You can hardly do worse than you have

done with your poll-driven, don't-challenge-a- president-with-high-approval-ratings, gutless capitulation.
