George Will sees the specter of Nazis in the Mideast.  Take Yasser Arafat.  

He is “a Goebbels echoed by gullible news media,” Will editorialized 

recently.



<p>Goebbels was a Nazi propagandist.  For Will, he was a forerunner of Arafat.



<p>“The  culture of death that he has assiduously cultivated has produced a 

Palestinian population intoxicated with a pogrom mentality,” Will wrote 

about Arafat.  Apparently, religious persecution drives the Israeli 

Palestinian conflict.



<p>Will also dripped scorn for journalists who interviewed Arafat from his 

compound in Ramallah as it was attacked by Israeli forces.  Too much press 

freedom can be a risky thing for Will.



<p>Accordingly, reporting the views of Israel’s political opponents such as 

Arafat demonstrates his ability to fool journalists.  Will knows this to be 

true perhaps because he is an objective journalist, and can’t be so easily 

tricked.



<p>Additionally, Will framed Israel’s sequestering of Arafat with “Europe’s 

appeasement reflex, which is still strong 64 years after Munich.”  

Obviously, Europeans are unaware that in communicating with an isolated 

Arafat that they are expecting the tiger of the new Third Reich (the leader 

of the Palestinian Authority), to change its stripes.



<p>England’s leadership made a similarly fatal mistake with Nazi leaders  

before World War II.  For Will, the Free World still hasn’t learned its 

lesson on dealing with evil.



<p>Them and us.  Darkness and lightness.



<p>Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon is defending Israeli Jews, 

continued Will.  He, however, faulted Sharon’s “military tentativeness” 

concerning his undelivered threat to exile Arafat.



<p>Regrettably, Sharon is following in the footsteps of former President Reagan 

and candidate (now president) Bush, Will added.  They also said one thing 

and did another in dealing with Arafat, who can’t be trusted.



<p>The other side lies.  Our side tells the truth.



<p>Our leaders and ally have good intentions.  But we know where the roads 

paved this way lead.



<p>The fact of the matter is that Sharon, Reagan and Bush dropped the ball when 

they had a chance to neutralize the problematic Palestinian leader, 

according to Will.  But he has a solution.



<p>It follows from Israel’s illegal acquisition and occupation of the West 

Bank.  “Sharon should ship Arafat to Europe, where there is much official 

sympathy for him,” Will concluded.



<p>Will’s view of the presumed Nazi threat to Israel posed by Arafat in 

particular and the Palestinian people in general is a straw man.  This 

fiction of the militarily weak being otherwise is also present in the hearts 

and minds of Will’s fellow travelers such as the Israeli lobby.



<p>Will and the Israeli lobby have many goals.  A big goal is to continue the 

occupation—that is, the occupation of the U.S. Congress.



<p>This system has sent billions of American tax dollars to the Israeli air 

force, army and navy to make the Mideast safe for U.S. investors.  The 

economics of U.S. foreign policy in the region isn’t in Will’s public 

pronouncements.



<p>Instead, they feature the Nazism of Arafat, political representative of a 

people who have no armed forces.  Nor do they have a legal state, unlike 

Israel.



<p>Will wants us to forgot this.  We shouldn’t.



<p>Let us not forget one more thing.  Will’s equation  of the Palestinian 

people’s freedom struggle as a representative of the Third Reich’s barbarism 

does a disservice in the extreme to the memory of Jews killed by the Nazis.
