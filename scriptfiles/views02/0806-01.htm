MADE ONE great mistake in my life,'' Albert Einstein admitted, ''when I signed 

the letter to President Roosevelt recommending that atom bombs be made...'' The 

letter was brought to the president in the fall of 1939, within weeks of the beginning 

of the war. 

<P>Einstein and other scientists were worried that Hitler had embarked on an atomic 

bomb project, which is why Einstein's comment continued, ''... but there was some 

justification - the danger that the Germans would make them.'' (My source for 

this quote, and inspiration for this column, is Martin J. Sherwin's milestone 

book, ''A World Destroyed.'')</P>

<P>Motivated by an urgent impulse to achieve the atomic weapon before Hitler, 

a collection of the world's most brilliant physicists went to work. The first 

self-sustaining chain reaction was created at the University of Chicago in December 

1942, but then, unknown to the scientists, a strange thing happened. Winning the 

race against the Nazis stopped being the paramount concern. As the policy chiefs 

of the Manhattan Project began to see exclusive possession of the bomb as a source 

of tremendous diplomatic power, they recognized its potential as an unprecedented 

political check on the Soviet Union after the war. The bomb had a new, if as yet 

unadmitted, purpose.</P>

<P>In November 1944, the United States discovered that Germany's atomic program 

was embryonic: There was no real threat of a Nazi bomb. Sherwin suggests that 

this crucial intelligence may have been kept from the Los Alamos scientists ''in 

order not to dampen their enthusiasm.'' By this point in the war, there was no 

longer any real danger of an Allied defeat, yet the Manhattan Project proceeded 

with more urgency than ever. The policy chiefs had an eye as much on a post-war 

rivalry with the Soviet Union as on the endgame with Germany and Japan, which 

gave them a whole new motive for using the bomb as soon as possible.</P>

<P>Today marks the anniversary of the American atomic bomb falling on Hiroshima. 

The unfinished debate about whether that attack, and the subsequent bombing of 

Nagasaki, were justified has always focused narrowly on the question of the war 

with Japan. Didn't the atomic bomb, in effect, spare the lives of all the leathernecks 

and GI's who would otherwise have landed on the beaches of the die-hard island 

nation? What else could Truman have done? These questions have stymied the American 

conscience, making it impossible to seriously reckon with that crossing of the 

nuclear threshold, which in turn inhibits our moral reckoning with our present 

nuclear arsenal.</P>

<P>But what if the invasion of an all-but-defanged Japan was, and remains, a red 

herring? What if, just as the Nazi threat fell by the wayside, the Japanese threat 

was not the real issue by then either? What if, by the summer of 1945, the overriding 

purpose of the atomic bomb was not to end a conflict against Japan, but to control 

the shape of an anticipated conflict with the Soviet Union? What if it was not 

Emperor Hirohito we were mainly trying to terrorize, but Premier Stalin? Not a 

last shot against the Axis powers, but a first shot against the Kremlin?</P>

<P>In war and politics, there are never one-factor answers to complex questions. 

In truth, the atomic bomb was a last shot and a first shot both. The point of 

my asking is simply to suggest that, as a people insisting on a narrative in which 

Hiroshima marked the end of a conflict instead of the beginning of one, we have 

given ourselves a pass on a far more troubling question. </P>

<P>If we used the nuclear weapon as much to send a signal to the Soviet Union 

as to end World War II, then all the wickedness unfolding from that use - not 

only the arms race, but the demonic new idea that national power can properly 

depend on the threat of mass destruction - belongs to us. If Saddam Hussein wants 

weapons of mass destruction for the sake of the strategic diplomatic power they 

will give him, he is playing by rules written in Washington. There are two ways 

to use the nuke - as a source of world destruction, and as a source of world power. 

We did the former at the end of World War II, which was the exact beginning of 

the Cold War. We have been doing the latter every day since. And why should Hussein 

not want to imitate us?</P>

<P>The bombing of Hiroshima was a great crime. That the United States of America 

has yet to confront it as such not only leaves the past with unfinished business, 

but undercuts the possibility of present moral clarity about the exercise of American 

power and leaves the earth's future tied to a fuse that we set burning 57 years 

ago today.</P>
