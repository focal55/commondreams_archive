<p>It wasn't that long ago that The New York Times was known as The Good Gray Lady. With its fustian expanses of solid gray type and its fussy usages, the paper was the last bastion of Victorian standards in American journalism. 



<p>Then things changed. 



<p>The paper introduced new sections, like Living (or as The New Yorker once called it, "Having"), or Sunday Style, which treats you to pictures of people you never heard of in evening dress at parties you'd never be invited to. 



<p>Just last month, the paper introduced a Friday section called "Escapes" for people who might decide on the spur of the moment to jet off to Marrakesh for the weekend. It is no longer a surprise to find articles about lottery winners or cuddly animals on page one, where datelines from Moscow used to be. Chefs from chi-chi restaurants are now writing a regular weekly column. 



<p>Today's New York Times can be cringe-making. A couple of weeks ago, I joked to friends that the Times would probably replace the Pulitzer-Prize winning "A Nation Challenged" section with one called "Pedophile Priests" in order to milk the increasingly tabloid-y sex story. 



<p>I was wrong; the section is called "Scandals in the Church." 



<p>But the paper hit bottom with its Sunday Magazine profile of Erin Brockovich. 



<p>Is there anyone alive who doesn't know, courtesy of Julia Roberts, that Erin Brockovich is a good-looking woman who likes to party? Is there anybody with a serious interest in news who wouldn't like to hear about her new lawsuit against Pacific Gas and Electric for contaminating ground water? More, that is, than the brief mention the suit got in the Times article, wedged in among more important facts, like her predilection for a Sunset Strip boutique "that sells thongs with the word 'spoiled' in sequins on the front"? 



<p>I never knew that Erin Brockovich drinks vodka and cranberry juice. I don't care. What about that lawsuit? Oh, whoops, we now learn about the "pair of blatantly age-inappropriate, low-slung denim pants" she tries on. 



<p>How many people were injured by the groundwater? "I don't like my bellybutton showing," she says. "I really don't." 



<p>What is this poison, chromium 6, in the water? Forget that; listen to how Erin met the woman who played her on screen: "She said, 'I'm Julia Roberts, and geez, I don't even have my boobs in yet.'" Oh, some detail creeps in toward the end -- after her house and her money are discussed. But the boobs and the bellybutton dominate. 



<p>Ms. Roberts, if you're looking for boobs, some of them seem to be running The New York Times.
