<p>D-Day of December 8th quietly approaches - the day Iraq

must provide the UN Security Council with a complete

accounting of its weapons programs, plus its civilian chemical/biological/nuclear production and research activities. Even though UN weapons inspectors have criticized the December 8th deadline as unrealizable, the consequences for missing it will be catastrophic: Iraq will be in "material breach" of UN resolution 1441, and therefore subject to swift and decisive military action.



<p>But at this point, UN 1441 seems little more than a

whitewash pretext for a US-led attack on Iraq. With US warplanes patrolling Iraq's no-fly zone, bombing raids against Iraq ongoing, multiple aircraft carriers on alert and 60,000 US troops currently in or around the Persian Gulf, it's clear the war has already begun, "material breach" or not. When it's convenient for the Bush administration, Iraq will be found to have violated some aspect of the UN resolution, and the current buildup and covert military activity will explode into an all-out attack.



<p>The justification (that Iraq's Hussein violates

international law with his weapons of mass destruction

and is thus a menace to world peace) seems a bit ironic

in light of US actions in Iraq these past eleven years.



<p>Case in point. Article 54 of the Geneva Conventions clearly states that destroying 

or rendering useless items essential to the survival of civilian populations is 

illegal under international law and a war crime. Hard then to explain the 1991 

US bombing of electrical grids that powered 1,410 water-treatment plants for Iraq's 

22 million people. An excerpt from a 1998 <a href="http://www.e-publishing.af.mil/pubs/speclist.asp?puborg=AFDC&series=dd" target="_new">US 

Air Force document</a>, entitled "Strategic Attack," chillingly explains: "The 

electrical attacks proved extremely effective ... The loss of electricity shut 

down the capital's water treatment plants and led to a public health crisis from 

raw sewage dumped in the Tigris River." A second US Defense Intelligence Agency 

document, 1991's "Iraq Water Treatment Vulnerabilities," predicted how sanctions 

would then be used to prevent Iraq from getting the equipment and chemicals necessary 

for water purification, which would result in "a shortage of pure drinking water 

for much of the population" leading to "increased incidences, if not epidemics, 

of disease." 

<p>So basically, in defiance of international law, the

United States knowingly destroyed Iraq's water supply,

then for the past eleven years has prevented the

contaminated drinking water from being treated, even

though it was obvious those most affected would be

millions of citizens doomed to preventable disease and

death. If that's not a material breach, what is?



<p>Then there's the depleted uranium (DU) weaponry the

United States and its allies used on Iraq during the

Gulf War, despite foreknowledge its radioactivity would

make food and water in the bombed regions unsafe for consumption on an indefinite basis (DU remains radioactive for 4.5 billion years). Add in the fact that trails of carcinogenic dust left in a DU bomb's wake spread in the wind to be absorbed by plants and animals, thereby devastating a region's food chain. Of course, humans inhale and absorb DU dust as well, which has most likely led not only to dramatically elevated levels of birth defects and cancer cases among Iraqi civilians, but also to a wide litany of suffering among Gulf War vets; a recent study, for example, found that even nine years after the war, veterans afflicted with Gulf War Syndrome ailments still had DU traces in their urine. This while there has yet to be any US governmental study on the effects of DU inhalation...



<p>We can expect DU to be used in the next attack on Iraq too, in spite of the 

inhumane risks to civilians and military personnel alike. According to a <a href="http://www.gulflink.osd.mil/du_ii/" target="_new">Defense 

Department report</a>, "the US Military Services use DU munitions because of DU's 

superior lethality" adding, "Gulf War exposures to depleted uranium (DU) have 

not to date produced any observable adverse health effects attributable to DU's 

chemical toxicity or low-level radiation." With more than one out of six American 

Gulf War vets having <a href="http://www.ngwrc.org/shg/page2.html" target="_new">reported 

health problems</a> since their service, and over 9,000 having died since the 

war ended, not to mention the marked increase in Iraqi birth defects and cancer 

cases in DU-bombed regions, denial like that is nothing short of material breach, 

an affront to both human rights and common sense. 

<p>And what if the December 8th deadline is met, and no weapons of mass destruction 

are found by U.N. weapons inspectors inside Iraq? <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2002/US/11/15/rumsfeld.iraq/index.html" target="_new">Says</a> 

US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld: "What it would prove would be that the inspection 

process had been successfully defeated by the Iraqis. There's no question but 

that the Iraqi regime is clever, they've spent a lot of time hiding things, dispersing 

things, tunneling underground." So it would appear regardless of how the inspections 

turn out, the Iraqis will be attacked anyway. 

<p>In facing a no-win situation, Hussein could seem like a

martyr to others in the region; he could also see

little option but to unleash whatever destructive

powers he has left. Backing someone like him into a

corner is foreign policy at its most disastrous, a

dangerous development for the entire region and very

bad news for the unfortunate service men and women

thrown into that quagmire.



<p>It's clear that Saddam Hussein is a loathsome ogre who has shown criminal disregard 

for his population. What's also clear though is that the US record in the region 

is disgraceful if not downright criminal. Consider that for the two years following 

Hussein's infamous 1988 gas attack on the Kurds at Halabja (an attack in which 

US-built helicopters were <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views02/0802-01.htm">apparently 

among those dropping the bombs</a>) the US government seemed quite uninterested 

in his possession of chemical weapons, or any other weapons for that matter. Remember 

too, that a 1992 Senate committee report entitled "US Chemical and Biological 

Warfare-Related Dual-Use Exports to Iraq," demonstrated that Hussein bought technology 

and materials necessary to create nuclear, biological and chemical weapons from 

none other than the States and Britain - and continued to make purchases even 

after the attack at Halabja. Factor in the water supply degradation, DU toxicity 

and debilitating sanctions and it's hard to imagine the average Iraqi embracing 

American forces as welcome liberators. 

<p>The bottom line is that the US has some questions to

answer about its past conduct in Iraq, questions that

can't be answered by another full-scale war.
