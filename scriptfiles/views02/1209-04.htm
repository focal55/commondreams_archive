<p>It's a discouraging and ominous time.  On Nov 5, frightened voters handed 

our administration unfettered power:  power to hasten environmental 

devastation, to increase the flow of wealth from the poor to the rich, to 

pack our courts with right wing ideologues, to subject Americans to 

invasive government scrutiny under the rubric of "homeland security," and 

to embark on a global military rampage, starting with Iraq.   Our leaders 

haven't tried to conceal their glee.



<p>And what do we do now?  How can we keep our spirits up and our hearts open 

in the midst of all this, and what can we do now to make this a better world?



<p>It's tempting to become cynical and bitter, or to pull back and await the 

onslaught, as many German citizens did in the '30s.  But, as Bruce Mulkey 

has pointed out, cynicism, denial and hopelessness amount to 

victimhood.  We can rarely control what life sends our way, but we can 

control how we respond to it.  We can make ourselves miserable, helplessly 

wishing things were better.  Or, we can do everything we can and feel the 

satisfaction of those efforts (regardless of the outcome).



<p>Many have offered lists of how one can make a difference.  Here is my 

contribution:



<p><b>*Allow yourself to grieve.</b>  Accept the pain, frustration, and anger you 

feel about what is happening.  It is a necessary step for healing and 

moving on.  But don't get stuck there.



<p><b>*Don't despair.</b>

<p>

<ul>

<li>Despair is a human notion - it doesn't exist elsewhere in nature, 

and it doesn't exist when one is immersed in the present moment.  By simply 

doing one's work, one can move beyond despair, and also beyond fear.</li>

<li>Taking a long term view can be comforting:  "This too will 

pass."  The world, albeit somewhat changed, will go on.</li>

<li>Corporate/military power is vulnerable because it's large and 

monolithic, it has a single mindset (destroying anything in its path), and 

it relies on a few powerbased tactics to maintain control. It is vulnerable 

to creative, adaptable strategies.  And it presents a large, clear target.</li>

<li>We are dealing with an outmoded mentality based on raw power and 

greed - a dinosaur, doomed to die.  Our job is to do what we can to limit 

the damage caused by its death throes.</li>

<li>Surprises are everywhere - change may be just around the corner



</li>

</ul>

<p><b>*Keep on keeping on.</b>  Even when it seems hopeless, persistence often pays 

off in the end - sometimes when least expected, and sometimes in surprising 

ways.  Patiently keep tapping away.  Be willing to give it several years - 

plant seeds.  Understand and use the tipping point concept:  major changes 

often develop as undercurrents with little visible indication, and our 

actions may seem to be futile. But if one keeps pushing, things can reach a 

critical point and abruptly shift in the desired direction, seemingly out 

of nowhere.  Examples:  the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the transformation 

of Nelson Mandela from black prisoner to President.  See "The Tipping 

Point," by Malcolm Gladwell.



<p><b>*Help people become aware.</b>  This is especially crucial in the media-drugged 

US.  Most Americans are good, well-intentioned people (albeit sometimes 

immature and self-indulgent), who have been herded into a fearful, 

self-protective state of mind by the mainstream media and official 

pronouncements of various threats.  Make holes in this world-view.



<p>Share thoughtful articles and magazines.  Write letters and op-ed pieces 

(perhaps mentioning your representatives by name).  Attend vigils and 

demonstrations.  Encourage people and groups to join a fact-finding 

delegation to a critical area to see for themselves and report back to 

their friends, church groups, etc. (check out <a href="http://www.witnessforpeace.org/" target="_new">Witness for Peace</a> or <a href="http://www.globalexchange.org/" target="_new">Global 

Exchange</a>).  And find other ways to help people understand what's going on.



<p><b>*Build bridges - reach out to those who think differently rather than just 

preaching to the choir.</b>  People already know "something's wrong" but don't 

know exactly what.  Those who believe differently can be softened by 

emphasizing common ground - hearing their concerns, and finding points of 

agreement.  Then expose them to new thoughts



<p>Form coalitions with other groups, even those with whom we don't agree on 

other issues. We can make our connections with them more solid by showing 

up at their meetings, helping them hand out flyers, etc.  Choose a specific 

issue that has a good chance of success, that many people care about (e.g. 

loss of privacy), that appeals to a variety of potential coalition 

partners, and where opposition is vulnerable.



<p><b>*Continue working on your representatives.</b>  Talk with them about the 

unanswered questions about this war and about other issues.  Urge them to 

help stop the rush towards war.



<p><b>*Work for campaign finance reform, and seek out worthy candidates to 

support.</b>  Maine, Vermont, Arizona and Massachusetts now provide public 

financing for candidates willing to follow stringent fundraising and 

spending guidelines.  Bringing public financing to your own community and 

state is a project worth undertaking.  We cannot allow our political 

representatives to continue to be bought and sold to the highest 

bidders.  More information:

www.publicampaign.org.



<p><b>*Look for and support good things.</b>   There is plenty of bad news.  But, 

although they don't often appear in the mainstream press, a lot of good 

things are also happening - thoughtful, caring, and compassionate words and 

deeds by ordinary and not so ordinary people and groups, locally, 

nationally, and internationally.



<p>Add your weight to push for change - seek out and help support good ideas 

and programs that people can get excited about and involved in.  Examples 

of successful actions can be found on www.dbsst.org.



<p><b>*Cut off the fuel supply.</b>   Giant corporations are fueled by money and 

profits.  Withdraw your bit of energy from the bad ones.  Whenever 

possible, buy from local vendors, and socially and environmentally 

responsible businesses.  Avoid chains and megastores.  Same for banking and 

investing.  A good resource is <a href="http://www.coopamerica.org" target="_new">www.coopamerica.org</a>.



<p>The most important item, by far, is food.  Don't eat factory food, but seek 

out food that is produced locally or by small producers, that is free of 

chemicals, hormones, and genetic modification.  You can help your community 

and the world, while enjoying healthier, more delicious food.



<p>Buy less.  Live more simply and develop a lifestyle based on other 

satisfactions than having lots of stuff.



<p><b>*Think outside the box.</b>  Find creative new ways to deal with our situation, 

and help others implement their innovative concepts.  Our thinking needs to 

be dramatic - unexpected - outside the box.  It can be a creative new 

tactic, an unexpected response, or an unexpectedly quick response.



<p><b>*Practice indirection.</b>  The war/greed machine is too powerful to confront 

headon, but grass roots efforts can make the road so muddy that the machine 

bogs down.  Maybe we can put out some nails for the tires or slip aboard 

and put some sugar in the gas tank.  We need to find our equivalent of the 

mud, nails and sugar.  Perhaps we can find leverage points, vulnerable 

spots, or redirect its motion so it does less damage or self-destructs.



<p><b>*Multi-pronged actions can have a synergistic effect.</b>  For instance, a 

combination of demonstrations, op-eds/letters, and legal action all 

happening together may produce better results than the same actions done 

one at a time.



<p><b>*Use triage.</b>  Go for greatest possible effect.  Spend time on people who 

might be energized or changed, rather than on the already committed or 

those who are hopeless.  Zero in on one specific issue or target rather 

than everywhere at once.  Savor small successes - they all help and they 

may lead to larger successes later on.



<p><b>*Don't demonize your adversaries.</b>  Consider opposing points of view.  While 

we may be correct in what we affirm, there is usually a kernel of truth in 

our opponent's viewpoint.  And, we need to be especially mindful about what 

we deny, because this is often where our blind spots will be.



<p>We are all in this together - there is no "enemy." We all want to be safe 

and loved. Any action that is fear-based - e.g. abusive language, 

intolerant behavior, or a violent act - is a cry for love and security, 

whether it's coming from George W. Bush or someone down the street.



<p><b>*Put joy into your work.</b>  Share your joy and allow it to warm others.  Move 

from anger and despair to compassion and love.  This is not to deny the 

legitimacy of outrage at injustice;  but it is more effective to work from 

compassion than to angrily fight against evil.  The Dalai Lama says, "A 

positive future can never emerge from anger and despair."



<p><b>*Broaden the circle of caring.</b>  Most of us care deeply about our small 

circle of friends, family, etc.  We usually also care about our 

neighborhood or community.  Some care deeply about the well being of their 

country.  However, our circle of compassion must expand beyond the familiar 

to include human and non-human, living and non-living - to match our 

expanded influence in the world.  Find ways to encourage concern about the 

life of a little girl in Baghdad or a coral reef in the South Pacific as 

well as about one's own loved ones.



<p><b>*Be kind to people everywhere, the good and the not-so-good.</b>  The world 

needs role models for kindness as never before.  Nurture others, and 

surround yourself with those who nurture you and who understand and respect 

your hopes and dreams.



<p>Be especially kind to yourself.  Keep yourself grounded and burnout-free by 

giving yourself down-time:  meditation, a quiet walk, exercise, music, time 

with a friend, creative time, etc.  Self-renewal is an essential part of 

your work.



<p>Detach yourself from the results of your efforts.  Make the commitment, do 

the work, follow through as needed, and then let go.  Let the universe make 

of it what it will.  Do it for the doing, not for the outcome.  Do it 

simply because it's the right thing to do, and because it's good for your 

soul.  This is a lighter, freer, and more effective way.



<p>As an added bonus, your good work may in fact produce unexpectedly good 

results, it may inspire others, and it will almost certainly expand your 

own capabilities and wisdom.



<p>Enjoy life.  An ancient parable tells of a Buddhist monk who is chased by 

tigers to the edge of a cliff.  As they close in, he spots a small bush 

growing at the very edge, grabs it, and jumps over.  As he hangs there, the 

tigers paw the ground above but can't reach him.  Looking down, he sees 

more tigers below.  Then he notices a mouse gnawing on the slender root 

that holds the bush.  As the bush slowly gives way, the monk spots a berry 

on it.  With a delighted smile, he picks the berry with his free hand and 

eats it slowly, enjoying every morsel.  In reality, we are all caught 

between tigers above and tigers below, but like that monk, we can and 

should live fully and with delight in this moment, in spite of it all.



<p>As Will Keepin tells us, we can serve as hospice workers to a dying 

culture, and also as midwives to an emerging culture. These two tasks call 

for us to maintain an open heart, offering our light and joy, and being 

present for grief and pain.  When we root our actions in both intelligence 

and compassion, we reach a balance of head and heart that combines the 

finest of human qualities.



<p>Discover your unique gifts - what you can do most effectively - and share 

them where they're most needed.  You have much to offer - your time, 

energy, money, talents, possessions to share, etc.  Our task is not easy - 

but we must do it anyway.



<p>We do make a difference - individually and collectively.  Every loving 

thought and compassionate action changes the world we live in, and 

therefore changes the fabric of our own existence.



<p><i>"Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can 

change the world. Indeed, it's the only thing that ever has."</i> -- Margaret Mead



<p><i>"It always starts with a small group of committed people. They raise their 

feeble voice. The media ignore them, the politicians laugh at them, the 

respectable parties distance themselves.  But slowly, with persistence, 

they start to have an impact. This finally compels the leaders of the 

mainstream organizations to respond, and the message spreads." </i>-- Uri 

Avnery, Israeli activist opposed to the oppression of the Palestinians



<p>A cloud of mosquitoes can send a rhinoceros running.
