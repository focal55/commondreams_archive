<p>Dysfunctional Bush and his anachronistic cronies are

leading us right into a catastrophic Middle Eastern

blowout. That much is apparent. But what's not so clear

is why we're allowing it to happen.



<p>Analyzing Dubya's psychological challenges is not

enough - he's the symptom not the cause, and while the

rapidity of societal decline has seemed to accelerate

since 2000's farcical US presidential election, the

framework for rollback was in place long before. If it

hadn't been, citizens quite simply wouldn't have

tolerated the rigged results.



<p>But what mechanisms could have been used to facilitate

the rollback? How can an unwilling population be

trained to blindly accept a new, repressive social

order?



<p>A CIA instruction manual entitled "<a href="http://www.fas.org/irp/cia/guerilla.htm" target="_new">Psychological 

Operations in Guerrilla Warfare</a>" provides some clues. Written in the early 

1980s (coincidentally, soon after Bush Sr. headed the Agency) the document was 

part of the US government's crusade to bring down Nicaragua's leftist government, 

by providing training and weapons to the Contra rebels. Detailing how to gain 

a community's support through propaganda and selective violence, the manual begins 

"In effect, the human being should be considered the priority objective in a political 

war ... Once his mind has been reached, the 'political animal' has been defeated, 

without necessarily receiving bullets." 

<p>The following are quotes from the original psyop

textbook, along with contemporary examples-



<p>PSYOP quote: "It is appropriate ... to guide the

discussion of a group to cover a number of points and

to reach a correct conclusion." The people "should feel

it was their free and own decision."



<p>Interesting to note that up until early 2000, military personnel from the Fourth Psychological Operations Group based in Fort Bragg, North Carolina were active at CNN's Atlanta-based headquarters - and left only after public outcry when CNN admitted to employing them. Their presence was perhaps not surprising given former CIA director William Colby's boast that "the Central Intelligence Agency owns everyone of any major significance in the major media."



<p>So much for a democratic free flow of information.



<p>Also striking is how the "discussion" around attacking

Iraq is being guided "to reach a correct conclusion."

After both the House and Senate agreed to give Bush his

blank check to attack Iraq (requesting only that Bush

report to Congress every 60 days if he does decide to

take action) Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle called

the endorsement of war "a statement of American values

and resolve." Apparently Daschle was unaware of the

large anti-war street protests taking place across the

country, and the overwhelming number of anti-war phone

calls flooding House and Senate offices. 



<p>Now that the vote is finished, the media will no doubt

bombard with messages echoing Daschle's myopic

observation, and assuring the American population the

vote for war was their "free and own decision." 



<p>PSYOP quote: "Always be prepared with simple slogans in

order to explain to the people, whether in intentional

form or by chance, the reason for the weapons." Reasons

such as: "The weapons will be for winning freedom; they

are for you," or "Our weapons are, in truth, the

weapons of the people, yours."



<p>The Bush administration proposes to increase its annual military budget by $120 billion (over one third) by 2007, which would bring the total annual budget to $451 billion; this while the economy crumbles and social services get left behind. The justification?



<p>George W. Bush

"Nothing is more important than the national security

of our country. So nothing is more important than our

defense budget.  The price for freedom is high, but

it's never too high as far as I'm concerned.” 



<p>Donald Rumsfeld

“The defense budget is cheap when one compares it to

putting our security at risk, our lives at risk, our

country at risk, our freedom at risk.” 



<p>PSYOP quote: "In places and situations wherever

possible ... explain the operation of weapons to the

youths and young men."



<p>A endless war requires an endless supply of cannon fodder; lucky for the military 

if enough recruits succumb to the sexy hype about weapons and enlist. If they 

don't though, there's always the <a href="http://www.cooperativeresearch.org/strengthening_the_military.htm" target="_new">Universal 

Military Training and Service Act</a> (H.R. 3598) which, aiming to bring back 

the draft, states: "ALL males residing in the U.S. between the ages of 18-22 (must) 

receive military training for at least 6 months" and imposes additional time on 

high school dropouts. 

<p>Chew on that quote for a second. The high school

dropout part is self-explanatory; longer military

sentences would effectively be forced on poor kids and minorities, those most likely to drop out of school. The "residing" part is odd though - apparently, even citizens of other countries who happen to live in the US will be obligated to complete military service for Uncle Sam.



<p>So it appears every trick in the book will be used to

get our youth on the battlefield, but once those boys

come home wounded or in body bags, they and their

families will be abandoned, at least if Secretary of

Defense Donald Rumsfeld has his way. Addressing the

Armed Services Committee, Rumsfeld recently claimed he

had no knowledge of the US having ever shipped any

biological weapons to Iraq; Rumsfeld said he had no

knowledge despite the existence of substantial proof,

including a widely-distributed 1994 Senate Report

documenting the US sale of bacteria and viruses to Iraq.



<p>The medical issue becomes even more serious when considering the fact that 

biological warfare agents don't affect only those service members directly exposed: 

they can lie undetected and later be transferred to family and friends back home. 

This is the <a href="http://www.gulfwarvets.com/abell.htm" target="_new">stuff 

of epidemics</a>, and the DOD's head-in-the-sand handling of the physical maladies 

of Gulf War veterans has only exacerbated the danger to us all. 

<p>Small wonder that, unlike hawkish politicians who have never seen battle, many 

Gulf War vets oppose an attack on Iraq. And Rumsfeld had better take notice: the 

American Gulf War Veterans Association (AGWVA) is so appalled by his claim of 

ignorance about the weapons sale - and attending denial about the dangers of a 

new war with Iraq - they've officially <a href="http://www.gulfwarvets.com/breaking.htm" target="_new">called 

for his resignation</a>.

<p>PSYOP quote: "Established citizens ... will be

recruited initially as 'Social Crusaders' in typically 'innocuous' movements in the area of operations. When their 'involvement' with the clandestine organization is revealed to them, this supplies the psychological pressure to use them as 'inside cadres' in groups to which they already belong or of which they can be members."



<p>Operation TIPS, US Attorney General John Ashcroft's plan to enlist citizens 

in spying on one another is down, but definitely not out. Due to public outcry, 

postal and utilities workers may have been exempted but employees of "industry 

associations and groups" in the broadly-defined transportation sector are still 

being "invited to receive information" on the <a href="http://www.citizencorps.gov/tips.html" target="_new">program</a>. 

It's anyone's guess who the invitation will be extended to next... 

<p>PSYOP quote: "Bring about uprisings or shootings, which

will cause the death of one or more persons, who would

become the martyrs ... in order to create greater

conflicts."



<p>In "Body of Secrets," respected journalist James

Bamford explores official government records in which

the Pentagon "called for innocent people to be shot on

American streets, for boats ... to be sunk on the high

seas, for a wave of violent terrorism to be launched in Washington D.C., Miami and elsewhere," for "people to be framed for bombings they did not commit" and for planes to be hijacked, all in the name of convincing Congress and the American public to support a new war. Bamford writes about the early 1960s, but many of the Pentagon's proposals then seem uncomfortably reminiscent today.



<p>So whatever happened to the basic foundations of "life,

liberty and the pursuit of happiness"? Have we really

gone so far astray that independent thought is a thing

of the past, trampled in the dirt by an artificial

psyop reality?



<p>Time to read through those Amendments once again,

slowly. Then take a careful look at the insidious ways

we're being controlled, and throw off the shackles.
