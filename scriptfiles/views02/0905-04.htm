<p>THE 102 minutes of horror between the crash of the first 767 into the North 

Tower and its ultimate collapse are the most documented moments in history. Some 

150 books are out there. Newspapers and magazines have produced special issues 

and are now turning out one-year-after editions and sections. Countless Web sites 

have sprung up. Steve Earle, Bruce Springsteen, Neil Young and others have recorded 

songs. Zillions of hours have been broadcast.

<P></P>

Since Sept. 11, I have seen the planes slam into the World Trade Center hundreds 

of times, tracked the flailing victims falling from the upper floors, watched 

the towers collapse from above, below, Brooklyn and beyond, witnessed the horror 

over and over again — and still hyperventilate or sob at the sights.

<P></P>

Just when I think I've seen every bit of video there could possibly be — as compiled 

in, say, HBO's <i>In Memoriam: New York City, 9/11 </i>(airing here Wednesday 

on Life and the Independent Film Channel) — more footage turns up. For example, 

CNN has already aired <i>America Remembers</i>, in which its news crews turned 

their cameras on themselves as they covered the event, while, on Sunday, CBC Newsworld 

will run <i>9/11 — Stories From The City </i>which shows New Yorkers shooting 

the evacuations of their homes and offices as the tragedy unfolded.

<P></P>

All this information. So little enlightenment. 

<P></P>

We're barely into the first anniversary wallow which peaks next Wednesday. There 

are concerts and commemorations, widows and orphans, survivors and heroes, faces 

and places of Sept. 11. Lots of whos and whats and whens and wheres — but precious 

few whys. Considering how everything was supposed to have changed as a result, 

it's instructive to examine what is missing from the 100-plus hours of planned 

coverage rather than what is scheduled. Here's what you won't see:

<P></P>

<li></li>

Ads: Major advertisers are balking at hawking their wares on Wednesday. Media 

buyers claim that commercials will seem crass and uncaring. Perhaps. But how about 

a tasteful minute of silence or sponsorship, with the money going to improving 

foreign news coverage on the U.S. networks? Instead, the loss of some $50 million 

in revenue will, in the long run, likely hurt news coverage. How does that help 

prevent another Sept. 11? 

<P></P>

<li></li>

An examination of civil liberties: Where did they go? Both in Canada and south 

of the border, far too many people were subjected to detention with no due process. 

When a Human Right Watch report recently came out on the subject, most media ignored 

it.

<P></P>

<li></li>

The hunt for Osama bin Laden: Uh, is it on? Are he and his henchmen dead or alive? 

Is Al Qaeda still wealthy and healthy as some reports suggest? Aside from a Newsworld 

documentary last night, there is virtually no mention of this subject on the airwaves. 

<P></P>

<li></li>

The prisoners: What's going on at Guantanamo Bay? Have the Al Qaeda captives slipped 

down the memory hole of history?

<P></P>

<li></li>

George W. Bush: Will any mainstream media outlet have the brass bits to examine 

the president's record before, after and around Sept. 11? Or will they continue 

to tiptoe around his administration's stunning ineptitude for fear of seeming 

unpatriotic? 

<P></P>

<li></li>

Ground Zero: Yes, there will be many memorials and remembrances. CNN has already 

aired and re-aired its <i>Sixteen Acres</i>, a look at the future of the site. 

But has anybody examined what poisons, toxins and carcinogens might have been 

in that dust and the smoke? Will thousands more New Yorkers die as a result? 

<P></P>

<li></li>

Fallen heroes: Did rescue workers die because the New York Fire Department had 

defective communications equipment? The New York Times recently reported on the 

subject. But few other media outlets have picked up on the issue, preferring instead 

the heart-wrenching tales of heroism and sacrifice. Why?

<P></P>

<li></li>

Afghanistan: So, how are the newly liberated people faring? Are the women there 

really better off? Has peace, law, order and good government been restored? Or 

have the people been bombed back to the Stone Age? Last week, <i>Newsweek</i> 

told of war crimes possibly committed under the aegis of U.S. troops but no other 

media have dwelt on the matter. Does nobody care?

<P></P>

Apparently not.

<P></P>

"The public has lost interest," CBS' Dan Rather told <i>TV Guide </i>(U.S.) last 

week. "They'd much rather hear about the Robert Blake murder case or what is happening 

on Wall Street. A feeling is creeping back in that if you lead (the newscast with 

international news), you die."

<P></P>

From what we won't see this week and next, it seems that if you lead anything 

but poignant, patriotic and superficial, you die.

<P></P>

Which, all things considered, does not bode well for the future.
