<p>Has the war on terrorism become the modern equivalent of the Roman Circus, 

drawing the people's attention away from the failures of those who rule them? 

Corporate America is a shambles because deregulation, the mantra of our president 

and his party, has proved to be a license to steal. Yet to question our leaders' 

stewardship of the economy has been made to seem unpatriotic.

<p>Although combating terrorism is of compelling importance--and should have been 

before Sept. 11--one is likely to be branded a nut for daring to suggest that 

the administration might be using current security threats as a smoke screen to 

obscure our floundering economy.

<p>Yet, after the miserable performance of the stock market these past five weeks, 

the forced resignations and indictments of corporate titans (not to mention the 

conviction of a top accounting firm), the humbling of the dollar and a rise in 

the trade gap, isn't it time to ask whether the war on terrorism isn't being milked 

as a convenient distraction? The question seems particularly relevant when our 

man in the White House has had close personal and financial ties to the company--Enron--whose 

demise is the most glaring symbol of the broad moral disarray of the nation's 

corporate culture.

<p>Is there any doubt that the chicanery of Enron executives and that of a growing 

Who's Who of top CEOs has done more long-term damage to the U.S. economy than 

the efforts of anti-American terrorists? And while sending in the Marines to clean 

up the boardrooms is not feasible, we ought to wake up to the reality that business 

greed is subverting the American way of life--and hurting the image of American 

capitalism and democracy--more effectively than the ploys of any foreign enemy.

<p>When even Martha Stewart is ethically suspect and her company's stock has plummeted--though 

not quite to the depths of Enron, Global Crossing, Tyco, Dynergy, Wal-Mart and 

Rite Aid--it is time to return to the wisdom of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the 

Depression-era president who saved capitalism from itself.

<p>Wealthy from birth, FDR had a healthy awareness of the tendency of the upper 

classes to destabilize society and even destroy themselves with their greed and 

hubris. Unlike Karl Marx, however, he believed the unraveling of capitalism was 

not inevitable if these excesses could somehow be corralled. Thus was born the 

idea of government regulation as the vital support structure for the powerful, 

fertile but unstable free market.

<p>Unfortunately, greedy people and institutions don't like being monitored, and 

they have the means to corrupt governments and skirt laws.

<p>Since the so-called Reagan Revolution, powerful corporate interests have succeeded 

in profoundly damaging the foundation of a properly regulated economy. Company 

auditors, for example, have become accomplices to deceptions of the public that 

should be considered criminal but that often do not violate statutes written by 

corporate lobbyists.

<p>Enron provides a startling illustration of a company jumping through loopholes 

that its D.C. lobbyists have created. In fact, the Enron scams made possible by 

deregulation in the first Bush administration are still being revealed, such as 

last week's reports that the company hid billions in income during the California 

energy crisis while publicly denying it was profiting excessively.

<p>Yet former Enron officials continue to play an important role under Bush the 

younger. The Bush family, in fact, has never been seriously confronted by the 

media or Congress as to its questionable ties to former Enron Chief Executive 

Kenneth Lay, a close family friend and top contributor to Bush family presidential 

campaigns.

<p>To be fair, the corporate corruption of our political system has long been 

bipartisan. The Clinton White House, for example, sponsored major deregulation 

acts, including the Financial Services Modernization Act, which reversed consumer 

protections enacted under Roosevelt, and the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which 

effectively ended all public accountability for the communications industry and 

has permitted a few media giants to gobble up vast markets.

<p>Clearly, the problem is bipartisan when a Democrat-controlled Senate moves 

so hesitantly to confront the myriad examples of sickness in our economy and corporate 

culture. 

<p>The politicians hesitate to act because candidates of both parties are lavishly 

financed by the very people who are conning a gullible public.
