<p>The new year approaches. I am finishing my second week

in Baghdad as a member of the <a href="http://iraqpeaceteam.org/" target="_new">Iraq Peace Team</a>, an international, non-governmental group of peace activists.  Our mission is simple: to be with the people of Iraq no matter what comes to pass in the weeks and months ahead. In my hotel one of the managers keeps a monkey. The monkey's name is Coffee. He is still quite young. His home is a cage that is moved at various times during the day from the reception area to a corner by the window. I have seen Coffee's owner holding him and feeding him formula from a dropper. The man is not unkind and seems to have won Coffee's trust and affection. When the monkey has drunk his fill, he gently pushes the dropper away with his deft little hands.

<p>If a stranger, hoping to attract Coffee's attention,

puts his fingers a tad too close to the cage, Coffee

will instantly dart his arm between the bars and

attempt to nab the intruder. Then, infuriated perhaps

or just frustrated by his repeated failures, Coffee

will bite his own feet and hands, or seize the wooden

slats of his seat and shake them with all the might

his heart can command.

<p>When I first met Coffee, he had nothing inside his

cage other than a container for water and two seats

for sitting on or sleeping. No toys, no blankets, no

food, and of course no companions. No room in which to

swing, to hang upside down if that is what he so

desired, to leap about in monkey-mad delirium and

delight. Coffee's environment could not have been more

stark, more lacking in all the things a living,

sentient being needs in order not merely to survive

but to flourish.

<p>With the owner's permission, I gave Coffee a small,

brown teddy bear. One week has passed since then and

still he has not destroyed the bear. I have seen him

holding it with the utmost gentleness or playing with

it as if it were indeed a companion of sorts, one he

would never want to lose or willingly hurt.

<p>Something about this little monkey's life has touched

me. I want him to stop hurting himself. I want him to

have all the things to which he is entitled. I want to

rip open his cage with my bare hands and set him free.

But I am not in Baghdad to sympathize with the plight

of captive primates.  I am here to stand with the

people of Iraq as they continue to struggle with the

effects of sanctions and now face the threat of

cataclysmic war. 

<p>Oddly enough, the plight of Coffee in a cage leads me

to the plight of children in Iraq, one of the richest

countries in the world. Despite its vast oil

resources, Iraq has declined from material prosperity

to third-world poverty. UN comprehensive economic

sanctions, in force since 1990, are primarily

responsible for this decline. One significant

indicator of Iraq's overall economic health is its

infant mortality rate. A UNICEF report published in

2001 noted that over the past decade the infant

mortality rate in Iraq has increased by 160%. This

increase is the highest among all the countries

surveyed in the 2001 report. 

<p>For the poor children of Iraq, even the essentials of

life are too often lacking, to say nothing of toys and

teddy bears. Over their lives, we in the West have

placed a cage. We allow these children to have just

what they need to survive but no more. We decide what

goes between the bars and into their barren hands. 

<p>In the public hospitals of Iraq, despite the benefits

derived from the Oil for Food program, doctors

continue to struggle with life-threatening shortages

of drugs and equipment. In Basrah, shortly before

Christmas, two fellow members of the Iraq Peace Team

visited the pediatric wards of the city's major

hospital. There they witnessed the death of a

six-year-old girl from leukemia. The drugs she needed

were not available. Not available in one of the

richest countries on earth. Not available because the

entire sanctions regime, imposed by the UN but

maintained and enforced by the United States and Great

Britain, severely restricts what Iraq can and cannot

import. 

<p>At Baghdad University, I had an opportunity to meet

with students and to visit the library for the

Department of English. Undergraduate and graduate

students alike are eager to pursue their studies and

master their particular disciplines, whether the 19th

century British novel or plays by contemporary

writers. But the books they need, works of modern

scholarship, are largely not available. There are 10

computers on one server for over 200 students.

Internet access is slow and unreliable due to frequent

power failures. In the one-room library most of the

texts are from the seventies. Many are much, much

older. Bookcases lean precariously under the weight of

moldy, forgotten volumes. 

<p>The books are unavailable because someone in New York

or Washington, adhering to official sanctions

guidelines, has declared them to be non-essential. Non-essential to a people who thrive on learning and literature, who gave the world the written word and the myth of Gilgamesh, one of the oldest stories humanity possesses. 

<p>Coffee the monkey may be satisfied, at least

temporarily, with a teddy bear. But what of the

children and young people of Iraq. If they are to

achieve the full measure of their humanity and become responsible, caring citizens not only of their own country but indeed of the world, then the cage that confines them must be removed. It is not enough to give them only government food rations purchased through oil revenues. It is not enough to allow them to have only  some of the medicine they need, or to provide them with internet access but deny them books.





<p>Far from removing the cage or granting the children of

Iraq the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of

happiness, the West, in particular the United States

and Great Britain, is now moving its weapons into

place and preparing to launch a massive assault that

will no doubt kill thousands of innocent Iraqi

children, lay waste to their cities and towns, pollute

their rivers and streams, destroy their homes and any possibility they might have had for a secure future. 



<p>It is not too late to prevent this from happening. To

believe otherwise is almost more than I can bear,

especially when I hold in my arms the children of

families I have grown to love through my years of

coming here. I give them little presents from home. I

take them to their favorite places. But now, as the

bombers are prepared, the only gift that has any

meaning is the blessing of life. Life in its fullest,

deepest, wildest being. Life and nothing less. Life

forever more.
