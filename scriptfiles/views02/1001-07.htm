<p> Sunday night, way up in the nosebleed section of the digital dial on MSNBC, 

I was thrilled to land on a rerun of the news conference that Michael Moore (<i>Roger 

& Me</i>, <i>Stupid White Men</i>) gave at the Toronto International Film Festival 

to promote his newest documentary <i>Bowling For Columbine</i>, which borrows 

its title from the horrible high school massacre in Colorado in 1999.

<P></P>

(No, MSNBC wasn't actually running the news conference. Rogers, which had taped 

it during the fest for telecast on its "community" Channel 10, was merely subbing 

regular MSNBC programming with the newser in order to fulfill its CanCon commitments 

for carrying the channel in Canada. But that's another column.)

<P></P>

Moore, who seems to be more at home here than in his native U.S.A., was defending 

his polemical film about guns and the American psyche, a film that won a special 

jury prize at Cannes — here it also earned a sustained 13-minute ovation from 

the audience.

<P></P>

Moore complained that American critics had not given <i>Bowling For Columbine 

</i>the attention it deserves, that nobody had reported that the country's largest 

theatre chain, which is based in Colorado, has refused to exhibit the film when 

it opens later this month.

<P></P>

Big surprise. Moore's anti-corporate, left-liberal films, TV shows and books tend 

not to play well with the corporate, conservative media. For example, his <i>Stupid 

White Men</i>, which was almost shredded by the publisher last fall for being 

patriotically incorrect, has been on all the bestseller lists for nearly a year 

— but has yet to be reviewed by The New York Times and other major papers. His 

last TV series, <i>The Awful Truth</i>, was made in Canada, by the Halifax-based 

Salter Street Films, which also co-financed <i>Columbine</i>.

<P></P>

I can count on one hand the number of times I have seen him onscreen on U.S. TV 

since <i>Stupid White Men </i>became a hit. And yet, Ann Coulter, his polar opposite 

both physically and politically, is seen all over the dial screeching the same 

half-truths she wrote in her best-selling screed <i>Slander: Liberal Lies About 

The American Right</i>.

<P></P>

Is it just because she has better legs than Moore that she gets all this exposure, 

including a substitute hosting gig on CNN's <i>Crossfire</i>? Or is it because, 

contrary to her contention and that of many readers who have e-complained about 

my "left-wing ravings" and The Star's "commie" slant, the liberal media ain't 

so liberal?

<P></P>

Sure, there are islands in the market-might-is-right media ocean. On the magazine 

racks, you'll find <i>Harper's</i> and <i>The Nation</i>, to name two of the few. 

The Internet is blessedly filled with alternative sites. In Canada, we can count 

on CBC and TVO not to always run everything through the is-this-good-for-the-market 

filter. But, in the U.S., aside from NPR (National Public Radio), there's not 

much, not even PBS.

<P></P>

That's right: Not even PBS.

<P></P>

Consider how, last month, even the much respected Jim Lehrer gave Defense Secretary 

Donald Rumsfeld a free pass, never challenging him when he repeatedly fudged the 

facts. For example, Rumsfeld reiterated the Bushist propaganda about how Saddam 

Hussein "threw the (U.N. weapons) inspectors out" — when, in fact, they were pulled 

out.

<P></P>

Last spring PBS ran a superb six-hour documentary titled <i>Commanding Heights: 

The Battle For The World Economy</i>, based on the book by Daniel Yergin and Joseph 

Stanislaw. It's an unabashed appreciation of the free market, a tribute to Margaret 

Thatcher, Ronald Reagan, Milton Friedman and their inspiration, Nobel Prize-winning 

economist Friedrich von Hayek. So one-sided is it that The Wall Street Journal 

headlined its review of it "PBS Likes Capitalism More Than the Commercial Networks 

Do," calling it a "paean to private enterprise." This series was not only originally 

co-funded by Enron, it ran just as the markets were imploding and CEOs were getting 

busted for being too free of regulation.

<P></P>

Meanwhile, I can list dozens of provocative and prize-winning films PBS will not 

run, including Danny Schechter's <i>Counting On Democracy</i>, about the scandalous 

2000 vote in Florida. Schechter, an Emmy-winning TV journalist, author and weblogger 

(<i><a href="http://www.mediachannel.org" target="_new">http://www.mediachannel.org</a></i>), 

says PBS rejected it because it is "biased." Instead, it will air <i>Who Counts? 

</i>— a political special starring <i>Saturday Night Live </i>alumnus Darrell 

Hammond doing his Al Gore impersonation. 

<P></P>

One PBS show that does get behind the news is <i>Now With Bill Moyers</i>. To 

watch it, I tape it Sundays at dawn — off KCTS in Seattle. That's because, like 

many other PBS stations, WNED in Buffalo doesn't air it. 

<P></P>

So much for the liberal media. Which is why I root for Michael Moore even when 

he goes over the top and/or edge.

<P></P>

Maybe his next film should take on CNN.
