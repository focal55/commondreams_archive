<p><I>Mea culpa, mea culpa, mea maxima culpa.</I> 

<P>The Missal<I>,Confession of sins</I> 

<P>The election made one thing absolutely clear &#151; I have been barking up 

the wrong Bush. Election night demonstrated conclusively that George W. Bush is 

nothing less than a national hero. There will be no more carping about him and 

his crew from the likes of me. And as evidence of my conversion, what better place 

to start than to acknowledge the wisdom of Mr. Bush's continuing efforts to make 

sure that United States citizens are protected from the reach of the International 

Court of Criminal Justice. 

<P>The ICCJ is empowered to charge and try cases of genocide and other crimes 

against humanity. Upon becoming president Mr. Bush began a campaign to get the 

signatories to agree to exempt all Americans from the reach of the court. At the 

end of September the European Union agreed to exempt American military personnel 

and diplomats from its jurisdiction. That did not satisfy Mr. Bush. On Oct. 8, 

he dispatched a top State Department envoy to Europe to try to persuade several 

European countries to agree that NO Americans would be subject to the jurisdiction 

of the court. 

<P>Mr. Bush fears that American citizens brought before that court might end up 

being deprived of the kinds of constitutional protections of which Mr. Bush routinely 

deprives those he designates "enemy combatants." Mr. Bush, however, only applies 

that label to people truly deserving of it whereas foreigners less sensitive to 

those protections might apply it to people such as Mr. Rumsfeld or Mr. Cheney, 

especially if they were to do something like blow up a car in some country with 

whom we are not even at war. Such an action would, depending on the car's occupants, 

be entirely appropriate because of who we are, whereas it would be totally inappropriate 

were it done by someone else. And that brings me to a very important point. 

<P>In early November a missile fired by a U.S. Predator drone over Yemen blew 

up a car, killing its six occupants, one of whom was Abu Ali al-Harithi, the man 

believed to have been one of the planners of the attack on the USS Cole and a 

man linked, among other things, to the Oct. 7 bombing of the French oil tanker 

off the coast of Yemen. Mr. Rumsfeld delivered the administration eulogy for Mr. 

Harithi saying: "It would be a very good thing if he were out of business." 

<P>This was the first known use of lethal military force outside Afghanistan since 

the beginning of the war on terrorism. It was carried out under broad authority 

that Mr. Bush has given the CIA over the past year to pursue terror wherever it 

is found. The killing does not violate the ban that the United States has on assassinating 

political leaders because none of the six victims was regarded as a political 

leader. 

<P>Some people compared this targeted killing with the Israeli targeted killing 

of Palestinian figures it regards as leading terrorists that the Bush administration 

deplores. That comparison is not apt. State Department spokesman Richard Boucher, 

commented on that very point, saying: "If you look back at what we have said about 

targeted killings in the Israeli-Palestinian context, you will find that the reasons 

we have given do not necessarily apply in other circumstances." 

<P>Equally as illuminating as Mr. Boucher's comments were those of former Sen. 

Warren Rudman, who explained that in the war on terrorism there are no rules. 

The terrorists "have none and we have to take whatever risks you have to take 

to make them fear us." He went on to say that the United States may carry out 

attacks within other countries even without the cooperation or approval of those 

governments. He would, I am sure, be the first to explain that that is so because 

of who we are and that we would not tolerate another country's applying the same 

standard in deciding to blow up a vehicle filled with suspected terrorists in 

the United States. 

<P>A former Clinton administration foreign policy adviser said we must work with 

friends and allies when fighting a stateless enemy. He went on to say, however, 

that: "We have to make sure that the U.S. government does not become &#151; in 

fact or perception &#151; judge, jury and executioner around the world. If the 

technique is used indiscriminately, there will be a backlash." 

<P>The Israelis know what he means. In early November they killed Mohammad Abdel 

Al, a member of Islamic Jihad's military wing. Defending the attack, Israeli Transport 

Minister, Ephraim Sneh, using language mimicking Mr. Bush, said: "These are people 

who have set themselves a goal of destroying Israel." Abdul Al allegedly killed 

an Israeli soldier in a 1994 shooting attack, helped plot a 1995 suicide bombing 

that killed more than 20 Israelis and in February planted two roadside bombs in 

Gaza. Mr. Bush, who can distinguish between what he authorizes and what Mr. Sharon 

authorizes, thus has no difficulty criticizing the Israeli policy while employing 

it for his own purposes. 

<P>Under the new Bush plan it is more important than ever that United States citizens 

not be subject to the jurisdiction of some international court of criminal justice. 

There might come a day when some country would fail to understand the distinction 

between what Mr. Bush does and what Mr. Sharon does and charge U.S. citizens with 

war crimes. Given the purity of our motives and Mr. Bush's great popularity, that 

would be completely inappropriate. One can only hope that other countries see 

the error of their way and agree to exempt the United States from the reach of 

a court run by a bunch of foreigners.
