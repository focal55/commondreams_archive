<p>AUSTIN, Texas &#151; Sometimes you have to connect the dots, and sometimes 

the connections just hit you over the head. 

<P>Congress is on the verge of taking a final vote on the bankruptcy bill, the 

product of a five-year effort by credit-card companies to stack the law in their 

favor and against average citizens. But you will be relieved to learn that our 

lawmakers have thoughtfully included a loophole that leaves six states, including 

Florida and Texas, free to continue providing extraordinary advantages to rich 

citizens from all over the country who need to shelter their gelt from bankruptcy 

proceedings. The millionaire protection amendment. 

<P>And this is about to happen despite the fact that one of the bill's most important 

sponsors, a congressman with financial problems, got a $447,500 loan &#151; as 

The New York Times genteelly put it, "on what appeared to be highly favorable 

terms," from (guess who? Right again) &#151; a major credit card company. 

<P>Rep. James P. Moran, Democrat of Virginia, got the loan from the MBNA Corp. 

of Delaware in 1998, the world's largest independent credit card agency, just 

one month before he signed on as the lead Democratic sponsor of the bill, giving 

it the appearance of a bipartisan effort. Quite a coincidence, eh? 

<P>And that's just what Rep. Moran said. "The timing of my loan was wholly coincidental 

with the co-sponsorship of bankruptcy reform." 

<P>I find that entirely believable, since I live in Texas where such coincidences 

lie thick on the ground. Just last summer, our governor Rick Perry appointed a 

former Enron executive to the state Public Utilities Commission, to better to 

regulate our energy market. The very next day, Perry got a $25,000 check from 

Kenny Boy Lay, but Perry explained, it was "totally coincidental." 

<P>You would think Moran would have a little more sympathy for Americans caught 

in the toils of the bankruptcy laws &#151; his own financial problems stem from 

running up debts on his credit cards, stock market losses and paying for cancer 

treatment for his daughter. Ninety-percent of all bankruptcies are caused by getting 

sick, getting laid off or divorce. But then, most Americans don't get half-million-dollar 

loans that qualify as the largest mortgage package given by MBNA to any single 

debtor that year. 

<P>Naturally, most congresspeople get their money from credit card companies in 

the form of campaign contributions, rather than loans. And that makes it so much 

better, you see. MBNA was President Bush's largest corporate contributor in 2000 

and, since 1990, banks alone have made contributions of over $106 million to Congress, 

the parties and presidential candidates. The Center for Responsive Politics website 

(opensecrets.org) has the gory details on who got how much with links to current 

contributions. 

<P>Bankruptcies have been rising in recent years, but there is no evidence of 

abuse of the system by average Americans or that it is hurting the card companies. 

Credit-card debt and credit-card companies profits are rising, too. 

<P>This card-company bill institutes a harsh "means test" and makes it much harder 

to get the "fresh start" status from bankruptcy. Average citizens will be pushed 

into five-year repayment plans, leaving less for child support. The bill will 

particularly affect women. 

<P>But whose fault is it that bankruptcies are rising? The Public Interest Research 

Group points out that the four leading banking regulatory agencies &#151; the 

Federal Reserve Board, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Office 

of Thrift Supervision and the FDIC &#151; just issued a report in June documenting 

predatory lending practices. The credit card companies are making loans to consumers 

already in debt trouble, not to mention offering cards to teenagers. Some credit-card 

companies charge monthly minimum payments so low consumers wind up owing more 

than they did before, instead of ever paying off their credit-card debts. 

<P>Citibank has just agreed to pay the Federal Trade Commission $200 million to 

settle predatory lending charges. So why reward the very companies that are causing 

the problem? Is this what Congress intended with its "Corporate Responsibility 

Act"? 

<P>The bill does contain a provision to keep Kenny Boy and Company from taking 

advantage of the millionaire's loophole: You can't use it if you've been convicted 

of securities fraud. Great, but as you may have read, it is extremely difficult 

to get convictions for securities fraud. 

<P>In Texas, at the end of the tech bubble, the S&L frauds and after the stock 

market dive, people here are suddenly scrambling for high-end houses. They trade 

up from the $1 million house to the $5 million or $10 million. The state's "homestead" 

exemption protects the family home from the claims of debtors. It's a good thing 

for most people, but has become another form of fraud by the big rich. 

<P>This bill stinks. Write, phone, fax or e-mail your representatives, and remind 

them that they work for you, not the credit-card industry. </p>
