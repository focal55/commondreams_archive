<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->In the run-up to the Gulf War, government officials put forth a bewildering 

array of reasons for the war, culminating with Secretary of State Baker's 

fatuous claim that "it's about jobs."



<p>In this coming war, perhaps the earliest and most consistently telegraphed 

since Cato the Elder's repeated calls for the destruction of Carthage, a 

similar confusion reigns. The same reflexively secretive administration 

that didn't want to disclose which companies it met with and for how long 

when formulating its energy policy has released at least four different 

plans for achieving "regime change" -- widely-announced "covert" 

operations, the "Afghan strategy," "Gulf War lite," and the "Baghdad/inside 

out option." It has also released numerous reports of generals, military 

strategists, and other insiders who oppose the war, to the point that 

people seriously wonder what's going on.



<p>This confusion has reached such heights that many are beginning to call 

this a "Wag the Dog" war, an attempt to avoid a Republican disaster in the 

November elections. While the exact timing may be affected by domestic 

considerations, the claim that they are the reason for the war itself is 

implausible when you consider that there has been talk about war on Iraq 

ever since 9/11, at a time when the world was Bush's oyster. In fact, the 

war is simply a continuation of the "regime change" policy of over ten 

years' standing -- except that in the post-9/11 world the government 

believes that it can get away with anything by invoking terrorism as a threat.



<p>So what is really going on?



<p>Let's start with what are not the reasons for the war. None of those put 

forth by the Bush administration hold water.



<p>Shortly after 9/11, there was an attempt to relate Iraq to the attacks. The 

original claim that Mohammed Atta, one of the hijackers, met with Iraqi 

intelligence in Prague earlier in the year, quickly fell apart, as Czech 

officials engaged in an array of recantations and re-recantations. There 

are also allegations, recently resurrected, that Iraq had a terrorist 

training camp at Salman Pak, where Islamic fundamentalists were trained in 

how to hijack planes. It's hard to argue against any of this simply because 

there's so little there there; in fact, for months the administration 

stopped claiming any connection, unthinkable had there been any concrete 

evidence. The best current argument for this connection is Donald 

Rumsfeld's dictum that "the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence."



<p>The main reason given for the war, of course, is the threat of Iraq's 

weapons of mass destruction.



<p>Scott Ritter, formerly one of the most hawkish of the U.N. weapons 

inspectors in Iraq, has stated repeatedly that Iraq is "qualitatively 

disarmed;" although there's no way to account for every nut and bolt and 

gallon of biological growth medium in the country, it had (as of December 

1998) no functional capacity to develop biological, chemical, or nuclear 

weapons. The common counter-argument is that Iraq could acquire them and 

the longer we wait the greater the chances.



<p>Given the widespread credulous acceptance of this argument, it's worth 

nothing that even the extremely one-sided pro-war panel on the first day of 

the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's hearings on Iraq was unable to 

produce any reason why Saddam would jeopardize his position by plotting an 

attack that would surely invite massive retribution. In fact, although he 

has used weapons of mass destruction before, most notably against the Kurds 

(at which time he was aided and abetted by the United States), the most 

plausible scenario in which he would use them again is under threat of 

American attack.



<p>Beyond that, successive U.S. administrations have done all they could to 

sabotage arms control in Iraq and worldwide.



<p>First, in December 1998, President Clinton pulled out the weapons 

inspectors preparatory to the "Desert Fox" bombing campaign -- even though 

he knew this meant the end of weapons inspections. This is normally 

reported in the press as the "expulsion" of the weapons inspectors.



<p>Next, in a move that stunned and angered the international community, 

George W. Bush killed the proposed enforcement and verification mechanism 

for the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention -- in December 2001, after 

the threat of bioweapons attacks was particularly clear.



<p>Passed in 1972, the convention has over 100 signatories, including Iraq and 

the United States. Because of the lack of an enforcement mechanism, 

countries were free to violate it, as did Iraq and the United States -- 

both have attempted to weaponize anthrax, for example, as we found out when 

U.S.-developed anthrax killed six Americans in the fall of 2001.



<p>In 1995, those signatories started negotiations to provide enforcement 

through mutual, intrusive inspections. For six years, the U.S. government 

threw up constant roadblocks, finally terminating negotiations. The reason? 

Biological weapons inspections in the United States might imperil the 

profits of biotech companies. Of course, had the enforcement mechanism 

passed, it could have been used to press for inspections in Iraq.



<p>Even worse, in March 2002, the United States removed Jose Bustani, head of 

the Organization to Prevent Chemical Weapons, from office. According to 

George Monbiot of the Guardian, it was because Bustani's efforts to include 

Iraq in the Chemical Weapons Convention (subjecting it to chemical weapons 

inspections) would deprive the United States of a casus belli.



<p>There is consensus by arms control experts that weapons inspections in Iraq 

were extraordinarily effective in finding and dismantling weapons of mass 

destruction. Clearly, the administration isn't really concerned about this 

threat.



<p>Constant protestations in the Senate hearings and elsewhere to the 

contrary, the administration is also not concerned about democracy in Iraq.



<p>Consider the U.S. reaction to the Iraqi intifada, the mass uprising of 

Iraqis after the Gulf War, in response to a call by George Bush, Sr., to 

the Iraqi people to overthrow Saddam. In February and March of 1991, at the 

peak of that rebellion, Saddam's regime was seriously imperiled.



<p>In order to save Saddam's regime, the U.S. military deliberately lifted the 

existing no-fly zone, allowing Saddam to use his helicopter gunships 

against the rebels; it seized arms depots so the rebels couldn't arm 

themselves; and it even allowed the Republican Guards safe passage through 

its ranks to put down the uprising.



<p>At the time, Richard Haas of the State Department explained, "What we want 

is Saddam's regime without Saddam." In 1996, on ABC, Brent Scowcroft 

explained further that the United States did not want a popular democratic 

movement that overthrew Saddam -- it wanted a palace coup.



<p>When all the official justifications collapse, what is left is the same 

ugly three-letter word that has always been at the core of U.S. Middle East 

policy -- oil. It's important to clarify, however, that U.S. policy is 

neither simply about access to oil, which is how mainstream commentators 

frame it, nor is it completely dictated by oil companies, as some on the 

left claim.



<p>Access to oil can be obtained by paying for it, as other countries do. The 

United States has a different attitude because it is an empire, not merely 

a nation. On any given day, U.S. troops are in 140 countries around the 

world, with permanent bases in over half of those. After two decades of 

structural adjustment and one of "free trade," the United States has more 

control over the internal policies of other countries than the elected 

governments of those countries. Although "globalization" was recently the 

more visible face of this imperial expansion, it always had a military 

underpinning -- and currently the military aspect is dominant.



<p>This empire is predicated, like past empires, on political control for the 

purpose of economic control and resource and surplus extraction. Oil is the 

world's most important resource, and control of the flow and pricing of oil 

is a potent source of political power, as well as a significant source of 

profits. Oil companies, arms companies, and general corporate America are 

all intimately concerned with U.S. Middle East policy.



<p>Iraq nationalized its oil in 1972, taking complete control over its own 

selling and pricing of oil and over the use of oil revenues. Iraq's 

invasion of Kuwait put an end to that.



<p>The sanctions imposed after that and maintained to this day have had many 

effects. In addition to causing the death of over 500,000 children under 

the age of five (according to a UNICEF study), sanctions have partially 

broken Iraqi control of Iraq's oil. Starting with a complete ban on oil 

sales, they were gradually modified so that now there are no restrictions 

on sales. Iraq cannot make its own decisions about oil exploration and 

investment, nor until recently about repair of existing oil production 

facilities. Most important, all revenues from oil sales are deposited in a 

bank account in New York administered by the Security Council. Money is 

disbursed from that account, only with the permission of the United States, 

and almost exclusively to foreign corporations.



<p>The sanctions have turned the Iraqi regime permanently against the United 

States. If they were lifted, the government would make oil exploration 

deals with French and Russian companies, not American ones. Continuation of 

the sanctions is a constant political burden for the United States. The 

Bush administration wants a war to extricate itself from this stalemate, by 

replacing Saddam with a U.S.-friendly dictator who will make deals with 

American companies and follow American dictates.



<p>The Afghanistan war was the opening move in a potentially far-reaching 

gambit. It was not particularly about fighting terrorism -- it was planned 

before 9/11, and even U.S. government officials have concluded (in a June 

16 New York Times article) that it may have made "rooting out" al-Qaeda 

more, not less, difficult, because of the geographic dispersion caused by 

the war. It was also not just about a natural gas pipeline through 

Afghanistan, although those plans seem to be going forward. It also got the 

U.S. military into all seven "stans," including potentially 

oil-and-gas-rich Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan.



<p>If Bush gets his Iraq war, given Russia's rapprochement with NATO, there 

will also be a complete military encirclement of Iran, the other part of 

the "axis of evil" (North Korea was thrown in for ballast). At that point, 

Iran will find it increasingly difficult not to accede to U.S. wishes.



<p>ExxonMobil, Shell, and other companies are currently negotiating with Saudi 

Arabia to do natural gas exploration. Although the Saudis say they will 

never allow foreign corporations to get their hands on crude oil, this is 

an important beginning.



<p>According to "The New Oil War," an article in the March/April 2002 issue of 

Foreign Affairs, OPEC countries have not increased their pumping capacity 

in over twenty years. This is the natural consequence, though the article 

doesn't say it, of the dual U.S. policy of propping up corrupt feudal 

elites that use the revenues from oil sales to invest in U.S. and European 

corporations instead of investing them in their own economies and of 

"containment" (i.e., targeting for destruction) those few countries, like 

Iraq and Iran, that do try to develop their internal economies. Over the 

next twenty years, world requirements for Middle East oil are expected to 

double.



<p>The United States seeks nothing less than the establishment of complete 

control over all significant sources of oil, especially of the Middle East, 

which holds roughly two thirds of the world's proven reserves. The twin 

requirements of U.S. imperial control and the constant feeding of an 

industrial system based on ever-increasing levels of fossil fuel 

consumption dovetail with the systematic attempts of the United States to 

keep Middle Eastern countries from developing independent economies to set 

the stage for large-scale re-colonization, through war, "covert" action, 

and economic coercion.



<p>This war is not about minor domestic squabbles between Democrats and 

Republicans, but about a very ugly New World Order, in which innocents in 

the Middle East, Central Asia, and in the United States pay for the 

imperial dreams of an increasingly detached American elite.
