<p>BARCELONA, Spain -- Does Iraq have nuclear weapons? Last week, Britain's authoritative 

International Institute for Strategic Studies issued a study that concluded Iraq 

had the ability to produce a few nuclear devices, but lacked the enriched uranium 

or plutonium to do so. 

<p>The institute's report seemed timed to provide more justification for a U.S.-British 

attack on Iraq. The U.S. and British governments as well as world media seized 

on the report to intensify claims that Iraq was a grave nuclear threat. 

<p>As a long-time member of the institute, I was disappointed that it would appear 

to bend to pressure from the British government by producing a report that was 

misleading and sensational. Instead of supporting "regime change" in Baghdad, 

the IISS might do better to review its own weak leadership at London HQ. 

<p>Iraq has no nuclear weapons or fissionable materials. This fact has been certified 

by the UN's nuclear inspection agency. As to IISS claims Iraq has the capability 

to produce nuclear devices, so do more than 40 nations. Making a nuclear weapon 

is relatively simple. Take 4-9 kilos of highly enriched uranium or plutonium, 

surrounded with a specially shaped shell of high-explosive lenses, and detonate. 

<p>The recipe is available on the Internet. The trick is acquiring highly enriched 

uranium or plutonium. This process requires hugely expensive, laborious separation 

and enrichment using banks of centrifuges, as well as expertise in fusing, and 

shaped-charge explosives. 

<p>In the 1980s, Iraq was indeed working on a crude nuclear weapon. Saudi Arabia 

secretly funded this top secret project in order to counter Israel's large nuclear 

arsenal, believed to number over 200 devices. Iraq acquired uranium from South 

Africa in exchange for oil. South Africa, which produced eight nuclear devices, 

secretly obtained its nuclear weapons technology from Israel. Ironically, South 

Africa later sold the Israeli uranium enrichment technology to Iraq. 

<p><B>The Bush Sr. trap</B> 

<p>When Saddam Hussein stumbled into the trap laid for him by George Bush Sr. 

by invading Kuwait in 1990, his scientists were within a few years of producing 

a primitive nuclear test device. During the 1991 Gulf war, Iraq's total nuclear 

and, in fact, total national industrial infrastructure, were pulverized by massive 

U.S. bombing. Before the war, Iraq had been the most technologically developed 

and best educated nation in the Arab world. After, Iraq was reduced to pre-World 

War I level, with even its water and sewage systems wrecked by America's ruthless 

air campaign. 

<p>However, Iraq still retains a cadre of about 10,000 trained nuclear scientists 

and technicians. Unless they are all shot, Iraq will in theory be able one day 

to build a nuclear weapon, provided it can obtain fissionable material. Once the 

crushing blockade of Iraq is lifted, Baghdad might be able to produce one or two 

nuclear warheads within five years. But having warheads and delivering them are 

two different things. Iraq lacks aircraft or missiles to deliver nuclear weapons 

beyond a range of 70 miles. 

<p>Iraq is a leading Arab nation with the Mideast's second largest oil reserves. 

Unless the U.S. succeeds in implanting and maintaining a compliant regime in Baghdad, 

such as it has done in Kabul, whatever brutal general that succeeds Saddam will 

eventually seek nuclear weapons. Why? 

<p>First, to counter Israel's nuclear monopoly. Israel is considered a mortal 

threat by the Arabs and Iranians. Second, because Iraq fears neighbouring Iran, 

which has three times its population. Interestingly, every Iraqi leader since 

the 1920s has vowed to invade Kuwait and reunite it with Iraq. Why, in fact, should 

Iraq not have the right to possess nuclear weapons to protect its vast oil reserves? 

<p>President Bush claimed last week that an attack on Iraq was justified because 

it had refused to bow to UN resolutions and had weapons of mass destruction. Bush 

could just as well have been talking about Israel, which ignores scores of UN 

resolutions and refuses to admit nuclear arms inspectors. Or of India, which also 

ignores UN resolutions on Kashmir, and is developing a very large nuclear arsenal 

with Israeli aid, that includes nuclear-armed ICBM missiles that will soon be 

able to reach the U.S. 

<p>The original 1990 UN resolution authorizing military action to evict Iraq from 

Kuwait had a little-noticed article that called for the Security Council to immediately 

begin a process of regional nuclear arms control and disarmament. This provision 

was totally ignored, yet it offers a key to the Iraq problem. 

<p>Instead of Bush threatening a war of pure aggression against Iraq - what used 

to be called "warmongering" - the U.S., European Union and Canada should begin 

an intensive campaign to rid the Mideast of nuclear, chemical, and biological 

weapons. Regional disarmament cannot be accomplished until all nations, including 

Israel and Iran, are thoroughly inspected by impartial specialists - Canadians 

would be ideal. There must be no repeat of the 1990s, when many UN inspectors 

in Iraq turned out to be U.S. and Israeli spies whose job was to target Saddam 

Hussein for assassination. 

<p>President Bush might even begin this overdue process by getting rid of a lot 

more of his own weapons of mass destruction.
