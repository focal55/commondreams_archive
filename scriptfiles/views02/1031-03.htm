<p>Beyond Paul Wellstone&#39;s death being a tragedy, the one thing everyone seems 

to agree on is that as a "true liberal," Wellstone was a member of a dying breed 

(for GOP purposes this endangered species will of course include Walter Mondale 

in the next few days). But this casting only proves how dramatically the terms 

of debate in American politics have shifted to the right.</P>

<P>The interesting thing is that the postmortems on Wellstone&#39;s liberalism 

almost never mention actual policy issues that supposedly placed him beyond the 

pale, apart from his two votes against war in Iraq. So let&#39;s look at what 

Wellstone actually stood for when he died:</P>

<P><B>&#149; Health care. </B>Wellstone thought it was wrong that 41 million Americans 

were uninsured. He believed they should be guaranteed a benefit package equal 

to that enjoyed by members of Congress. I defy any conservative in Congress to 

explain why this notion is "outside the mainstream." </P>

<P><B>&#149; Wages. </B>Wellstone believed it was wrong that the federal minimum 

wage, at &#36;5.15 an hour, was worth less now, adjusted for inflation, than it 

was in the 1970s. He thought full-time work should enable a decent life. Polls 

show that most Americans agree. </P>

<P><B>&#149; Welfare. </B>Yes, Wellstone voted against 1996&#39;s welfare reform. 

But so did Bob Kerrey, nobody&#39;s idea of a "true liberal." Kerrey voted against 

it because he thought ending a &#36;15 billion a year subsistence entitlement 

for (at the time) 4 million poor adults and their 10 million blameless children 

-- while leaving untouched several hundred billion a year in entitlements for 

Americans earning more than &#36;50,000 a year -- was immoral. "We don&#39;t spend 

too much on the poor," Kerrey told me this week. "We spend too little. Then and 

now." What a pinko! Well, at least Kerrey wants Saddam&#39;s head.</P>

<P><B>&#149; Education. </B>Wellstone fought for well-funded after-school programs, 

which Arnold Schwarzenegger is championing via a ballot measure in California, 

and smart people think it may get Arnold the GOP nod for governor in four years. 

Wellstone opposed the "Leave No Child Behind" hoax because it was full of make-believe 

fixes -- such as a decree that states have a qualified teacher in every classroom, 

without any money to help poor districts actually achieve that goal. Opposing 

such "unfunded mandates" is usually a conservative fetish. My bet is that within 

six months governors of both parties will persuade Washington to waive many of 

these requirements as impractical, validating Wellstone&#39;s view of the bill 

as a politically inspired charade. </P>

<P>Wellstone thought it was wrong that the Head Start preschool program serves 

only half of eligible children, that Pell grants for disadvantaged college students 

are worth less than they were two decades ago even as tuitions have soared, and 

that crumbling schools need &#36;100 billion in repairs. He therefore thought 

it sensible to put off further tax cuts for people who earn more than &#36;300,000 

to address this. If that&#39;s "too liberal," then why are conservatives afraid 

to defend the merits of their tax cut for the top vs. Wellstone&#39;s uses for 

the same money -- and desperate to frame the debate instead through their generic 

"They&#39;re tax hikers!" demagoguery?</P>

<P>There&#39;s more, but you get the point. Paul Wellstone wasn&#39;t "embarrassingly 

liberal," as the attacks against him charged. It&#39;s that the rest of country 

has become "shamefully conservative," or, perhaps more accurately, "unthinkingly 

conservative," and the vital task is to understand why. Daniel Patrick Moynihan 

quips that no Democrat today would stand behind Richard Nixon&#39;s proposals 

for universal health coverage and a guaranteed minimum income for poor workers. 

Too liberal. What happened?</P>

<P>The right&#39;s great strategic achievement in the last 25 years -- from the 

aggressive conservative think tanks to Newt Gingrich&#39;s artful demagoguery 

on "Clintoncare" to the "compassionate conservative" hoax now on display -- has 

been to confuse the press and the public about how reasonable goals like Paul 

Wellstone&#39;s actually are. Wellstone wrote last year that he felt he was playing 

defense 80 percent of the time in the Senate. Given how mainstream most of his 

ideas were in the minds of real people, Democrats can best honor Wellstone&#39;s 

memory by finally becoming strategic themselves about how to play offense.</p>
