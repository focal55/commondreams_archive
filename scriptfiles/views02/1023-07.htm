<p>For me, it's as if I'm reliving what was happening in the Pentagon in 1964 

and 1965. This time, for awhile, it looked like the Democrats were ready to resist 

another Gulf of Tonkin (1964) resolution -- which got us into Vietnam -- but in 

the end they caved. So, now we have Tonkin Gulf II, with key phrases like "as 

the president determines" and "all necessary measures." That's an absolutely blank 

check, just like the Tonkin Gulf resolution. Only the place names have changed. 

<P>The people who voted for President Bush's resolution, especially the Democrats, 

covered themselves in shame. They voted away their exclusive war powers to a president 

who this time -- and this is different from 1964 -- they know is going to use 

the resolution for war. They won't have the excuse this time that they were lied 

to, like Lyndon Johnson, who promised that he had no intention of going to war 

without coming back to Congress for a more specific resolution. Senator Robert 

Byrd, D-W.Va., said he has felt ashamed and guilty for 38 years for voting for 

the Tonkin Gulf resolution. 

<P>It was equally shameful that 75 senators went against Byrd and voted to close 

off the debate on Iraq, even though they know in their hearts that Byrd and (Sen. 

Edward) Kennedy, D-Mass., and the others who voted against it are right -- that 

going to war with Iraq increases our risks of terrorism, strengthens al Qaeda's 

recruiting efforts and reduces the ability of Muslim countries to cooperate with 

us against al Qaeda, even if they wanted to. 

<P><b>THE REAL MOTIVE FOR WAR</b> 

<P>It's not about stopping proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, like 

the administration claims -- Vice President Dick Cheney and Defense Secretary 

Donald Rumsfeld know better than that. The real reason is right there, like the 

purloined letter, though saying it stamps you as some kind of vulgar radical or 

cynic. Oil. This war is going to be not just for Iraq's oil but to strengthen 

our control of Saudi Arabian oil, and eventually Iranian oil and Kuwaiti oil. 

War for oil is not some radical slogan, it's a simple statement of reality. The 

administration thinks that kind of control of the world's resources makes war 

worthwhile, but they're not putting that out to the public. 

<P>What they are holding out is an image of empire that in this chaotic world 

looks rather attractive to a lot of Americans. But the lesson of Sept. 11 is that 

it's going to be a very bloody business. That's not to say anything in favor of 

the people or causes behind Sept. 11. But the fact is, killing innocent civilians 

in a Muslim country is going to lead to reaction that costs American lives as 

well. It's wrong of us to even think about waging an aggressive war under these 

conditions. 

<P><b>WHAT CAN BE DONE</b> 

<P>If people in the administration and the Pentagon can hear me, indirectly or 

directly, I urge them to consider that if they know of untruths; if they know 

of false arguments being made; if they know, from documents passing their hands, 

that the country is being deceived into a reckless war, then they should considering 

doing what I wish I had done in 1964 and 1965, rather than waiting till 1969 and 

1971: Going to Congress with the documents, and to the press, and telling the 

truth.</p>

<P><i>Daniel Ellsberg is a former Pentagon official who in 1971 leaked a 7,000- 

page study to the press that detailed American involvement in Vietnam. The release 

of the study, which became known as the Pentagon Papers, set in motion a chain 

of events that helped lead to the resignation of President Nixon and the end of 

the Vietnam War. Ellsberg, who lives in Berkeley and Washington, D. C., is the 

author of the just published Secrets: A Memoir of Vietnam and the Pentagon Papers. 

He is scheduled to speak tonight at 8 p.m. at UC Berkeley's Zellerbach Auditorium, 

in a speech co-sponsored by the World Affairs Council of Northern California and 

the Independent Institute of Oakland.</i></p>
