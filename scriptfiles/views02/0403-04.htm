For the last few months, we’ve been hearing an awful lot about Enron.



<p>By now we know the basic story: A handful of greedy corporate executives at Enron cheated the public out of millions of dollars using every accounting and influence peddling trick in the book. Stock analysts and members of the media cheered adoringly. Accountants and government officials signed off or stood by without a second thought. From Ken Lay’s perspective, the system worked perfectly.



<p>But now that the details have come out, general response has been outrage, and rightly so. What Enron and Andersen executives did was wrong, and they should be punished accordingly. Most of us can agree on that much.



<p>But let’s make no mistake -- the unbridled greed that drove Enron executives to create fraudulent earnings reports is the driving force behind almost every corporation in America. These days, profits matter more than anything else.



<p>Unfortunately for most citizens, the dangerous consequences of corporate greed are usually far more difficult to detect than the fireworks surrounding Enron’s demise. Slowly declining pay and benefits for workers, subtle reductions in quality and value for consumers, reduced contractual rights and privacy, invisible toxic pollution and tax evasion schemes – these things happen too gradually and inconspicuously to make the daily papers.



<p>Most of the information we do get from corporations comes in loud and glitzy advertisements and pervasive public relations campaigns, all designed to deter us from the slightest criticism of the consumer goods and services that have given us our standard of living.



<p>But cutting through the smoke and the mirrors of corporate propaganda just takes some basic critical thinking. You can even start with that Coca-Cola in your hand. Yeah, the same sugary soft-drink that is advertised just about everywhere and is rammed into our schools even as record levels of diabetes among our nation’s youth continue to grow. Or that McDonald’s meal you had for lunch? Ever wonder why three-fifths of Americans are overweight, a problem that will cost our healthcare system billions of dollars?



<p>And what about that car that you drove to work today? Yeah, the one that doesn’t really get that many miles to the gallon. But it’s okay – it’s not your really your fault. It’s not like there are too many fuel-efficient vehicles to choose from anyway. After all, automakers can’t be bothered with fuel efficiency, and besides, better fuel efficiency would hurt the oil industry, too.



<p>Such a list could go on forever – the big chain stores where we shop, with their sub par working conditions and their awful effects on small independent businesses – not to mention the cheap, sweatshop-manufactured consumer goods that they bombard our lives with. The credit card companies that bury us deep in personal debt with shameless predatory lending. The ubiquitous billboards and advertisements that blemish every skyline, the branding of every facet of our lives.



<p>It’s only getting worse – corporate power is becoming more and more concentrated every minute. McDonald’s opens up six restaurants a day and serves 45 million people daily. Wal-Mart , now the leader of the Fortune 500, opens up a Superstore every other day and now employs 1.2 million people and takes in more revenue than the entire GNP of Austria. The pace of worldwide mergers and acquisitions has steadily grown from 94 in 1980 to 38,342 in 2000.



<p>Wealth is reaching levels of concentration not seen since before the stock market crash of 1929. The top 1% now control 38.1% of the wealth and the top 5% control 60% of the wealth. The average CEO makes 531 times the entry-level employee. The bottom 40% control just 0.2% of the wealth. These are numbers more akin a third-world dictatorship than a modern democracy.



<p>April 6 is Big Business Day. It is a day to talk about the incredible power that big business has over our lives – the jobs we do, the products we buy, the air we breathe. Even most of our elected officials, the people who are supposed to represent our interests, are primarily doing the work of the corporations who lavish them with hefty donations and then pester them with high-priced lobbyists. All we have is our vote.



<p>But working together, we can create a future where citizens are in power, where entrepreneurship, good business practices, and community thrives, where individuals can dictate the terms of their own lives, where families are not threatened by commercialism or life-altering toxic chemicals, where people matter more than profits. In order to do so, we must speak out and speak out loudly. We must demand more. Because so much more is possible.
