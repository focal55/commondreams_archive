<p>Army Secretary Thomas White appears to be inching closer to becoming the first Bush Administration casualty of the Enron scandal. Senators Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer of California have asked Attorney General John Ashcroft to launch a criminal probe into Enron's role in manipulating California's electricity market, after Enron memos released by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission showed how Enron boosted electricity prices in California and created shortages. </p>

<p>

People close to Feinstein and California Congressman Henry Waxman said

the lawmakers will ask Ashcroft to direct that the criminal

investigation include White and whether the unit he helped lead, Enron

Energy Services, played a part in California's two-year energy crisis.

"We believe we have evidence, based on our conversations with former

Enron employees, that Mr. White and other executives from Enron Energy

Services may have worked side by side with Enron's traders and supplied

inside information about the amount of electricity California needed,"

an aide to Feinstein said. "We believe, based on this information, that

the traders were then able to create shortages and manipulate the price

of power in the state."

</p>

<p>

Neither a spokesman for White nor for Enron returned calls for comment.

Enron is already under investigation by California Attorney General Bill

Lockyer for allegedly manipulating the price of electricity and natural

gas. White is being investigated by the FBI on the timing of his sale of

Enron stock last year and by the Inspector General's office on his use

in March of a government airplane to fly to Aspen to sign papers on the

sale of a $6.5 million house he owned, prompted by Enron-related

financial problems. Separately, he engaged in a dispute with Defense

Secretary Donald Rumsfeld over the Crusader weapons system; Rumsfeld

continued to express support for him.

</p>

<p>

Former employees of EES have come forward saying that the retail unit,

under White's leadership, played a role in California's power crisis and

that White told his staff that EES would earn millions in profits

because of the crisis. In addition, former employees are coming forward

with information about White that indicates that his involvement with

Enron's suspect accounting was far deeper that he has let on. White has

said that EES was a legitimate operation and not a house of illusory

profits.

</p>

<p>

John Olson, an analyst now with Sanders Morris Harris, recalls asking

White in 1999 how EES, a relatively small operation, could show millions

of dollars in profit with barely a shred of business. "I did not believe

Mr. White, nor any of the other Enron executives I spoke with, were

being honest or forthcoming about EES's profits," Olson said. "When I

pressed Mr. White for an answer he said, 'One word: California.'"

</p>

<p>

White told EES's sales team in 1998 that they could earn hefty bonuses

by signing energy contracts with large businesses in California to

manage their electricity needs for a substantially cheaper price than

these companies had been paying through their local utilities. But

promising customers a discount at the beginning of the contracts meant

EES wasn't earning enough money to cover what the local utilities were

charging for gas and electricity. Moreover, EES was spending much more

than anticipated setting up the infrastructure for the contracts, said

Lee Jestings, a former EES executive who worked directly with White.

</p>

<p>

Jestings said he told White that EES would actually lose money this way,

but White said Enron would make up the difference by selling electricity

on the spot market in California, which Enron had bet would skyrocket in

2000. Jestings said he continued to complain to White that the profits

declared by the retail unit were not real. "Tom told me those are the

orders," Jestings said. "He said he never questions a direct order. This

man spent thirty years in the Army and was a four-star general. His life

was based on taking orders." Jestings said he resigned from EES in 2000

because he did not agree with the way EES reported profits. He is now

working as an energy consultant.

</p>

<p>

The ex-employees, more than a dozen interviewed, said White often

clashed with Lou Pai, chairman of EES, over the company's use of

"aggressive" accounting methods to make the unit appear profitable when

it wasn't but that ultimately White agreed that EES would have to use

such methods because the unit was hemorrhaging cash right from the

start. Steve Barth, a former EES vice president of special projects who

attended meetings with White and Pai, said White's job was that of

cheerleader--he was supposed to motivate the EES sales force to show, by

any means necessary, that the retail unit made a profit. "That meant

lying to Wall Street," Barth said. "White did it, and so did I." Barth,

who transferred from EES to Enron's broadband unit in 1999 and left last

July to start a broadband firm, said his experience at the company had

been positive. 

</p>

<p>

Enron reported that EES, founded in 1997, became profitable during the

fourth quarter of 1999 and had steadily rising profits every quarter

thereafter. Those reports helped send Enron's stock price to $83 by the

end of 2000, from $43 at the beginning of the year. As part of his

employment contract with Enron, White was given a small financial stake

in EES, later converted into Enron stock, which he sold for more than

$50 million. 

</p>

<p>

Eventually, with Enron becoming a target of California lawmakers, White

may have decided it was time to get out. In early 2001, according to

Barth, when then-Enron chairman Kenneth Lay was under consideration to

be Energy Secretary, Lay met with George W. Bush and urged him to

appoint White as Secretary of the Army. Barth said White told him that

the California energy crisis was hurting EES and that the unit's profits

would never materialize. White "just wasn't happy with his role at the

company anymore," Barth said.
