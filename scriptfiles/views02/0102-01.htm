WELL, I tried to compile a list of good things that came out of 2001, but 

it was so short it wouldn't fill this space. So, I'll look ahead instead and 

list a few things I hope to see happen in 2002.

<P>Most of them, I know, should be subtitled, 'In My Dreams.'

<P>-- Sooner than later, the mainstream U.S. news media -- especially 

electronic types -- will snap out of the ultimate-video-game trance that's 

been induced by our undeclared and totally lacking-in-boundaries war on 

terrorism.

<P>When they do snap out of it, they will regain their perspective and start 

reporting the military events of whatever country we happen to be ripping up 

in search of terrorists as only one aspect (albeit an expensive one) of a huge,

complex, global situation.

<P>And they will quote George W. Bush about the war only when he actually has 

something informative to say instead of trumpeting his every 'We are resolved,

' 'We have them on the run' or 'I'm a patient man,' as if that were real news.

<P>-- In a similar vein, previously courageous and intelligent members of 

Congress will get it together to start questioning the wisdom (let alone 

morality) of how much we are spending in money and people power to 'smoke out' 

terrorists the hard way.

<P>They will shove aside their fears of losing re-election and listen to their 

conscience and their years of experience. If they are Sen. Barbara Boxer or 

Rep. Nancy Pelosi, they will at least look us in the eye and say one of two 

things:

<P>'I've rolled over to the Bush juggernaut because I'm privy to a lot of 

really scary military information that I can't share' or 'I saw what happened 

to Barbara Lee and I just haven't got the guts.'

.

<P>-- Likewise, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops will start 

listening to the few sages among them -- say, Detroit's Thomas Gumbleton -- 

and put discussion of such unholy matters as nuclear weapons and the missile 

defense shield back on their agenda where it belongs.

<P>Then, they can take another vote and see if the majority still feels like 

issuing knee-jerk approvals of the Bush administration's war on terrorism or 

its plan to spend obscene amounts of money on a missile shield that is more 

about protecting the U.S. military's offensive capabilities than protecting 

the citizens of New York or Los Angeles.

<P>-- Somebody in the print media will spend big bucks to put a team of 

investigative reporters on the still-mysterious (and slightly stinky to any 

veteran journalist) anthrax story. If it turns out that the perpetrators are 

an embarrassment to the military or an entity even higher up the chain of 

command, the investigative team's newspaper will have the cojones to publish 

the story.

<P>-- Every American public school kid (and every teacher) will be required to 

read or listen to a weekly digest of foreign coverage of our war on terrorism 

as well as other U.S. policy decisions that affect the rest of the world. I'm 

not talking about Fox's or CNN's version of Al Jazeera, I'm talking about 

translations of the front pages and nightly newscasts of media of our allied 

nations.

<P>-- On a local level, Mayor Willie Brown, the San Francisco Board of 

Supervisors and the people of this city finally will declare 'homelessness' 

the public health crisis that it is and act accordingly.

<P>No, Gavin Newsom, that does not mean we ape New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.

<P>After Sept. 11, he was a saint filling a crucial role for his people, but not 

all of his answers to the problems of the urban poor, mentally ill and 

addicted should be imitated.

<P>-- The San Francisco Bay Area will experience three straight days of 

sunshine.
