<p>Another day, another corporation caught cooking its books. Why should workers 

support better regulation of corporations and the super-rich in the U.S.? 

<p>Because regulating elites is a move towards a more humane future. That’s why. 

<p>Yet this should only be a short-term strategy. Please allow me to explain. 

<p>In the U.S., there currently is a mix of financial speculation and political 

machinations. The national air is thick with hope and fear. 

<p>On the one hand, there is conflict. On the other hand, a resolution is hard 

to see. 

<p>Meanwhile, the wave of financial scandals may be politically clearing the air. 

The daily disclosures of financial fragility could help to build a new politics 

of popular participation. 

<p>Against this backdrop, revelations of elites’ decadence appear to be spurring 

a political awakening of sorts. Is it an exaggeration to say that much rides on 

the emergence of the public’s political consciousness past solutions from the 

official sources in Washington and on Wall Street? 

<p>To be sure, many working people have good reason to be fearful. Millions of 

them who have become involved in financial speculation, now a sour place to be. 

<p>Case in point is U.S. workers’ retirements in 401(k) accounts, plummeting downward 

as stock prices sink. Sadly, this pension thievery began long before the current 

market swoon. 

<p>Then there are high-tech workers who have been paid in company shares. Those 

prices have plunged, leaving many holding a lightened portfolio. 

<p>Markets aren’t perfect. But during the recent boom phase their perfection was 

an article of faith, no less. 

<p>The Christian Science Monitor editorialized on July 9 that, “Investors will 

return to the market if Congress gets it right.” But there’s much less here than 

meets the eye. 

<p>Better regulation to restore investor confidence won’t change the nature of 

financial markets. Their rise, after all, came after U.S. elites squeezed workers 

through deregulation, downsizing, outsourcing and union-busting. 

<p>This redistributive trend gave new life to financial speculation, which rose 

like a phoenix from the ashes of U.S. workers’ shattered lives. Financial markets 

cheered when jobs disappeared, leaving elites with more cash to bid up share prices. 

<p>But all parties, financial and otherwise, come to an end. In fact, the bursting 

of the U.S. market bubble was foreshadowed by events abroad. 

<p>During the 1990s, U.S. elites led by the Clinton administration managed to 

confine financial crises to foreign shores. Crashes in Mexico, Southeast Asia 

and Russia “managed” by the IMF and World Bank were cases in point. 

<p>Busts abroad were a boom for some. Financial speculators such as George Soros 

made billions by profiting from the devaluation of nations’ currencies, causing 

much misery for workers and their families. 

<p>Which brings us back to the short-term, re-regulating U.S. elites to prevent 

further theft of wealth from working people via financial speculation. This is 

a necessary, yet contradictory, step. 

<p>It will likely be taken by the political class that serves immense wealth to 

protect it. They will do it, of course, in the name of those whose work makes 

the market economy function. 

<p>The governments that protect the few can, if pressured, also cushion the public 

from the harshness of the market. In the U.S., the New Deal during the Great Depression 

is proof of that. 

<p>But in our time, the popular forces whose politics made the New Deal happen 

are nowhere to be seen. But that could change, given the dynamic instability of 

the market economy, emerging before our eyes. 

<p>The seeds of such a popular politics exist. Demonstrations against corporate-led 

globalization and racial profiling are two examples that come to mind. 

<p>At any rate, it isn’t in the majority’s long-term interest to settle for legislation 

to make elites engaged in financial speculation more “honest.” Politically, the 

term is an evasion. 

<p>Corporations and rich people control society’s institutions, financial and 

otherwise, to accumulate more wealth by exploiting others. Honesty has nothing 

to do with it. 

<p>Government regulation is a means, not an end, to get public control of how 

people make the world they live in. The alternative is business-as-usual for elites. 

<p>They have every reason to maintain the status quo to amass more wealth that 

won’t be used to meet people’s basic needs. It’s time to think about how to change 

these social relations, to make the politically impractical become practical.
