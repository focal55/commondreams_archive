<p>On March 25, during a Pacifica radio interview, 

Representative Cynthia McKinney, a Georgia Democrat, said, 

"We know 

there were numerous warnings of the events to come on 

September 

11.... What did this Administration know, and when did it 

know it 

about the events of September 11? Who else knew and why 

did they not 

warn the innocent people of New York who were needlessly 

murdered?" McKinney 

was not merely asking if there had been an 

intelligence failure. She was suggesting--though not 

asserting--that 

the US government had foreknowledge of the specific attacks 

and 

either did not do enough to prevent them or, much worse, 

permitted 

them to occur for some foul reason. Senator Zell Miller, a 

conservative Democrat from her state, called her comments 

"loony." 

House minority leader Dick Gephardt noted that he 

disagreed with her. 

White House spokesman Ari Fleischer quipped, "The 

congresswoman must 

be running for the Hall of Fame of the Grassy Knoll Society." 

The 

<i> Atlanta Journal-Constitution</i> called her a "nut." Two 

months later, 

after it was revealed that George W. Bush had received an 

intelligence briefing a month before September 11 in which 

he informed 

told Osama bin Laden was interested in both hijacking 

airplanes and 

striking directly at the United States, McKinney claimed 

vindication. 

But that new piece of information did not support the 

explosive 

notion she had unfurled earlier--that the Bush Administration 

and/or 

other unnamed parties had been in a position to warn New 

Yorkers and 

had elected not to do so.

</p>

<p>

With her radio interview, McKinney became something of a 

spokesperson for people who question the official story of 

September 

11. As the  <i> Constitution</i>'s editorial page blasted her, 

its website 

ran an unscientific poll and found that 46 percent said, "I 

think 

officials knew it was coming." Out there--beyond newspaper 

conference 

rooms and Congressional offices--alternative scenarios and 

conspiracy 

theories have been zapping across the Internet for months. 

George W. 

Bush did it. The Mossad did it. The CIA did it. Or they 

purposely did 

not thwart the assault--either to have an excuse for war, to 

increase 

the military budget or to replace the Taliban with a 

government 

sympathetic to the West and the oil industry. The theories 

claim that 

secret agendas either caused the attacks or drove the 

post-9/11 

response, and these dark accounts have found an audience 

of 

passionate devotees.

</p>

<p>

I learned this after I wrote a <a 

href="http://www.alternet.org/print.html?StoryID=12536">column</a> dismissing 

various 9/11 

conspiracy theories. I expressed doubt that the Bush 

Administration 

would kill or allow the murder of thousands of American 

citizens to 

achieve a political or economic aim. (How could Karl Rove 

spin 

<i> that</i>, if a leak ever occurred?) Having covered the 

national 

security community for years, I didn't believe any government 

agency 

could execute a plot requiring the coordination of the FBI, the 

CIA, 

the INS, the FAA, the NTSB, the Pentagon and others. 

And--no small 

matter--there was no direct evidence that anything of such a 

diabolical nature had transpired.

</p>

<p>

Hundreds of angry e-mails poured in. Some accused me 

of being 

a sophisticated CIA disinformation agent. Others claimed I 

was 

hopelessly naive. (Could I be both?) Much of it concerned two 

men, 

Michael Ruppert and Delmart "Mike" Vreeland. Ruppert, a 

former Los 

Angeles cop, runs a website that has cornered a large piece 

of the 

alternative-9/11 market. An American who was  jailed in 

Canada, 

Vreeland claims to be a US naval intelligence officer who 

tried to 

warn the authorities before the attacks. Ruppert cites 

Vreeland to 

back up his allegation that the CIA had "foreknowledge" of 

the 9/11 

attacks and that there is a strong case for "criminal complicity 

on 

the part of the U.S. government in their execution." My article 



discounted their claims. But, I discovered, the two men had a 

loyal--and vocal--following. They were being booked on 

Pacifica 

stations. Ruppert was selling a video and giving speeches 

around the 

world. (In February, he filled a theater in Sacramento.) I 

decided to take a 

second--and deeper--look at the pair and key pieces of the 

9/11 conspiracy 

movement.

</p>

<p>

The Ex-Cop Who Connects the Dot

</p>

<p>

By his own account, Ruppert has long been a purveyor of 

amazing tales. In 1981 he told the Los Angeles <i> Herald 

Examiner</i> a 

bizarre story about himself: While a cop in the 1970s, he fell 

in love with a mysterious woman who, he came to believe, 

was working with the mob and US intelligence. Only 

after she left 

him, Ruppert 

said, did he figure out that his girlfriend had been a CIA 

officer 

coordinating a deal in which organized crime thugs were 

transporting 

weapons to Kurdish counterrevolutionaries in Iran in 

exchange for 

heroin. In an interview with the newspaper, the woman 

denied 

Ruppert's account and questioned his mental stability. 

Whatever the 

truth of his encounter with this woman, the relationship 

apparently 

extracted a toll on Ruppert. In 1978 he resigned from the 

force, 

claiming that the department had not protected him when his 

life was 

threatened. According to records posted on Ruppert's site, 

his 

commanding officer called his service "for the most part, 

outstanding." But the CO also said Ruppert was hampered 

by an 

"over-concern with organized crime activity and a feeling that 

his 

life was endangered by individuals connected to organized 

crime. This 

problem resulted in Officer Ruppert voluntarily committing 

himself to 

psychiatric care last year.... any attempts to rejoin the 

Department 

by Officer Ruppert should be approved only after a thorough 

psychiatric examination."

</p>

<p>

In 1996 Ruppert showed up at a community meeting in 

Los 

Angeles concerning charges that the CIA had been in league 

with crack 

cocaine dealers in the United States. There Ruppert claimed 

the 

agency had tried to recruit him in the 1970s to "protect CIA 

drug 

operations" in South Central Los Angeles--an allegation that 

was 

missing from the guns-and-drugs story published in 1981. In 

1998 he 

launched his <i>From the Wilderness</i> alternative 

newsletter, which 

examines what he considers to be the hidden currents of 

international 

economics and national security untouched by other media. 

On March 31 

of last year, for instance, he published a report on an 

economic 

conference in Moscow where the opening speaker was a 

fellow who works 

for Lyndon LaRouche, the conspiracy-theorist/political cult 

leader. 

"I share a near universal respect of the LaRouche 

organization's 

detailed and precise research," Ruppert wrote. "I have not, 

however, 

always agreed with [its] conclusions." Ruppert claims that 

twenty 

members of Congress subscribe to his newsletter.

</p>

<p>

Ruppert is not a reporter. He mostly assembles facts--or 

purported facts--from various news sources and then 

makes 

connections. The proof is not in any one piece--say, a White 

House 

memo detailing an arms-for-hostages trade. The proof is in 

the line 

drawn between the dots. His masterwork is a timeline of  

fifty-one 

events (at last count) that, he believes, demonstrate that the 

CIA 

knew of the attacks in advance and that the US government 

probably 

had a hand in them. Ruppert titled his timeline "Oh 

Lucy!--You Gotta 

Lotta 'Splaining To Do."

</p>

<p>

In the timeline he notes that transnational oil companies 

invested billions of dollars to gain access to the oil reserves 

of 

Central America and that they expressed interest in a 

trans-Afghanistan pipeline between 1991 and 1998. He lists 

trips made 

to Saudi Arabia in 1998 and 2000 by former President 

George Bush on 

behalf of the Carlyle Group investment firm. On September 7, 

2001, 

Florida Governor Jeb Bush signed an order restructuring the 

state's 

response to acts of terrorism. There's a German online news 

agency 

report from September 14 claiming that an Iranian man had 

called US 

law enforcement to warn of the attack earlier that summer. 

The list 

cries out, "Don't you see?" Oil companies wanted a stable 

and 

pro-Western regime in Afghanistan. Warnings were not 

heeded. Daddy 

Bush had dealings in Saudi Arabia. Brother Jeb was getting 

ready for 

a terrible event. It can only mean one thing: The US 

government 

designed the attacks or let them happen so it could go to war 

on 

behalf of oil interests.

</p>

<p>

Space prevents a complete dissection of all Ruppert's 

dots. 

But in several instances, he misrepresents his source 

material. Item 

number 8 says that in February 2001, UPI reported that the 

National 

Security Agency had "broken bin Laden's encrypted 

communications." 

That would suggest the US government could have picked 

up word of the 

coming assault. But the actual story noted not that the US 

government 

had gained the capacity to eavesdrop on bin Laden at will but 

that it 

had "gone into foreign bank accounts [of bin Laden's 

organization] 

and deleted or transferred funds, and jammed or blocked the 

group's 

cell or satellite phones." Item number 9, based on a <i>Los 

Angeles 

Times</i> story, says the Bush Administration gave $43 

million in aid to the 

Taliban in May 2001, "purportedly" to 

assist farmers starving since the destruction of their opium 

crop. 

Purportedly? Was the administration paying off the Taliban 

for 

something else? That is what Ruppert is hinting. The 

newspaper, 

though, reported that all US funds "are channeled through 

the United 

Nations and international agencies," not handed to the 

Taliban. 

Unless Ruppert can show that was not the case, this dot has 

no 

particular significance. What if Washington funded 

international 

programs assisting Afghan farmers? With his timeline, 

Ruppert implies 

far more than he proves. It is a document for those already 

predisposed to believe that world events are determined by 

secret, 

mind-boggling conspiracies of the powerful, by people too 

influential 

and wily to be caught but who leave a trail that can be 

decoded by a 

few brave outsiders who know where and how to look.

</p>

<p>

The "Spy" Who Tried To Warn Us?

</p>

<p>

Ruppert can claim one truly original find: Delmart "Mike" 

Vreeland. He is the flesh on the bones of Ruppert's 

the-dots-show-all 

timeline. On December 6,  2000, Vreeland, then 34, was 

arrested in 

Canada and charged with fraud, forgery, threatening death or 

bodily 

harm, and obstructing a peace officer. At the time, he was 

wanted on 

multiple warrants in the United States--for forgery, 

counterfeiting, 

larceny, unlawful flight to avoid prosecution, narcotics, 

reckless endangerment, arson, and grand theft. Months 

earlier, the 

<i> Detroit News</i>, citing law enforcement authorities, had 

reported that 

Vreeland was an experienced identity thief. While Vreeland 

was in 

jail in Toronto, law enforcement officials in Michigan began 

extradition proceedings.

</p>

<p>

On October 7, 2001, Vreeland, who was fighting extradition, 

submitted an exhibit in a Canadian court that he says shows 

he knew 

9/11 was coming. And, Ruppert argues, this is proof that US 

intelligence was aware of the coming attacks. The document 

is a page 

of handwritten notes. There is a list that includes the World 

Trade 

Center, the Sears Tower and the White House. Below that a 

sentence 

reads, "Let one happen--stop the rest." Elsewhere is a 

hard-to 

-decipher collection of phrases and names. Vreeland claims 

he wrote 

this in mid-August 2001, while in prison, and had it placed in 

a 

locked storage box by prison guards. He says the note was 

opened on 

September 14 in front of prison officials. Immediately, his 

lawyers 

were summoned to the prison, according to one of them, 

Rocco Galati, 

and the jail officials dispatched the note to Ottawa.

</p>

<p>

Vreeland's believers, including Ruppert, refer to this note 

as a "warning letter." It is no such thing and, though 

tantalizing, 

holds no specific information related to the 9/11 assaults. 

There is 

no date mentioned, no obvious reference to a set of 

perpetrators. In 

a telephone interview with me, Vreeland said this document 

was not 

written as an alert. He claimed that throughout the summer 

of 2001, 

he was composing a thirty-seven-page memo to Adm. 

Vernon Clark, Chief 

of Naval Operations, and that this page contains the notes he 

kept 

during this process. What of the memo to Clark? Vreeland 

won't share 

it, maintaining that he wrote in such a manner that only its 

intended 

recipient would truly understand what it said. Who can 

confirm the 

note was indeed what he had placed in storage prior to 

September 11? 

Is it possible some sort of switch was pulled? Vreeland 

maintains 

that during court proceedings, five officials of the Canadian 

jail 

affirmed that he had passed this document to the guards 

prior to 

September 11. When I asked for their names, Vreeland said 

the judge 

had sealed those records. Kevin Wilson, a Canadian federal 

prosecutor 

handling the extradition case, and Galati, Vreeland's lawyer, 

say no 

seal has been ordered.

</p>

<p>

The note is one small piece of Vreeland's very big 

<i>Alias</i>-like story. He claims he was a US  naval 

intelligence officer 

sent to Russia in September 2000 on a sensitive mission: to 

obtain 

design documents related to a Russian weapon system that 

could defeat 

a US missile defense system. He swiped copies of the 

documents and 

altered the originals so the Russian system wouldn't work. 

As one 

court decision states, "According to [Vreeland], he was sent 

to 

Russia to authenticate these documents because he had 

originally 

conceived of the theory behind this [anti-Star Wars] 

technology, when 

working for the US Navy in 1986." While in Moscow, he also 

snagged 

other top-secret documents that, he claims, foretold the 

September 11 

attacks. And now the US government, the Russian secret 

police, 

organized crime and corrupt law enforcement officials are 

after him. 

As one Canadian judge noted, "No summary of the complex 

allegations 

of multiple concurrent conspiracies...can do justice to 

[Vreeland's] 

own description."

</p>

<p>

Ruppert and Vreeland assert that Canadian court records 

back 

up Vreeland. But court decisions in his case have 

questioned his 

credibility. In one, Judge Archie Campbell observed, "There 

is not 

even a threshold showing of any air of reality to the vast 

conspiracy 

alleged by the applicant." Judge John Macdonald wrote, "I 

find that 

the Applicant is an imaginative and manipulative person who 

has 

little regard for the truth.... the testimony that he developed the 

theory for anti-Star Wars technology in 1986, based on high 

school 

courses, personal interest and perhaps a law clerk's course 

and a 

'Bachelor of Political Science' degree is simply incredible." 

Nor did 

he he believe Vreeland was a spy or that he had smuggled 

documents 

out of Russia. Macdonald, though, did state that the US 

records 

submitted in court regarding Vreeland's criminal record were 

"terse, 

incomplete and confusing," and he noted that the sloppiness 

of the 

filing might suggest the Michigan criminal charges were 

"trumped up." But he was not convinced of that, explaining "I 

see no 

reasonable basis in the evidence for inferring that the 

Michigan charges are 

'trumped 

up.'"

</p>

<p>

It's not surprising those records might be a mess. After I 

first wrote about Vreeland, I received an e-mail from Terry 

Weems, 

who identified himself as Vreeland's half-brother. He claimed 

Vreeland was a longtime con man who had preyed on his 

own family. 

Weems sent copies of police reports his wife had filed in 

Alabama 

accusing Vreeland of falsely using her name to buy office 

supplies 

and cell phones in August 2000. Weems provided me a list 

of law 

enforcement officers who were pursuing Vreeland in several 

states. I 

began calling these people and examining state and county 

records. 

There was much to check.

</p>

<p>

According to Michigan Department of Corrections records, 

Vreeland was in and out of prison several times from 1988 to 

1999, 

having been convicted of assorted crimes, including 

breaking and 

entering, receiving stolen property, forgery and writing bad 

checks. 

In 1997 he was arrested in Virginia for conspiring to bribe a 

police 

officer and intimidating a witness, court records say. He 

failed to 

show up in court there. In Florida he was arrested in 1998 on 

two 

felony counts of grand theft. In one instance he had 

purchased a 

yacht with a check written on a nonexistent account. He was 

sentenced 

to three years of probation. The Florida Department of 

Corrections 

currently  lists him as an absconder. In 1998 he was 

pursued by the 

Sheffield, Alabama, police force for stealing about $20,000 in 

music 

equipment. Charges were eventually dismissed after some 

of the 

property was recovered and Vreeland agreed to pay 

restitution. In the 

course of his investigation, Sheffield Detective Greg Ray 

pulled 

Vreeland's criminal file; it was twenty pages long. "He had to 

really 

try to be a criminal to get such a history," Ray says. A 1999 

report 

filed by a Michigan probation agent said of Vreeland, "The 

defendant 

has 9 known felony convictions and 5 more felony charges 

are now 

pending in various Courts. However, the full extent of his 

criminal 

record may never be known because he has more than a 

dozen identified 

Aliases and arrests or police contacts in 5 different states."

</p>

<p>

Michigan state police records (sent to me by Weems, 

Vreeland's half-brother) show that in 1997, while Vreeland 

was in 

jail after being arrested on a bad-check charge, he wrote a 

letter to 

the St. Clair Shores Police Department warning that his 

brother-in-law was going to burn down his own restaurant. 

The letter 

was dated five days prior to a fire that occurred at the 

restaurant, 

but it was postmarked three days after the fire. "Do you see a 

pattern here?" Weems asks.

</p>

<p>

Judge Campbell called Vreeland a "man who appears on 

this 

evidentiary record to be nothing more than a petty fraudsman 

with a 

vivid imagination." But Ruppert dismisses Vreeland's past, 

noting he 

has "a very confusing criminal arrest record--some of it very 

contradictory and apparently fabricated." When I interviewed 

Vreeland, he said, "I have never legally been convicted of 

anything 

in the United States of America." And, he added, he has 

never been in 

prison.

</p>

<p>

There are two odd bounces in this case. Vreeland claims 

that 

in Moscow he worked with a Canadian Embassy employee 

named Marc 

Bastien. Unfortunately, this cannot be confirmed by Bastien. 

He was 

found dead in Moscow on December, 12, 2000--while 

Vreeland was in 

jail in Toronto. At the time of his death, Canadian authorities 

announced Bastien died of natural causes, but Vreeland 

later claimed 

Bastien had been murdered. Then, this past January, the 

Quebec 

coroner said Bastein died after drinking a mixture of alcohol 

and 

clopazine, an antidepressant, and he noted that Bastien may 

have been 

poisoned--or may have been offered the medication to fight a 

hangover. Had Vreeland really known something about this 

death, or 

had he made a good guess about a fellow whose death was 

covered in 

the Canadian media? And during a courtroom proceeding, at 

Vreeland's 

insistence, the judge allowed his counsel to place a call to 

the 

Pentagon. The operator who answered confirmed that a 

Lieutenant D. 

Vreeland was listed in the phone directory. Afterward, 

Canadian 

prosecutors claimed that information from the US 

government indicated 

that a person purporting to be Lieutenant D. Vreeland had 

earlier 

sent an e-mail to a telephone operator at the Pentagon, 

saying he 

would temporarily be occupying a Pentagon office and 

requesting that 

this be reflected in the listings. Could a fellow in a Toronto 

jail 

have scammed the Pentagon telephone system?

</p>

<p>

In March the Canadian criminal charges against Vreeland 

were 

dropped, and he was allowed to post bail. Explaining why 

charges were 

removed, Paul McDermott, a provincial prosecutor, says his 

office 

considered the pending extradition matter the priority. 

Vreeland's 

extradition hearing is scheduled for September.

</p>

<p>

To believe Vreeland's scribbles mean anything, one must 

believe his claim to be a veteran intelligence operative sent 

to 

Moscow on an improbable top-secret, high-tech mission 

(change design 

documents to neutralize an entire technology) during which 

he stumbled upon 

documents (which he has not revealed) showing that 9/11 

was going to 

happen. To believe that, one must believe he is a victim of a 

massive 

disinformation campaign, involving his family, law 

enforcement 

officers and defense lawyers across the country, two state 

corrections departments, county clerk offices in ten or so 

counties, 

the Canadian justice system and various parts of the US 

government. 

And one must believe that hundreds, if not thousands, of 

detailed 

court, county, prison and state records have been forged. It is 

easier to believe that a well-versed con man got lucky with 

the 

Bastien death/murder, was able to arrange a stunt with the 

Pentagon 

switchboard and either wrote a sketchy note before 

September 11 that 

could be interpreted afterward as relevant or penned the note 

following the disaster and convinced prison guards he had 

written it 

previously. Michigan detective John Meiers, who's been 

chasing 

Vreeland for two years, says, "The bottom line: Delmart 

Vreeland is a 

con man. He's conned everyone he comes into contact with. 

That's why 

he's wanted.... He keeps going back into court for hearings 

because 

he doesn't want to come back here. He knows he's going to 

prison, and 

he's fighting. In the interim, he's coming up with a variety of 

stories."

</p>

<p>

The Rest of It

</p>

<p>

The Vreeland case--despite the attention it has drawn--is not 

the centerpiece of all 9/11 conspiracy theories. There is 

much more: 

A CIA officer supposedly met with bin Laden in July 2001 in 

Dubai. 

Before September 11, parties unknown engaged in a frenzy 

of 

short-selling involving the stock of American Airlines, United 

Airlines and dozens of other companies affected by the 

attacks. The 

Pentagon was not actually hit by an airliner. Flight 93--the 

fourth plane--did not crash in Pennsylvania; it was shot 

down. The 

Bush Administration, in talks with the Taliban, warned that 

war was 

coming. And that's not a complete run-down.

</p>

<p>

Some of the lingering questions or peculiar facts warrant 

more attention than others. There was a boost in 

short-selling. But 

does that suggest the US government ignored a clear 

warning? Or might 

the more obvious explanation be true--that people close to 

Osama bin 

Laden were tipped off and took advantage of that inside 

information? 

Ronald Blekicki, who publishes <i>Microcap Analyst</i>, an 

online 

investment publication, says most of the short-selling 

occurred 

overseas--and escaped notice in the United States. If that 

type of 

trading had happened in the US markets, he explains, it 

would have 

stirred rumors about the companies involved. "Everyone on 

the 

exchanges would have known about it," he explains. "My best 

guess is 

that the people who profited were reasonably wealthy 

individuals in 

the inner circle  of bin Laden and the Taliban." What is 

curious, 

though, is that news of the investigations into the 

short-selling has 

taken a quick-fade. Neither the Securities and Exchange 

Commission 

nor the Chicago Board Options Exchange will say whether 

they are 

still investigating trading practices prior to September 11. 

And 

there has been no word from Congress or the Bush 

Administration on 

this topic. Suspicious minds, no doubt, can view the public 

absence 

of government interest as evidence of something amiss. In 

this 

instance, the lack of a credible official investigation creates 

much 

space for the disciples of conspiracy theories.

</p>

<p>

No airliner at the Pentagon? You can find websites 

devoted to 

that thesis. Another site, called www.flight93crash.com, 

offers a sober 

look at the anomalies that have led people to wonder if that 

last 

plane, the one in Pennsylvania, was blasted out of the sky.

</p>

<p>

The alleged CIA-bin Laden meeting in Dubai has attracted 

intense notice in alternative-9/11 circles. The story first 

appeared 

In <i>Le Figaro</i>, a French newspaper, on October 31, 

2001, in an 

article by freelancer Alexandra Richard. Citing an unnamed 

"partner 

of the administration of the American Hospital in Dubai," she 

maintained that bin Laden was treated at the hospital for ten 

days. 

Her story also asserted that "the local CIA agent...was seen 

taking 

the main elevator of the hospital to go to bin Laden's hospital 

room" 

and "bragged to a few friends about having visited bin 

Laden," but 

she provided no source for these details. The hospital 

categorically 

denies bin Laden was there. Even if a meeting occurred, that 

would 

not necessarily indicate the CIA was aware of bin Laden's 

plot. Such 

news, though, would be a huge embarrassment and prompt 

many awkward 

questions. But the meeting's existence--unattached to a 

single 

identifiable source--can only be regarded as iffy.

</p>

<p>

Two French authors, Jean-Charles Brisard, a former 

intelligence employee, and Guillaume Dasquie, a journalist, 

have 

written a book, <i> Bin Laden; the Forbidden Truth</i>, in 

which they 

maintain that the 9/11 attacks were the "outcome" of "private 

and 

risky discussions" between the United States and the 

Taliban 

"concerning geostrategic oil interests." As they see it, 

Washington, 

driven by fealty to Big Oil, threatened the Taliban with military 

action and replacement, as it was pursuing Osama bin 

Laden and 

seeking a regime in Afghanistan that would cooperate with 

oil firms. 

In response to Washington's heavy-handed tactics, the two 

suggest, 

bin Laden and the Taliban decided to strike first. This double 

theory--it's-all-about-oil and Washington provoked the 

attack--has 

resonated on anti-Bush websites. To prove their case, the 

French men 

attach sinister motives to a United Nations initiative to settle 

the 

political and military strife in Afghanistan. Citing a UN report, 

they depict this effort as "negotiations" between 

the Taliban and the United States, in which the Americans 

aimed to replace the Taliban with the former King. Yet a fair 

reading 

of the UN report shows that the endeavor--conducted by the 

UN Special 

Mission to Afghanistan--was a multilateral attempt to resolve 

the 

conflict in Afghanistan that involved discussions with the 

various 

sides in that country. It was not geared toward reinstalling 

ex-King 

Mohammad Zahir Shah.

Brisard and Dasquie's most dramatic charge is that former 

Pakistani foreign minister Niaz Naik, who attended one of a 

series of 

international 

conferences held by the UN Special Mission to Afghanistan, 

says that at the 

July 2001 meeting a "US official" threatened the Taliban, 

"Either you accept 

our offer of a carpet of gold, or we bury 

you under a carpet of bombs." (This portion of the book is 

similar to 

an earlier article in the British <i>Guardian</i>, in which Naik 

additionally noted that the Pakistani government relayed 

Naik's 

impression of this US threat to the Taliban.) The Taliban, 

though, 

were not present at the session, which was held in Berlin, 

and the three 

American 

representatives there were <i> former</i> US officials. One of 

the reps, Tom 

Simons, a past US Ambassador to Pakistan who spent 

thirty-five years 

in the foreign service, recalls no such threat but 

acknowledges that 

the Americans did note that if Washington determined bin 

Laden was 

behind the USS Cole bombing in Yemen, the Afghans 

obviously could 

expect the Bush Administration to strike bin Laden. That 

would hardly 

have been a remark to cause bin Laden to arrange quickly a 

pre-emptive assault. Simons--who says he was not 

interviewed by the 

French authors--believes Naik misheard the Americans on 

this point. 

Whether Naik did or not, the French authors, at best, suggest 

a line 

of inquiry rather than come close to validating their 

contention. 

(Brisard and Dasquie also argue--without offering an 

abundance of 

evidence--that the United States, by design, did not 

vigorously 

pursue bin Laden and the Al Qaeda network because doing 

so clashed 

with other diplomatic priorities, most notably, cozying up to 

the oil 

autocrats of Saudi Arabia.)

</p>

<p>

Official accounts ought not to be absorbed without scrutiny. 

Clandestine agendas and unacknowledged geostrategic 

factors--such as 

oil--may well shape George W. Bush's war on terrorism. And 

there are 

questions that have gone unaswered. For example, on 

September 12, 2001, a 

brief story in <i> Izvestia</i>, the Moscow-based newspaper, 

citing unnamed 

sources, reported that Moscow had warned Washington of 

the 9/11 attacks weeks 

earlier. Was such a warning actually transmitted? If so, who 

issued the 

warning and who received it? But questions 

are not equivalent to proof. As of now, there is not 

confirmable 

evidence to argue that the conventional take on September 

11--bin 

Laden surprise-attacked America as part of a jihad, and a 

caught-off-guard United States struck back--is actually a 

cover story.

</p>

<p>

Without conspiracy theories, there is much to wonder 

about 

September 11. The CIA and the FBI had indications, if not 

specific 

clues, that something was coming and did not piece them 

together. 

Government agencies tasked to protect the United States 

failed. US 

air defenses performed extraordinarily poorly--even though 

there had 

been signs for at least five years that Al Qaeda was 

considering a 

9/11-type scheme. Afterward, neither the Bush Administration 

nor 

Congress rushed to investigate. In fact, Senate majority 

leader Tom 

Daschle maintains that Bush and Vice President Dick 

Cheney both told 

him in January they opposed any Congressional 

investigation of 9/11. 

(The White House denies this.) Congress finally 

greenlighted an 

inquiry, but the investigation bogged down as the 

Congressional 

investigators complained that the CIA and the Justice 

Department were 

impeding their efforts.

</p>

<p>

One problem with conspiracy theorizing is that it can 

distract from the true and (sometimes mundane) misdeeds 

and mistakes 

of government. But when the government is reluctant to 

probe its own 

errors, it opens the door wider for those who would turn 

anomalies 

into theories or spin curious fact--or speculation--into 

outlandish 

explanation. Not that all who do so need much 

encouragement. 

September 11 was so traumatic, so large, that there will 

always be 

people who look to color it--or exploit it--by adding more 

drama and 

intrigue, who seek to discern hidden meanings, who desire 

to make 

<i> more</i> sense of the awful act. And there will be people 

who want to 

believe them.</p>
