the Oakland City Council is poised to join a national grassroots movement that 

seeks to defend fundamental civil rights and liberties that may be violated by 

the USA Patriot Act signed by President Bush on Oct. 26, 2001. 

<P>The movement began last February in Northampton, Mass., and 18 towns and cities 

-- including Berkeley, Santa Cruz and Sebastopol in California -- have already 

passed resolutions that direct local agencies to protect citizens from such questionable 

practices as domestic spying, ethnic profiling, secret detentions and the unauthorized 

release of personal records. 

<P>The American Civil Liberties Union, according to Laura Murphy, director the 

group's Washington legislative office, is working with dozens of communities "to 

go on record against repressive legislation." 

<P>Oakland's "Resolution to Oppose the USA Patriot Act and Related Executive Orders," 

which has received strong support from council members, affirms the city's strong 

opposition to terrorism, but also calls upon city agencies and private organizations 

to defend citizens' basic constitutional rights. 

<P>These local resolutions would be unnecessary if members of Congress were as 

bold in standing up to the Bush administration's excessive proposals to peel back 

civil liberties.</p>
