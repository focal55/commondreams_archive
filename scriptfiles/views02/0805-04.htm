<p>ON JULY 16, The U.S. navy was granted a permit to deploy its frequency active 

sonar known as SURTASS LFA. The low-frequency Surveillance Towed Array Sensor 

System is a product of the Cold War. Its development to detect enemy submarines 

cost some $300 million.

<P></P>

Last week, there were three beachings of pilot whales on Cape Cod, Mass., the 

largest beaching in that area in the past 20 years. Is there a connection to the 

July 16 approval and the events of July 27? 

<P></P>

According to a spokesperson for Coastal Watch, involved in the three rescue attempts 

of the pilot whales, there is no link. The U.S. navy is only operating the system 

in the Pacific area at present. But, what <i>is </i>known is that in March, 2000, 

near the Bahamas, at least four different species of whales and dolphins beached 

themselves shortly after a navy SURTASS LFA test. 

<P></P>

The surveillance sensor system is capable of transmitting signals as powerful 

as 215 decibels. Marine scientists believe whales are affected by sounds louder 

than 110 decibels. At 180 decibels, a whale's eardrums can explode. 

<P></P>

Whales are not the only ones who will be affected by this new military system; 

dolphins and other higher functioning mammals of the world's oceans are equally 

at risk.

<P></P>

The navy's strategic plan is to cover 80 per cent of the world's oceans with the 

new active sonar system. 

<P></P>

The system functions like a floodlight, scanning the ocean for vast distances 

and areas with intense sound. Each transmitter can generate 215 decibels of sound.

<P></P>

Scientists say this sound level is not only unsafe for whales and dolphins, but 

can also kill human divers in its path. The navy's own testing has indicated that 

when the signals expand, the sound range can reach 240 decibels. To place the 

system in context, a decibel scale is much like the Richter scale for earthquakes: 

each employs small differences to increasing orders of magnitude. 

<P></P>

In a test in 1991, a loud, low frequency signal sent from an island in the Indian 

Ocean was detected on the West Coast of the United States. 

<P></P>

In late January, 2001, the navy released its own environmental impact report in 

which it admitted to exposing a 32-year-old navy diver to 12 minutes of the LFA 

system, at 160 decibels. After 12 minutes, the diver experienced dizziness and 

drowsiness. 

<P></P>

He was hospitalized, but continued to suffer memory problems and seizures. He 

improved only after being treated with antidepressants and seizure medications. 

<P></P>

Whales and other mammals employ their sensitive hearing to follow migration routes, 

locate one another and keep track of their calves. Noise that can destroy their 

eardrums will kill whales.

<P></P>

Since whales travel in families, this could lead to more beachings in the future. 

<P></P>

Dolphins will be impacted in the same manner. Even if the whales are not killed, 

it will play havoc with their migration patterns. 

<P></P>

The SURTASS LFA was kept secret until 1995. 

<P></P>

The Bush administration defends its use on the grounds of national security, arguing 

that new submarines are becoming quieter and more difficult to detect. 

<P></P>

The navy contends that safeguards will be in place to ensure that no harm comes 

to marine life. The navy will be required to employ special measures, such as 

scanning for any marine mammals in the area and shutting the system down if animals 

are found. No mention is made of human divers.

<P></P>

But the navy has been granted a five-year exemption from the Marine Mammal Protection 

Act. Under the act, the navy and the personnel responsible could be charged over 

the death of a whale or other marine mammals. A "free pass" has now been granted. 

<P></P>

Or as Michael Jasny of the <a href="http://www.nrdc.org" target="_new">Natural 

Resources Defense Council</a> explains, "The Bush administration has issued a 

blank check for the global use of the system."
