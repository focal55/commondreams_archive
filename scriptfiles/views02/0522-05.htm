<p> WHEN PRESIDENT Bush arrives in Moscow on Thursday, he will usher in a 

dangerous new era of false arms control. Typically, nations seek arms control 

agreements as a means to increase the security of the signatory nations. Sadly, this latest agreement is a cynical shell game designed to cover the perilous 

and aggressive new nuclear posture of the Bush administration. It also sets a 

new, destabilizing precedent for the future and threatens to undo decades of 

progress in nuclear disarmament.

<P>The Bush administration is pursuing a nuclear strategy detailed in the 

"Nuclear Posture Review" that was leaked to the media in April. In essence, 

the strategy targets nations perceived as capable of developing weapons of 

mass destruction. The idea is that the threat of a pre-emptive first strike 

from the United States will deter other nations from seeking a nuclear 

capability.

<P>In a dramatic break from past strategy, the review makes clear that the 

United States will consider using nuclear weapons against non-nuclear 

adversaries, and even lists seven nations as preliminary targets.

<P>This strategy requires the development of new capabilities and the 

preservation of others. The first challenge, as the Pentagon sees it, is 

finding a way to destroy hardened underground "enemy" facilities. Their 

solution is to develop a "super" warhead known as the "robust earth 

penetrator" whose function is to burrow underground prior to detonating.

<P>The second challenge is to overcome the stigma of a nuclear first strike. 

The Bush administration's solution to this problem is to seek to develop lower-

yield nuclear weapons, with less explosive power than the city-leveling 

capability of nuclear weapons of the past. Earlier this month, the Bush 

administration sought congressional approval of funds for both of these 

projects. While Congress resisted funding development of these new weapons, 

lawmakers did agree to fund research toward their development.

<P>In order to deliver the earth-penetrating, low-yield warhead of the future, 

the United States will need to retain the most accurate weapons available. The 

answer to this is the Trident missile, the most accurate weapon in our arsenal.

<P>Tridents will be completely untouched by the Bush/Putin agreement.

<P>So, under this new agreement, the United States will de-activate a large 

number of less accurate, strategically irrelevant weapons while simultaneously 

pursuing a new generation of highly destabilizing offensive nuclear weapons. 

Or as a Bush administration official candidly put it: "What we have now agreed 

to do under the treaty is what we wanted to do anyway."

<P>If the weapons being de-activated were being destroyed, there would be room 

for at least some celebration. The agreement that President Bush and Russian 

President Vladimir Putin will sign, however, will not require the destruction 

of a single weapon. The treaty will also give both parties the opportunity to 

announce that they are withdrawing from it on three months notice. The short 

amount of notice coupled with the idea of storing weapons is sure to rattle 

the Russian military. From its perspective, it will be more desirable to store 

the weapons, in case the United States announces that it will withdraw from 

the treaty. This in turn means the worst of all scenarios -- more Russian 

nuclear weapons stored rather than destroyed. The theft of even one of these 

weapons represents probably our single greatest security threat.

<P>Finally, the timing of this trip to Moscow is a transparent exercise in 

"issue management," also known as "spin." This Sunday marks the 30th 

anniversary of the signing of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty -- the 

landmark nuclear disarmament treaty that the Bush administration has 

unilaterally abandoned.

<P>Between now and our formal withdrawal from the treaty on June 13, we will 

be encouraged to believe that the Bush administration is genuinely committed 

to disarmament while its actions clearly indicate that it is not.



<P>The path to greater security is a lot more direct than this complicated 

shell game -- lasting security will only be achieved when America commits to 

ending the development of new nuclear weapons and gradually destroying the 

existing stockpiles.
