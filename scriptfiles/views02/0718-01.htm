<p>The Senate is talking about prescription drugs. Emphasis on the talking.

<p> There is little chance that elderly people who now trek to Canada for their 

drugs, or show up at food banks because they've traded off buying their groceries 

in favor of buying their medicine, will get drug coverage under Medicare this 

year.

<p> The Senate is splintered over how to deliver coverage and how much to deliver. 

Most Democrats want Medicare to provide a drug benefit that is uniform and predictable 

- that is, with the government setting rules so coverage does not turn out to 

have some fine print that shocks the conscience. Most Republicans want insurance 

companies to design the drug benefit, set its terms and ultimately its price. 

This is roughly the drug plan the House passed.

<p> A few in each party straddle the middle. But this seems to satisfy only themselves 

and is a maneuver for political self-preservation, not progress.

<p> This is what happens when politicians are unanimous that there is a horrible, 

heart-wrenching crisis out there but the horrible, heart-wrenching crisis is in 

health care. They agree there is big trouble, but that is the end of it.

<p> The stalemate over prescription drug coverage is a summer rerun of the stalemate 

over the Bill Clinton health care plan, without the megadose of vitriol.

<p> We do not particularly like the way the health care system is working. It's 

too expensive, doesn't cover everybody, and more and more looks like just another 

racket. We particularly dislike insurance companies and especially their HMOs, 

with their wretched telephone bureaucrats and cursed hoops through which to jump 

before getting treatment for more than a rash.

<p> These annoyances irritate more now that it's clear the HMOs failed at their 

essential promise of care at lower cost. Health insurance premiums rose 11 percent 

last year and are expected to climb 13 percent this year. HMO rates could go up 

as much as 20 percent in 2003, according to private benefit consultants.

<p> But we do not want the government to get involved.

<p> Or at least that is what we believe, at some gut level. That the government 

will only mess things up more.

<p> The presumption is that the government is not now involved, except in paying 

for the care of the poor and the old. The mythology is essential to prolonging 

the political standoff. Nonetheless, it is myth.

<p> A new study in the journal Health Affairs concludes that tax-financed health 

expenditures - that is, government - amount to 60 percent of all health spending 

in the United States. Authors Steffie Woolhandler and David U. Himmelstein, both 

Harvard Medical School professors who support national health insurance, count 

direct spending on Medicare and Medicaid as well as tax subsidies for health expenses 

that flow to private individuals and ultimately to private insurers. They found 

the United States spends more public money on health care than countries with 

national health insurance.

<p> "Our allegedly private health care system is funded mainly by taxes," the 

authors conclude. "Indeed, Americans pay the world's highest taxes to finance 

health care."

<p> And we pay among the highest drug prices. Not because, say, the Europeans 

and Canadians don't get miracle cures or fine medicines for everyday life. They 

buy from the very same manufacturers as we do. But they buy in bulk. Like our 

own Defense Department, which buys drugs for military personnel and their families 

at a discount of about 40 percent.

<p> This Sam's Club logic is simple enough to be understood in every strip mall. 

There is no good reason it should not be applied to Medicare or Medicaid or, for 

that matter, to every taxpayer whose money sloshes through the government's coffers 

before it reaches the insurance company - then, finally, the drugmaker.

<p> But there are rarely good reasons for why we do not start unraveling the health 

care knot. Only bad ones. </i></p>
