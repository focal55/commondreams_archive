What makes a peacemaker these days?  Apparently with the nomination of 

President George W. Bush and Prime Minister Tony Blair for the Nobel Peace 

Prize, being a peacemaker means that you can drop bombs on civilians, offer 

few options for reconciliation to your enemies and reduce spending on 

social services in favor of funding an already disproportionate military 

budget.



<p>I try to explain to my students who take "Solutions to Violence," a 

semester-long course on peacemaking for high schools that pacifism works 

and offer evidence to that fact.  Nominating Bush and Blair for the Nobel 

Peace Prize undermines this effort significantly.  So as their teacher, I 

have tried to note a few characteristics of peacemakers which might help to 

clarify the quandary we as a global community face when people who fit more 

in the category of war criminals are heralded as peace heroes.



<p>Someone seeking to be a peacemaker uses violence only as a last 

resort.  Violence has a very simple dynamic: might makes 

right.  Nonviolence on the other hand uses creativity with unlimited 

possibilities to resolve problems and seeks to evoke the human spirit in 

their enemies, that undeniable conscience which ought never be 

shelved.  Alexander Solzhenitsyn speaks of the futility of separating the 

evil people from the good people and destroying them - the same language 

George W. Bush is using to delineate the evildoers from the benevolent - 

only Solzhenitsyn truly knows that the line between good and evil runs 

through each human heart.  When we desire to kill evil, we commit to 

killing a piece of ourselves.



<p>I continue to remind my students of Gandhi's message that the goal is not 

to bring our enemies to their knees but to their senses.  To do this, we 

must offer ways for them to save face, rather than give them ultimatums 

which back them into a corner and force them to lash out in frustration of 

lack of options.  To grant our enemies the dignity they are due as human 

beings is to take a step toward reconciliation.  We can love the evildoer 

while hating the evil act.



<p>Many religious leaders have blessed many wars throughout the years, and 

just last week I heard a Catholic priest at an interfaith dialogue making 

excuses for the "Just War Theory."  My students sitting near me beckoned 

for my response.  On a sheet of scrap paper I asked them if Jesus embodied 

"Just War Theory" - if his actions represented justifications for hatred 

and retaliation, or if his message called us to a greater level of 

understanding.  Walking with our enemies.  Loving them because they are 

difficult to love.  Showing compassion and mercy.  Where is this dialogue 

happening nowadays in our war frenzy?  Dare we speak out for moderation - 

or are even clergy being swept away in this flood of madness and 

hatred?  Certainly the voices of peace and justice have been drowned in the 

swiftly moving tide.



<p>A peacemaker these days would not continue to bomb Iraq while calling for 

an end to terrorism and violence.  In the past two weeks, the United States 

has bombed Iraq four times, while calling on the United Nations to keep 

their negotiations with Iraq "short".  Talk is cheap, I suppose, when we 

have bombing to maintain!  A peacemaker would allocate more than enough 

resources so that housing, health care and education never went needy.  Dr. 

King said that any nation spending more on its military than on programs of 

social uplift is approaching spiritual death.  We are already there.



<p>It's quite handy for our government to do this, though.  We cut funding for 

social spending and overwhelm the Pentagon's budget.  This way, our 

students who are prone to fall through the cracks anyway will realize that 

there is no future for them in school, or in the workforce, and then 

believe that they have no other choice than to join the military.  We're 

eliminating options and free will under the guise of national security, 

underhandedly denying educations and futures to young people who deserve 

them.  We are killing the dreams of many young people who want to create 

better lives for themselves and their families.



<p>The most important quality of a peacemaker these days, I believe, can be 

summed up in a line from the Manifesto by Wendell Berry on the Mad Farmer 

Liberation Front: Be joyful even though you have considered all the 

facts.  A peacemaker knows the obstacles ahead.  A peacemaker cries with 

the families of those killed and labeled 'collateral damage'.  A peacemaker 

lives the spirit of peacemaking and is not afraid to take risks in the name 

of justice.  A peacemaker these days aligns with the unpopular causes, 

speaks up for the people we'd rather hate, and questions the authority 

which condones cultural genocide, mass murder and rampant militarism.



<p>This is what my students deserve to know about peacemaking.
