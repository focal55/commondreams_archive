<p> IN 1971, WASHINGTON was shocked when a throng of battle-scarred veterans showed 

up to protest the war in Vietnam. They camped on the Mall, and the Nixon administration 

quickly obtained a ruling from Chief Justice Warren Burger ordering the veterans 

to clear out. 

<P> They refused. Would they be arrested? It was then that Senator Edward M. Kennedy 

boldly went to the Mall where the antiwar veterans had pitched their tents and 

sleeping bags. ''You have served your country well abroad,'' he told them, ''and 

will serve it even better here in Washington.'' 

<P> Kennedy's public support of the illegal demonstrators was key in turning the 

tide of opinion - and then law - in the veterans' favor, and a crucial blow against 

the war was struck (See ''Home to War'' by Gerald Nicosia). 

<P> Ted Kennedy is doing it again. ''I started my career at a time when there 

was a war that was important to end,'' he said to me as we sat together last Saturday. 

''And now - not that I am finishing my career - there is a war that requires us 

to relearn those lessons of history.'' 

<P> A few minutes later, in Harvard's Sanders Theater, Kennedy delivered a stirring 

address at the induction ceremony of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, 

perhaps the strongest criticism of the move toward war in Iraq yet made by a leading 

politician, although you would not know that from the way the speech was ignored 

in the drum-beating media. 

<P> Instead of focusing on the details of the prowar resolution that Congress 

will likely approve this week, Kennedy hom ed in on ''a more fundamental debate 

that is only just beginning - an all-important debate about how, when, and where 

in the years ahead our country will use its unsurpassed military might.'' Iraq 

is simply the first case in point. 

<P> Responding to the Bush administration's recently published ''National Security 

Strategy of the United States,'' Kennedy carefully dissected the radical assumptions 

that are driving the nation toward war. First, he showed that by equating the 

two quite distinct purposes of ''prevention'' and ''preemption,'' President Bush 

is leading America to embrace a course of action it has long condemned in others. 

<P> ''Traditionally,'' Kennedy said, ''`preemptive' action refers to times when 

states react to an imminent threat of attack.'' He offered Israel's response to 

the border-moves of Egypt and Syria in 1967 as an example of justified preemption. 

By contrast, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, intending to undercut a potential 

''capability that could someday become threatening,'' was a ''preventive'' action. 

''The coldly premeditated nature of preventive attacks and preventive wars makes 

them anathema to well-established principles against aggression.'' 

<P> To Kennedy, preventive war is still anathema, and his denunciation of the 

Bush embrace of preventive war against Iraq draws its edge from the fact that 

President John Kennedy, in 1961 and 1962, rejected the argument for preventive 

war against the Soviet Union, protecting a moral boundary. ''For 175 years,'' 

Edward Kennedy quotes Robert Kennedy as saying, ''we have not been that kind of 

country.'' 

<P> Are we now? The Bush administration's new doctrine, Kennedy said, ''asserts 

that global realities now legitimize preventive war and make it a strategic necessity. 

The document openly contemplates preventive attacks against groups or states, 

even absent the threat of imminent attack I strongly oppose any such extreme doctrine.'' 

<P> The second feature of Bush's radical new approach that Kennedy lambasted was 

its assumption that the United States is somehow exempt ''from the rules we expect 

others to obey.'' Kennedy reiterated an old cliche of public morality - ''Might 

does not make right!'' - but in the present context, his reference rang with prophetic 

relevance. The hubris of overwhelming power is corrupting the nation. ''America 

cannot write its own rules for the modern world. To attempt to do so would be 

unilateralism run amok.'' Bush is undercutting the war on terrorism, destroying 

alliances, setting dangerous precedents, and eviscerating America's moral legitimacy. 

<P> Again daring to go where few of his colleagues venture, Kennedy defined all 

of this by its proper name: ''The administration's doctrine is a call for 21st 

century American imperialism that no other nation can or should accept.'' The 

debate in Congress this week is centered on Saddam Hussein and Iraq, but what 

is really at stake are basic structures of the American idea. The name Kennedy 

is properly attached to this nation's noblest impulse, and it is fitting that 

the last of the brothers is raising his voice in its defense. 

<P> The afternoon of his speech, the senator and I were sitting in a Somerville 

cafe. A customer approached our rear-corner table to say, ''Senator, I want to 

thank you for all you're doing to stand up for us against this rush to war.'' 

<P> I asked her name, and if I could quote her. ''Lucy Borodkin,'' she said firmly. 

''And you certainly can.''
