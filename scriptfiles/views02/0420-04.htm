WASHINGTON -- THE POPE in Rome and the president of the United States are in the 

same boat. They are both coping with the consequences of a failure to recognize 

a crisis. 

<P> 

<P>For John Paul II, it was the pedophile scandal, which enraged the faithful 

in an unparalleled way. The Holy Father, who rightly expects a place in history 

as the liberator of Poland, was apparently preoccupied with cosmic diplomacy and 

missed the significance of crimes committed by a clergy that was protected, promoted 

and even pampered by the hierarchy. He made the mistake of thinking that Catholics 

care more about their church than their children. Now His Holiness has called 

the 10 US cardinals to an emergency session at St. Peter's.</P>

<P>In a similar way, George W. Bush turned a blind eye to trouble that only he 

could solve. He sees himself not as a peacemaker but as a warrior against terrorism. 

For the first 15 months of his term, he refused to lend his prestige or even his 

attention to the ugly developments in Israel and the West Bank. The Middle East, 

to his way of thinking, was a hobby of Bill Clinton's, which was reason enough 

to bypass it. Besides, it chewed up intervenors; both sides were bent on extermination 

and were best left to their own devices.</P>

<P>But the moment inevitably arrived when nothing but the might of the United 

States could halt the carnage - on one side, suicide-bombers shattering Passover, 

on the other, bulldozers bringing houses down on blameless inhabitants. At length, 

Bush sent Colin Powell to the scene and ordered Ariel Sharon to stop the invasion. 

Sharon thumbed his nose at the leader of the free world. Israeli soldiers are 

still shooting at faces in the windows on the West Bank, and Manger Square bristles 

with tanks. Colin Powell returns empty-handed. Sharon ignored Bush's demand.</P>

<P>The pope's crisis summit seems equally doomed. If the pope were as concerned 

about the sexual abuse of children in rectories and seminaries as his calling 

of the conference is meant to suggest, why is Bernard Law, the author of the major 

coverup, still in office?</P>

<P>Law enjoys the special favor of the pope. He is doctrinaire and inflexible, 

and he treated the uproar over pedophile priests precisely as the pope did; that 

is, he ignored it as long as he could. When The Boston Globe started to publish 

the bad news, the Supreme Pontiff finally spoke. In an Easter letter to the clergy, 

he suggested it was just a few bad apples - all Americans - and made the jarring 

comparison between the good priests who were smeared by the scandal and the young 

victims whose lives had been blighted by bondage to predators in cassocks. Adding 

to Catholic outrage, Cardinal Law wrote a preposterous letter to the priests in 

his diocese in which he presented himself as ''determined to provide the strongest 

leadership possible in this area.'' In other words, the murderer will solve the 

homicide.</P>

<P>Boston, usually a docile and deferential parish, talks of indicting His Eminence. 

Some of the pious are withholding their money from the collection plate. Big givers 

have folded their checkbooks. Students at Catholic colleges have petitioned the 

authorities to disinvite Law from their commencements.</P>

<P>Yet Law traveled secretly to Rome for a parley with the pope, who, he says, 

''encouraged'' him in his efforts to ''provide the strongest possible leadership'' 

in the cleanup. Members of the US bishops' conference recently convinced the pope 

of the gravity of the situation, but not of Law's radioactivity.</P>

<P>Meanwhile, Bush partisans have found a way out of the embarrassment attendant 

on being dissed by the head of a thoroughly beholden ally. They pretend that Bush 

never demanded Sharon's withdrawal; they have diluted the macho ''demand'' to 

the wimpy ''request,'' and lamely cite the bulldozers' retreat from some areas. 

The talk is of ''solidarity''; the spin is that Bush made a slight faux pas on 

a bad day.</P>

<P>A telling moment at the huge pro-Israel rally held on Capitol Hill on Monday 

came with the appearance of Paul Wolfowitz, deputy secretary of defense, who was 

there as the special representative of the president. He mentioned statehood for 

Palestine and was roundly booed. The idea of one of Washington's most ferocious 

hawks, a zealot for the invasion of Iraq, as a martyred peacenik was a light moment 

in a heavy week.</P>

<P>Bush, standing in the rubble of his Mideast coalition, may feel that he was 

vindicated in his initial refusal to go near the witches' brew. Or maybe the experience 

will deter him, at least for a while, from blasting into Baghdad.</P>

<P>Now if he wants a cease-fire, he must play hardball and threaten a curtailment 

of the $2 billion plus we pay to subsidize Israel. The pope, if he wishes to retrieve 

moral authority from the scorched earth left by the scandal, must relieve Law 

of his red hat. These are hard choices. But they are the only kind available to 

world leaders who refused to lead in clear and present crises.</P>
