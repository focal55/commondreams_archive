<p>A COUPLE OF months ago, my friend Jena, a politically aware 17-year-old who 

has such a '60s fixation she goes to Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young concerts, lamented 

how, when I was her age, there were "much better things to protest."

<P></P>

Hunh? Had she missed the anti-globalization demonstrations in Seattle, Quebec 

city, Genoa? But Jena waved those off, not convinced battling the corporatization 

of the planet was as romantic as protesting the war in Vietnam or marching for 

civil rights.

<P></P>

Not that I blame her. Media images of G-8 Summit protests are nearly always covered 

in one of two dismissive ways. Either the very few instances of violence are blown 

up big time for the news, or the more fanciful demonstrations (the puppets, the 

costumes, the bare bums) are mocked by the late-night comics. The protesters can't 

win: Their message is almost always subverted by the media. 

<P></P>

Which could explain why there don't seem to be any protests against what seems 

to be the inevitable war with Iraq. What with Americans so divided, you'd think 

there would be people greeting President George W. Bush on his tub-thumping, Republican 

fundraising tour, not just with flags, but also with placards. 

<P></P>

But if there are demonstrators, the cameras don't show them. 

<P></P>

This is standard media practice, however. These camera ops are stage-managed so 

tightly that journalists don't get a chance to capture what's happening on the 

periphery. And networks, always pinching pennies, won't send second crews to cover 

the people instead of the political message of the day, now conveniently displayed 

on that big blue background screen that must travel with Bush nowadays. 

<P></P>

But don't think that the news nets would have much time for protesters or public 

dissent, if only the White House weren't so cleverly manipulative. Two cases in 

point:

<P></P>

<li></li>

Last Thursday on CNN, anchor Kyra Phillips introduced a report by Washington correspondent 

Bob Franken who said that the Rev. Jesse Jackson was leading a march on the Justice 

Dept.

<P></P>

"(T)hey are complaining about the loss of civil liberties, and the loss of access 

to this administration," said Franken. "It is the coalition of the same civil 

rights, labour, women's rights groups that we have known for decades now."

<P></P>

He then gave Jackson about 10 seconds. To my ears he sounded awfully dismissive. 

But it got worse: A few seconds later Phillips gave at least three minutes to 

a story about a two-legged dog.

<P></P>

<li></li>

The same day on MSNBC's <i>Buchanan & Press</i>, Sara Flounders of the Washington-based 

International Action Center (<i><a href="http://www.iacenter.org">http://www.iacenter.org</a></i>), 

which is co-ordinating a national day of protest for Oct. 26, was subjected to 

a tirade.

<P></P>

"I looked at your organization," Pat Buchanan said. "It's not simply against an 

invasion of Iraq. You are against the oppression of gay, bisexual and trans people. 

You want America to be free of war and racism ... You're in favour of affirmative 

action. Aren't you just a hard leftist organization that is anti-anything Mr. 

Bush does?"

<P></P>

Now, I am not entirely convinced Buchanan actually believed what he was saying 

— but he has to play a right-wing nut for the cameras. Despite that, MSNBC allowed 

Flounders to get her message out before giving her the hook a few short minutes 

later. 

<P></P>

Then yesterday, wonder of wonders, Medea Benjamin and Diane Wilson, two ordinary-looking 

women, stood up and interrupted U.S. Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, who was 

making his case against Iraq before Congress.

<P></P>

"Inspections, not war!" they cried, before being hustled away by Capitol police.

<P></P>

Both CNN and MSNBC replayed the scene, remarking on how Rumsfeld recovered "with 

aplomb" in "a quick comeback" about how the women would not be able to express 

their opinions in Saddam Hussein's country.

<P></P>

Later CNN interviewed the two women, all but berating them for interrupting the 

proceedings. Anchor Leon Harris never once picked up on what they wanted to hear: 

"How many civilians would be killed? How would they protect us against the backlash 

of anti-Americanism? Why is this all about oil? Why is it coming up now? Can't 

we wait until after elections? Why is the Bush administration stopping this inspection 

process? Why don't we put it back in the hands of the Security Council?"

<P></P>

"We see you did not get locked up today," concluded Harris. "We will see whether 

or not your luck holds out. Thank you very much for talking with us this morning. 

We will see how this all plays out."

<P></P>

Seems like a foregone conclusion to me.
