<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->Where are the productive workers?  Look no further than data from the U.S. 

Labor Department for the first-quarter of 2002, cited in a May 7 AP article. 

  “Worker productivity, a key ingredient to the economy's long-term 

vitality, shot up at an annual rate of 8.6 percent in the first quarter, the 

best performance in nearly 19 years.”



<p>Productivity refers to the output per hour of every worker.  And is a higher 

rate of productivity a good thing for society?  We return to the AP article.



<p>“Businesses, responding to the lingering effects of last year's recession, 

cut back on their payrolls.  That caused the total number of hours worked to 

fall at a rate of 1.9 percent. Output, however, rose at a solid 6.5 percent 

rate.”



<p>On one hand, hiring is down.  Employers’ demand for labor-power is weak.  

Consequently, many are hiring part-time instead of full-time workers.



<p>On the other hand, workers are producing more in fewer hours.  This means 

that their working day is more intense.  Work speed-ups are increasing.



<p>“Labor-saving technology” also spurs worker productivity.  How?  By cutting 

investment on workers and transferring it to machines.



<p>When employers shift spending from workers to machines, there’s less hiring 

of new workers.   With respect to productivity, automation can’t be 

separated from its application.



<p>There’s more in the AP article worth reviewing.  “The rise in productivity 

in the first quarter helped to push down unit labor costs, a gauge of 

inflation. Unit labor costs declined at an annual rate of 5.4 percent, the 

biggest drop since the second quarter of 1983. In the fourth quarter, unit 

labor costs fell at a rate of 3.1 percent.”



<p>Thus, U.S. workers’ pay is also out of balance with their productivity.  

Employers, not employees, are getting the benefits of productivity gains.  

This is a trend in many job sectors of the nation’s economy.



<p>In the U.S., the buyers of labor-power have been winning the struggle over 

productivity gains with those who sell their labor-power.  This outcome can 

change, of course.  But only when the working-class is mobilized and 

organized.



<p>For the past quarter-century, the U.S. working-class has been taking it on 

the chin.  The working day has grown longer and more intense.  Accordingly, 

working and living conditions have deteriorated for many millions of 

Americans.



<p>In the meantime, a report in the May 7 Financial Times cast doubt on the 

continuation of the U.S. “productivity miracle.”  But that sidestepped a 

rather big point.



Namely, gains in worker productivity that are flowing away from U.S. workers 

aren&#146;t much of a miracle to them.
