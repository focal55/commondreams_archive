Campaign finance reformers finally have a victory on their hands. They've earned it. The McCain-Feingold bill started as a robust, multi-faceted proposal seven years ago. But each time it was defeated, its proponents had to pare it down in an attempt to improve its chances the next time. Reformers had to battle every step of the way -- such is the intransigence of the incumbent brain.  <P>

But on March 20, the Senate gave the bill its final Congressional blessing (kicking and screaming the whole way) and sent it to the White House. The President says that he'll sign it (after flipping and flopping over whether he supported the bill, something that drove his anti-reform friends on Capitol Hill nuts). Sen. Mitch McConnell, the anti-reform ringleader, is taking the battle into the courts -- where he'll once again argue that wealth is a virtue that entitles the wealthy to an extra helping of democracy.  <P>

McConnell may see it as doomsday, but most observers characterize the McCain-Feingold bill -- named after its Senate sponsors -- as modest reform, a first step. It will curtail some dramatic abuses in the system: the use of unlimited "soft money" that is not supposed to support federal candidates but which has been used to do so, and tighter control of campaign advertising that tries to masquerade as independent "issue adverting."  <P>

But the President and McConnell must be snickering in private about the other major provision of the bill. Even as it reduces soft money and discouraged sham "issue advertising," McCain-Feingold doubles the size of "hard money" contributions, those that directly fund a candidate.  <P>

Here's the irony: Recall that record-breaking, headline-making $100 million that George W. Bush raised in the 2000 primary season? It was all hard money, raised mostly in $1,000 denominations, the maximum then allowed by law. Even as McCain-Feingold reduces the influence of soft money, it doubles the amount of hard money that donors can give. Soft money makes up one-third of the money in federal politics, while hard money accounts for most of the other two-thirds. So, if we cut soft money but all hard-money donors double their gifts, we'll end up with four thirds, or a third more money in federal politics than before. This is progress? <P>

If this is reform, we better re-think the meaning of the word. If this is a first step, we better have some guide for deciding if what comes next constitutes legitimate "campaign finance reform" or if it's just a sham. <P>

How can we decide? "The Fannie Lou Hamer Standard" can be our guide. It was developed by the Fannie Lou Hamer Project, an Atlanta-based nonprofit group that sees campaign finance reform as a civil- and voting-rights issue.  <P>

Fannie Lou Hamer was a hero of the voting rights movement. She strove to advance the highest aspiration of our nation -- political equality regardless of economic status, education, race, gender or religion. A daughter of sharecroppers, she rose to national prominence as a leader of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, which in 1964 challenged the state's all-white delegation for seats at the Democratic National Convention. She was a talented leader who could organize and inspire fellow citizens. She had great civic worth but little net worth, and no powerful friends in Washington.  <P>

"The Fannie Lou Hamer Standard" says that we can measure any campaign reform proposal by asking: "Would this make the system fair for someone like Fannie Lou Hamer -- a poor woman, a person of color, a stranger in the halls of power, but someone with vision, a passion for justice, and a calling to public service?" <P>

Here's how the standard works when used to evaluate different "reform" proposals:  <P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Increasing "hard-money" limits</B> further diminishes the already small political weight of a Fannie Lou Hamer relative to the biggest donors, whose contributions are limited only by law. If the legal limit goes up, the fat cats can increase their giving, but people like Fannie Lou, who are limited by their income, cannot do so.  If someone like Fannie Lou was a candidate, her supporters would be unable to give anything like the limit, leaving her vulnerable to a candidate who appeals to wealthy donors or who can self-fund a campaign.  <P>

<B>Reducing "soft money" abuse</B> marginally improves political equality for a Fannie Lou Hamer. It tilts the playing field a little bit back in her favor, away from the biggest donors, but only a bit. A Fannie Lou neither gives soft money nor, as a candidate, would get much -- her constituents don't have it to give.  <P>

<B>Free or reduced-cost commercial airtime</B> for candidates would help someone like Fannie Lou run for office. But a campaign requires some cash, and free airtime won't pay for a campaign computer, put gas in the campaign car, or pay the campaign office rent. Free airtime would help, but it would still leave candidates to fund themselves or rely on wealthy donors -- those who couldn't or wouldn't do so would remain at a significant disadvantage. <P>

<B>Full public financing</B> would put more money into politics, but it would be <I>clean and accountable</I> money available to anyone who could qualify, including people like Fannie Lou Hamer. It would increase electoral competition by encouraging them to challenge privately funded and self-funded opponents. It would allow ideas and organizing skill to count as much or more than fundraising as the measure of a candidate. </BLOCKQUOTE> <P>

 "We believe there's a lot more that needs to be done," said Stephanie Wilson, director of the Fannie Lou Hamer Project, after McCain-Feingold passed the Senate on March 20. "The campaign costs will still keep growing, and if poor people, people of color, do not have the access or the resources to raise the big contributions needed, then we just will not be able to run a competitive race." <P>

Wilson favors offering candidates the opportunity to use public funding in both primary and general elections if a candidate first demonstrates support (by collecting a number of small qualifying contributions) and then foreswears any additional private money or self-funding. The system is voluntary -- other candidates can still fund themselves or rely on private money, but they don't get any public subsidy if they do.  <P>

"If full public financing is available, candidates can choose to fund their races with private money or public money," Wilson says. "Then voters get to choose who will best represent their interests in government. It's fair, it's constitutional, and it goes to the heart of the problem -- the fact that candidates for public office, if they're not born rich, are obliged to sacrifice their independence to the wealthy special interests who fund campaigns."  <P>

Wilson has applied the Fannie Lou Hamer Standard to McCain-Feingold and finds the reform bill lacking. "Just because something is called 'reform' doesn't mean it is," she says.  <P>

Wilson knows that once the president signs it, the campaign reform community will have to decide what comes next in the struggle for deeper reform. <P>

"I hope that the campaign finance reform groups will decide to aim higher now," Wilson says. "From here on out, the Fannie Lou Hamer Standard must be the measure of any reform." <P></p>
