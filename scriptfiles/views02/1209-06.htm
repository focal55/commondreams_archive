<p>The really singular thing about the coming war with Iraq is the phrase just 

employed, the "coming war with Iraq."  If I've read it once, I've read it a 

thousand times.  Like Gulf War I, Gulf War II became a given the moment it 

left a Bush tongue and went to press.  There has since been abundant 

speculation on what will happen when (not if) we invade, and on what we will 

do after (not if) we fight the war.  There has not been so much as a 

speculative peep about what we will do when we refrain from invading Iraq, 

what we will do after we've poured our best energy, thought, diplomatic 

verve, and money into avoiding a war with Iraq, or similar notions of 

inconceivable heresy.



<p>The tone of the media and the tone out of Washington have remained 

unswervingly hopeful -- for an invasion that is.  If only those feckless and 

annoying UN inspectors will hurry up and either A) Find something, or B) Not 

find something, we can (C) Get on with the bombing.  While we're waiting, 

we've stepped up the bombing of Iraq’s southern no-fly zone and quietly 

overseen the movement of a quarter million troops to the Gulf and the 

establishment there of command centers and bases.  The world may not be 

entirely blamed for wondering whether America's energies are dedicated more 

to the prevention or to the invention of war.



<p>So what will happen when (not if) we invade Iraq?  In the first place, we 

will win.  There has been no speculation at all about what we will do 

if/when we hit a stalemate or lose.  In the second place, we will effect a 

regime change.  Saddam Hussein will be extinguished like a rogue cigar butt 

and all will be well.  If not, recent experience suggests we can simply wave 

a magic wand, change captions on CNN, take a big collective blink, issue a 

pronouncement that one man isn't all that important, and proceed to bomb 

Somalia.  Something else that will occur when (not if) we invade Iraq, is 

that people will die – a point some in the media have been acknowledging 

with something like excited anticipation.  How many deaths?  Between a 

thousand and ten thousand, according to the punditry.  Or put another way, 

an “acceptable figure”.  That’s Us.  What about Them?  If the kill ratio is 

as skewed as it was in Gulf War I, somewhere between a million and ten 

million of Them would be shorn of their lives.   That figure is probably 

extreme.  But in any case, if you consider it unacceptable it may help to 

consider that we have nothing against the people who will die when (not if) 

we invade Iraq, and that the blame for their deaths can be laid squarely on 

one anachronistic dictator.  And what will happen after (not if) we invade 

Iraq?  There have been hints of a protectorate or military occupation or...  

But we can afford to be vague, as it seems a safe bet there will be someone 

around to drape a green robe on who can run the place for us, and some kids 

available to fly kites for CNN.  Then off to North Korea or Iran or Canada, 

or whatever other threat to American democracy needs fixing.



<p>There are several things I would like to see happen in the "coming war with 

Iraq", since the possibility of its not coming at all is apparently not an 

option.  For starters, I would like to see us pick an appropriate name.  

Operation Just Cuz, as unbelievers in the State Department dubbed it, was 

used already back in Panama, so that's out.  Operation Nothing Against the 

Iraqi People seems too long.  Operation Finite Justice might serve as a 

relatively modest variant to last year's Infinite Justice, though Operation 

All-Too-Human has perhaps the homier feel.  I tend to like Operation 

Whatever.  It's just vague enough to suit our intentions, and flexible too – 

if we have to abruptly shift gears and bomb Iceland or Sierra Leone, at 

least we won’t be groping for a name.   To reflect the moral rectitude we 

claim to carry into Iraq when (not if) we invade it, I would like to further 

propose that our tanks be fitted with armored bumper stickers that read 

'What Would Jesus Drive?'  Appropriate stickers could be adapted to all 

branches of the invading force. 'What Would Jesus Drop?' might bring comfort 

to the pilots, for instance.



<p>Come to think of it, what would Jesus do?  It does not seem at all 

far-fetched to suppose that if a party of conspiring hawks was to approach 

and bait him with the question of what to do about Saddam Hussein, Jesus 

would respond by bending down and writing with his finger on the ground.  If 

he chose to speak, it might be to say, “Let him who is without sin among you 

launch the first strike.”  And the party of conspiring hawks would retreat 

murmuring and conspiring to their offices and board rooms to pray for a 

certain someone’s death by lethal injection, crucifixion being too 

unsophisticated for this civilized age.



<p>I guess it was unsophisticated of my parents to teach me that war is a 

mistake, and of me to take them seriously.  Yet I doubt I’m alone in 

thinking that war is less often an indication of rightness, righteousness, 

courage, or historical necessity than an indication of failure.  We might 

try, just for a second, to regard Gulf War I as a screw-up.  While it 

offered some Americans an unprecedented occasion to gloat, it also put the 

anti-American burr up Al Qaida’s backside, culminated in an abattoir of 

100,000 dead in 100 hours, and accomplished nothing so certain as the 

present sequel.   Of course, like all mistakes, wars happen.  If they happen 

as a last resort, at least there is that – you can say you tried.  If they 

happen as a first resort, it is a sign of foolishness, avarice, malice, or 

false pride.  The prospect of war casualties should prompt far more from us 

than eager speculation on an “acceptable figure”.  “Was it for this the clay 

grew tall?” asked Wilfred Owen, in reference to the youthful lives thrown 

away in World War I.  The media do not address that bitter question, 

suggesting instead that any lives lost when (not if) we invade Iraq are an 

inevitability.  To think of a human life, whether one of Ours or one of 

Theirs, wasted because the Bushes and Hussains couldn’t work things out is 

cause for something other than this anticipatory air of countdown.</p>
