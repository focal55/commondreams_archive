<p>In Afghanistan, it is possible to go from hell to hell. The first circle of 

hell is the Waiting Area, the feces-encrusted dustbowl in which 60,000 Afghans 

rot along their frontier with Pakistan at Chaman &#150; a bone-dry, sand-blasted 

place of patched bedouin tents, skinny camels, infested blankets and skin disease. 

There are laughing children with terrible facial sores, old women of 30, white-bearded, 

dark-turbaned men who from huts of dry twigs look with suspicion and astonishment 

at Westerners.</p>

<p>They are a leftover of the last Afghan war, the one we are supposed to believe 

is over, although they are living proof that hostilities have not ended. At least 

40,000 of the Pashtu refugees cannot go home because their people are still persecuted 

in the north of the country. But Pakistan no longer wants this riff-raff of poor 

and destitute on its squeaky-clean border.</p>

<p>So the United Nations, that great savior of the dispossessed, has discovered 

another vile place for these people. A second circle of hell, 40 miles west of 

Kandahar, it is a gray, hot desert, reached through minefields, shot through with 

blow-torch winds and black stones, haunted by great, creased mountains and fine 

sand hills that move like waves.</p>

<p>The United Nations has drilled wells for the 60,000 &#150; boring more than 

20 meters (60ft) for water &#150; yet few UN officials can do more than shake 

their heads when they stand in this future midden. It is called <i>Zheray Dasht</i> 

&#150; "yellow desert" in Urdu &#150; because of the flowers that carpet the sand 

after rain. But it hasn't rained here for seven years.</p>

<p>Roy Oliff, of the UN High Commission for Refugees, describes the decision-making 

to us with almost teutonic efficiency as he stands amid this desolation. "There 

is a political need to move them from Chaman: they may not have a choice," he 

says. "This was the only place the Afghan government would let us have. We didn't 

get a choice. The local people on the main road didn't want the displaced persons 

near their villages in case they took away employment and used their scarce water 

resources. This area is reasonably [sic] free of mines. We're not anticipating 

much resistance. If they get water and food, there'll be a flood of people here, 

not resistance. Five thousand people will be housed in 12 settlements."</p>

<p>Across the hard desert floor, hundreds of empty, dark-brown tents flap in the 

wind. There are latrines and vast tented reception areas and land for each family 

on which &#150; if the water holds out in the unending drought &#150; they can 

plant trees and graze animals. "It takes them a week to build a mud-walled home," 

Mr Oliff tells us. Note here the UN-speak.</p>

<p>No choice for the refugees. No choice for the UN. Little resistance from the 

refugees. That's how the UN talked in Bosnia as they aided the Serbs in their 

ethnic cleansing by trucking Muslims from city to city. It isn't Mr Oliff's fault. 

When I gently raise the issue of the UN's collective conscience, always supposing 

so sensitive a creature exists within the world's most bureaucratic institution, 

he looks at me with some distress. "Everyone involved in this project has misgivings 

and is making the best of it," he says.</p>

<p>The truth, which is as scarce as water in Afghanistan, is that Pakistan has 

already severely limited the ability of humanitarian workers in the border camps 

and that the Afghan authorities in Kandahar don't want the refugees too close 

to their own city. There are quite a few Afghan-Arab families in the frontier 

camps &#150; al-Qa'ida families among them &#150; and several Taliban sympathizers. 

Spin Boldak, across the old Durrand line from Chaman, was the very last stronghold 

of the black-turbaned misogynists last December. The Afghans don't want them infecting 

Kandahar again.</p>

<p>Mohammed Godbedin, of the UNHCR in Chaman, says at least 50 Afghan-Arab families 

came to the local camps &#150; ("They all came together, not individually," he 

says) although many of these families existed long before the days of al-Qa'ida. 

The remainder of the refugees are Kochi, nomads whose livestock died in the drought, 

and who never had homes. In a few days, the first of the displaced of Chaman and 

Spin Boldak will be taken to visit the Yellow Desert, to decide for themselves 

if they are prepared to move.</p>

<p>But this is a mere ritual. Pakistani and Afghan officials will make the final 

decision, with the UN's familiar compliance. The refugee leaders will be trucked 

to the Kandahar-Herat desert highway, then led along a sand trail marked by red 

and white rocks. On either side of these markers are land-mines left by the mujahedin 

during the war against the Soviet occupation. "They are vehicle mines, not anti-personnel 

mines so they won't blow up under people," one UN official says helpfully.</p>

<p>Unless, of course, the refugees acquire a clapped-out lorry and drive on the 

wrong side of the markers. Beyond a former Russian military fortress, its tank 

revetments still evident amid the gray muck, the desert flattens. This is where 

the land is "reasonably" clear of mines. And where the UN has built its new refugee 

camp.</p>

<p>Things might be different if the warlord battles ended in the north, if the 

Americans allowed the international peace-keeping forces to move out of Kabul 

and collect the weapons in the north and damp down the ethnic fires. More than 

half the frontier refugees could then go back to their homes. But Afghanistan 

is becoming more lawless by the week. Refugees remain the linguistic definition 

of much of this country. And the Yellow Desert, the latest UN prison for the 60,000 

destitute of Chaman and Spin Boldak, will soon be on all our maps.</p> </p>
