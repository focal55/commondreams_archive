<p>Our president has made it abundantly clear that Iraq's Saddam Hussein is the ringleader of what he calls the axis of evil.

<P>Whether that's indeed the case is something that undoubtedly will play out during the coming months as the United States continues its war on terrorism.

<P>What's strange, though, is that George Bush's own vice president, Dick Cheney, apparently didn't see either Iraq or Saddam as a big problem when he was making billions for Halliburton Inc. and millions for himself only a few years ago.

<P>Halliburton's role, under Cheney's direction, was first outlined in a detailed story in the San Francisco Bay Guardian during the 2000 election campaign and has since been reported in other publications.

<P>"During former Defense Secretary Richard Cheney's five-year tenure as chief executive of Halliburton Inc., his oil services firm raked in big bucks from dubious commercial dealings with Iraq. Cheney left Halliburton with a $34 million retirement package," the Guardian's Martin Lee wrote.

<P>"Of course, U.S. firms aren't generally supposed to do business with Saddam Hussein," he continued. "But thanks to legal loopholes large enough to steer an oil tanker through, Halliburton profited big-time from deals with the Iraqi dictatorship. Conducted discreetly through several subsidiaries in Europe, the transactions helped Saddam Hussein retain his grip on power."

<P>He went on to explain that Halliburton was among more than a dozen American firms that supplied Iraq's petroleum industry with spare parts and helped retool its oil rigs after the Gulf War and after U.N. sanctions were eased in 1998.

<P>The Financial Times of London has estimated that between September of 1998 and the winter of 1999-2000, Cheney, as CEO of Halliburton, oversaw $23.8 million of business contracts for the sale of oil-industry equipment and services to Iraq through two of its subsidiaries, Dresser Rand and Ingersoll-Dresser Pump.

<P>Under Cheney, Halliburton became the United States' largest oil services company and the fifth largest military contractor.

<P>Just another example, apparently, of Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill's "beauty of capitalism."

<P>When it comes to making big money, who cares about evil?</p>
