</font>On January 28, 2002, Attorney General John Ashcroft, <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines02/0129-04.htm" target="_new">announced</a> that he spent $8000 of taxpayer's money for drapes to cover up the exposed breast of The Spirit of Justice, an 18ft aluminum statue of a woman that stands in the Hall of Justice. <br />

</i><br />

John, John, John, <br />

you've got your priorities all wrong. <br />

While men fly airplanes into skyscrapers, <br />

dive bomb the pentagon, <br />

while they stick explosives into their shoes, <br />

and then book a seat right next to us, <br />

while they hide knives in their luggage, <br />

steal kids on school buses, <br />

take little girls from their beds at night <br />

drive trucks into our state capital buildings, <br />

while our president calls dangerous men all over the world <br />

evildoers and devils, <br />

while we live in the threat of biological warfare <br />

nuclear destruction, <br />

annihilation, <br />

you are out buying yardage <br />

to save Americans <br />

from the appalling <br />

alarming, abominable <br />

aluminum alloy of evil, <br />

that terrible ten foot tin tittie. <br />

You might not be able to find Bin Laden <br />

But you sure as hell found the hooter in the hall of justice. <br />

<br />

It's not that we aren't grateful <br />

But while we were begging the women of Afghanistan <br />

To not cover up their faces <br />

You are begging your staff members to <br />

Just cover up that nipple <br />

To save the American people <br />

From that monstrous metal mammary <br />

How can we ever thank you? <br />

<br />

So, in your office every morning <br />

in your secret prayer meeting<br />

while an American woman is sexually assaulted every 6 seconds <br />

while anthrax floats around the post office <br />

and settles in the chest of senior citizens, <br />

you've got another chest on your mind. <br />

While American sons arrive home in body bags <br />

and  heat seeking missiles <br />

fly around a foreign country <br />

looking for any warm body <br />

you think of another body. <br />

And you pray for the biggest bra in the world John <br />

because you see that breast on the spirit of justice <br />

in the spirit of your <br />

own inhibited sexuality. <br />

And when we women see <br />

our grandmothers, our mothers, our daughters, our granddaughters, <br />

our sisters, ourselves, <br />

when we women see that <br />

statue the spirit of justice <br />

we see the spirit of strength <br />

the spirit of survival. <br />

While every day <br />

we view innocent bodies dragged out of rubble <br />

and women and children  laid out <br />

like thin limp dolls <br />

and baptized into death as collateral damage <br />

and the hollow eyed Afghani mother's milk has dried <br />

up underneath her burka <br />

in famine in shame <br />

and her children are dead  at her breast. <br />

<br />

While you  look at that breast John <br />

that jug on the spirit of justice <br />

and deal with your thoughts of lust <br />

and sex and nakedness <br />

we see it as a testimony motherhood <br />

And you see it as a tit. <br />

<br />

It's not the money it cost. <br />

It's the message you send. <br />

We've got the right to live in freedom. <br />

We got the right to cheat Americans out <br />

of millions of dollars and then <br />

just not want to tell congress about it. <br />

We've got the right <br />

to drop bombs night and day <br />

on a small country that has no army, <br />

no navy, no military at all, <br />

because we've got the right to bear arms <br />

but we just better not even think <br />

about not the right to bare breasts. <br />

So now John you can be photographed <br />

while you stand there and talk about <br />

guns and bombs and poisons <br />

without the breast appearing over your right shoulder <br />

without that  bodacious bosom bothering you <br />

and we just wanted to tell you <br />

in the spirit of justice <br />

in the spirit of truth <br />

John <br />

there is still one very big boob left standing there in that picture. <br />
