<p>George W. Bush has this thing about laws -- domestic or 

international -- that disagree with him.  He likes to operate outside 

their embrace or withdraw from them or try to repeal them.  It is not 

just personal -- as when he costs taxpayers millions to pay for his 

political trips on Air Force One before elections -- it also involves 

the health, and safety of Americans and people abroad.

<p>Bob Woodward relates in his new book on Bush and war that the 

President admits to being a black and white person who makes decisions 

from his gut.  A dubious enough personality type for a football coach, 

this trait raises serious concerns when imbedded in the 

commander-in-chief of the most powerful arsenal on Earth.

<p>Consider what this gut instinct has done to our constitutional 

framework and the tenuous architecture of international law.  Earlier 

this year, Bush launched an all out offensive on Congress to have it 

selectively surrender its exclusive constitutional authority to declare 

war against Iraq.  Despite heroic efforts from legislators led by 

Senator Robert Byrd (D-WV), Congress supinely gave up its war-making 

power to the White House.

<p>Jefferson, Madison, Adams and company had distinct reasons for 

refusing to lodge this power in the Presidency and instead wanted many 

legislators in open session to make this awesome decision.  They did not 

want another King George emerging with this single-power launching war.

<p>Throughout the year 2002, Bush made no secret of his desire to 

unilaterally overthrow the Iraqi dictatorial regime (called "regime 

change").  But the opinion polls were unflagging; the American people in 

sizable majorities did not want the U.S. to go it alone.

<p>OK said Mr. Bush; he'll go to the UN and have the Security Council 

resume a rigorous inspection process in Iraq of weapons of mass 

destruction.  The other nations then insisted that if Iraq materially 

breaches the UN resolution, the U.S. would go back to the Security 

Council for any further action.  Yet Bush made it clear that if the UN 

did not act, the U.S., and its very few allies, would do so unilaterally.

<p>It should be noted that in responding to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait 

in 1990, Bush's more deliberative father, then President Bush, first 

asked the UN for a resolution, then asked Congress, after the November 

elections not before as did his son, for its approval the following January.

<p>Treaties that deal with arms control or a real weapon of mass 

destruction called global warming are irritants to our White House-based 

west Texas sheriff.  The Bush Administration has rejected the Kyoto 

Protocol on climate change, declined to support the small arms treaty, 

the land mines treaty and the verification protocol for the Biological 

Weapons Convention.  Mr. Bush refuses to submit the Comprehensive Test 

Ban Treaty for ratification by the Senate which rejected it under 

President Clinton.  There are other similar avoidances.

<p>Even in the area of health, Mr. Bush is indifferent.  The 

International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which 

130 countries have signed, has not received Mr. Bush's willingness to 

send it to the Senate for ratification.  What is objectionable about the 

Covenant is that it has a "right to health" within its terms, along with 

steps to attain this right to health incumbent on signatory nations.  

The U.S. is the only western democracy without universal health care.

<p>Perhaps no other area of American law has aroused more anger, 

pre-9/11 -- in Mr. Bush's mind than the American civil justice system 

which enables wrongfully injured children and adults to sue, among other 

parties,the President's corporate friends when they sell dangerous or 

defective products.

<p>As Governor of Texas and as President, Bush has wanted to limit 

corporate compensation for unlimited injuries, take away the authority 

of the states and put it in Washington, D.C. and federally tie the hands 

of state judges and juries who are the only ones who hear and see the 

evidence in trials.  Note, however, none of his so-called "tort reforms" 

would take away the right of corporations to sue people or other companies.

<p>It is the daily behavior of this one-track President that is 

irritating even the usually compliant White House press corp.  Day after 

day, his repetitively belligerent sound bites and his unrevealed 

"intelligence" declarations about Iraq have been wearing thin.  A Los 

Angeles Times poll on December 17th found that seventy two percent of 

respondents, including sixty percent of Republicans, "said the President 

has not provided enough evidence to justify starting a war with Iraq."

<p>On October 11th, the Washington Post reported that the former 

military commander for the Middle East, retired Marine Gen. Anthony C, 

Zinni, is opposed "to a U.S.-led invasion of Iraq."  Zinni believes Iraq 

is already contained and that the U.S. has other priorities in the 

Middle East.  Adding that General Zinni is "widely respected in the U.S. 

Military," the Post concludes its report by saying that a retired 

three-star General said that Zinni's concerns "are widely shared by many 

in the leadership of the military but aren't universal."

<p>There are few doubts, however, among the covey of "chicken hawks" 

surrounding Mr. Bush.  These men, including Vice President Dick Cheney, 

supported the Vietnam War in the Sixties but wanted other Americans to 

do the fighting.

<p>There is not much time before Mr. Bush declares a war with 

scenarios far more costly, harmful and devastating then the "cake-walk" 

scenario that is the premise of Mr. Bush's airborne electronic posse.  

It could be a war fraught with severe longer term "blowback" impacts on 

the U.S. and one that could seriously affect the economy, as Yale 

Professor Nordhaus warned recently in the New York Review of Books.

<p>It is testimony to the inherent sense of the American people that, 

even in the midst of the Bush propaganda barrage, when asked if they 

would support a U.S. unilateral invasion, with large civilian 

casualities in Iraq, and significant casualties among our military 

personnel, a large majority says no.

<p>More Americans are wondering why Bush wants peaceful dialogue with a 

North Korea that has more advanced arms, yet seeks war with a contained, 

weakened and surrounded Iraq?  But then, when decisions are made in the 

gut, such inconsistencies can bound.
