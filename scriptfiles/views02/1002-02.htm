<p> Even without our protests telling them so, it must be obvious to the finance 

ministers who attend the annual meetings of the IMF/World Bank that their institutions 

are sick. Those inside the Washington DC headquarters can't feel so healthy after 

the year that passed. It was a year when corporations that they nurtured and nourished, 

like Enron, collapsed with little warning and less grace. When countries that 

had long swallowed their prescriptions, like Argentina, found themselves suffering 

from nauseous economies and rashes of popular uprising. And when a critic they 

cut from their innards like a malignant growth, Joseph Stiglitz, walked off with 

a Nobel Prize.</p>

<p>If they care to listen to the protests, the ministers will hear at least one 

diagnosis that explains their various ailments: &#145;Infectious greed.&#146; 

And they will learn that, as a remedy, thousands of activists have joined a Saturday 

march to &#145;Quarantine&#146; them. Here on the streets, Greenpeace wears white 

sanitary garb. The scores of police present used mass arrests to overwhelm a much 

smaller number of Anti-Capitalist Convergence protesters on Friday. But now they 

are also enlisted in the pageant: Their barricades, the action suggests, are needed 

not so much to keep criticism out, but rather to keep the contagious delegates 

away from the general public.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that global-justice chants echo through the meeting chambers. 

But it is equally certain that the IMF and World Bank feel less affected by our 

modest attempt at containment than by a global state of siege that has constrained 

them in the past year. I was intrigued to watch a short video on the <i>Washington 

Post</i> website, in which Citigroup USA Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer exhibits 

the defensive posture of the meetings: &#145;I think that every time there's a 

crisis, every time there's a global slowdown, you're bound to have a questioning 

of the policies that are being followed,&#146; he says. &#145;My guess is that 

if we were in a situation with global growth of five per cent and no major crisis 

in the emerging markets, you wouldn't have these questions.&#146;</p>

<p>What is fascinating to me is that Fischer does not need to elaborate the actual 

questions that compel his response. Here in Washington DC, questions push in from 

all sides. They come from private investors who hesitate to invest their confidence 

in IMF schemes, and from economists &#150; even from World Bank President James 

Wolfensohn himself &#150; eager to disassociate themselves from the &#145;Washington 

Consensus&#146; that ruled development thinking for two decades. The questions 

come from a public distrustful of the corporate representatives that hover around 

the meetings. And, most of all, questions come from countries in the global South, 

where eruptions of outrage greet any IMF and World Bank representatives brave 

enough actually to face the public, and where even some governments now ask: &#145;Is 

there a way to break free?&#146;</p>

<p>During the Quarantine march I walk with Mark Weisbrot, co-director of the Center 

for Economic and Policy Research. &#145;That a country like Argentina is now considering 

defaulting to the IMF is something that would have been unimaginable even a few 

years ago,&#146; he says to me. &#145;Or look at Brazil, where the IMF tried to 

lock in the new government to their policies. It didn&#146;t work. They haven&#146;t 

committed.</p>

<p>&#145;There&#146;s going to be a lot more countries trying to figure out ways 

to go around the IMF. It&#146;s happening slowly, but it&#146;s happening.&#146;</p>

<p>The prerogative of the ministers, it seems, is to prove that their malady is 

nothing so serious &#150; that it's just a bit of a cold. As we walk along amidst 

the drums and puppets, Mark Weisbrot and I are joined by a journalist who has 

just visited the official proceedings.</p>

<p>&#145;Inside, they&#146;re guardedly optimistic,&#146; she reports.</p>

<p>&#145;Optimistic of what?&#146; Weisbrot asks.</p>

<p>&#145;Optimistic that it won&#146;t get worse.&#146;</p>

<p>Three weeks ago a bulletin from the FBI's National Infrastructure Protection 

Center, released to warn of potential terrorist activity in the weeks surrounding 

the anniversary of the September 11 attacks, devoted a full paragraph to the protests 

that ultimately assembled this weekend. It infuriates me to think that the individuals 

who write such alerts are the same people who are charged with protecting the 

country &#150; that their &#145;intelligence&#146; cannot distinguish legitimate 

threats to national security from past instances, dutifully recited in the memo, 

where a few protesters broke some bank windows. And yet this is not the last time 

that trade and terror would intermingle during the weekend.</p>

<p>The officers hand-cuffed and bussed away as many as three hundred activists 

who did nothing more severe than to gather in a public park and beat drums against 

the impending invasion of Iraq. Police Chief Ramsey was plain-spoken enough. He 

said simply: &#145;The protesters put themselves in a place to be arrested.&#146; 

And, from a certain perspective, the logic was irrefutable. Never mind that the 

place in question was Freedom Plaza.</p>

<p>By connecting the IMF and the World Bank to corporate scandal, the protests 

this weekend seek to capitalize on one of the major themes in US politics. But 

another theme haunts the demonstrations. In the press, the deliberations from 

Capitol Hill about how broad an endorsement Congress will grant President Bush 

for his invasion of Iraq dominate the front pages. Activist Maude Barlow, the 

chairperson of The Council of Canadians, reminds us that Bush has rarely missed 

an opportunity to use the war on terror to advance his trade agenda. She quotes 

the President from the announcement of his Administration's National Security 

Policy last week: &#145;There is a single sustainable model for national success,&#146; 

Bush said. &#145;Freedom, Democracy, and Free Enterprise.&#146; </p>

<p>For the people of the United States, this constitutes a shameless politicization 

of our fear. When Bush stares down &#145;the enemy&#146;, he leaves no room for 

a vision of freedom based on open debate and democratic self-determination. Rather, 

he pledges to wield the military might at his command to enforce this &#145;single 

model&#146; &#150; one where &#145;free markets&#146; and &#145;free trade&#146; 

rule.</p>

<p>You are either with us or against us, he says.</p>

<p>&#145;Let&#146;s face it,&#146; the writer Naomi Klein said on Friday when 

remembering the A16 demonstrations that took place here two-and-a-half years ago. 

&#145;Those protests were bigger.&#146;</p>

<p>She offers this analysis of the situation: &#145;A lot of people aren't here 

this week. But they're not here not because they don't care and they're scared 

and they're not activists anymore. They're not here because they're squatting 

in their cities. They're not here because they're fighting against illegal deportations 

of refugees. They're not here because they're building a rooted community movement.&#146;</p>

<p>It is an optimistic take. And her view is no doubt true &#150; in part. However, 

it is also true that these times of war and recession are difficult ones for global-justice 

organizing in the United States. The idea that media hype and the internet magic 

created the 1999 protests against the WTO is false. Seattle was not built in a 

day. To construct that gathering it took almost a year of caravans, coalitions 

and cash advances. In its aftermath, we had the luxury of riding a wave of unusual 

interest and excitement. But, as organizer Mike Prokosch of Boston's United for 

a Fair Economy noted earlier this weekend: &#145;That wave is over.&#146; </p>

<p>By returning to the long and difficult process of churning up the waters at 

its base, the institutions that make up the global-justice movement in the US 

&#150; its unions, its environmentalists, its community groups and its collections 

of young radicals &#150; may well ride high once again. Indeed, the escalating 

battle against the Free Trade Area of the Americas will demand it in coming years. 

For now, however, the mood of our Washington DC protests is less &#145;The Whole 

World is Watching&#146; than &#145;We Are Watching the World&#146;.</p>

<p>At a time when a rampant unilateralism dominates this city, perhaps this is 

a good thing. This weekend we viewed videos of South Africans taking direct action 

to remove the filters that &#150; like an extreme version of a &#145;low flow&#146; 

showerhead &#150; reduce their water pressure to but a trickle. We hear stories 

of Brazilians defying warnings of financial ruin to assert their right to elect 

officials that truly represent them. And we read e-mail dispatches from London, 

where an awesome crowd of 350,000 reportedly rallies against an invasion of Iraq.</p>

<p>Oscar Olivera, a movement leader from Cochabamba, Bolivia, perhaps did best 

to capture the importance of this battle against provincialism. &#145;The victories 

of the US Government are not the victories of the US people,&#146; he said. And 

he suggested instead that we learn about the successes of popular movements across 

the globe, and that we begin to celebrate them as our own. </p>

<p>It is a wise counsel. For even as we quarantine greed in Washington DC we can 

hope that there exists a more potent contagion in this world. Ours is the germ 

of infectious solidarity.</p>
