<p>UNICEF just released statistics showing a significant improvement in the nutritional status of children in Iraq. According to the figures, over the last two years chronic malnutrition has declined by 23%, and acute malnutrition has declined by almost 50%. 



<p>The improvement is visible. At the hospitals I’ve visited, particularly in 

Central and Northern Iraq, wasting diseases such as kwashiorkor and marasmus are 

no longer pandemic. And while doctors throughout Iraq continue to report shortages 

in essential medicines and equipment, pediatric cancers have replaced malnutrition 

as their chief complaint. Despite these improvements - UNICEF figures show that 

over 1 in 5 Iraqi children remain malnourished. Our work isn’t over yet. 

<p>There are several reasons why malnutrition has

declined - almost all due to busting sanctions. One

reason is, fairly obviously, because more food is

available. In December 1999, the UN lifted the limit

it had placed on Iraqi oil sales through the

Oil-for-Food program, and in early 2000 exempted food

from the security review process. This allowed Iraq to

import more food, more quickly, and distribute it to

families in need. Of the $24.2 billion in supplies

Iraq has been allowed to import under the Oil-for-Food

program to date, almost $10 billion has arrived in

just the last year - allowing the Iraqi government to

increase the food ration they provide to everyone in

Iraq. 



<p>The last two years have also brought good rainfall,

ending the previous drought in Iraq, and providing

bumper crops. This not only increased the supply of

food available in local markets, but brought down

prices as well, allowing some families to supplement

their ration at local markets. However, the ration

still represents the only source of food for a

majority of families, and, for many, their sole source

of income as well. Sanctions still prevent the Iraqi

government from spending its own money within the

country. As a result, only dry goods, imported from

outside the country, can be included in the food

ration. The increased ration still does not contain

any fresh fruits or vegetables, or animal protein. 



<p>Recent, illegal trade agreements between Iraq and its neighbors, and increased smuggling, have also impacted nutrition by bringing more goods and hard currency into the country. According to a September 2002 overview of the nutritional status of Iraqi children, UNICEF reports that “[m]ajor shifts in Security Council Resolutions and government of Iraq regional trade policies are among the basic factors that have improved child malnutrition in the South/Centre [of Iraq].”



<p>Additionally, the Iraqi government, in conjunction

with UNICEF, has built 2,800 Community Child Care

Units (CCCUs), staffed by almost 13,000 Iraqi

volunteers, in order to provide nutritional

assessment, counseling, and therapy to children in

need. These units now screen an average of 1.1 million

children every year. 



<p>Without safe drinking water, children contract chronic

diarrhea and are unable to absorb nutrients, so

improvements in essential civilian infrastructures

have also had an effect on malnutrition. Electricity

is necessary to run water and sanitation plants, and

Iraq has reduced its electrical deficit from 3000

megawatts in 1996 to 900 megawatts today. Iraq has

also been able to increase the availability of potable

water in urban areas to almost 2/3 of what it was in

1990. This has led to a reduction in diarrhea cases

among children under the age of 5. But it’s not all

good news. According to the “Profile of Women and

Children in Iraq (UNICEF, April 2002), “Diarrhea

leading to death from dehydration and acute

respiratory infections together account for 70% of

child mortality in Iraq. An Iraqi child suffers an

average of 14.4 diarrhea spells a year, an almost 4

fold increase from the 1990 average of 3.8 episodes.

During the same period, typhoid fever increased from

2,240 to over 27,000 cases.”



<p>Despite repeated denials by every UN agency and NGO

working in Iraq, the U.S. continues to claim that the

only reason people are suffering under sanctions is

because of their government. However repressive that

government may be, the programs Iraq has put in place

to deal with malnutrition, and the improvements that

have resulted, should finally put to rest U.S.

allegations about Iraqi “interference” in the

functioning of the Oil-for-Food program. 



<p>Unfortunately, recent improvements are likely to be short-lived. There is currently a multi-billion dollar shortfall in the money available for the Oil-for-Food program. In order to stem the “crumbling” of sanctions, the U.S. has begun enforcing a policy on oil sales called “retroactive pricing.” Under this policy, purchasers of Iraqi oil are not allowed to know the price of the oil they have bought for up to a month after they’ve received it. Given the volatility of the oil market, this uncertainty has led to steep declines in sales. According to the UN Development Program’s June 2002 brief for Iraq, “the Oil-for-Food Programme is increasingly facing a financial crisis due to the substantial drop in revenues received from Iraqi oil exports and to uncertainties regarding the pricing mechanism.” If this crisis isn’t quickly reversed, the program will falter, and malnutrition rates will again begin to rise.



<p>The other major problem on the horizon is the war

George Bush keeps promising to deliver. If the U.S.

bombs electrical plants, and water and sewage

treatment centers in Iraq, as was done during “Desert

Storm,” the result is going to be even greater

epidemics than Iraq is currently suffering from. If

civil war breaks out, or if the U.S. bombs roads,

rail, and all the bridges, as was done during “Desert

Storm,” the result will be country-wide famine. 



<p>Iraq began food rationing prior to the Gulf War, when

sanctions were first imposed. The Iraqi government

only accepted the restrictions on its sovereignty

imposed by the Oil-for-Food program when it became

clear in 1995 that internal stores were no longer able

to meet the crisis caused by sanctions. This

distribution of food, to 24 million people on a

monthly basis for over 12 years, is one of the most

massive, logistical operations in world history. How

well this program could work, during the middle of a

war and invasion, is not something we should want to

discover. 



<p>If we care about the children of Iraq, then we need to

stop this war from happening. But, in the end, the

only thing that will truly end Iraq’s humanitarian

crisis, and put an end to malnutrition once and for

all, is if we stop the war that is already going on.

Economic sanctions are intended to damage economies

and increase poverty. Increased poverty means

increased malnutrition. And - no matter how hard

UNICEF, or the Iraqi government, or anti-sanctions

activists try - there's no way around that.
