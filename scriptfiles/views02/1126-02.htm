<p>Last week the Bush administration announced new rules that would effectively 

scrap "new source review," a crucial component of our current system of air pollution 

control. This action, which not incidentally will be worth billions to some major 

campaign contributors, comes as no surprise to anyone who pays attention to which 

way the wind is blowing (from west to east, mainly — that is, states that vote 

Democratic are conveniently downwind). </p>

<P> But this isn't just a policy change, it's an omen. I hope I'm wrong, but it's 

likely that last week's announcement marks the beginning of a new era of environmental 

degradation. </p>

<P> Some background: The origin of new source review lies in a big policy mistake 

30 years ago. The original Clean Air Act imposed strict rules on new sources of 

pollution, but it grandfathered existing power plants, refineries and so on. The 

idea was that over time, as old facilities closed down, strict rules would become 

the norm. </p>

<P> What happened instead was predictable: In order to keep their exemptions, 

polluting industries poured money into existing facilities rather than build new 

ones. In an attempt to close this loophole, the Environmental Protection Agency 

began requiring companies that invested in existing facilities to demonstrate 

that they were merely doing maintenance, rather than creating new capacity that 

was supposed to face stricter regulation.</p>

<P> Everyone agrees that this was an awkward fix. It was a recipe for endless 

legal battles between companies and the E.P.A., and in some cases it deterred 

investments that would actually have made the air cleaner. Most experts also agree 

on the solution: a so-called cap-and-trade system, in which existing facilities 

are granted emissions licenses that they can sell to others if they succeed in 

reducing their own pollution. This would end the litigation, and provide businesses 

with broad-based incentives to clean the air. </p>

<P> But in the early years of the Clean Air Act, environmentalists didn't trust 

market solutions enough to endorse cap-and-trade. By the time they changed their 

minds, it was too late. Polluters had lost interest in improving the way the emission-control 

system works, figuring that in a political scene increasingly dominated both by 

money and by conservative ideology they could buy themselves the right to spew 

at will. And so it has turned out. </p>

<P> True, the Bush administration says that it favors a cap-and-trade system; 

it has even introduced legislation to that effect. I could explain the defects 

of the Clear Skies Initiative — its conspicuous failure to deal with greenhouse 

gases, the glacial pace at which it proposes to reduce emissions of those pollutants 

it does control (many estimates say that it would actually allow more pollution 

than would a strict enforcement of current law). But it's a moot point: Last week's 

announcement is, I believe, a signal that even Clear Skies isn't going to happen.</p>

<P> Aside from cynicism (which has been an almost infallible guide to administration 

environmental policy so far), how do I reach that conclusion?</p>

<P> Here's one reason: If a cap-and-trade system is just around the corner, why 

not wait and introduce the whole system at once? As the E.P.A. press release last 

week correctly declares, "under the Clear Skies Initiative, NSR [new source review] 

would no longer be necessary." But then why did polluters so badly want an immediate 

end to such review before a new system could be put in place? And why was the 

administration willing to accept lots of bad press for a clearly anti-environmental 

move, if it was seriously planning to impose new controls in the next year or 

two? The obvious answer is that both the polluters and top administration officials 

know that Clear Skies is, figuratively and literally, a smokescreen. </p>

<P> Here's another reason: As long as new source review was in effect, the regulated 

industries had an interest in fundamental reform; a sensible cap-and-trade system 

could have both reduced pollution and increased profits. But now the polluters 

have gotten what they want; they would be hurt, not helped, by new restrictions. 

There's no longer any basis for a deal that clears the air.</p>

<P> Administration officials still insist, of course, that they plan to proceed 

with clean air measures. And it's possible that they will eventually do the right 

thing. But don't hold your breath waiting. In fact, it might be a good idea to 

breathe deeply now, while you still can.</p>
