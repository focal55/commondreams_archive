<p>Fast Track is back-- but not so fast, says the

US Senate. Re-named by its advocates as "Trade

Promotion Authority," this measure would strip the

Congress of its power to amend commercial

agreements with other countries. Our elected

representatives would have only an up or down vote

on the final product brought to them by the Bush Administration.</p>



<p>But the speed bumps are getting bigger in

the Senate, which has already fought back with an

amendment preserving the right of Congress to

separately consider certain changes in US trade law.</p>



<p>Why the fight? Nine years ago our corporate

and political leaders sold the American public a bill

of goods under the misleading title of "free trade,"

as in the North American Free Trade Agreement

(NAFTA). The same false advertising was used to

market the World Trade Organization (WTO) a

couple of years later. Now the truth about these

agreements is coming back to haunt them.</p>



<p>Fast Track is a power grab by the executive

branch to deprive Congress of its constitutional

authority to regulate foreign commerce. The

administration wants this power because the

commercial agreements it seeks are not primarily

about "free trade," and in fact have a number of

harmful objectives.</p>



<p>Take NAFTA's now infamous Chapter 11.

This set of rules gave corporations the right to sue governments directly for actions that reduce their profits. Californians awoke to discover that their environmental laws were now subject to a new form of legal challenge. When they banned the gasoline additive MTBE, which had already contaminated more than 10,000 groundwater sites in the state, California faced a lawsuit from a Canadian corporation under NAFTA's Chapter 11.</p>



<p>This case and others have aroused

opposition from not only the nation's largest

environmental groups, but also broad-based, non-

partisan organizations such as the National

Conference of State Legislatures, the National

Association of Counties, and the National League of

Cities.</p>



 <p> "We do not believe that it is necessary to

create different legal standards for foreign investors

to attract their investments in our communities,"

they wrote in a letter supporting Senator John

Kerry's amendment to the Fast Track legislation.

The Kerry amendment would direct trade

negotiators to protect the Constitutional authority of

our local, state, and national governments -- and not

to erode this authority with new rights for

corporations.</p>



<p>The use of "free trade" agreements and

organizations such as the WTO to increase patent

protection for pharmaceutical companies is also

being exposed. This is the most costly and -- in the

case of essential medicines for such diseases as

AIDS -- deadly form of protectionism in the world.

Yet it remains one of the top priorities for US trade negotiators.</p>



<p>Then there is the economic question of who

wins and loses from these agreements. The weight

of the evidence from economic research across the

political spectrum is clear: for at least 70 percent of

the US labor force, the liberalization of trade and

investment over the last 20 years has lowered

wages. This is the logical and predictable outcome

of throwing American workers into increasingly

harsh competition with people who earn as little as

25 cents an hour, and often do not even have the

right to organize unions.</p>



<p>Americans are fine with trade. But we are

deeply suspicious of agreements that subordinate

our Constitution, our environmental protection, and

our health and safety standards to international

agreements that are fast-tracked into law by

multinational corporate lawyers and lobbyists. And

if increased trade and international investment are

being used to lower living standards for the majority

of Americans, why should we support more of the

same?</p>
