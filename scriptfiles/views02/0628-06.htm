<p>OH, MY ... God! Since no politician can afford to be seen as godless, no matter 

how completely they lean on the everlasting arms of lobbyists, they rushed to 

fax machines to be the first to cast stones at the ruling Wednesday by the 9th 

Circuit Court of Appeals. A three-judge panel held that the phrase ''one nation 

under God'' makes the Pledge of Allegiance unconstitutional.

<P>''Ridiculous!'' said President Bush, according to spokesman Ari Fleischer.</P>

<P>''Nuts!'' said Senate majority leader Tom Daschle, a Democrat.</P>

<P>''Senseless!'' said Democratic Senator Joseph Lieberman.</P>

<P>''Stupid!'' said Senate Republican leader Trent Lott.</P>

<P>''Our Founding Fathers must be spinning in their graves!'' said Republican 

Senator Christopher Bond of Missouri.</P>

<P>''Junk justice!'' said New York's Governor George Pataki.</P>

<P>If one little atheist family is capable of creating such panic, the next thing 

you know, these politicians will send gravediggers to Appleton, Wis., to exhume 

Senator Joseph McCarthy. During McCarthy's Red Scare of the 1950s, 60 percent 

of Americans, in research by Harvard sociologist Samuel Stouffer, believed that 

atheists should not be allowed to give a public speech. That percentage was similar 

to the percentage who believed that a communist should not speak.</P>

<P>Contrary to Bond's romantic rhetoric about the Founding Fathers, ''under God'' 

was added to the Pledge by Congress only in 1954. It was the brainchild of the 

Knights of Columbus, which was doing its part to smoke out ''godless communists.'' 

In the 1950s, even God had leaned on the everlasting arms of lobbyists.</P>

<P>Nearly five decades later, atheist Michael Newdow of Sacramento sued his school 

district and the federal government after his second-grade daughter was forced 

to say the pledge. The suit was originally thrown out by a federal judge. Newdow 

appealed, saying ''nobody should be made to feel like an outsider.'' On Wednesday, 

Newdow won in the 9th Circuit, with Judge Alfred Goodwin writing for a three-judge 

panel that ''one nation under God'' was just as objectionable as saying one nation 

under Jesus, Vishnu, Zeus, or even under ''no god.''</P>

<P>Newdow's victory was short-lived. Yesterday, after all the expressions of outrage, 

Goodwin stayed the panel's ruling indefinitely. </P>

<P>No wonder. Hours after the ruling the Senate had passed a resolution, 99-0, 

to defend ''under God.'' Lott attacked the judges, saying that anyone ''who would 

make this kind of decision is bad for America.'' Senators screamed that it might 

mean we cannot mention God in patriotic songs, mint God onto money, or swear on 

the Bible in courts or political offices.</P>

<P>House Republican whip Tom DeLay said: ''It is sad that at a time when our country 

is coming together, this court is driving a wedge between us with their absurd 

ruling.''</P>

<P>''One nation under God'' has its own absurdities, being inserted into the pledge 

at a time that black people were lynched and girls and women were kept home. ''One 

nation under God'' came three and a half decades before the Americans With Disabilities 

Act and four decades before a presidential candidate would openly go to a gay 

and lesbian fund-raiser.</P>

<P>After the terrorist attacks, the singing of ''God Bless America'' fell off-key 

as the weeks passed. On a planet full of deadly conflicts, AIDS, and vast poverty, 

asking God to bless only America sounds a bit self-centered. Asking God to bless 

only America when we are asking the globe for help us in the fight against terrorism 

is arrogant. Michael Jackson once sang, ''We Are the World,'' but American politicians 

do not say ''God Bless the World.'' </P>

<P>Instead of being seen as a wedge of division, the 9th Circuit ruling gave Americans 

an opportunity to rethink the pledge. No matter the bad that has been done, either 

behind the flag or in the name of God, the pledge in the abstract is a declaration 

of optimism. When we say ''liberty and justice for all,'' many of us know quite 

well that generations of power brokers have spent the vast majority of the nation's 

two and a quarter centuries denying it to millions of its citizens. That does 

not stop us from wishing for it. </P>

<P>The clear and universal optimism implied in the wish should not be clouded 

by religious rituals. In a nation that so easily decries Muslim ''radicals'' or 

''fanatics,'' what else could you call the congressional spewing of ''stupid!'' 

''senseless!'' ''absurd!'' and ''nuts!'' but a fanaticism all its own? Not one 

senator had a kind thing to say about Newdow's constitutional rights. The individual 

was trampled in the lawmakers' dash to occupy the front pew of pontification.</P>

<P>Instead of the panicked echoes of McCarthy that would keep ''under God,'' we 

might do better with phrases that everyone can draw upon that speak to our organic 

history. My wife came up with, ''one nation, from many.'' I offer, ''one nation, 

of glorious diversity,'' ''one nation, born of inequality,'' and ''one nation, 

willing to struggle.'' Many of you surely have better ones. Newdow's courage reminds 

us that the Pledge of Allegiance itself is organic. In 1954, the issue was less 

about truly declaring a nation under God than shouting, ''One nation ... oh my 

God, the Commies are coming!''</P>
