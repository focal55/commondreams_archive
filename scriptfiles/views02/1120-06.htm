<p>When people think of genetically modified crops, they usually think of plants 

that are meant to be eaten. However, to industry insiders, food is just the beginning. 

The real money is supposed to be biopharming: the engineering of plants to produce 

pharmaceutical and industrial substances. 

<p>It might sound futuristic, but a lot is being spent to stake a claim in what 

investors hope will be a multibillion dollar industry by the decade's end, and 

the people involved aren't about to bother with pesky details like regulations 

or public safety. Hundreds of fields of experimental drug-producing crops have 

already been planted throughout the nation. Because these plants contain "confidential 

business information," they are planted secretly -- and because the best-kept 

secrets are hidden in plain sight, they are planted in the open, unidentified 

and unsecured. 

<p>This mass experiment has been conducted with the cooperation of the U.S. Department 

of Agriculture. The USDA rarely visits trial sites more than once, and sometimes 

not at all. So far, they've relied primarily on the "voluntary compliance" of 

biopharm companies. Voluntary compliance, we all know, is a business term for 

virtually unregulated. 

<p>Luckily, perhaps, the biopharm industry's veil of secrecy was ripped spectacularly 

off last week when newspapers across the U.S. reported that the Food and Drug 

Administration had ordered the destruction of half a million bushels of Nebraska 

soybeans. The crop had been contaminated by biopharmaceutical corn which was planted 

last year in the same field and unexpectedly sprouted again. 

<p>Ever the masters of "the dog ate my press release" school of public service, 

the USDA announced the next day that they had burned 155 acres of similarly contaminated 

Iowa soybean fields back in September, only they hadn't told anyone. It was, technically, 

a surprising admission. Just weeks ago, USDA officials informed activist groups 

concerned about the open planting of biopharmaceuticals that contamination testing 

hadn't even happened. 

<p>Clearly, the USDA decided to reveal what happened in Iowa only after it became 

obvious that it could no longer be hidden. As it happens, the rogue corn in both 

states was developed by ProdiGene, a Texas-based corporation whose cavalier attitude 

towards their technology has long drawn the ire of environmentalists. Joe Jilka, 

ProdiGene's vice president of product development, once the planting methods used 

in their 85 USDA-approved crop trials as this: 

<p>"The best way to secure it is to grow it just like any other corn. In other 

words, the anonymity of it just completely hides it. You know, our TGEV [pig vaccine] 

corn was up here by Story City right by the interstate, and no one could have 

ever seen it." 

<p>Both ProdiGene and the government refuse to identify what drugs or chemicals 

so very nearly ended up on dinner tables across the nation. However, based on 

ProdiGene's history, it was likely one of four things: an AIDS vaccine which some 

researchers think may actually suppress immune response, a blood clotting agent 

which causes pancreatic disease in lab animals, an asthma-inducing digestive enzyme 

used in pharmaceutical processing, or an industrial adhesive. 

<p>Of course, it could have been something else entirely. All we know is that, 

according to the FDA's own press release, the "genetically modified material" 

is being studied under an Investigational New Drug application. In other words, 

they're still don't know whether it's safe to test on people. 

<p>The USDA's response was insultingly tepid. "The department may consider revising 

its rules to lessen the chance of similar problems in the future," said Cindy 

Smith, a senior administrator. "May consider"? "Lessen the chance"? Exactly what 

would make the USDA take seriously the fact that millions of people were nearly 

fed experimental drugs and chemicals? A few spectacular deaths, perhaps, or a 

steady increase in debilitating disorders that is only noticed decades later, 

when it is too late? Or, in starkly economic terms, the loss of even more export 

markets? 

<p>The USDA needs to publicly document every single secret trial crop in the nation, 

and demonstrate a genuine commitment to regulating the biopharmaceutical industry. 

Until then, there should be an immediate moratorium on all open-field trials. 

No commercial gain is worth the risk that is now being taken, without our permission, 

with us.</p>
