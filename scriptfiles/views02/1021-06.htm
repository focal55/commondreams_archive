<p>The food labels that you will begin to see today in supermarkets across the 

nation, signifying a new national standard for organic foods, could mark the beginning 

of an era in which organic foods migrate from the fringe to the mainstream.<p>

Dedicated consumers and enterprising farmers have propelled the growth of organic 

farming in the United States. At a time when every other sector of the food industry 

is stagnant, organic sales are growing at more than 20% each year.<p>

Americans already purchase about $10 billion in organic foods annually. While 

that is a small share of the total food market -- and certified organic land still 

makes up less than 1% of our agricultural space -- consumers who previously hesitated 

to buy organic foods may be swayed by the new government seal of approval. And 

with a growing market, even more farmers might consider abandoning their pesticide 

sprayers and sacks of nitrate in favor of going organic.<p>

Why is this important? Organic farming has the potential to liberate consumers 

from many of the threats in our food system: meat recalls, the unknown consequences 

of genetically engineered crops, and agrochemical residues in drinking water.<p>

Instead of depending on the pesticides and fertilizers that now taint our nation's 

waterways, organic farmers rely on understanding the ecological processes in the 

fields: rotating crops to break pest cycles and build the soil, encouraging beneficial 

insect populations that gobble pests and combining livestock and crop production.<p>

In organic agriculture, farm animals have access to the outdoors instead of being 

crammed into the warehouse-size metal boxes that now define American meat production 

and that soil neighboring communities with mountains of manure. The new standard 

forbids organic farmers from routinely feeding antibiotics or growth hormones 

to livestock. Last year, studies in the New England Journal of Medicine documented 

that such routine use in chickens, pigs and cows spurs the growth of resistant 

bacteria, which undermines the effectiveness of antibiotics for human use.<p>

Consumers of organic food do not have to worry about unlabeled, cloned animals 

being ground into their meat. Organic processing standards also forbid food irradiation, 

in addition to a range of preservatives and additives allowed into nonorganic 

products.<p>

Compared with nations in Europe, where organic farmers enjoy widespread financial 

and technical support, the United States is lagging. The $180-billion farm bill 

passed this year included only $15 million for organic farming research and only 

$5 million to help farmers cover the costs of certification.<p>

But the new labeling standard is a major step toward recognizing that organic 

farming delivers benefits the public craves: cleaner air and water and a safer 

food supply.</p>
