High counts of gays and counterculture "Bohemians"? Lots of immigrants? Downtowns with lively music and arts scenes, even a tolerance for tattoo parlors?

<P>

 Is it conceivable these seemingly offbeat qualities could be the hallmarks of the most successful 21st-century cities and regions? And areas that place a premium on cultural, ethnic and artistic diversity will more likely burst with entrepreneurial fervor &#151; even while straight and staid cities atrophy?

<P>

 On first blush, it's an unlikely proposition. But it's gaining popularity among some students of what makes city and regional economies work well.

<P>

 These iconoclasts proclaim it is time to toss out tired old economic stimulus tools. So they'd stop subsidies for footloose corporations. Say no to taxpayer-underwritten industrial parks. Stop believing a city or region has much of an advantage because it is close to raw materials, or has cheap labor, or lots of interstate roads.

<P>

 Instead, say exponents of the new theory, the successful cities and metro areas of the 21st century will be those that appeal to talented people &#151; especially talented youth. The race for factories and big corporations was 20th-century stuff; the prize of the future will be success in attracting the kind of smart and creative people who generate new inventions, patents, marketing and finance plans, and world-class products &#151; the seedbeds, in short, of 21st-century innovation and growth.

<P>

 A leader of the new theorists is Richard Florida of Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, who proclaims "The Rise of the Creative Class" &#151; actually the title of his newly published book (Basic Books). Florida quotes Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina telling a recent conference of governors: "Keep your tax incentives and highway interchanges, we will go where the highly skilled people are."

<P>

 What kind of people are the "creative class"? Florida talks of a "super-creative core" &#151; scientists, engineers, university professors, artists, entertainers, editors and writers, think-tank researchers. And behind them "creative professionals" in such knowledge-intensive industries as high technology, finance, the law, health care and business management.

<P>

 Altogether, he reports, there are 38.3 million Americans in "creative class" professions &#151; about 30 percent of the workforce, up from less than 20 percent in 1980. Any area that has enough of these folks is almost sure to surge with economic vigor, he asserts.

<P>

 Most "creative class" people aren't interested in tattoos; most aren't gays or pop musicians or countercultural types themselves. But creative people characteristically grow up feeling a bit like outsiders, different from their schoolmates. When they shop around for a new job or city, acceptance of diversity and of gays in particular sends a signal that "non-standard people are welcome here."

<P>

 The creative class searches out cultural variety &#151; interesting music venues, neighborhood art galleries, a vibrant nightlife. Its members choose active, participatory recreation over passive forms. "They prefer indigenous street-level culture &#151; a teeming blend of cafes, sidewalk musicians and small galleries and bistros, where it is hard to draw the line between performers and spectators. They crave stimulation, not escape," Florida asserted in a recent Washington Monthly article.

<P>

 They go for active outdoor sports (from bicycling to kayaking) over sitting in stadiums watching professional teams compete. They value authenticity (real and historic neighborhoods and natural settings) to places full of chain stores and chain restaurants.

<P>

 Booming Austin, Texas, which has successfully nurtured a street and arts scene on top of its well-known high-tech successes is a sort of poster child for the new formula. No other U.S. city increased the number of patents its inventors received faster in the past 17 years; indeed "no other city even came close," report Bill Bishop and Mark Lisheron in the Austin American-Statesman.

<P>

 Both Florida and the American-Statesman undertook complex statistical comparisons of U.S. cities, seeing if striking high-tech successes could be correlated with such indicators as countercultural lifestyles and high numbers of foreign-born residents.

<P>

 The results, overall, show striking consistency. Such high-tech economic powerhouses as San Francisco and Los Angeles, Seattle, Boston, New York, Washington, Atlanta, Denver and Chicago rank well up the innovation and cultural diversity lists. Many cities at the bottom of the economic vigor charts &#151; Buffalo, Louisville, New Orleans, Honolulu, Memphis and Richmond, for example &#151; are also low in innovation and cultural diversity.

<P>

 In general, strong high-tech growth has erupted in cities that not only tolerate, but seem to promote and indeed celebrate all manner of cultural diversity. Cities that ignore the new signal will likely be stragglers in the new century's economic race.
