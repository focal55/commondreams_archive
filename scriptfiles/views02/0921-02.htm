<p>SANTA CRUZ, Calif. -- How did I, a mayor of a small town in California, wind 

up in a tug of war with the Drug Enforcement Agency? </p>

<P> This week, I stood in front of Santa Cruz's city hall as a local group that 

provides medical marijuana went about its weekly task of distributing the drug 

to the sick and dying.</p>

<P> My story begins on the morning of Sept. 5 when approximately 30 men, dressed 

in military fatigues and carrying automatic weapons, descended on a small cooperative 

farm run by the Wo/Men's Alliance for Medical Marijuana in northern Santa Cruz 

County, about 65 miles south of San Francisco. They were pulling up organically 

grown marijuana plants. </p>

<P> When the Santa Cruz County sheriff's office learned what was going on, it 

was at a loss to explain who the intruders were or what type of response was in 

order. I didn't hear about the raid until 10 a.m., when I was called by members 

of the collective. I then telephoned the Santa Cruz police chief and other local 

officials. The chief hadn't heard anything either. </p>

<P> Later it became clear that the D.E.A. was making a raid. Agents collected 

more than 130 plants and arrested the founders of the medical marijuana collective, 

Valerie and Mike Corral. The Corrals were taken to a federal detention center 

in San Jose, but no charges were filed and they were subsequently released.</p>

<P> The D.E.A. was right to release them. But the Corrals shouldn't have been 

there in the first place. They had not been breaking the law. They were growing 

marijuana specifically for people who had been legally prescribed the substance 

to help them with chronic pain brought on by cancer, diabetes and other illnesses. 

</p>

<P> These weren't new laws, either. Residents in Santa Cruz County had voted in 

1992 to legalize the use of medical marijuana. In 1996, Californians approved 

Proposition 215, a statewide measure to allow the use of marijuana for medicinal 

purposes. Two years ago our city council passed an ordinance to make it easier 

to grow and distribute medical marijuana under the new law.</p>

<P> Before the morning raid, Santa Cruz had a good relationship with drug enforcement 

officials. Santa Cruz, like many communities, has a problem with illegal drugs, 

most notably heroin and methamphetamine. In the last 15 months, the D.E.A. has 

conducted two operations here; working with the sheriff's office and the Santa 

Cruz Police Department, the agency has caught hundreds of drug dealers and users. 

According to our police chief, "the D.E.A. did an excellent job" in these operations. 

</p>

<P> That was not the case on Sept. 5. The D.E.A. came to town unannounced and 

under cover of darkness.</p>

<P> I'm worried that the agency is going to be coming to other towns, too. Since 

1996, eight other states — Alaska, Washington, Oregon, Nevada, Arizona, Hawaii, 

Colorado and Maine — have passed laws allowing for the use of medical marijuana. 

At the same time, the Department of Justice has made it clear that it opposes 

the use of marijuana under any circumstances. </p>

<P> Clearly, state law and federal law are on a collision course. I would not 

be surprised if there are more raids. </p>

<P> And if there are more raids, more mayors and elected officials will find themselves 

doing what we did here this week: standing with people like the Corrals as they 

deliver medical marijuana to patients who are using the drug on the advice of 

a physician.</p>

<P> The government is fighting a losing battle. In the states where medical marijuana 

has been on the ballot, it has received overwhelming approval from voters. Canada 

and Great Britain recently approved the medical use of marijuana and plan to have 

the government grow and distribute it. </p>

<P> As medical costs skyrocket, medical marijuana is a cost-effective way to treat 

people with chronic pain. Most of all, making medical marijuana available is an 

act of common sense and compassion. The Corrals' collective lost 40 members this 

year; many of them left this world with Ms. Corral holding their hand.</p>

<P> I'm hopeful that this week's events will prompt the federal government to 

begin working with state and local governments to determine how far it can go 

in regulating activity that has been approved by the states and that has negligible 

effects on interstate commerce. There's legislation in Congress, supported by 

a bipartisan coalition, that would allow all states to approve medical marijuana, 

thus eliminating any conflict with federal law. To me, that makes sense. But until 

it passes, I'm standing with the Corrals. </p>
