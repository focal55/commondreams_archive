<p>The fiercest debates about war usually take place after the slaughter has begun, 

and sometimes only when it's over. Vietnam crept up on Kennedy, and then Johnson, 

and even in 1965 when their private deliberations concluded with American military 

intervention, the public argument was nugatory. The mainstream media gave it near-total 

support. Somewhat later, opinion turned, and war fury both ways dominated the 

whole of politics. By then it was too late to save anyone from catastrophe. 

<P>The case of modern Iraq is different. We can see war coming. A better analogy 

is the second world war, which was preceded by epic argument between appeasers 

and warriors here, and then by pro- and anti-war debates in America both before 

and after Pearl Harbor. More telling still is George Bush I's Gulf war against 

Saddam Hussein in 1991. This too had a long build-up. In the course of it, the 

American debate was troubled. Despite the obvious pretext supplied by Saddam's 

invasion of Kuwait, the Senate approved military force by only 52 votes to 47. 

Among those who voted against Operation Desert Storm was Senator Sam Nunn, the 

hard-nosed chairman of the armed services committee. 

<P>George Bush II's Iraq war is being prepared in different circumstances. The 

political build-up is intense and almost unchallenged. There are virtually no 

naysayers in mainstream Washington, though they have plenty of opportunity to 

speak. Last week the US seized on Iraq's rejection of a new team of UN weapons 

inspectors, and with electric speed cast aside Kofi Annan's offer of mediation. 

A detailed battle plan was leaked to the New York Times, evidently by someone 

who thought it wasn't good enough. The momentum towards war is palpable, and to 

anyone who read Bush's speeches since he became a national politician it should 

not be surprising. 

<P>The absence of challenge can also be seen in Europe. The other day Jon Snow 

pressed Tony Blair on this point, and extracted an extraordinary response. Could 

you foresee yourself committing British troops to a ground war in Iraq, Snow asked. 

"I suggest we have that discussion when the decisions are actually about to be 

taken," Blair replied. In other words, when the discussion can influence nothing. 

Blair's suggested timing is precisely wrong. Any serious debate taking place after 

Washington has decided where it's about to go can only be destructive to the alliance. 

The time when a European argument might be useful is now, before the stone is 

set. 

<P>For a start, it would put salutary pressure on the Europeans. European nations 

need to formulate some positions or, ideally, one position. What do they propose 

to do about Saddam? How do they think about his weapons of mass destruction? What 

is their view on the balance between terror and freedom? How do they propose to 

counter the virulent American voices which remark that Europe is simply failing 

to address the threats it faces from terrorist-harboring states? Europe slinks 

silent in the shadows of this crucial discussion. 

<P>But in the absence of any real discussion in America, a more public European 

debate could perform an urgent service to the world. Major European leaders should 

be asking these questions in public places, even if one makes the charitable assumption 

that none of the issues are lost on the American actors. They fall into two categories. 

Might war work? And is it right? 

<P>There's more to hear, for example, about some of the working premises of the 

warriors. Are they banking on Saddam caving in fast, and his armies disintegrating? 

Since Washington is signaling skepticism about either an internal coup or an effective 

local military force of dissidents, the more likely plan envisages some 250,000 

US troops, with Britain and few others possibly alongside. Have they worked out 

the scale of the collateral damage likely in such a big war? "No one can say whether 

a war will last five days, five weeks or five months," the skeptical Nunn said 

in 1991. With a smaller alliance to depend on, and a more tenuous casus belli 

, the question is more urgently worth asking today. 

<P>What, then, of the region? Is it the case that Washington, after paying lip-service 

to a Middle East peace process, will use the failure of its own one-sided approach 

as justification for the real agenda of the Pentagon hawks, who've been thirsting 

to devour Saddam ever since Bush I failed to do so? If Saddam is dethroned but 

not destroyed, what then? How deeply have the consequences of any failure in this 

enterprise been considered? Are such questions inappropriate for mainstream European 

politicians to ask or, instead, an essential contribution from allies who will 

be expected to go along with anything that eventually happens? 

<P> Just as pressing are the issues of justice and proportionality. Even if one 

accepts the contested claim that Saddam has deliverable weapons of mass destruction 

(WMD), how valid are the scenarios that predicate their use? If he can reach Israel, 

why would he dare to try if he knew the entire world would then respond in kind? 

Some say the most convincing explanation of his WMD is, as Tariq Aziz once confided, 

to prepare for revenge against Iran. It seems at least possible that the only 

scenario in which these weapons become a threat to America and her allies is in 

some last-ditch act of desperation as the Iraqi tyrant faces the build-up of an 

invasion army. Is it not time such perversity broke through the wall of acquiescent 

silence, and was coolly evaluated by informed public people in the public realm? 

<P>More largely, how will the envisaged campaign fit into the frame of international 

law? How stale is the thread of old UN resolutions that America - and Britain 

- seem determined not to try to refresh? Where might the unfolding of a long and 

bloody campaign fit into the doctrines of morality? That question could be as 

inflammatory as it was at Suez, among both officers and men. John Major, in his 

autobiography, recalls summoning his Anglican archbishop and Catholic cardinal 

to secure their approval for the Gulf war. They "gave me their public and private 

support", he writes, "and in so doing their reassurance that this would be a just 

war". The same blessing will be far harder to buy in 2003, even if the issues 

have been properly explored beforehand. 

<P>Germany is precluded from such discussion until and perhaps after the September 

election. France, on anything to do with the Middle East, has no credence in Washington. 

But Britain has a position and a special voice, and now is the time to make use 

of them, before these severe anxieties are buried under the juggernaut of a son's 

revenge for what happened to his father. To say that they're only worth discussing 

"when the decisions are actually about to be taken" is to say that everything 

must be left to the leaders. If these then suffer the fate of Lyndon B Johnson, 

booted out of politics for a war the people decided they didn't want, they will 

deserve it.
