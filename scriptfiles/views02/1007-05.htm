<p>As the full imperial dimensions of current administration policy become 

clearer, helped along by the recent promulgation of a new “national 

security” policy that calls explicitly for a new imperialism based on 

military dominance, opposition to the planned war on Iraq is mounting 

across the globe (except in Congress, where the Democratic leadership has 

once again sold out, ignoring the overwhelming message sent by the huge 

grassroots mobilization of recent weeks).



<p>In the context of Iraq, it has become acceptable, even respectable, to say 

that the emperor is aptly garbed for a naked power grab. To this day, 

however, few are willing to criticize the war in Afghanistan. In fact, some 

self-proclaimed spokespeople for the antiwar movement have recently 

suggested that the “left,” which is to say the peace movement, the global 

justice movement, and most of the progressive grassroots activists in the 

country, still handicaps itself by its opposition to that war. The official 

story remains that, whatever has come after, the war on Afghanistan remains 

the one shining success in the “war on terrorism.”



<p>One year later (the bombing started on October 7, 2001), many of the 

results are in, and it’s about time for a critical look at some of those 

“successes.”



<p>The war increased the threat of terrorism. Last fall, those who were 

“prematurely antiwar” predicted that it would. At the time, very few 

agreed; after the sudden collapse of the Taliban and the stories about 

Afghans welcoming their bombers with open arms, almost no one did. More 

recently, the argument has found support from a different quarter: the FBI 

and the CIA. According to the June 16 New York Times, “Classified 

investigations of the Qaeda threat now under way at the FBI and CIA have 

concluded that the war in Afghanistan failed to diminish the threat to the 

United States … Instead, the war might have complicated counterterrorism 

efforts by dispersing potential attackers across a wider geographic area.”



<p>Further, middle-level al-Qaeda operatives used the opportunity to 

strengthen contacts with other Islamist groups in the region, thus 

increasing the pool from which future terrorists will be drawn. The war 

allowed them to draw other Islamist groups, hitherto focused on domestic 

political questions, into the world of terrorist networks committed to 

attacks on the United States. According to one official quoted, “Al Qaeda 

at its core was really a small group, even though thousands of people went 

through their camps. What we're seeing now is a radical international jihad 

that will be a potent force for many years to come.”



<p>And, of course, the war didn’t result in the apprehension of Osama bin 

Laden or others high in the al-Qaeda network, who could possibly have been 

extradited had the United States deigned to offer evidence to the Taliban 

-- according to reports in the British press (Daily Telegraph, October 4, 

2001), an extradition deal had been worked out, only to be quashed at the 

last minute by Pakistan’s dictator Pervez Musharraf, presumably at the 

behest of the White House, which didn’t want to lose its casus belli. So, 

it seems, the war put an end to the best chance of catching those 

high-level leaders.



<p>Many innocents were killed. Initial concerns about civilian casualties were 

generally dismissed amid claims that the bombing of Afghanistan was the 

most restrained and precise in history, Christopher Hitchens even accusing 

U.S. forces of being “pedantic” in their restraint. In fact, as in other 

recent U.S. bombing campaigns, the initial narrow targeting was broadened 

as air defense was destroyed. As the small store of pre-determined targets 

was exhausted, the country was divided into “kill boxes” where pilots were 

to attack “targets of opportunity.” A policy of cavalierly attacking 

military or supposed military targets right in the heart of 

heavily-populated areas was part of the reason that, at a conservative 

estimate by the Project for Defense Alternatives, the Afghanistan war 

killed at least four times as many civilians per bomb as were killed in the 

war on Yugoslavia. Although the difficulties of estimating civilian 

casualties from the bombing are formidable (largely because the U.S. 

government, with its customary indifference to the effects of its wars, 

refuses to do a study), all serious estimates conclude that over 1000 died 

-- recent studies by the Guardian newspaper, reported on May 20, 2002, 

indicate a possibility of up to 8000 actually killed by the bombs.



<p>These concerns quickly gave way to the much graver threat of disruption of 

humanitarian aid. Over 7 million Afghans were directly dependent for 

survival on aid, which was disrupted for September, October and part of 

November first by the threat of bombing and then by the bombing. The 

precipitous collapse of the Taliban in mid-November meant that the United 

States stopped bombing most of the country, so that aid deliveries by 

international organizations were rapidly restored, narrowly averting a 

catastrophe. That disruption did have noticeable effects, which have 

finally been assessed: according to the same Guardian survey, “As many as 

20,000 Afghans may have lost their lives as an indirect consequence of the 

US intervention. They too belong in any tally of the dead.”



<p>The United States installed a puppet regime, throwing democracy out the 

window.  The “loya jirga,” or grand council, that selected the current 

interim government of Afghanitan, was peopled from the start with delegates 

selected by the United States, mostly representatives of the regional 

warlords, with a small sprinkling of Afghan expatriates (mostly from the 

United States) and “technocrats” to give it some aura of respectability. 

Representatives from the 1.5-million-strong Watan Party, successor to the 

PDPA (which ruled Afghanistan until 1992), were not allowed into the jirga.



<p>According to Omar Zakhilwal and Adeena Niazi, delegates to the loya jirga, 

“We delegates were denied anything more than a symbolic role in the 

selection process. A small group of Northern Alliance chieftains decided 

everything behind closed doors.” Since former monarch Zahir Shah, the most 

popular candidate for interim president, was unsuitable for U.S. interests, 

“the entire loya jirga was postponed for almost two days while the former 

king was strong-armed into renouncing any meaningful role in the 

government,” they said. At that point, most delegates, aware that the 

U.S.-backed warlords held all the military power and fearing for their 

lives, silently went along.



<p>Perhaps the high point was the sudden declaration by U.S. special envoy 

Zalmay Khalilzad (former consultant with Unocal) that Zahir Shah was 

stepping down -- something that the octogenarian former king was apparently 

unable to say for himself. After that, the confirmation of the United 

States’s handpicked (likely in October or November 2001) candidate Hamid 

Karzai (former consultant with Unocal) was swift and sure. And any 

lingering doubt about Karzai's freedom of action should have been ended by 

the news that U.S. Special Forces were acting as his praetorian guard.



<p>The U.S. government has shown little concern for the rights of women in 

Afghanistan. Given the Bush administration’s lack of concern for women’s 

rights in the rest of the known world, including the United States, this 

should, of course, be no surprise. But the extent of this indifference is 

striking. Notwithstanding the expressed commitment to building 

infrastructure for women's education and health care, both shamefully 

neglected under the Taliban, the Bush administration has been so stingy as 

to block $134 million in Afghan humanitarian aid, citing domestic economic 

problems (the money is less than 50 cents per American). Of that, $2.5 

million was for the Ministry of Women's Affairs. Ritu Sharma, president of 

the advocacy group Women's Edge, described that $2.5 million, earmarked to 

build women’s centers across Afghanistan, as a “question of life or death 

for the ministry and Afghan women.” So far, the United States has 

contributed a mere $120,000 to it -- about one-tenth the cost of a single 

cruise missile.



<p>The U.S. government has done little to alleviate the extreme humanitarian 

crisis in Afghanistan, let alone to rebuild the country. To take one index, 

U.S. contributions through UNICEF for Afghanistan have been less than a 

third those of Japan -- even though it was the United States that played a 

huge role in creating the crisis, through its decade-long support for 

various mujahedin factions as well as through the bombing campaign last 

fall. At the Tokyo conference on reconstruction of Afghanistan in January 

2002, a mere $4.5 billion was pledged, a derisory $300 million of it from 

the United States -- not nearly enough to address Afghanistan’s needs. 

Driven largely by the perceived lack of concern from the U.S. government, 

donor countries have in fact not even followed through on these minuscule 

pledges. So shamefully negligent has the United States been in fixing its 

mess that today, as winter approaches, 6 million Afghans -- a larger number 

than before Sept. 11, 2001 -- are once again on the brink, dependent on 

humanitarian aid to get through the next months.



<p>On every test of justice and of pragmatism, the war on Afghanistan fails. 

Worse, every one of these aspects, from an increased threat of terrorism to 

large numbers of civilian deaths to installation of a U.S.-controlled 

puppet regime is due to play out again in the war on Iraq. In fact, though 

it has been little noted, the sanctions regime has made Iraqis dependent on 

centralized, government-distributed food to survive and relief agencies 

have already expressed their concerns about the potential for a 

humanitarian crisis once war starts.



<p>We, and the Iraqi people, can do without any more “successes” in the war on 

terrorism.
