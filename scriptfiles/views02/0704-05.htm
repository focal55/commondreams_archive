<p>It's the workers, stupid.

<p> Not the accountants. Not the corrupt corporate chieftains. Not even Martha 

Stewart. You can lock them all up and the bottom line - the bottom line you can 

trust, now and forever - is that the political fix will not trickle down.

<p> The workers of WorldCom, of Enron, of Xerox, of whatever company is next up 

in headline news, cannot be made whole. No paycheck will arrive for laid-off workers 

because some congressional committee tinkers with accounting regulations. Nobody's 

retirement account is replenished with tough talk about corporate crooks. You 

can't pay for gas with that.

<p> "The longer you've been here, the more you lost," said a clerk in the downtown 

Washington office of MCI, the giant long-distance company owned by the humongous 

conglomerate WorldCom, the latest icon of corporate corruption. She'd heard about 

someone at the WorldCom complex in suburban Virginia who'd lost $400,000 on the 

company's stock in his 401(k).

<p> No one in her building seems to have been hit so hard, she said. But then, 

they are too scared to talk much, even to each other. They're barred altogether 

from talking to outsiders.

<p> "They said not to talk, if you want another paycheck," said a legal secretary 

on a cigarette break.

<p> This scandal is not quite so miserable as the Enron mess. There's no evidence 

corporate masters prevented employees from selling their WorldCom stock, even 

as the top guys cashed out. WorldCom did not require employees to hold its shares, 

chief executive John Sidgmore told reporters at a news conference Tuesday. So 

some did, some didn't.

<p> But WorldCom is a New Economy company and that means it wants nothing to do 

with those quaint Old Economy customs, like guaranteed pensions for loyal long-timers. 

In 1999, the company reported $1.12 billion in assets in defined-contribution 

pension plans, according to Nelson Information, a financial reporting company.

<p> These are funded by worker contributions. Pension researchers say America 

reached a milestone about two years ago: Workers now put more of their own money 

into pension funds and retirement savings plans than their employers do.

<p> Most of the WorldCom money was in the 401(k) plan but about a third was in 

an employee stock-ownership plan, according to the 1999 report. That means WorldCom 

stock. It closed yesterday at 22 cents, down from its peak of $64 three years 

ago.

<p> Three years is an interesting time frame. It happens to be the length of time 

the Bush administration believes employers should be allowed to force workers 

to hold company stock if, for example, the stock is awarded as the company "match" 

in a 401(k) account. This was a proposal the White House made after Enron exploded.

<p> No one talks about Enron anymore. Kenny Boy has been upstaged by conniving 

acccountants everywhere. The tearful Enron workers who lost both their jobs and 

their life savings got their day before the cameras, but not their pension legislation.

<p> The House passed a toothless measure that allows workers to get investment 

advice from firms picked by none other than the sponsors of their retirement plans 

- that is, their employers. The administration opposed efforts to limit the amount 

of company stock that can be held in 401(k)s. The Senate passed nothing, because 

of Republican objections and divisions among the Democrats controlling the chamber.

<p> Next week, the Senate is to debate and probably pass a tough-on-accountants-and-corporate-crooks 

bill. Its chief sponsor, Sen. Paul Sarbanes (D-Md.), delivered the Democratic 

response to President George W. Bush's radio address last Saturday.

<p> "Corporate wrongdoing is being felt not just at the boardroom table but at 

the kitchen table as well," Sarbanes said.

<p> But it hurts more in the kitchen than in the conference room. One small way 

to ease the pain is for Congress to pass, and the president to sign, the pension 

protections both promised after Enron but still haven't delivered. </p>
