The destruction in the Jenin refugee camp on the West Bank, in the words of the 

United Nations envoy to the Middle East, is "shocking and horrifying." 

<P>News reports confirm the observations of Terje Roed-Larsen, the U.N. envoy, 

who says that a sustained assault by the Israeli army has left the community devastated 

physically and emotionally. 

<P>"It looks as if an earthquake has hit the heart of the refugee camp here," 

Roed-Larsen told CNN. "I've just been witnessing two brothers digging out of the 

rubble their father and five other family members. I witnessed a family digging 

out their 12-year-old son from beneath the rubble. ... The scene is absolutely 

unbelievable." According to the U.N. envoy, the air is thick with the stench of 

decaying corpses. 

<P>News reports in the European press confirm the view that Jenin is a city of 

destroyed buildings, dead bodies and the walking wounded. Throughout the city, 

according to Britain's Guardian newspaper, people are digging with their hands 

to try and find the bodies of lost loved ones. 

<P>The government of Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, which ordered the destruction 

of Jenin, has been slow to give full access to the camp to aid agencies distributing 

food and water to the remaining residents. This is an indefensible decision on 

the part of the Sharon government, which went ahead with the attack on Jenin even 

after President Bush demanded that Israeli troops withdraw from Palestinian territories 

"without delay." 

<P>Israeli human rights groups and progressive members of the Israeli Knesset 

have joined the U.N. call for opening Jenin to aid groups. They are right to do 

so, and their willingness to publicly oppose the reprehensible actions of Sharon 

should serve as a reminder that a great many Israeli Jews have, even in these 

difficult times, refused to support their prime minister in his unreasonable excesses. 

<P>The United States should side with the Israelis, the Palestinians and the United 

Nations observers who recognize that the people of Jenin must be helped if further 

tragedy is to be prevented. 

<P>The Bush administration should make an emergency authorization of financial 

assistance to groups that are prepared immediately to help the people of Jenin, 

such as the Palestine Red Crescent and the U.N. Relief Agency for Palestine Refugees 

in the Near East. And the president should then demand that Sharon allow the aid 

the United States has provided to get to the people of Jenin. </p>
