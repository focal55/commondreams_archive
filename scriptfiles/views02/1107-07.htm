<p>This should have been the Democrats' year. 

<p>The country is still mired in recession. Polls consistently have shown that 

the Republicans' positions on such basic policy issues as the environment and 

the economy are decidedly unpopular. The connection of top administration officials 

with scandal-plagued corporations provided ample opportunities for a populist 

message against corruption and in support of economic justice. 

<p>Despite this, the Democrats became the first party out of office to lose one 

of the houses of Congress in an off-year election. It was the first time in a 

century that a Republican president saw his party gain seats in an off-year election 

and only the second time since 1934 that a sitting president's party did not lose 

seats in Congress 

<p>Instead of emulating the hugely successful 1994 Republican strategy of aggressively 

challenging the incumbent president and his party's Congressional leadership, 

the Democrats instead decided to work on a consensus-building approach with the 

Republican administration. They even went as far as supporting President George 

W. Bush's demand that he be granted the authority to invade Iraq without the legally-required 

mandate from the United Nations Security Council. In addition, the majority of 

Democrats went on record praising his support for last spring's attacks by Israel's 

right-wing government against civilian areas of the occupied West Bank. The Democrats 

went as far as supporting Republican calls authorizing the use of military force 

to free any citizen of the United States or an allied nation detained for war 

crimes by the United Nations' International Criminal Court in The Hague. 

<p>As a result, many thousands of rank-and-file Democrats, longtime supporters 

of peace and human rights issues, voted for the Green Party or simply did not 

vote. Thousands more voted reluctantly for the Democratic nominee but did not 

put in the volunteer time or campaign contributions they would have otherwise, 

angered that the Democrats had shifted so far to the right. 

<p>It is noteworthy that both incumbent Democratic senators and five out of the 

six Democratic House incumbents who were defeated supported the Iraq war resolution. 

By contrast, no incumbent who opposed the Democratic Congressional leadership's 

support of President Bush's war plans lost, with the exception of Rep. James Maloney 

of Connecticut, who was pitted against a popular moderate female Republican incumbent 

in a redrawn district. 

<p>It is difficult to shift public attention to domestic issues in times of international 

tension. Making a strong case against the Bush administration' s war plans, its 

support for repressive governments and its assaults on well-respected international 

institutions would have almost certainly resulted in a galvanizing of the Democratic 

Party faithful as well as large numbers of independents, insuring a Democratic 

victory. 

<p>The Democratic leadership should have recognized that calls for prescription 

drug benefits for seniors while the nation is concerned about an illegal, unnecessary 

and possibly devastating war simply did not catch the imagination of the voting 

public. 

<p>This was particularly problematic in that the Democrats were unable to explain 

how they intended to pay for such benefits while refusing to reverse recently-enacted 

tax cuts and in authorizing a military campaign that will cost up to $200 billion. 

<p>Hopefully, the Democrats will learn the lesson for Tuesday's devastating defeat 

and decide to replace their discredited leadership with those who have the integrity 

and political smarts to return them to majority status.
