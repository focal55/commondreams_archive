<p>Bill Clinton spoke at Hunter College in New York on 

Tuesday, challenging President Bush to send American 

troops as part of an international peacekeeping force

to the Middle East.  What many Americans don’t know is



that U.S. forces might as well be there already.  



<p>From 1990 to 2000 U.S. military aid to Israel totaled

over $18 billion.  No other nation in the world has

such a close relationship with the U.S. military and

arms industry.



<p>The UN, Amnesty International and other groups have

raised questions about the extent the to which U.S.

military aid is abetting human rights abuses by

Israeli forces operating in the West Bank. These

debates will no doubt continue for some time.  

In the mean time, however, there is another aspect of

the American-Israeli relationship that may have an

even

greater impact on U.S. and Israeli security in the

long run: the ongoing transfer of American arms

technology from Israel to potential U.S. (and Israeli) adversaries around the globe.



<p>From the most sophisticated warplanes

to tank engines, artillery systems and armored

vehicles, the United States is Israel's one-stop

shopping center.  Last year alone the U.S. sold one

hundred top-of-the-line F-16s to Israel for a total of

over $3 billion.  That same year Israel purchased 9 of

the newest Apache helicopter version equipped with the

Longbow Radar system.  The helicopter-buying spree

didn't end with the Apaches.  Israel bought fifteen

Cobra attack helicopters last year along with

twenty-four Black Hawk transport helicopters.    



<p>Besides selling aircraft, the United States is also

Israel's preferred vendor for missiles.  Although

Israel has designed its own version of the U.S.

air-to-air AIM9 sidewinder missile, the Python 3, it

still relies on the U.S. for its ground attack

technology.  Two years ago Lockheed Martin sold Israel approximately 80 AGM-142D Popeye air-to-surface missiles.  Israel also buys the AGM65 Maverick air-to-surface missile produced by Hughes and Raytheon.  



<p>In addition, the U.S. sells Israel the engines for its "indigenous" Merkava main battle tank.  In 1999 Israel purchased 400 power packs for their Merkava fleet. 

The Merkava was developed by Israel so that it

wouldn't have to rely on "fickle" countries like

Britain, France or Russia when it was in the midst of

a conflict.



<p>Transactions between the U.S. and Israel are not

necessarily worrisome by themselves; after all, as

Israel has proved, there are a host of countries

willing to sell the weapons it needs.  Currently,

Germany is Israel's source for submarines, and if

Israel really needed fighters, Russia is always

looking to make a buck and always seems to have a

surfeit of aircraft and other excess defense articles.

      

<p>The real danger comes in Israel's habit of reverse

engineering U.S. technology and selling to nations

hostile to U.S. interests.  Israel's client list

includes Cambodia, Eritrea, Ethiopia, the South

Lebanon Army, India, China, Burma and Zambia.  The

U.S. has most recently warmed up to India and is now

in fact competing with Israel for arms sales there,

but the other Israeli customers remain dubious at

best.  



<p>Perhaps the most troubling of all is the

Israeli/Chinese arms relationship.  Israel is China's

second largest supplier of arms.  Coincidentally, the

newest addition to the Chinese air force, the F-10

multi-role fighter, is an almost identical version of

the Lavi (Lion).  The Lavi was a joint

Israeli-American design based upon the F-16 for

manufacture in Israel, but financed mostly with

American aid.  Plagued by cost overruns, it was

canceled in 1987, but not before the U.S. spent $1.5

billion on the project.



<p>Last April, when the Navy EP-3E surveillance plane was

forced to land in China after a Chinese F-8 fighter

flew into its propeller, photos show Israeli built

Python 3 missiles under the fighter's wings.



<p>If Israeli weapons sales to China induce misgivings,

including the most recent U.S. blocked sale of

Israel's Phalcon airborne radar, the beneficiaries of

Chinese arms transfers of Israeli-American technology

are even more disturbing.  In 1996, as disclosed in

the UN Register of Conventional Arms, China sold over

100 missiles and launchers to Iran, along with a

handful of combat aircraft and warships.  Even worse,

in 1997 the New York Daily News reported that Iraq had

deployed Israeli-developed, Chinese PL-8 missiles in

the no-fly zones, endangering American pilots.  



<p>Americans deserve to know where their money is being

spent, and how money allocated for friends and

technology shared with friends can all too easily end

up in the wrong hands, threatening all parties

involved.  At a minimum, discussions on a new security framework for the Middle East should include plans to monitor and restrict Israeli transfers of U.S.-origin military equipment to potential adversaries. 

Otherwise, this deadly technology could come back to

haunt U.S. and Israeli forces in future conflicts.
