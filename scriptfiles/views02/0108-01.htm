As George W. Bush heads into the congressional campaign season he faces the







first major election test of his presidency. This fall is the Democrats' 



first post-2000 test, as well. Bush plans to hit the campaign trail soon in a



bid 



to return the Republican Party to full control of Congress. What do



Democrats 



plan? 



<p>



A year ago this week, fourteen representatives led by the Congressional



Black 



Caucus, stood up and objected to the formal registration of the 2000 



Electoral College vote. One after the other they rose in opposition to the 



rubber-stamping of an election result that required the throwing out of more







than 175,000 disproportionately African-American and overwhelmingly



Democratic 



Florida votes. 

<p>Al Gore -- in his position as president of the Senate -- 



ruled the fourteen out of order. House rules require a signature from a 



senator and no senator was willing to join the CBC's protest. (Incidentally,



there are no 



Black senators in the U.S. Senate.) The election was over and done with, but



electoral reform topped the Democrats list of priorities, the Gore/Liberman



team told the 



public.



<p>



On the anniversary of the Supreme Court decision in Bush vs. Gore, the House







by a 363 to 63 passed a bill that was widely hailed in the press as 



"Election Overhaul." "House Approves Election Overhaul," read the Washington







Post headline (12-13-01). The Ney-Hoyer bill (hammered out by 



Republican Robert Ney (Ohio) and Democrat Steny Hoyer (Md.) would appropriate 



funds for upgrading voting machines and replacing punch-ballots if counties 



were so inclined. 



<p>



"It's less than what we'd like it to be, but it's headed in the right 



direction," Congressional Black Caucus Chair, Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-Tex.) 



told Working Assets Radio Monday. Good enough -- but an "overhaul" it is not.



<p>



"Nothing has changed. Absolutely nothing," Bob Fertik of Democrats.com told 



Working Assets. "175,000 votes in Florida were never counted [in 2000.] Nationally, 6



million 



were not counted. What's changed is that the House passed a very weak bill 



that has not passed the Senate and even if it did pass, it wouldn't change 



anything," said Fertik. The bill offers money to counties to upgrade, but it







doesn't make upgrading mandatory. 



<p>



"There are plenty of counties out there that have no inclination to make any







change and there's nothing in the law that would make them," Fertik



concluded.



<p>



Any suggestion that Congress should finally create a fair voting system in 



the United States is certainly no more advanced than it was a year ago. To 



quote from an <a href="http://www.workingforchange.com/article.cfm?ItemID=10383" target="new">essay of December 2000</a>: 







"While African Americans in huge numbers know there was massive voter fraud,







harassment and intimidation a la Jim Crow, the Democratic Party's white 



top-dogs have resolutely refused to talk about voting rights, race or



racism. Why? For fear it will hurt them in the court of public opinion?



Among white 



swing voters and southern Democrats? Already hurting in all of those places,







they're trifling with one of the few solid voting blocks they've got left 



(Blacks, Latinos, Jews).



<p>



"The conditions are ripe for a pro-democracy movement," I wrote a year ago. "A moment, at least: this is  



it."



<p>



Last year's voter protests built a multi-racial coalition that advocated a 



nonpartisan election commission, standardized voting procedures and federal 



enforcement of the Voting Rights Act. Some cranked up their demands for 



instant-runoff voting or some form of proportional representation, so that 



small parties (and minority constituencies) could build support for their 



issues without throwing elections to their foes. Since then some voting 



machines have changed, but where's the justice movement? 

<p>Is your passion for







democracy, like the CBC's was in January 2000, running hot? Or not? If the 



latter -- what do you think -- is cool as a Senatorial cucumber any way to



be 



a Democrat?
