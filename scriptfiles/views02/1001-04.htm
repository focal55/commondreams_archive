<p>We are approaching a big moment in American politics, but not for any of the 

reasons you might imagine, or are likely to have read about. Coming up is the 

first Monday in October, the start of the new term in the supreme court. 

<P>The nine justices met informally yesterday. Today or tomorrow they are expected 

to announce which cases they consider worthy of their winter-time attention. Do 

they fancy White v South Carolina, perhaps, in which Bill Clinton's legal pursuer, 

Ken Starr, is defending a tattooist, a practice banned under state law? Or Oakley 

v Wisconsin, which covers whether a state has the right to ban someone from having 

children as a condition of probation? They will definitely have to consider executions 

again, and California's patented three-strikes-and-you're-locked-up-for-25-years 

rule.

<P>The judges will be sitting down as old colleagues, if not necessarily as friends. 

For the ninth successive year, the court's make-up is unchanged, an unprecedented 

run of stability and non-mortality. The tension is becoming overwhelming; sooner 

or later they have to start dying. And then all hell is going to break loose. 

<P>There are three prongs to the US government, remember. Because the executive 

(i.e. the president) dominates the attention of the addled media, the legislature 

and, especially, the judiciary get forgotten. Yet by far the most vituperative 

disputes between White House and Congress of the past year have concerned the 

appointment of judges. Republicans blame the Democrats for jeopardizing the judicial 

system by holding up appointments; Democrats say the other lot started it under 

Clinton, when the choices were less provocative. Actually, the arguments probably 

started in George Washington's administration, but they have rarely been this 

rancorous. 

<P>Supreme court vacancies come up infrequently, but the administration has to 

fill hundreds of more routine vacancies in other courts. The process is always 

overtly political. Still, the Bush administration, despite its own flawed mandate 

and all his pre-election talk of "compassionate conservatism", does seem peculiarly 

blatant in pushing its own partisans, sometimes extreme ones.

<P>The Democrat-controlled Senate judiciary committee has held up many appointments 

and thrown out two, voting 10-nine on party lines. At least five more are in doubt. 

If the Democrats lose their Senate majority in the mid-term elections next month, 

all these nominations are likely to go through. And the gates will be open for 

Bush to make the supreme court appointment he wants. Stand by for someone (preferably, 

for political reasons, a Hispanic someone) combining the qualities of Judges Jeffreys, 

Roy Bean ("Hang 'em first, try 'em later") and Melford Stevenson. 

<P>The court is already split ideologically. This manifested itself most ignobly 

in December 2000 when, by an astonishing coincidence, the court's five Republican-leaning 

judges thought Florida's electoral laws required that George Bush should be declared 

as president, and the four Democratic-leaning judges thought they did not. 

<P>But the ideological divide exists on a more intellectual plain too, displayed 

in the split between two of the judges, Antonin Scalia and Stephen Breyer. Scalia 

is the leader of the rightwing in the court, a man whose reading of the constitution 

is rooted firmly in the 18th century. As he says: "The constitution that I interpret 

and apply is not living but dead." 

<P>It is not an unfamiliar view in a country of biblical fundamentalists; it is 

slightly surprising to find the judicial mindset that allowed the US to have first 

slavery, and then segregation, still at the very heart of government. Even Breyer, 

who talks of purpose and context when interpreting the law, is hardly an out-and-out 

liberal: he has usually voted to reject appeals against the death penalty, even 

if he does sound angst-ridden about it. 

<P>In any case, there is no doubt which way this argument is going. Scalia is 

possibly the next chief justice. If Bush stays in office until 2009, he is going 

to skew the court so far to the right it would take decades to unravel. Long after 

the president might have been forgotten, his appointees would be influencing American 

law. 

<P>Supreme court judges often thwart the intentions of their political patrons 

by turning out other than expected. Bush is likely to appoint people whose views 

will be so far off and up the wall that no mistake will be possible. 

<P>It could be enough to ensure a continuation of his worldview until Doomsday. 

It is not just a matter of tattooists in South Carolina. It will show itself in 

cases about capital punishment, corporate responsibility, gun control, you name 

it. Watch carefully. </i>
