As protests against corporate globalization resume following the trauma of September 

11, it may be helpful to reflect again on the role of nonviolence in the global 

justice movement. The violence that led to one death and hundreds of injuries 

in Genoa last July prompted a great deal of soul-searching within the movement. 

Even before Genoa, many global justice activists were beginning to question the 

vandalism and streetfighting tactics that have emerged at globalization protests. 

The battles that erupted in Seattle, Prague, Quebec and other cities have frightened 

away potential supporters and tarnished the movement's image, eroding the good 

will that is crucial to political success. The answer to this dilemma, an increasing 

number of activists recognize, is a return to Gandhian principles, and an unequivocal 

commitment to nonviolent discipline as the key to effective social action. 

<p> Some activists believe that nonviolent methods are too weak, that more militant 

forms of disruption are needed to bring about social change. They are right to 

emphasize the importance of disruption. During the civil rights movement and other 

historical campaigns for justice, disruptive tactics were crucial to political 

effectiveness. Sociologist William Gamson called this phenomenon the "success 

of the unruly." But disruption does not necessarily mean violence. In Seattle, 

Quebec and other cities, street lockdowns effectively blockaded key intersections. 

Groups of civil resisters occupied major crossroads, immobilizing themselves and 

refusing to leave. They courageously held their ground in the face of police attack 

and managed to remain in the streets long enough to disrupt official proceedings. 

These effective disruptive actions had nothing to do with the trashing of stores 

and the throwing of bricks and firebombs. </p>

<p> The belief that nonviolence is meek or ineffective reflects a misunderstanding 

of the rich tradition of nonviolent resistance. In recent decades the Gandhian 

method has achieved worldwide success. In the United States nonviolent action 

helped to achieve historic gains for African-Americans, farmworkers and women. 

Nonviolent methods brought down the Marcos regime in the Philippines, undermined 

Communist dictatorships in Eastern Europe and helped to end apartheid in South 

Africa. In Serbia trained nonviolent resisters helped to overthrow the Milosevic 

regime. The power of nonviolence is real, and has proven to be far more effective 

as a method of social change than the resort to violence and destruction. </p>

<p> The effectiveness of social protest depends on attracting the support of third 

parties. As one participant in the Quebec demonstrations put it, "The movement 

is about winning the hearts and minds of the tens of millions of working families 

who must be persuaded to support necessary political change." When nonviolent 

activists display a willingness to sacrifice and remain dignified and disciplined 

in the face of repression, they are often able to win sympathy and political support 

from bystanders. This is what nonviolence activist Barbara Deming called the "genius" 

of nonviolence, what farm labor leader Cesar Chavez termed its "chemistry"--the 

ability of dignified suffering to attract sympathy and political support. Violence, 

by contrast, turns off potential supporters and pushes third parties toward the 

sidelines or the other side. Streetfighting tactics jeopardize the moral integrity 

and political legitimacy that are necessary for political success. </p>

<p> The contrast between the anarchical images of vandalism in Seattle and Genoa 

and the dignified demeanor of civil rights demonstrators forty years before is 

striking. Students in Nashville in 1960 sat at lunch counters wearing dresses 

and suits, strictly nonviolent despite the blows and curses of racist thugs. Careful 

training and nonviolent discipline enabled them to withstand attack without retaliation. 

The civil rights protesters captured and maintained the moral high ground, and 

preserved their ascendancy over the segregationists who attacked them. By contrast, 

the actions of some demonstrators in Seattle and Genoa blurred the distinction 

between the movement and its repressive adversaries. Destructive acts created 

negative media images and provided an excuse for even harsher repression. </p>

<p> Activists have complained about the biased media coverage they received in 

Genoa and other cities, but such bias should come as no surprise. As Noam Chomsky 

reminds us, the major news organizations reflect the interests of the powerful 

corporations that own them. They rarely portray social movements fairly or accurately. 

The media are inevitably attracted to controversy and mayhem. If a hundred people 

are sitting in peacefully at a street corner while five are smashing windows nearby, 

the cameras will cover the latter. Vandalism and streetfighting divert attention 

from the movement's underlying message of concern for the poor and the environment. 

The image conveyed is of lawless rampaging rather than a commitment to global 

justice. This diminishes rather than increases support for the movement's goals. 

</p>

<p> Globalization activists face hard choices now as they contemplate the future 

of the movement. Many have called for a greater commitment to nonviolence. The 

Mobilization for Global Justice, one of the leading US groups in the antiglobalization 

movement, issued a "visions for action" declaration last August stating: "We envision 

a nonviolent world; we will use means consistent with this vision." But the mobilization 

statement also said: "These are not philosophical or political requirements or 

judgments; there are many ways to resist corporate globalization." This phrasing 

reflects a rather tepid commitment to nonviolence and suggests a tolerance for 

destructive tactics that seems contrary to the declared goal of upholding nonviolence. 

Within the global justice movement as a whole, there has been a reluctance to 

mount more concerted efforts to disown vandalism and streetfighting. It's impossible 

to control the actions of everyone who participates in a demonstration, of course, 

but more vigorous efforts to insure nonviolence and prevent destructive behavior 

are possible and necessary. A 95 percent commitment to nonviolence is not enough. 

The discipline must be total if the political benefits of the nonviolent method 

are to be realized. </p>

<p> The first essential step, according to nonviolence trainer George Lakey, is 

to "fully commit to strategic nonviolent action explicitly." Movement leaders 

must insist upon a strict code of conduct among those who participate in global 

justice protests. Last summer an ad hoc group of US-based activists proposed a 

Nonviolent Declaration that would specifically renounce all forms of violence. 

The proposed declaration pledges that "we will not harm people or property" and 

will "treat everyone with goodwill and respect." Supporting such a nonviolent 

declaration does not mean abandoning civil disobedience or urban lockdown tactics. 

On the contrary, these and other forms of disruptive nonviolence can and should 

be encouraged. But attacks against the police are unacceptable under any circumstances 

and must be actively opposed. </p>

<p> The question of property damage is more ambiguous. Some forms of damage, such 

as hammering the nose cones of nuclear missiles, may be morally appropriate if 

conducted in a Gandhian spirit of respect for the adversary. Deming wrote of the 

need at times to "shock" people but at the same time to provide reassurance against 

harm and to act in ways that encourage more and more people to join us. This is 

a far cry from the hit-and-run tactics and random trashing of cars and stores 

that have marred globalization protests. The indiscriminate vandalism that occurred 

in Genoa and other cities should have no place in a movement that espouses global 

justice. </p>

<p> The choice of nonviolence should not be left to chance. It must be integrated 

into every element of the global justice movement. It should be publicly proclaimed 

as the movement's guiding principle and method. The legitimate search for assertive 

and disruptive methods can and should proceed, but this must not be confused with 

vandalism and violence. The most radical and effective forms of social action 

are those that heighten the contrast between the just demands of the global justice 

movement and the brutal actions of the police. Only by preserving nonviolent discipline 

can the movement occupy and hold the moral high ground and win political support 

for necessary social change.</p>
