<p>I'm tracking a new phenomenon called "scandal fatigue." It sets in when the 

corporate crime rate gets too high and the numbers being bandied about become 

too boggling to get your mind around. 

<p> For instance, I was plenty angry when WorldCom announced that it had misstated 

its earnings by $3.7 billion. I couldn't really get a handle on what a figure 

like that meant -- but I knew it was a pantload. Then they looked through the 

books again and realized that, oops, the amount was actually $7 billion. Was I 

supposed to be twice as ticked off? Or were there just too many zeros to grasp? 

<p> The reason our eyes start to glaze over at a certain point is that we lack 

what T.S. Eliot called "an objective correlative" -- a way of relating to something 

as abstract and conceptual as a seven followed by nine zeros. 

<p> With that in mind, I've done a little research in an effort to offer up some 

perspective on the magnitude of these crimes. My hope is that when you see a number 

like $100 million -- the amount Jeff Skilling pocketed from Enron before abandoning 

the sinking ship -- expressed not in dollars but in terms we can all identify 

with, your outrage meter will be set to the proper scale. 

<p> Here goes. 

<p> The total amount of sweetheart insider loans doled out to John Rigas (Adelphia), 

Bernie Ebbers (WorldCom), Stephen Hilbert (Conseco), Dennis Kozlowski (Tyco) and 

Ken Lay (Enron) was $3.9 billion. 

<p> With $3.9 billion, you could: 

<p> -- Fund Habitat for Humanity to build 83,691 homes at a cost of $46,600 each 

for America's homeless. 

<p> -- Send 35,583 poor but deserving students to Harvard Business School. 

<p> -- Buy 390 million tickets to see "Austin Powers in Goldmember." Or one medium 

popcorn and soda. 

<p> -- Loan United Airlines the $1.8 billion it says it needs to avoid bankruptcy 

-- twice. Or you could just flush the money down the toilet. The results will 

be the same. 

<p> -- Foot the bill for you and the 195 members of your high school class you 

really liked to ride a Russian rocket into space. The downside is two of you will 

have to sit next to 'N Sync's Lance Bass. 

<p> -- Finance 39 equally priced sequels to Eddie Murphy's $100 million flop, 

"Pluto Nash." You could ... but please don't. 

<p> -- Buy every WorldCom shareholder a Xerox copier, some aspirin from Rite Aid, 

a year of long-distance service from Qwest, and a share of Enron stock (suitable 

for framing). 

<p> -- Fund the SEC's new, greatly increased, annual budget for five years. 

<p> Still having a little trouble with the figures? Well, consider this: According 

to Fortune magazine, the total amount of money raked in by corporate executives 

selling company stock even while their companies crashed and burned was roughly 

$66 billion. 

<p> With $66 billion, you could: 

<p> -- Fund the annual budget of the FBI, corporate crime-fighting included, for 

16 years. 

<p> -- Give 74 times what America currently gives in foreign aid to all of sub-Saharan 

Africa. 

<p> -- Cover the entire $25 billion America has spent fighting the war against 

terrorism in Afghanistan. And still have enough left over to give every Afghan 

more than two times their average yearly income. 

<p> -- Spend 132 million nights with Julia Roberts at the nightly rate she charged 

as the hooker in Pretty Woman. 

<p> -- Buy 3.3 billion copies of "Who Moved My Cheese?" But even if you read each 

and every one, you still couldn't explain why it's been a best seller for over 

two years. 

<p> -- Pay President Bush's $400,000 salary for 165,000 years. Although, if he's 

anything like his dad, you'll only be on the hook until 2004. 

<p> -- Pay the $1.08 million sales tax on Dennis Kozlowski's artwork and still 

have $65.99 billion left to buy every masterpiece in the Metropolitan Museum of 

Art's Impressionist collection at its assessed value. 

<p> I imagine your blood is really boiling now. But maybe still not enough to 

take action. Then try these numbers on for size: 

<p> The total loss in market value of WorldCom, Tyco, Qwest, Enron and Global 

Crossing was $427 billion. 

<p> With $427 billion, you could: 

<p> -- Fund the United Nations for the next 263 years and still have $164 billion 

left over for unforeseen famine relief and peacekeeping missions. 

<p> -- Get Argentina back on its feet by paying off its external debt three times 

over. 

<p> -- Give $356 to every man, woman and child on the planet living in poverty. 

<p> -- Build and deploy 2,702 comet-hunting Contour satellites. The cost to track 

them down is extra. 

<p> -- Buy 61 billion packs of cigarettes, now $7 each in New York City. Or you 

could transplant the lungs of 1.7 million patients -- at $250,000 each -- suffering 

from irreversible emphysema. 

<p> -- Order 34 billion prime cut filet mignons from Omaha Steaks. Baked potato 

not included. 

<p> -- Pay the combined salaries of every player in baseball for the next 237 

years. Although I don't know why you would. Despite your generosity, they'd still 

disappoint you and go on strike. </i></p>
