As the father of two young girls, I have a personal stake in women's issues - one big reason why I look forward to the month of March - Women's History Month.

<p>

You can argue about feminism but there's no denying that the male species has a huge problem with violence - a problem that has brought us to the brink of collective annihilation, living as we do under the threat of man-made weapons of mass destruction.

<p>

And I tremble to think my <IMG align=left hspace=14 vspace=14 SRC=images/seanlogo.jpg WIDTH=94 HEIGHT=124 BORDER=0>daughters will one day learn that the biggest danger to American women (and children) are not turban-wearing terrorists but abusive domestic partners living in a nation that prides itself on being the pinnacle of human civilization.

<p>

You'd think after several millennia of what has been essentially a male monopoly of violence begetting more violence, we'd pursue alternatives with the same vigor we've brought to the science of killing. Instead - if the president and all his men are any indication - it appears our motto is: if it didn't work last century, or the century before that, well, by all means, let's do it again next century, too!

<p>

Gender politics aside, the scourge of violence infecting the planet today comes from not cultivating feminine attributes, like nonviolent courage in both men and women, especially in our "macho" leaders.

<p>

Chicago-based peace activist Kathy Kelley is a woman who fights nonviolently to counter the "macho" war mindset. And for that, I salute her during this month of celebrating womanity.

<p>

When Kelley traveled to Iraq in 1998 to smuggle medicine into that beleaguered nation, having already made dozens of similar trips as co-coordinator of Voices in the Wilderness (www.vitw.org), she was struck by the reluctance of Western journalists to report on the massive suffering of the Iraqi people under the U.S.-led sanctions.

<p>

"Children are dying in Iraq of eminently treatable (water-borne) diseases...in a country whose advanced health-care system was so developed before the sanctions regime...that the most important problem faced by Iraqi pediatricians was childhood obesity," reports Denis Halliday, former U.N. assistant secretary general, who resigned his post in 1998 to protest the sanctions.

<p>

Kelley recalls asking "a cameraman from a major U.S. news network why he came to the entrance of Fallujah General Hospital to film us, but opted not to enter the hospital."

<p>

He shrugged and said: "Both sides use the children suffering."

<p>

So, "while political games are played, the children are dying... . If people across the U.S. could see what we've seen - the crisis of child sacrifice and child slaughter - we believe hearts would be touched. Sanctions would not withstand the light of day," the Nobel-prize nominee says, explaining why she's committed to shedding light on the sanctions' effects.

<p>

The approximately 500,000 children under the age of 5 who have died as a direct result of the 11-year-old embargo far surpasses the number of people who have been killed by all the world's weapons of mass destruction put together. The cruel irony here is that the sanctions have become a weapon of mass destruction, embittering an entire generation of Iraqis while strengthening Hussein's iron-fisted rule.

<p>

After Kelley's 1998 trip to Iraq, VitW received a pre-penalty notice from the Treasury Department, threatening a $160,000 fine for violating "the regulations and underlying statues and Executive Orders" prohibiting "exportation of donated goods, including medical supplies and toys, to Iraq absent specific prior authorization."

<p>

While many Americans have been conditioned to visualize Saddam when they think of Iraq, Kelley thinks of Iraqis like Umm Reyda, "a mother who lost nine of her family members when, on Feb. 12, 1991, two astonishingly smart bombs blasted the Ameriyah Community Center."

<p>

The bombs hit. "The exits were sealed off... . The pipes overhead burst with boiling water cascading down on the innocents who slept. Hundreds of people were incinerated," Kelley laments.

<p>

Still, Umm Reyda greeted VitW delegations with: "We know that you are not your government and that your people would never choose to do this to us."

<p>

Last week, Kelley told me she "can understand that when situations are complex, people are vulnerable to oversimplify. But by personifying the whole country as one person (Saddam), we take away our own ability to find a way to form bonds of compassion and understanding with ordinary people in Iraq, who love their children just as much as we love ours."

<p>

If we started paying better attention to the work of women like Kathy Kelley, we'd significantly reduce the number of possible future "terrorists" with a grudge against America, making the world left for our children a better, less violent place.

<p>

Meanwhile, the Bush administration is contemplating making Iraq the next target in the "war on terrorism."
