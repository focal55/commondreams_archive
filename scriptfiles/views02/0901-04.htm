<p>AMERICA LONG ago lost the war of world public opinion on Iraq. Hundreds of 

thousands of babies dying and millions of civilians suffering under economic sanctions 

saw to that, notwithstanding the argument that it's all Saddam Hussein's fault. 

<P></P>So botched has the American policy on Iraq been that, as hard as it is to admit, this two-bit dictator has outwitted not one but two presidents of the United States, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush.<P></P>With the rising buzz about a war against Iraq, American credibility is taking a beating, as Washington keeps shifting the reasons for "regime change" in Baghdad: <li></li>Saddam's supposed buildup of biological, chemical and, especially, nuclear weapons. <li></li>His unproven links to terrorists. <li></li>His proven dodging of United Nations weapons inspectors. <li></li>The failure of the inspectors to reach conclusions more acceptable to Washington. <li></li>The danger Saddam poses his own people (even if America has never cared for them), and to nations, including — the two latest additions — the United States, <i>a la </i>the Sept. 11 terrorists, and Iran (which he did attack once but with full American complicity, and which the U.S. itself now brands as evil). Any combination of all the above.<P></P>The American case for war has been so imprecise and propagandistic that it has convinced no allies in the Middle East, bar Israel, or Europe. Britain's Tony Blair faces a caucus revolt should he ignore majority public opinion and join the war. Canada, too, has begged off.<P></P>There is growing opposition within Republican ranks, and audible grumbling in the Pentagon.<P></P>Yet the Bush administration is plowing ahead, leaving itself no exit strategy out of its rhetorical bombast. It is hard to see how it can now <i>not</i> go to war.<P></P>It is counting on congressional patriotism to rubber-stamp a war already underway. It is hoping that at least some of the reluctant allies will join when the action begins.<P></P>America can do what it wants where it wants; so absolute is its military and economic supremacy. But even a solo superpower must pay a political price for unilateralism, arrogance and bullying; in lost friends, isolation and a corrosive erosion in the veracity of its word.<P></P>Even as sound an American position as forcing Saddam into giving international weapons inspectors "unfettered and unconditional access" is no longer seen as an attempt at avoiding war, only a trick to create a <i>casus </i><i>belli </i>to launch one.<P></P>Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder — making the American "adventure" in Iraq a campaign issue in the Sept. 22 German election, an unusual development — took the even more unusual step this past week of accusing Vice-President Dick Cheney of playing games with the issue.<P></P>So did French President Jacques Chirac. As did the Saudis, not normally given to public disagreement.<P></P>Announcing that neither they, nor even the Kuwaitis, feel any immediate threat from Saddam, the Saudis have refused permission for the use of the American air base near Riyadh for a war against Iraq.<P></P>"The rhetoric about using force is way ahead of policy," declared their spokesman, even as Bush was hosting at his Texas ranch Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the Saudi ambassador, to patch up frayed relations. <P></P>"There's a process underway with the U.N. to bring the inspectors back in. If it is successful, we can achieve our objectives without firing a single bullet or losing a single life."<P></P>Notice how the possible loss of Iraqi lives has been entirely missing from the administration's public deliberations and also from the media talkfest about how many planes and missiles may be deployed and how much of their payload dropped on Iraq to get the job done. <P></P>Arab governments fear the prospect of innocent Iraqis — hurting for a decade under sanctions and the radioactive wastes of the 1991 Gulf War bombs — yet again becoming collateral damage, especially at the hands of America which has turned a blind eye to the deaths of another group of Arabs, the Palestinians.<P></P>Part of the panic in Egypt and elsewhere springs from instincts of self-preservation. Inflamed publics can turn against their own undemocratic and impotent regimes. <P></P>Saudi Arabia may also be worried over speculation that the Bush administration — awash in oilmen — is out to conquer Iraq to get access to its oil, a tenth of the world's known reserves, thereby also reducing dependency on Saudi crude.<P></P>But Arab worries go deeper. <P></P>Will Saddam fire Scuds at them or at Israel in retaliation? Will Israel sit out Gulf War II, as it did the first? Ariel Sharon has said he may not.<P></P> Will America stay around post-Saddam to divvy up the spoils between the ruling Ba'athists and the minority Kurds and Shi'ites, rather than abandoning the latter two as it did after Gulf War I? Post-Taliban Afghanistan does not offer an encouraging precedent, either.<P></P>Arabs are not the only ones asking such questions.<P></P> Countries from Canada through Europe to Asia are deeply worried over the implications of America so flagrantly violating international law and undermining the United Nations.<P></P> At issue is not appeasement of a rogue state and its dictator who ought to have been toppled years ago, as long argued in this space. <P></P>

Rather it is this: Should we be resorting to rogue tactics to do so?
