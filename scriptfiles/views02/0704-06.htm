<p>PARIS</b> </a> -- The Fourth of July was once, from the American boy's point 

of view, right behind Christmas as the very best holiday of the whole year.

<p>Why? Because of the noise and danger. Still in bed, you heard random bangs 

in the neighborhood. They went on until dusk, when fathers set up Roman candles 

and nailed Catherine wheels to trees in the front yard, lighting thrilling displays 

that children rushed to from up and down the street.

<p>But the wowsers are always among us in America and helped by the annual casualty 

rate - fingers gone here and there, the occasional eye - they managed to stamp 

out all of that. Fireworks were handed over to responsible adults in locations 

like town stadiums, where the volume of the noise increased but the joy and danger 

were removed.

<p>After that, businessmen who don't like floating holidays lobbied legislators 

to turn what began as patriotic exuberance into a weekend featuring Fourth of 

July sales. The patriotism went out of the holiday, and the United States became 

a drabber place.

<p>At this point the columnist must get down to his real subject, which is the 

question of what has happened to that American patriotism. Once confident and 

jubilant, now it is defensive, lugubrious and seriously paranoid.

<p>The paranoia has been on display all week as Washington has done its best to 

break the international consensus supporting the International Criminal Court 

on war crimes that came into existence Monday. This campaign started in the Pentagon 

and Congress during the Clinton administration, which initially had supported 

the treaty. It turned into a crusade when President George W. Bush took office.

<p>Its intensity is hard to account for in rational terms, since the probability 

that any American acting in an official capacity would come before the court is 

slight. It is well insulated against malicious political exploitation, and only 

individuals, not governments, are subject to indictment.

<p>Washington nonetheless threatened this week to wreck the United Nations peacekeeping 

apparatus if Americans were not exempted from the court's jurisdiction. It has 

vetoed renewal of the UN peacekeeping mission in Bosnia and bluffed that it would 

block UN peacekeeping overall.

<p>To do the latter would either terminate or remove from American influence the 

UN peacekeepers in southern Lebanon, allowing Hezbollah to reoccupy the Israeli 

border.

<p>Ending the UN mission in Bosnia would not automatically affect the larger peacekeeping 

force there, set up under NATO authority. Washington could veto the UN-linked 

NATO role in both Bosnia and Kosovo, at the price of a crisis with its NATO allies, 

who would probably continue under European Union rather than NATO authority. However, 

that would mean curtains for NATO (which some hard-liners in Washington might 

not regret).

<p>The legal approach to war crimes and genocidal acts can be questioned on grounds 

of practicality. Making those responsible for such crimes subject to international 

arrest does not necessarily solve problems. In some circumstances it can make 

things worse.

<p>However, most of Washington's democratic allies believe the court is an important 

advance in building a system of international law that already has been a valuable 

asset in dealing with conflicts that might otherwise have ended in war.

<p>The historical American response to international disorder has been to strengthen 

and extend international law - the country's policy from the first Theodore Roosevelt 

government to the second Clinton administration.

<p>The contrary policy of the Pentagon, Congress and the Bush administration seems 

motivated by fear, but fear of what? Of America's allies themselves? I suppose, 

in a sense, that is partly the case.

<p>The administration's implicit demand is for a totally free hand in acting internationally. 

To put it in other language, it wants a grant of unaccountable power. No one is 

going to agree to that.

<p>Fear has been the principal theme, and the justification offered, for administration 

policies and public statements since Sept. 11. A different America would have 

scorned such fear.

<p>Indeed, a different America did. Confronting the power of the British Empire, 

nearing its peak in 1776, the American Declaration of Independence was an act 

of calm defiance. The war it provoked could easily have ended with the declaration's 

signers shot, hanged or in prison. That is why they concluded their Declaration 

with their mutual pledge of &quot;our lives, fortunes and sacred Honor.&quot;

<p>Their courage and the nobility of their sentiments were what we really were 

celebrating with those fireworks, many years ago.
