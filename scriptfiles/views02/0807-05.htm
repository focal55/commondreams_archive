<p>Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill's trip

to Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay has brought

some needed attention to the financial and

economic crises there. But there is one country

where the US is playing an enormous -- and

thoroughly destructive -- role that has been left

out of the picture: Venezuela.



         <p>Last April the Bush Administration sent

a powerful message not only to Venezuelans but

to all of our Southern neighbors: if we don't like

the presidents you elect, we will use our muscle

to get rid of them. By any means necessary.

That is what was understood when the

Administration endorsed the attempted military

coup on April 11 against the elected president of

Venezuela. (The White House later justified its

response by saying it thought that President

Hugo Chavez had "resigned;" but nobody south

of the Rio Grande was fooled).



         <p>Now we will see whether the

Democratic-led US Senate will object to this

1950s-style foreign policy.



         <p>On May 3, Senator Christopher J. Dodd

of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee

requested an investigation from the US State

Department, to find out what it did wrong in

Venezuela. What he got was a complete

whitewash -- which was turned over to the

Senate last week.



         <p>The State's Department's supposedly

independent Office of the Inspector General

didn't even interview a single Venezuelan, but

relied on US embassy officials and others who

had a direct career interest in covering up what

happened. This is comparable to investigating

Enron by talking to Ken Lay and Andrew

Fastow.



         <p>Significant parts of the report remain

classified -- most tellingly, a section entitled

"Miscellaneous Issues Raised by the News

Media in Venezuela or the United States." Just

what issues raised by the Venezuelan and U.S.

news media are our State Department trying to

keep away from the public discussion?



         <p>Of course they can't hide what the press

has already printed. The Washington Post and

New York Times cited numerous meetings

between top US officials and the people who led

the military coup on April 11. The European

press was even more explicit about these

meetings: "The coup was discussed in some

detail, right down to its timing and chances of

success, which were deemed to be excellent,"

reported the Observer of London, citing sources

at the Organization of the American States.



         <p>There were dozens of such leads in the

press that the State Department could have

investigated. But they chose not to do so; or if

they did, they have apparently withheld the

results from the public.



        <p> Some of the report's admissions are even

more damning than the omissions. Listing the

reasons for US hostility to President Chavez, the

report notes "his involvement in the affairs of

the Venezuelan oil company, and the potential

impact of that on oil prices." There you have it:

the number one reason for the US State

Department supporting a military coup against a

democratically elected president. He had the

nerve to get involved in deciding how much oil

Venezuela should produce, instead of leaving

these decisions to Washington! And people

wonder why anti-US sentiment is rising in Latin

America.



         <p>Even more importantly, the report

admits that US officials did little or nothing to

warn the coup leaders that the United States

would impose sanctions on a government that

was installed by military force. This means that

all the admonishments from the US embassy

about not supporting a coup -- while

Washington was funneling millions of dollars to

pro-coup organizations -- were a mere

formality. The real message was a big green

light.



         <p>The anti-democratic Venezuelan

opposition will continue to understand that

message, until there is an explicit statement

from the Bush Administration that a coup would

result in a cut-off of economic and diplomatic

relations with the United States.



        <p> The Senate should demand exactly such

a statement, and conduct a real investigation in

place of the State Department's cover-up.

Anything less would tell the world that our

Congress -- not just the Bush Administration --

has little respect for democracy in Latin

America.
