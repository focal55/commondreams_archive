<p>Iraq is not Vietnam, but war is war. Some of you will recall that I was Press 

Secretary to Lyndon Johnson during the escalation of war in Vietnam. Like the 

White House today, we didn't talk very much about what the war would cost. Not 

in the beginning. We weren't sure, and we didn't really want to know too soon, 

anyway. 

<p> If we had to tell Congress and the public the true cost of the war, we were 

afraid of what it would do to the rest of the budget &#151; the money for education, 

poverty, Medicare. In time, we had to figure it out and come clean. It wasn't 

the price tag that hurt as much as it was the body bag. The dead were coming back 

in such numbers that LBJ began to grow morose, and sometimes took to bed with 

the covers pulled above his eyes, as if he could avoid the ghosts of young men 

marching around in his head. I thought of this the other day, when President Bush 

spoke of the loss of American lives in Iraq. He said, "I'm the one who will have 

to look the mothers in the eye." 

<p> LBJ said almost the same thing. No president can help but think of the mothers, 

widows, and orphans. 

<p> Mr. Bush is amassing a mighty American armada in the Middle East - incredible 

firepower. He has to know that even a clean war &#151; a war fought with laser 

beams, long range missles, high flying bombers, and remote controls &#151; can 

get down and dirty, especially for the other side. 

<p> We forget there are mothers on the other side. I've often wondered about the 

mothers of Vietnamese children like this one, burned by American napalm. Or Afghan 

mothers, whose children were smashed and broken by American bombs. 

<p> On the NBC Nightly News one evening I saw this exclusive report from Afghanistan 

&#151; those little white lights are heat images of people on foot. They're about 

to be attacked. 

<p> That fellow running out in the open - were he and the people killed members 

of Al Qaeda, or just coming to worship? 

<p> We'll never know. But surely their mothers do. And there will be mothers like 

them in Iraq. Saddam won't mind - dead or alive; and we won't mind, either. The 

spoils of victory include amnesia. 

<p> Ah, the glories of war; the adrenaline that flows to men behind desks at the 

very thought of the armies that will march, the missiles that will fly, the ships 

that will sail, on their command. Our Secretary of Defense has a plaque on his 

desk that says, "Aggressive fighting for the right is the noblest sport the world 

affords." I don't think so. 

<p> To launch an armada against Hussein's own hostages, a people who have not 

fired a shot at us in anger, seems a crude and poor alternative to shrewd, disciplined 

diplomacy. 

<p> Don't get me wrong. Vietnam didn't make me a dove; it made me read the Constitution. 

That's all. Government's first obligation is to defend its citizens. There's nothing 

in the Constitution that says it's permissible for a great nation to go hunting 

for Hussein by killing the people he holds hostage, his own people, who have no 

choice in the matter, who have done us no harm. 

<p> Unprovoked, the noble sport of war becomes the murder of the innocent.</p>
