<p>CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. -- Only a person of unblemished virtue can get a job at 

Wal-Mart — a low-level job, that is, sorting stock, unloading trucks or operating 

a cash register. A drug test eliminates the chemical miscreants; a detailed "personality 

test" probes the job applicant's horror of theft and willingness to turn in an 

erring co-worker.</p>

<P> Extreme submissiveness to authority is another desirable trait. When I applied 

for a job at Wal-Mart in the spring of 2000, I was reprimanded for getting something 

"wrong" on this test: I had agreed only "strongly" to the proposition, "All rules 

have to be followed to the letter at all times." The correct answer was "totally 

agree."</p>

<P> Apparently the one rule that need not be slavishly adhered to at Wal-Mart 

is the federal Fair Labor Standards Act, which requires that employees be paid 

time and a half if they work more than 40 hours in a week. Present and former 

Wal-Mart employees in 28 states <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines02/0625-04.htm">are 

suing</a> the company for failure to pay overtime.</p>

<P> A Wal-Mart spokesman says it is company policy "to pay its employees properly 

for the hours they work." Maybe so, but it wasn't a policy I remember being emphasized 

in the eight-hour orientation session all new "associates" are required to attend. 

The session included a video on "associate honesty" that showed a cashier being 

caught on videotape as he pocketed some bills from the cash register. Drums beat 

ominously as he was led away in handcuffs and sentenced to four years in prison.</p>

<P> The personnel director warned us, in addition, against "time theft," or the 

use of company time for anything other than work — "anything at all," she said, 

which was interpreted in my store as including trips to the bathroom. We were 

to punch out even for our two breaks, to make sure we did not exceed the allotted 

15 minutes.</p>

<P> It turns out, however, that Wal-Mart management doesn't hold itself to the 

same standard of rectitude it expects from its low-paid employees. My first inkling 

of this came in the form of a warning from a co-worker not to let myself be persuaded 

to work overtime because, she explained, Wal-Mart doesn't pay overtime. Naïvely, 

I told her this was impossible; such a large company would surely not be flouting 

federal law.</p>

<P> I should have known better. We had been apprised, during orientation, that 

even after punching out, associates were required to wait on any customers who 

might approach them. Thanks to the further requirement that associates wear their 

blue and yellow vests until the moment they went out the door, there was no avoiding 

pesky last-minute customers.</p>

<P> Now some present and former employees have filed lawsuits against Wal-Mart. 

They say they were ordered to punch out after an eight-hour shift and then continue 

working for no pay. In a practice, <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines02/0625-04.htm">reported 

in The Times</a>, that you might expect to find only in a third-world sweatshop, 

Wal-Mart store managers in six states have locked the doors at closing time, some 

employees say, forcing all present to remain for an hour or more of unpaid labor.</p>

<P> This is "time theft" on a grand scale — practically a mass mugging. Of course, 

in my brief experience while doing research for a book on low-wage work, I found 

such practices or milder versions of them by no means confined to Wal-Mart.</p>

<P> At a Midwestern chain store selling hardware and lumber, I was offered an 

11-hour shift five days a week — with no overtime pay for the extra 15 hours. 

A corporate-run housecleaning service paid a starting wage of only $6.65 an hour 

but required us to show up in the morning 40 minutes before the clock started 

running — for meetings and to prepare for work by filling our buckets with cleaning 

supplies.</p>

<P> What has been revealed in corporate America over the past six months is a 

two-tier system of morality: Low-paid employees are required to be hard-working, 

law-abiding, rule-respecting straight arrows. More than that, they are often expected 

to exhibit a selfless generosity toward the company, readily "donating" chunks 

of their time free of charge. Meanwhile, as we have learned from the cases of 

Enron, Adelphia, ImClone, WorldCom and others, many top executives have apparently 

felt free to do whatever they want — conceal debts, lie about profits, engage 

in insider trading — to the dismay and sometimes ruin of their shareholders.</p>

<P> But investors are not the only victims of the corporate crime wave. Workers 

also suffer from management greed and dishonesty. In Wal-Mart's case, the moral 

gravity of its infractions is compounded by the poverty of its "associates," many 

of whom are paid less than $10 an hour. As workers discover that their problem 

is not just a rogue store manager or "bad apple" but management as a whole, we 

can expect at the very least widespread cynicism, and perhaps an epidemic of rule-breaking 

from below. </p>
