<p><I>I believe there are more instances of the abridgment of the freedom of the 

people by gradual and silent encroachments of those in power than by violent and 

sudden usurpations.</I> <BR>

&#151; James Madison, <BR>

<I>Speech in the</I> <I>Virginia Convention</I> 

<P> 

<P>It only seems odd until you think about it. Then it makes perfect sense. I 

refer to Mr. Bush's support for Mr. Musharraf following Mr. Musharraf's actions 

on Aug. 21. That was the day Mr. Musharraf unilaterally redrew Pakistan's Constitution 

all by himself. He adopted 29 amendments that greatly expanded the powers he acquired 

when he enjoyed the fruits of a 1999 military coup and became the leader of Pakistan. 

<P>Among the 29 amendments he adopted was one that allowing him to make further 

amendments any time he feels like it. In addition, he gave himself the power to 

dissolve the elected Parliament and to appoint the country's military chiefs and 

Supreme Court Justices. He also allotted some seats on a newly created National 

Security Council to the military. He explicitly stated that the Parliament that 

will be elected will not have the power to repeal the constitutional amendments 

he adopted. Describing the changes, he said: "This is part of the Constitution. 

I am hereby making it part of the Constitution." 

<P>The Bush administration, which is discovering that the United States Constitution 

is more malleable than was thought before Mr. Bush ascended to the presidency, 

responded as expected. State Department spokesman, Philip T. Reeker, said that 

Mr. Musharraf's actions could make it more difficult "to build strong democratic 

institutions in Pakistan." He then said: "It is of vital importance that full, 

democratic civilian rule be restored in Pakistan." Lest that comment leave the 

impression that the administration was distressed by Mr. Musharraf's action, he 

also said, evidence to the contrary notwithstanding, that: "We believe, and judging 

from many of his statements, that President Musharraf wants to develop strong 

democratic institutions." Where he got that idea was not explained. 

<P>Back at the ranch Mr. Bush said that Mr. Musharraf was "still tight with us 

in the war against terror" and "I appreciate his strong support." Mr. Bush did 

not condemn Mr. Musharraf's unilateral amendment of the Pakistani constitution 

for reasons that reflection made obvious. Mr. Musharraf amended the constitution 

in order to better serve the citizens of Pakistan. Although Messrs. Bush and Ashcroft 

have not yet tried to amend the United States Constitution, they have suspended 

it when it serves their notion of the national interest. 

<P>In recent weeks the administration has declared that if it wants to hold U.S. 

citizens incommunicado and deprive them of the right to counsel guaranteed them 

under the Constitution, all it has to do is label them "enemy combatants." It 

has approved more aggressive behavior by the FBI and the CIA. White House counsel 

has interpreted the Constitution to conclude that Congress does not have to approve 

a declaration of war. 

<P>Not all of the administration's assaults on the Constitution have gone unnoticed, 

and one of its attacks has drawn a sharp rebuke from the Sixth Circuit Court of 

Appeals. As part of its war on an open society, the Bush Administration has held 

hundreds of deportation hearings in secret, justifying the secrecy by saying that 

the people involved may have links to terrorism. The case that invoked the wrath 

of the Sixth Circuit was brought by four Michigan newspapers and U.S. Rep. John 

Conyers Jr. of Michigan. They wanted to attend a deportation hearing of a Muslim 

clergyman who had overstayed his tourist visa. The administration did not want 

them there. It said it had the right to decide which hearings had to be open to 

the public without presenting argument or evidence to a judge. Responding to the 

government, the court said that the general interest in preventing terrorism must 

be argued to and accepted by immigration judges in the context of particular cases. 

<P>In its opinion the court said: "Today the executive branch seeks to take this 

safeguard (the press acting as watchdog over the deportation of non-citizens) 

by placing its actions beyond public scrutiny. Against non-citizens, it seeks 

the power to secretly deport a class if it unilaterally calls them "special interest" 

cases. The executive branch seeks to uproot people's lives, outside the public 

eye and behind a closed door. Democracies die behind closed doors. The First Amendment, 

through a free press, protects the people's right to know that their government 

acts fairly, lawfully and accurately in deportation proceedings. When government 

begins closing doors, it selectively controls information rightfully belonging 

to the people. Selective information is misinformation. The framers of the First 

Amendment 'did not trust any government to separate the true from the false for 

us.' They protected the people against secret government.... The public's interests 

are best served by open proceedings. A true democracy is one that operates on 

faith &#151; faith that government officials are forthcoming and honest and faith 

that informed citizens will arrive at logical conclusions. This is a vital reciprocity 

that America should not discard in these troubling times.... Today we reflect 

our commitment to those democratic values by ensuring that our government is held 

accountable to the people and that First Amendment rights are not impermissibly 

compromised. Open proceedings, with a vigorous and scrutinizing press, serve to 

ensure the durability of our democracy. " 

<P>Messrs. Bush, Ashcroft and Musharraf have more in common when it comes to understanding 

constitutional law than any of us might wish. That explains why Mr. Bush hasn't 

scolded Mr. Musharraf. He understands exactly what Mr. Musharraf is about. The 

rest of us understand what Mr. Bush is about. It's not reassuring.
