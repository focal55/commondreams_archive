<p><i>Now look, that damned cowboy is president of the United States.</i><BR>

<LI>Marcus Alonzo Hanna on Roosevelt's accession, September 1901 

<P>

 

<P>

It wasn't a clean sweep and it's not the same as replacing the leader of a country. Nonetheless, April was not a bad month for the Bush administration. It just had a bad moment. 

<P>

The bad moment was the failure of Hugo Chvez, the former president of Venezuela (for a brief time), to stay former. The Bush administration's pleasure at his ouster was short-lived, as was his ouster. That left the administration with not much to say except to express the hope that he would prove a better leader than the Bush administration, in its wisdom, had perceived him to be prior to the coup. The secret hope in all probability was that he would comport himself as the United States comports itself except insofar as that would cause Venezuela to do things of which it disapproves unless they are done by it. April was not without highlights. The administration managed to get rid of a couple of other international figures of whom it disapproved. The first was Dr. Robert Watson. 

<P>

Dr. Watson was voted out as chair of the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) on April 19, and a good thing too. He has a somewhat strange idea that human activities are contributing dangerously to climate change. Not only that: According to a report by the British Broadcasting Corporation, the only achievement of the IPCC is the Kyoto Protocol which addresses global warming, something that everyone who follows the musings of the president knows, is not the problem a few people, (including Dr. Watson) make it out to be. 

<P>

The United Kingdom, which sees in Mr. Bush virtues that are invisible to many others, tried to make things better by suggesting that there be co-chairs of the IPCC. His spokespersons said that the UK "warmly endorses" Dr. Watson's nomination but thought co-chairs would preserve the IPCC's "remarkable consensus." Indeed, a British official told BBC News Online that: "Dr. Watson has done an excellent job, and we would like him to continue. But consensus is important with the IPCC, and always has been, which is why we are promoting a co-chair." Dr. Klaus Toepfer, who heads the United Nations Environment Program, told the BBC that: "We should try to stick to the wonderful consensus culture of the IPCC. It's the best basis for scientific cooperation." Dr. Watson was removed. 

<P>

The administration also eliminated Jose M. Bustani, the Brazilian director general of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) three days after Dr. Watson was removed. Mr. Bustani had been unanimously re-elected in 2001 as the director General of the 145-nation OPCW. According to Mr. Bustani, in late February of 2002, American officials asked him to step down but told him to keep the request confidential. They told him that they did not like his management style. 

<P>

One of the things the administration especially disliked was his effort to get Iraq to join the organization. Some members of the administration feared that if Iraq joined OPCW it would undermine the U.N. Security Council resolutions demanding that it submit to inspections by the U.N. Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission. Other administration hardliners feared that if Iraq joined, it would be more awkward for the United States to invade Iraq. Mr. Bustani defended his action in seeking Iraq's membership, saying that the agency's mandate is to ensure the "convention's universality without exception." He did not share the administration's concerns since he has no plans to participate in an invasion of Iraq. 

<P>

The Bush administration supported Mr. Bustani's selection in 2001 because Latin American countries were unanimously behind him. That was no longer a factor in 2002. According to a report in the British paper The Guardian, the U.S. ambassador to the OPCW met with American members of the organization's staff prior to the vote. The ambassador arrived late at the meeting explaining that he had been seeking a replacement for Mr. Bustani. He reportedly told the assembled multitude that the U.S. had promised that it would replace Mr. Bustani with a Latin American but, according to the report, he said: "Latin Americans are so characterized by sheer incompetence that they won't be able to make up their minds". (He was sufficiently mindful of the slightly derogatory tone of what he said that he admonished those attending the meeting that "if any of this gets out of this room, I'll kill the person responsible.") He also advised the staff that if Mr. Bustani's replacement proved no better than Mr. Bustani: "We will say 'screw the organization'. We'll dismantle our [chemical] weapons independently and monitor them ourselves'. 

<P>

Mr. Bustani was fired in a vote on a U.S. motion calling for his discharge. Forty-eight countries voted for his removal. Forty-three countries abstained and seven opposed his removal. Mr. Bustani's removal was the very first time that the director general of a U.N. agency had been fired in midterm. Coupled with Dr. Watson's earlier removal, it showed that there are advantages to being the biggest kid on the block. It was not, however, with benefit to OPCW. 

<P>

The U.S. still owes OPCW $30 million. After the vote, a senior U.S. official said he was "confident we will pay that in the immediate future." The same official told a reporter for the Christian Science Monitor that the action of the U.S. did not set a precedent but that he hoped it would: "instill a greater sense of responsibility in international organizations." The U.S. does not need to have a greater sense of responsibility in international organizations. It has money and clout instead.
