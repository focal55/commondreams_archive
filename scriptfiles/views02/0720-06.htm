<p>As a former Dilbertina in corporate America, it seems to me that something 

important is missing in the current efforts to diagnose and treat a very bad case 

of corruption. The malady is not limited to "a few bad apples," nor will it yield 

to new regulations, important as they are.

<p>The infection is systemic, reflecting a 20-year change in corporate culture 

that converted full-time employees to temporary workers, all but eliminated corporate 

investment in communities and gutted strong companies to "maximize shareholder 

value." The resulting, and temporary, increases in stock prices and reductions 

in operating costs (at the expense of employees) fueled an obscene rise in executive 

salaries.

<p>Employees and communities were the immediate losers in the new corporations. 

Now we see that shareholders can also lose. Employees once were valued members 

of a corporate family. They worked an eight-hour day and were paid a fair salary 

that included a company-paid pension plan and decent medical-dental insurance. 

They may also have had a 401(k), or one of its predecessors, but this was not 

a replacement for a traditional pension. In return, most employees willingly gave 

their best efforts and loyalty. Shareholders received a regular return on investment 

in the form of dividends. They didn't have to sell their stock for immediate return 

and could endure the normal ups and downs of the business cycle, knowing that 

good companies invested for the future. Both employees and investors were usually 

in for the long term.

<p>Somewhere in the mid-1980s, "paternalism" gave way to "entrepreneurship." Of 

course, corporate managers bear no relationship to true entrepreneurs. But the 

illusion led many to believe they deserved to live like robber barons and kings. 

Companies that once referred to employees as "part of the family" became "lean 

and mean" places of temporary employment, with employees hired and fired as needed. 

This was sold to employees as "taking charge of one's career." Divisions were 

sold off, producing instant revenue and juicing up executive compensation.

<p>It is no wonder that today's corporations do not value "older" workers. They 

know too much. Attention, young people: In the 1930s, people died to establish 

the eight-hour workday, and until recent years it was the norm. There is something 

wrong when today's children are fed packaged dinners by a nanny and parents eat 

remnants while standing over the sink at 10 p.m. Employers know this.

<p>It was possible to overlook the loss of personal time and such hard-won benefits 

as company-paid pensions and medical care when it seemed we were all going to 

be rich. Now that that's over, perhaps we can rebuild our work environment into 

something fair.

<p>Dethroning the CEO is a beginning. Prior to the 1990s, extraordinary wealth 

was the realm of the true entrepreneur--Edison, Ford, Gates, Disney and others 

who, warts and all, created something of value. Many of today's CEOs created nothing; 

at best they managed well what they inherited.

<p>Businesses should start again to reinvest in employees and the community. This 

was once touted as being good for business and for shareholders. It still is.

<p>Accountants and economists can start speaking in plain language. Congress can 

establish independent governing boards and enact effective regulations. But without 

a change of values, greed and fraud will simply take a different form.
