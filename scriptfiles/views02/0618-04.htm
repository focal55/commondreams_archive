<p>I thought it was just me, but after speaking with a colleague, I’m not so sure. 

</p>

<p>Something has happened. </p>

<p>It isn’t one of the obvious things – the end of the illusion of being safe 

on the North American landmass, for example – but something more elusive. </p>

<p>Whatever it is, it’s the source of fluttering qualms of anxiety amplified by 

those frequent vague useless alerts that make us question the identity of the 

real terrorists. </p>

<p>It’s hard to pin down so let me try to approach it obliquely. </p>

<p>I recently attended a homeland defense conference. Lots of smart experienced 

people were on the platform and in the audience. Periodically I turned to an expert 

in biological warfare, say, or information security to see how people were responding 

to the detailed but oddly disconnected presentations. </p>

<p>“How would you sum up the conference?” I asked an aerospace executive. </p>

<p>He thought for a long moment, then said: </p>

<p>“Where’s the beef?” </p>

<p>Maybe that’s part of it. There are lots of details but they don’t connect into 

a coherent whole. </p>

<p>Here’s one detail: </p>

<p>During the conference I spoke with a friend who is an expert on corruption, 

terrorism, and money laundering. She had written a book about an international 

financier and his involvement in all of the above. She has published several other 

books noted for their prescience and has a contract for a new one, but not a single 

publisher would touch her account of that well-known figure’s misdeeds. Nor would 

a single magazine print an article based on the material. </p>

<p>The financier has a lot of clout. One of his “employees” told my friend early 

on that her book would never get anywhere. “We know how to keep people like you 

quiet,” he said. </p>

<p>Maybe that’s part of it too. That quiet surrounds us, suffocating, blocking 

all the exits. </p>

<p>Details pile up. Writers have the luxury of gathering a lot of information, 

which most people have neither the time nor the inclination to do – what’s happening 

with oil and gas fields in central Asia, that pipeline in Afghanistan, the impending 

coup in South America, the cat-and-mouse game we have played for years with Iraq, 

the flow of money from narcotics and weapons sales through the largest banks in 

the United States. The official story we are asked to believe, a simplistic tale 

of “us and them,” is at odds with the complexity of the real multi-leveled game 

we are playing. What we’re told is the signal is the noise and the noise hides 

the real signal. </p>

<p>We know how to keep the real signal quiet. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, quietly quietly, the strategy of decades is changed and we announce 

that we are prepared to strike first anywhere anytime we perceive a threat. The 

imperative to manage and control everything is finally articulated clearly, a 

global doctrine analogous to the Monroe Doctrine, just a little bigger. At the 

same time – quietly, quietly – basic rights are surrendered as I predicted they 

would be when an event of sufficient magnitude justified the shift. Last time 

around it took a Viet Nam, a Watergate, and Congressional hearings to get some 

of them back. </p>

<p>In a recent conversation, Whit Diffie, who invented public key cryptography 

in the seventies, made this remark about technology and its implications. “Someone 

said that Hitler may have lost the Second World War, but Fascism won.” </p>

<p>The Third Reich went down, in other words, but the technological engines of 

its efficiency, enabled by businesses like IBM whose data processing helped the 

Nazis track and kill millions, have grown into engines of social and political 

control of unimaginable depth and complexity. States, said Diffie, will use that 

technology to ensure themselves, always. </p>

<p>Here’s another detail. </p>

<p>The Gulf of Tonkin resolution supporting the Viet Nam War ended the constitutional 

requirement that Congress declare war. I recently discussed the incident with 

Gene Poteat who was a go-to radar guy at CIA at the time. He revisited Lyndon 

Johnson's lack of interest in the real explanation for the report that American 

destroyers had been attacked. Johnson asked John McCone, the Director of Central 

Intelligence, to evaluate the data and McCone asked Poteat who said he would need 

forty-eight hours to do it right. He needed to review weather and water conditions, 

ship's logs, and the like to say definitely whether or not an attack had taken 

place. McCone told Johnson but the president announced the following morning that 

the United States had been attacked and began bombing North Viet Nam. </p>

<p>When he had all the data, Poteat said, it was clear there had been no attack. 

He asked McCone, why didn't Johnson wait for our evaluation? </p>

<p>Because he didn’t want to know, McCone said. He wanted to go to war. </p>

<p># # # # # </p>

<p>The bigger question before us is whether or not we have the will and the desire 

to know the truth, all of it, all the details, all the levels of motivation and 

complexity, so the data can be integrated into a coherent framework that makes 

sense. In possession of the truth and in the absence of that inordinate fear and 

anxiety which create a force field of distortion, most people will make the right 

decision most of the time. But those vague useless alerts, among other things, 

sustain that force field of distortion. </p>

<p>And all this is happening absent an acceptable forum for public discourse about 

these critical issues. The cumbersome machinery of a global society that uses 

technologies of social and political control axiomatically, the way it breathes 

in and breathes out, has lurched for so long to the right that there is no longer 

a center, much less what was once called the left. When a moderate voice speaks 

out, it is denounced as radical, unpatriotic, even treasonable. The desire of 

the great mass of people to want to believe in their leaders and the righteousness 

of their cause, fused with a fear of fear and fear of the power of a war machine 

unparalleled in human history, is absolute. </p>

<p>The dust from September 11th had not settled when billions of dollars began 

to move through channels dug deeply by political and business interests without 

regard to the real necessities of restructuring for a new world. The intensity 

of genuine patriotism and the promise of leaders to defend the lights of civilization 

against the long night that threatened to fall mobilized our hearts on behalf 

of action. Now the momentum of those actions uninflected by meaningful informed 

debate is creating a chain of consequences and a world which may be at odds with 

the kind of world we want to inhabit. </p>

<p># # # # # </p>

<p>“I feel helpless.” </p>

<p>Those words were said by that colleague, an expert in information security 

recognized as one of the rare minds of our generation. Such weariness is uncharacteristic 

for a person who is usually robust, self-motivating, energized by multiple passions. 

</p>

<p>It’s not too much information that causes this malaise. A university library, 

an Internet with a search engine, does not make us feel helpless. All complex 

organisms filter billions of bits of data per second. That isn’t it. It’s the 

conflict generated by competing streams of data that just don’t add up that leads 

to this despondency, the public insistence that we adopt a model of the world 

that doesn’t fit what our gut tells us is happening. </p>

<p>This is the machinery that Whit Diffie described, an instrument of our own 

creation. We are locked up on the starship Nostromo with an alien beast our ship 

had been programmed to retrieve. The great ship of our global society can’t do 

anything else, and we, looking into the mirror, see that we are not only the crew, 

we are the programmers, the designers of the ship, the investors too. </p>

<p>Where oh where is Ripley when we need her? </p>

<p># # # # # </p>

<p>Last week my wife and I visited six of our seven children in California. We 

just wanted to touch base. Driving south along the coast from San Francisco to 

Los Angeles twice we were surprised by wonder. We came upon beaches packed with 

immense elephant seals and then, near a beach at Point Magu, we saw the dorsal 

fins of dolphins suddenly carve the gray water along the shore and we followed 

them down the beach as long as could. </p>

<p>That connection with our children and with seals and dolphins, a friend suggested, 

is a way of knowing that we belong. </p>

<p>Ah ha. Maybe that’s it. Maybe moments of knowing and deep communion, moments 

of consolation and reassurance not based on a shared delusion, are few and far 

between these days. </p>

<p>The world to which we truly belong is not a world of narrow self-interest fueled 

by religious righteousness, with Jews, Christians, Moslems, Hindus all dreaming 

feverishly that God loves them only or best. That is a landscape distorted by 

waves of anxiety rising like summer heat seen through a telescope inversely in 

the distance, as crazy-making as all those idiotic alerts, disconnected utterly 

from elephant seals barking and jousting in the brine, dolphins carving the water 

in the bliss of their unknowing. </p>
