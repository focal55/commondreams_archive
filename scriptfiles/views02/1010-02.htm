<p>HOW DID America get to this place? 

<P> It is the electorate in a democratic superpower that is ultimately responsible 

for the power wielded in its name. Citizenship demands focused attention. It requires 

staying awake, even for the boring parts. 

<P> We have opted for distraction instead. 

<P> In Amusing Ourselves to Death, education theorist Neil Postman notes how 19th 

century farmers and villagers turned out for hours-long debates by the likes of 

Abraham Lincoln and Stephen Douglas. We would rather spend the night at Home Depot 

buying lawn furniture. We scrutinize the ads for cell phone deals as if life or 

death hangs in the balance. We count our frequent-flier miles, buy our Powerball 

tickets, go to the spa. 

<P> Meanwhile, our leaders decide on war and peace, pollution controls, tax cuts 

and health care. 

<P> The facts are out there. Income disparity, housing costs, campaign spending, 

incarceration rates, substance abuse, depression and road rage -- all are on the 

increase, while voter turnout, school funding, air quality, affordable health 

care, retirement security and corporate accountability plummet. High school kids 

graduate unprepared to think with clarity or independence. 

<P> If this is the American dream, it might be time to wake up. 

<P> How did we get to this place? 

<P> Those of us who see our circumstances largely resulting from Republican policies 

find it easy to blame the Democrats in Congress for quiescence and timidity. Yet 

those who place the blame forget the essential logic of democracy: It&#39;s the 

people who decide the contours of government policy. Both parties may be forgiven 

part way for their failures because the people are sending mixed signals. One 

poll question shows lopsided support for a particular position. The next question, 

nearly identical in meaning to the first, elicits a different response. 

<P> That said, history does not stand still, and the Democratic leadership is 

in a time warp. Call it &quot;anti-Vietnam syndrome.&quot; The specter of 1972 

and the humiliating debacle of George McGovern has had Democrats by the throat 

for three decades. The confused, milquetoast muddle that their party has become 

allows the Republicans to intimidate the Democrats into silence and to embrace 

far-right extremists with impunity. 

<P> But someone should tell the liberal leadership that Ronald Reagan is gone, 

and the public has moved on. Much of it is fed up with religious fundamentalism, 

corporate greed and mindless bloodletting as the political weapon of choice from 

Rwanda to the Middle East to Lower Manhattan. As hard times loom in ordinary middle-income 

neighborhoods, Americans suspect the Bush people have no intention of providing 

answers for their problems. 

<P> We have, like Marley&#39;s ghost in Dickens&#39; A Christmas Carol, hauled 

those chains of over-consumption and over-stimulation for so long we&#39;ve forgotten 

what inspiration feels like. The words of John F. Kennedy and the Rev. Martin 

Luther King Jr. are resurrected for memorial dinners, but they are a dead language 

in the year of Tyco and Enron, Dick Cheney and Martha Stewart. &quot;Ask not what 

your country can do for you&quot;? Who was he kidding? 

<P> Americans are distracted, and our opinions are full of contradiction, but 

there is a deep craving no leader seems to have noticed. We need the American 

dream to add up to something beyond the Target receipts and HDTV. We would gladly 

make sacrifices that allow us to believe we have something to contribute to a 

noble purpose. 

<P> Some genuine leaders with brains, guts and vision need to come forward and 

risk their political careers for something larger than themselves. They may well 

not win the battle in the first round. But they will reap grateful support from 

surprising quarters, and they will not be forgotten by history.
