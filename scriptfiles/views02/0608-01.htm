<p>A DECADE after the end of the cold war, the peril of nuclear destruction is mounting. The great powers have refused to give up nuclear arms, other countries are producing them and terrorist groups are trying to acquire them. </p>

<p>

POORLY GUARDED warheads and nuclear material in the former Soviet Union

may fall into the hands of terrorists. The Bush Administration is

developing nuclear "bunker busters" and threatening to use them against

nonnuclear countries. The risk of nuclear war between India and Pakistan

is grave.

</p>

<p>

DESPITE THE END of the cold war, the United States plans to keep large

numbers of nuclear weapons indefinitely. The latest US-Russian treaty,

which will cut deployed strategic warheads to 2,200, leaves both nations

facing "assured destruction" and lets them keep total arsenals (active

and inactive, strategic and tactical) of more than 10,000 warheads each.

</p>

<p>

THE DANGERS POSED by huge arsenals, threats of use, proliferation and

terrorism are linked: The nuclear powers' refusal to disarm fuels

proliferation, and proliferation makes nuclear materials more accessible

to terrorists.

</p>

<p>

THE EVENTS of September 11 brought home to Americans what it means to

experience a catastrophic attack. Yet the horrifying losses that day

were only a fraction of what any nation would suffer if a single nuclear

weapon were used on a city.

</p>

<p>

THE DRIFT TOWARD catastrophe must be reversed. Safety from nuclear

destruction must be our goal. We can reach it only by reducing and then

eliminating nuclear arms under binding agreements.

</p>

<p>

WE THEREFORE CALL ON THE UNITED STATES AND RUSSIA TO FULFILL THEIR

COMMITMENTS UNDER THE NONPROLIFERATION TREATY TO MOVE TOGETHER WITH THE

OTHER NUCLEAR POWERS, STEP BY CAREFULLY INSPECTED AND VERIFIED STEP, TO

THE ABOLITION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS. AS KEY STEPS TOWARD THIS GOAL, WE CALL

ON THE UNITED STATES TO:

</p>

<p>

&sect;&nbsp;&nbsp;RENOUNCE the first use of nuclear weapons.

</p>

<p>

&sect;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permanently END the development, testing and production of nuclear warheads.

</p>

<p>&sect;&nbsp;&nbsp;SEEK AGREEMENT with Russia on the mutual and verified destruction of nuclear weapons withdrawn under treaties, and increase the resources available here and in the former Soviet Union to secure nuclear warheads and material and to implement destruction.

</p>

<p>

&sect;&nbsp;&nbsp;STRENGTHEN nonproliferation efforts by ratifying the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, finalizing a  missile ban in North Korea, supporting UN inspections in Iraq, locating and reducing fissile material worldwide and negotiating a ban on its production.

</p>

<p>

&sect;&nbsp;&nbsp;TAKE nuclear weapons off hairtrigger alert in concert with the other nuclear powers (the UK, France, Russia, China, India, Pakistan and Israel)  in order to reduce the risk of accidental or unauthorized use.

</p>

<p>

&sect;&nbsp;&nbsp;INITIATE talks on further nuclear cuts, beginning with US and Russian reductions to 1,000 warheads each.

</p>
