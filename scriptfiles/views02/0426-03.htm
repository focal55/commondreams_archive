Among the many responses I’ve received for my columns on the Middle East

two stand out. A number of non-Jews, in person and by e-mail, have told

me, “You write what I believe, but I’m afraid to speak out. I’m afraid to

criticize Israel because people will think that I’m anti-Semitic.” <p>

A second response, spoken by an acquaintance whom I respect for his

decent, liberal values, was more unsettling. “I’m starting to feel

anti-Semitic,” he said without any suggestion of irony. “It is disgusting

what Israel is doing to the Palestinians.” <p>

“Anti-Semitism is not the issue,” I replied. “It’s not Jews attacking

Palestinians, it’s Israelis. Many Jewish people, myself included, share

your disgust.”

<p>

But maybe anti-Semitism is an issue, a subtext of the Palestinian-Israeli

conflict that no one wants to talk openly about. In the cauldron of the

times, anti-Semitism has become an accusation, a weapon, a way of

silencing critics of Israel without having to listen to their arguments.

And when used against Palestinians, it’s a way of denying their

aspirations and ignoring their grievances.

<p> 

Anti-Semitism exists, but to extract its meaning it has to be put into

perspective. Under Hitler, the German people murdered millions of

European Jews. But today most Germans are friends and allies of Jews and

of Israel. As a Jew, I still feel a gut wariness whenever I meet a

German. But I also feel elated. That we two, German and Jew, can interact

empathetically fills me with hope. The history of modern Germany is proof

that people can change, that ancient feuds and tribal bloodbaths need not

dictate humanity’s future. Blacks-whites, Hutus-Tutsis, Bosnians-Serbs,

even Arabs and Jews: we shall overcome. 

<p>

Anti-Semitism exists in the Arab world. Increasingly, Arabs couch their

opposition to Israel in the anti-Semitic rhetoric that originated in

Europe. But is anti-Semitism driving the Palestinian resistance? Or is

the Middle East conflict simply a battle over land, two peoples with a

historic claim over the same territory? For centuries Jews lived amongst

the Arabs of the Middle East. Coexistence was never easy and during World

War II many Arab leaders gave verbal support to the Nazis. But Zionism,

the movement for a Jewish state in Palestine, was a European phenomenon;

Middle Eastern Jews did not look to the biblical holy land for security

and life’s meaning. After the holocaust the logic of Zionism could not be

denied. European guilt assured Israeli statehood. But it was the

Palestinians who bore the brunt. And they were not consulted.<p>

Supporters of Israeli policy in Israel and America, rarely acknowledge

this. They speak of the conflict with the Palestinians in terms of Arab

anti-Semitism, and in the context of the holocaust and Jewish survival.

Rarely mentioned is the historic record of Israeli provocations: the

occupation of the West Bank, the military checkpoints, the continuous

expansion of Jewish settlements in Palestinian territory.<p>

Anti-Semitism in America, except on the margins of society, rarely

includes overt acts of violence and discrimination. It is usually more

subtle, expressed politically in the belief that the United States is a

Christian nation or, among evangelical and some other fundamentalist

Christians, that Jews cannot find salvation unless they accept Christian

dogma. People have an absolute right to religious belief, but once it

enters the political arena, it opens itself to critical comment.<p>

On April 15, an Israeli Solidarity Rally brought speakers from all across

the political spectrum. One speaker was Janet Parshall, a national talk

show host who is a director of the evangelical Christian National

Religious Broadcasters and the spokesperson for the Family Research

Council, an anti-choice, homophobic front-group for right-wing

Republicans whose web site

&lt;<a href="http://www.fcr.org/">www.fcr.org</a>&gt;

promotes tax cuts, bashes liberals, and says nothing about Israel. But at

the Solidarity Rally, Ms. Parshall enthusiastically identified herself

with what she considered the cause of the Jews and drew cheers attacking

the idea of “land for peace.” “We will never give up the Golan,” she

announced. “We will never divide Jerusalem,” she declared.

<p>

Jewish organizations that uncritically support Ariel Sharon in the name

of security for Israel are avidly courting the Christian right. A

headline speaker at a recent meeting of AIPAC (the influential

American-Israeli Political Action Committee) was Republican House Whip

Tom DeLay who drew applause for calling the West Bank by its biblical

name, “Judea and Samaria,” and for stating that Israel should not give

any land back to the Palestinians. Delay’s politics are anathema to most

American Jews, but all that can be overlooked, or so it seems, for his

support of Israel. On his web site

&lt;<a href="http://www.tomdelay.house.gov/">www.tomdelay.house.gov</a>&gt;,

Delay boasts of his 100% support for the positions of <i>New American

Magazine</i>, the house organ of the John Birch Society. He has also

publicly said, according to <i>USA Today</i>, that Christianity offers

the “only viable, reasonable, definitive answer” to the questions of

life. Note the word “only.” No other religions are in the game.

<p>

What then is one to conclude about this new Jewish compact with the most

reactionary elements of American society? It seems to me that right-wing

Christians are happy to support a new crusade to drive Arabs from the

Holy Land, and that they’ll cheer the killing of Palestinians down to the

last Jew. But don’t expect Jewish warriors to be granted salvation. As

the fundamentalist Christians describe it, heaven is off-limits to Jews;

unless, of course, we Jews convert to their right-wing theology and

denounce the religious legitimacy of our own Jewish faith. <p>

In the context of American politics and religious culture, the Jewish

organizations that demand uncritical support of Ariel Sharon have

embraced organizations most closely reflective of anti-Semitism itself.

For the sake of solidarity with Israel they’ve allied themselves with

religious organizations most problematic for Jews. Supporting Sharon is

bad enough. An alliance with the religious right is a second mistake.
