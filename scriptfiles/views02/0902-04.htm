<p> For years, experts have been saying we have only 40 or so years of cheap, 

available crude oil left. Now some of the world's leading petroleum geologists 

are suggesting that global oil production could peak and begin a steep decline 

as early as the end of this decade, sending oil prices through the roof. Increasing 

tensions between the West and Islamic countries, where most of the world's oil 

is produced, could further threaten our access to affordable oil.

<p>In desperation, the United States and other nations could turn increasingly 

to dirtier fossil fuels--coal, tar sand and heavy oil--which would only worsen 

global warming and imperil the Earth's already beleaguered ecosystems.

<p>There is a better way to go: hydrogen power.

<p> Weaning the world off oil and turning it toward hydrogen, however, will require 

a concerted effort by industry, government and local communities on a scale comparable 

to the efforts in the 1980s and 1990s that helped create the World Wide Web.

<p>Hydrogen is the most basic and ubiquitous element in the universe. It is the 

"forever fuel," producing no harmful carbon dioxide emissions when burned and 

giving off as byproducts only heat and pure water. All that needs to be done is 

to extract hydrogen from various elements so that it is useable in fuel cells.

<p>The commercially usable hydrogen currently being produced is extracted mostly 

from natural gas. However, renewable sources of energy--wind, hydro, photovoltaic, 

geothermal, biomass--are increasingly being used to generate electricity locally, 

and in the future that electricity will in turn be used to electrolyze water and 

separate out hydrogen that can be used to power fuel cells.

<p>Commercial fuel cells powered by hydrogen are just now being introduced into 

the market for home, office and industrial use. The major auto makers have spent 

more than $2 billion on development of hydrogen cars, buses and trucks; the first 

mass-produced vehicles are expected to be on the road in just a few years.

<p>Exactly how soon we will all be driving hydrogen cars will depend on a number 

of factors, including the price of oil on world markets, the availability of hydrogen 

refueling stations and numerous other technical questions in the manufacturing 

process itself.

<p>Even given these stumbling blocks, many energy experts believe that over the 

next several decades hydrogen fuel cells will become our best source of energy. 

And the rise of this source of power would open the way for fundamental changes 

in our markets and political and social institutions, just as coal and steam power 

did at the beginning of the Industrial Age.

<p>The hydrogen economy would make possible a vast redistribution of power. Today's 

centralized, top-down flow of energy, controlled by global oil companies and utilities, 

would become obsolete. In the new era, every human being could become the producer 

as well as the consumer of his or her own energy--so-called "distributed generation."

<p>When millions of users connect their fuel cells by hooking into existing power 

grids, using the same design principles and smart technologies that made possible 

the Web, they can begin to share energy peer-to-peer--creating a new, decentralized 

form of energy use.

<p>In the hydrogen fuel cell era, even the automobile itself would be a "power 

station on wheels" with a generating capacity of 20 kilowatts. Since the average 

car is parked most of the time, it could be plugged in, during nonuse hours, to 

the home, office or the main interactive electricity network, providing premium 

electricity back to the grid.

<p>When the end users also become the producers of their energy, the only role 

remaining for existing power plants is to become "virtual power plants" that can 

manufacture and market fuel cells, bundle energy services and coordinate the flow 

of energy over the existing power grids.

<p>Hydrogen would dramatically cut down on carbon dioxide emissions and mitigate 

the effects of global warming. And because hydrogen is so plentiful and exists 

everywhere, every human being, once we all become masters of the technology, could 

be "empowered," resulting in the first truly democratic energy regime in history.

<p>Nowhere would hydrogen energy be more important than in the developing world.

<p>Incredibly, 65% of the human population has never made a single telephone call, 

and one-third has no access to electricity or any other form of commercial energy.

<p>Lack of access to energy, especially electricity, is a key factor in perpetuating 

poverty around the world.

<p>Conversely, access to energy means more economic opportunity. In South Africa, 

for example, for every 100 households electrified, 10 to 20 new businesses are 

created.

<p>Electricity frees human labor from day-to-day survival tasks. In resource-poor 

countries, simply finding enough firewood or dung to warm a house or cook meals 

can take hours out of each day.

<p>Electricity provides power to run farm equipment, operate small factories and 

craft shops and light homes, schools and businesses.

<p>As the price of hydrogen fuel cells and accompanying appliances plummets with 

new innovations and economies of scale, cells will become more available, as was 

the case with transistor radios, computers and cellular phones. The goal ought 

to be to provide stationary fuel cells for every neighborhood and village in the 

developing world. 

<p>The road to global security lies in lessening our dependence on Middle East 

oil and making sure that all people on Earth have access to the energy they need 

to sustain life. The hydrogen economy is a promissory note for a safer world.
