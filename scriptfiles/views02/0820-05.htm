<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->As 

war with Iraq looms bewilderingly larger this summer, it would be an overstatement 

to say that there's now a Peace Camp (or more precisely, an Anti-Invasion-Now 

Camp) in Washington. There sure as hell is a Privately Held Doubts Camp, however. 

People worry about the costs -- in lives, money and reputation -- that such a 

war would inflict on America; some even worry about the number of Iraqi casualties 

we would inflict. They worry about what would become of Iraq if we shuffle Saddam 

Hussein off this mortal coil; they worry that the administration doesn't even 

know what should happen if we do. They worry that the war would inflame an already 

enraged Arab and Muslim world; they worry that the war would drive a deeper rift 

between us and Europe; they worry that the administration really doesn't care 

if we estrange the rest of the world. 

<p> Some congressional heavyweights have begun to audibly express such concerns. 

Key Republicans -- such as Dick Armey, Chuck Hagel and Henry Hyde -- have wondered 

if we really have the grounds to go to war, and a number of Democratic senators 

-- Carl Levin, Barbara Boxer, John Kerry and Bob Graham -- have expressed similar 

misgivings. The most important Democrats, however -- Senate Majority Leader Tom 

Daschle, House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt and Senate Foreign Relations Committee 

Chairman Joseph Biden -- are staying discreetly mum, though there are days when 

Gephardt sounds distinctly hawkish. And it's these three leaders -- Daschle and 

Biden in particular -- who can set the Democrats' agenda and shape their talking 

points on the Iraq issue. 

<p> Biden has begun to hold hearings, which can be a good way to air questions 

that Democrats may have without having to commit themselves to a particular position. 

But so far, what most Democrats are saying is merely that the administration needs 

to make a case for going to war (a more compelling case than those that have emerged 

thus far through news leaks). They have not said what they'll do if that case 

doesn't measure up, nor are they saying why they think the administration will 

be able to make a better case than it's made thus far. 

<p> You can understand the calculations behind such reticence. No significant 

constituency is expressing alarm yet about U.S. military action. Biden's committee 

has yet to hear expert testimony that pokes holes in the administration's as yet 

unmade case. It's tricky opposing a war before the official case for that war 

emerges. 

<p> But there's another kind of calculation that Democrats -- their leaders in 

particular -- are making, and it's political. It's an entirely proper calculation 

for party leaders to make. The Democrats are suddenly staring at the prospect 

of a very good election year. This reversal of fortune is entirely the result 

of the corporate scandals, the market's fall, the president's miserable economic 

stewardship, his Harken troubles, his vice president's Halliburton troubles and 

his party's utter indenture to big business. When the dominant issue in the land 

was national security, however, Bush was riding high, and the Democrats opted 

to stay by his side in all things nondomestic. 

<p> So they backed the president's initial response to the al-Qaeda attacks, for 

good reasons that went well beyond the political. But the leadership's Velcro 

adherence to the president's military initiatives now extends far beyond Afghanistan. 

Democrats have said virtually nothing about Bush's stunning announcement that 

the United States is now free to wage preemptive -- if need be, nuclear -- war. 

And they still have said little about Iraq, which apparently is to be the object 

of our first preemptive war, though the administration has yet to specify what 

exactly we'd be preempting. 

<p> The choice now before discreetly doubting Democrats is a bit like the one 

that confronted the Democratic Congress of 1965&#150;1966, when, at Lyndon Johnson's 

insistence, it enacted the Voting Rights Act and Medicare and, with Johnson, declared 

war on poverty. The opportunity to transform America was real, as was that little 

war in Vietnam, which in the course of the year grew into a big war. Some Democrats 

doubted the wisdom of that war, but most decided that with the prospects for fundamental 

social change so high, it was not the time to break with the president. 

<p> It was a difficult question for leaders of the left, too; some, such as the 

great civil-rights organizer and nonviolence advocate Bayard Rustin, decided that 

the opportunity to create a more egalitarian America eclipsed any imperative to 

oppose the war. "How does one judge a man like Bayard," his friend Michael Harrington 

later wrote, "who did the wrong thing for the right reason?" 

<p> That, I fear, is what people may be asking years from now of our congressional 

Democrats. The right reason this year may be nothing so fundamental as it was 

in 1965, but being able to block Bush's legislative initiatives and end the right-wing 

offensive of the past decade constitute genuine gains. And yet a war likely to 

have disastrous consequences in much of the world, a war that will let the terrifying 

genie of preemptive war out of the bottle, is being prepared. With ancestral voices 

prophesying war and all the polls pointing to victory, the Democrats' silence 

is understandable. But not excusable.</p>
