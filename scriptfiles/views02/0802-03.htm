<p>As prominent senators consider the wisdom of making war on Iraq, truly independent 

thinking seems to stop at the water's edge. But I keep recalling a very different 

scene: On Feb. 27, 1968, I sat in a small room on Capitol Hill. Around a long 

table, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee was in session, taking testimony 

from an administration official. I remember a man with a push-broom mustache and 

a voice like sandpaper, raspy and urgent.

<p>Wayne Morse, the senior senator from Oregon, did not resort to euphemism. He 

spoke of the "tyranny that American boys are being killed in South Vietnam to 

maintain in power." Moments before the hearing adjourned, Morse said he did not 

"intend to put the blood of this war on my hands."

<p>It's hard to imagine the late senator going along with claims today that the 

U.S. government has a right to attack Iraq because of the doctrine of "anticipatory 

self-defense."

<p> A fierce advocate of international law, Morse had no patience for double standards. 

In 1964 he told a national TV audience: "I don't know why we think, just because 

we're mighty, that we have the right to try to substitute might for right. And 

that's the American policy in Southeast Asia--just as unsound when we do it as 

when Russia does it."

<p>Nor was Morse at all tolerant of pronouncements about the necessity of saving 

face. He bristled at the kind of logic advanced the other day by a top Pentagon 

advisor, James R. Schlesinger, who asserted that "given all we have said as a 

leading world power about the necessity of regime change in Iraq ... our credibility 

would be badly damaged if that regime change did not take place."

<p>Members of Congress are apt to focus on the efficacy of taking military action, 

the hazards of getting bogged down, the need for a clear exit strategy. But such 

discussions did not preoccupy Morse. He directly challenged the morality--not 

just the "winnability"--of the war in Vietnam. And from the outset he insisted 

that democracy requires substantial public knowledge and real congressional oversight 

rather than acquiescence to presidential manipulation.

<p>Appearing on the CBS program "Face the Nation," Morse objected when journalist 

Peter Lisagor said, "Senator, the Constitution gives to the president of the United 

States the sole responsibility for the conduct of foreign policy." The senator 

responded sharply: "Couldn't be more wrong. You couldn't make a more unsound legal 

statement than the one you have just made. This is the promulgation of an old 

fallacy that foreign policy belongs to the president of the United States. That's 

nonsense."

<p>When Lisagor prodded him ("To whom does it belong then, senator?"), Morse did 

not miss a beat: "It belongs to the American people.... And I am pleading that 

the American people be given the facts about foreign policy."

<p>When his questioner persisted--"You know, senator, that the American people 

cannot formulate and execute foreign policy"--Morse became indignant. "Why do 

you say that?" he demanded. "I have complete faith in the ability of the American 

people to follow the facts if you'll give them. And my charge against my government 

is, we're not giving the American people the facts."

<p>Today there are ample reasons for similar concerns.

<p>During the early years of the Vietnam War, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee 

functioned as a crucial venue for dissenting perspectives, but in its current 

incarnation the panel is notably less independent. The witness list for this week's 

hearings about Iraq prompted Scott Ritter, an ex-Marine and former U.N. weapons 

inspector in Iraq, to charge that Chairman Joseph Biden (D-Del.) and most of the 

congressional leadership "have preordained a conclusion that seeks to remove Saddam 

Hussein from power regardless of the facts and are using these hearings to provide 

political cover for a massive military attack on Iraq."

<p>Transfixed with tactical issues, none of the senators on television in recent 

days would dream of acknowledging the current relevance of a statement made by 

Morse a third of a century ago: "We're going to become guilty, in my judgment, 

of being the greatest threat to the peace of the world. It's an ugly reality, 

and we Americans don't like to face up to it." 

<p>With war and peace hanging in the balance, I miss Wayne Morse. He insisted 

on asking tough questions. He fully utilized a keen intellect. And he spoke fearlessly 

from the heart without worrying about the political consequences.</p>
