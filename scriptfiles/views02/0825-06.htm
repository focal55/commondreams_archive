<p>NEW YORK -- U.S. forces are rapidly massing in the Arabian Gulf to invade Iraq. 

Four heavy brigades have been positioned near Iraq, a huge new air complex is 

now operational in Qatar and American special forces are active in Iraqi Kurdistan. 

<p>The White House is hoping its threats of war will provoke a coup against Saddam 

Hussein by the Iraqi Army. But if one does not come, the George Bush administration 

shows every sign of plunging into an unprovoked war that the rest of the world 

will view as blatant aggression. 

<p>Even America's closest allies are appalled by the tide of warmongering and 

jingoism that has engulfed the United States. Bush's recently proclaimed doctrine 

of "pre-emptive intervention" anywhere on Earth is nothing less than a frightening 

revival of the old imperialist Brezhnev Doctrine of 25 years ago that called for 

Soviet intervention wherever socialism was threatened. 

<p>"Bush, himself the most intellectually backward American president of my political 

lifetime, is surrounded by advisers whose bellicosity is exceeded only by their 

political, military and diplomatic illiteracy." Such were the stinging words of 

Gerald Kaufman, highly respected former foreign affairs spokesman of Britain's 

ruling Labour party, America's closest ally. 

<p>Bush's accelerating campaign to invade Iraq and turn it into another U.S. oil 

protectorate is also provoking a storm of outrage across Europe, the Mideast and 

Asia, where people believe pollution and climate change are far bigger and more 

urgent threats than the bogeyman of Baghdad. 

<p>There are two important exceptions. First, Israel. Last week, Prime Minister 

Ariel Sharon, sounding like he was giving orders to a subordinate, demanded Bush 

speed up plans to attack Iraq. Right on cue, American supporters of Sharon's far-right 

Likud party, led by the Bush administration's Rasputin, Richard Perle, intensified 

their clamor to send American GIs to fight Iraq. 

<p><B>Virtual monopoly on U.S. media</B> 

<p>These bloodthirsty "neo-conservatives" - most of whom evaded military service 

in their own country - dominate the Pentagon and exercise a virtual monopoly on 

U.S. media commentary on the Mideast. They are ardently backed by loony Armageddon-seekers 

of the Christian far right. 

<p>Senior Republican senator Chuck Hagel spoke for many when he asked if Perle 

was so eager to attack, why didn't he join the first assault wave against Baghdad. 

Brent Scowcroft, former national security adviser to Bush's father, warned an 

attack on Iraq would be a disastrous mistake. 

<p>Meanwhile, in Congressional hearings last week, former UN arms inspector Scott 

Ritter courageously stated what many Americans believe, but dare not say: "A handful 

of ideologues have hijacked the national security policy of the United States 

for their own ambitions." Ritter insisted Iraq was totally disarmed and no threat 

to the U.S. or the Mideast. The Bush administration - or, more precisely, the 

people pulling its strings - does not want renewed inspections of Iraq, Ritter 

said, it only wants war. 

<p>A torrent of propaganda, lies and half-truths about Iraq has been pouring from 

the White House in a campaign reminiscent of old Soviet agitprop. The government-appointed 

"defense" team representing accused 9/11 plot member Zacharias Moussaui reportedly 

urged him to falsely claim Iraq was behind the attacks. Moussaui refused. The 

head of Czech intelligence said there were no contacts in Prague between Iraq 

and al-Qaida, a key Bush reason for attacking Saddam. CIA veterans and European 

intelligence officials scoff at White House claims Iraq is a threat to the world. 

<p>The other exception to worldwide outrage over America's Mideast policies was 

Osama bin Laden's al-Qaida. In 1998, bin Laden carefully outlined his grand strategy 

to: 1) liberate Palestine; 2) drive the U.S. occupying troops from Saudi Arabia 

and 3) end the punishment of Iraq's people. To attain these goals, bin Laden planned 

to provoke the U.S. into a large number of fruitless military involvements that 

would wear it out and bleed its military and financial power. 

<p>Afghanistan, which costs American taxpayers $5 billion monthly, is the first 

step. Iraq, whose leader is hated by bin Laden - a hatred equally returned by 

Saddam - will be No. 2. Then, Iran, Syria, Libya - all also on Perle's hit list 

- and so on until a host of Lilliputian conflicts tie down the American imperial 

giant. 

<p>George Bush, who takes pride in not reading books, and calls Greeks "Grecians," 

is charging like a Texas bull into the trap set for him by both bin Laden and 

Gen. Sharon. 

<p>Israel has been trying for 20 years to get the U.S. to go to war against the 

Arabs and Iran, knowing this will permanently enlist America's vast wealth and 

power in its cause, and permanently alienate the U.S. from the Islamic world. 

<p>If ever the United States needed real friends, it is now. And real friends 

like Canada, Germany and France are trying to deter the empty, misguided George 

Bush and his hijacked cabinet from committing an outright aggression that risks 

plunging the Mideast into chaos, or even nuclear war. </p>
