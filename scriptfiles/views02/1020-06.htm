<p>A long running performance just closed in the Senate. It was masquerading as 

a debate over creating a Department of Homeland Security. The question for the 

audience is whether to laugh or cry. 

<p>The case for laughing is this: a Homeland Security Department was a political 

gimmick from the get-go, a gigantic bureaucratic reshuffling intended to provide 

voters with the appearance that something real was happening to fight terrorism. 

Now both Republicans and Democrats alike come off as insincere and incompetent 

as they squabble over their own invented ploy. Just desserts. Hoisted by their 

own plucky petards. 

<p>But go ahead and cry if you ever thought a new Department of Homeland Security 

would make America safer, if you ever felt you could soon enjoy the protection 

of a lean, mean, Cabinet-level, evil-fighting machine. 

<p>I don’t imagine many tears are being shed, except the crocodile tears of professional 

Democrats and Republicans. 

<p>So enjoy the giggles of stupid politician tricks. 

<p>Homeland security is dead in the pre-election Congress. There’s a slim chance 

that it could be resurrected in a lame-duck session after the November elections. 

<p>The irresolvable issue has little to do with public security and more to do 

with job security for government workers. 

<p>President Bush wanted to have broad powers to fire, hire and reassign the 170,000 

workers that were to be transferred into the new department from 22 existing public 

safety agencies -- powers presidents don’t have now and wouldn’t have in other 

agencies. 

<p>President Bush and Team GOP claim this is necessary to ensure that the new 

D. of H.S. doesn’t become just another Washington watering hole for fat and happy 

civil leeches. 

<p>Democrats refuse. They say the President is not only trying to strip civil 

rights from government employees, but also trying to dismantle protections that 

stop presidents from filling agencies with hacks, ideologues and patronage pals. 

<p>Republicans say the Democrats are simply toadying to the public employees unions 

that give them tons of reliable dollars and votes. In the always-subtle words 

of the near-departed Sen. Phil Gramm, the Democrats “love public employee unions 

more than homeland security.” 

<p>Out-going foot and mouth-meister Dick Armey has a more colorful take, "America 

sits and wonders why is it that al Qaeda, this rag tag bunch of terrorists scattered 

all over the globe, can reorganize themselves ... and the United States government 

cannot reorganize itself." 

<p>"Well, I guess the difference is al Qaeda doesn't have a Senate,” analyzed 

Armey. 

<p>Thus flows the eulogy of the Department of Homeland Security. 

<p>And as we pause to pay our respects, let me step out of character for a moment 

and praise the Senators who bound and gagged this legislation: If they really 

believed this new agency would increase world safety, there would be a new agency. 

But they don’t. They never did. 

<p>An agency for “homeland security” was and is an ersatz-issue that is all about 

generating October campaign ads that shout, “I was for it” or “you were against 

it.” And now the airwaves are full of them. 

<p>But there is a silver lining, and it reflects an ancient political truism: 

Good things often happen for bad reasons. 

<p>I think the invisible hand of political markets kept something from happening 

that was dumb at best, expensive and risky at worst. 

<p>If a Democratic administration had proposed a domestic security mega-agency, 

Republicans would have gone nuts screaming about bloated government. And they 

would be right. 

<p>Yet Republicans proposed it because it was, they said, vital to our safety. 

If that’s the case, then safety is more important than bureaucratic management 

issues or breaking federal unions. Why draw the line in the sand on this “vital” 

issue? It doesn’t make much sense. 

<p>The FBI and CIA were never included in this "reinventing government" plan. 

That itself tells us that this was tinkering. 

<p>Still, the idea was that somehow central management would improve functions 

now scattered in two-dozen separate agencies. Could be. 

<p>But it reminds me of the line we were fed a decade ago, the one about how bringing 

a swarm of MBA’s into the world of medicine would deliver unto us better, cheaper 

"managed care." I’m wary, to put it mildly. 

<p>Here’s the bottom line: I object to this project on purely etymological grounds. 

The words "homeland security" evoke a <I>Deutschland uber alles</I> mood that 

is creepy and un-American. Good riddance and <i>auf wiedersehen</i>.
