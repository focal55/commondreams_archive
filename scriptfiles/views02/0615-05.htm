<p><I>Greed is all right. . . . Greed is healthy. You can be greedy and still feel good about yourself.</I> 

<BR>

<B>Ivan Boesky, </b><I>Commencement address,</I> <I>Berkeley, May 1986</I> 



<P>It was a bit of a surprise. I thought they were doing it for shareholders. They are doing it for themselves. That just came to light. They probably wish it hadn't since it kind of makes them look greedy. On the other hand, they may not mind. The rewards they will reap are more than adequate to make up for whatever vilification they may endure. 



<P>Much in the news of late have been stories about U.S. corporations which are incorporating their businesses in Bermuda and establishing a legal residence in Barbados where they must hold one meeting a year. The practice was most recently brought to the public's attention when Stanley Works held a shareholder election that, if successful, would have permitted it to become a Bermuda company. Because of assorted difficulties, the election is being held a second time. If successful, and its success seems likely, Stanley Works will reportedly reduce its income taxes by 28 percent or close to $30 million a year. Here's how. 



<P>The United States has a special tax treaty with, among other countries, Barbados. The treaty permits a U.S. company to transform taxable profits in the United States into expenses that are deductible on the company's U.S. tax return. To Barbados it sends its profits in the form of interest payments, royalties for using the company's logotype and fees for management advice, thus converting those profits into expenses that it deducts on its U.S. tax return. The Barbados company sends the money it receives to the company's worldwide headquarters in Bermuda, which has no income tax and the money can then be used anywhere in the world. The reason the companies have to use places like Barbados in addition to Bermuda is because the U.S. has no tax treaty with Bermuda that permits the transformation of profits into expenses. 



<P>According to reports, these kinds of transfers can save companies anywhere from 11 percent to 28 percent. Although Stanley Works has not yet received shareholder approval for the move, Cooper Industries, Tyco International, Seagate Technology and Ingersoll-Rand have already moved. 



<P>Shareholders should be pleased to learn that the companies in which they have invested are looking out for their welfare. If the companies take steps to save taxes it would seem obvious that shareholders will benefit. That proves to not necessarily be the case, at least not in the short term. According to a story in the New York Times, most, if not all, of the tax savings benefit not the shareholders but the executives of the migrating companies. These are not the sort of executives who are suffering because they are only paid a few hundred thousand dollars a year, the bare minimum anyone needs to get by on. These are executives who are earning millions of dollars. Take for example Eugene M. Isenberg. 



<P>According to the report, Mr. Isenberg, the CEO of Nabors Industries, a company planning on moving (unless a shareholder suit seeking to block the move that was reported on June 1 is successful) has been paid $126 million, including profits from the sale of stock options over the last two years. His company has $2 billion in annual revenues. The $126 million is enough for him to do many of the things he and his family could not do if they earned less money. There are lots more things they'll be able to do following the move. That is because his contract pays him 6 percent of the company's cash flow. By reducing taxes, the company's cash flow will increase significantly and so will Mr. Isenberg's salary. The increased cash flow should cause share prices to increase, thus enabling Mr. Isenberg to make dozens of millions more on his stock options, the exact number of millions depending on how high the price of the stock goes. 



<P>John Trani, Stanley Works president, will also receive a sizeable salary increase since his salary is based, in part, on improved cash flow. Mr. Trani will earn 58 cents for each dollar of taxes saved by the move. Since corporate taxes are estimated to fall by $30 million, Mr. Trani's compensation should increase by $17.4 million. Increased salary is not his only benefit. 



<P>Mr. Trani estimates that if the move is approved the stock price should double in eight years. If that happens, shareholder wealth will increase by about $3.3 billion. Mr. Trani's wealth will increase by at least $385 million if he exercises his stock options. The United States will lose $240 million in taxes. 



<P>Shareholders will not share in Mr. Trani's instant rewards. Instead, they will have to pay capital gains taxes based on the value of the stock prior to the move. Mr. Trani will also have to pay taxes, but they will be less than one week's salary because many of his shares are in options and retirement accounts that are not subject to that tax. 



<P>Mr. Trani is willing to overlook the short-term hardship imposed on shareholders by the capital gains tax because of what the move means for his family's wealth. Any slight feelings of guilt he might otherwise have because of what he has done to shareholders he overcomes by thinking of how the anticipated increase in the stock price will ultimately benefit them. In the meantime, and while waiting for the shares to go up, shareholders can look forward to attending future annual meetings in Barbados or Bermuda. It's not as much fun as anticipating what they could do if they had Mr. Trani's money, but being in those countries, albeit briefly, will give shareholders the illusion of sharing the affluence their investment in the company has enabled its officers to enjoy. </p>
