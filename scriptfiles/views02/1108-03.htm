<p>It started with the November 2000 rigged US presidential election and has just 

degenerated from there. I've not been alone in watching with horror as our country's 

government flipped the bird at international treaties designed to protect human 

rights and the environment, favoring military build-up and big oil instead. Many 

of us have been outraged by the unelected ones sabotaging chances for an independent 

investigation into 9/11, and disgusted by their ass-covering legal gyrations to 

prevent inquiry into their former shady business dealings, not to mention their 

equally shady bedding with oil interests once having seized political power. 

<p>But now it seems the coup from hell is complete. In midterm US Congressional 

elections in which only 40% of those citizens eligible bothered to vote, a full 

95% percent of House races and 75% of Senate races <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/pressreleases/Election2002Analysis.asp" target="_new">were 

won by the candidates who spent the most money</a>. This while, under the guise 

of "poll watching," Republican Party functionaries were posted at polling stations 

across the country on Election Day, <a href="http://www.wsws.org/articles/2002/nov2002/poll-n04.shtml" target="_new">harassing 

(mainly Democratic) working class and minority voters</a>. This while, right before 

the voting, a beloved Democratic Senator who was locked in a close election contest 

died in a mysterious plane crash, exactly two years after another Democratic Senate 

candidate died in the same mysterious way. This while the same inaccurate lists 

of supposedly ineligible (mainly Democratic) voters which unfairly <a href="http://www.wsws.org/articles/2002/nov2002/poll-n04.shtml" target="_new">disenfranchised 

tens of thousands</a> in the 2000 presidential race, were inexplicably used again 

in this election. This while much of the country voted via computer systems whose 

proprietary nature does not permit public scrutiny, and which by definition do 

not leave much in the way of physical evidence for each vote. The computer glitch 

in South Florida which almost <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2002/ALLPOLITICS/11/07/elec02.florida.votes.missing/" target="_new">deleted 

103,000 votes</a> is a case in point; what other votes could have been "lost" 

at the touch of a button, and to whose benefit? 

<p>Do the math: in a seriously flawed, arguably corrupt, electoral process in 

which the majority of the population was too apathetic to even feign democratic 

pretenses, only 21% ended up granting Bush his newfound sweeping and absolute 

powers. 

<p>Call me old-fashioned, but that's just not my idea of democracy. It's a farce 

and a travesty. And it's guaranteed to get much worse. 

<p>With a lame-duck Congress, and Republicans controlling both the House and the 

Senate (plus the Supreme Court), it's clear military spending will skyrocket as 

domestic social services are slashed and the environment is pillaged. Any previous 

attempts to rein in corporate scandal and excess will be attacked as un-American 

(kiss the corporate-fraud targeting Sarbanes-Oxley Act goodbye, for one). The 

proposed $37 billion Department of Homeland Security bureaucracy will be approved, 

along with its attending decimation of civil protection rights and collective 

bargaining power. And with the <a href="http://www.osamaskidneys.com/morales.html" target="_new">Civil 

Disturbance Plan 55-2</a> (nicknamed GARDEN PLOT) finally enforced, the military 

will be able to suppress domestic "assemblages or rebellion against the authority 

of the United States" whenever the President sees fit. In other words, it's going 

to get a lot more dangerous to protest or express dissent. 

<p>And that's the relatively good news. 

<p>As the US economy tanks, Bush will pursue his oil-hegemony dreams in Iraq, 

creating a bloodbath for both Iraqi civilians and US service members, not to mention 

burning up hundreds of billions in taxpayer dollars in the process. Meanwhile, 

the Putins and Sharons of the world will see fit to continue oppressing their 

chosen targets, with full knowledge the US will turn a blind eye to their crimes 

against humanity in return for their own tacit approval of similar US actions. 

The Middle Eastern region will predictably destabilize, with dangerous political/economic 

consequences accompanied by untold human costs. 

<p>And the US will be subjected to further terrorist attacks - that is, if Secretary 

of Defense Donald Rumsfeld has his way. According to a little-discussed classified 

document prepared for Rumsfeld by the Defense Science Board, a group of private 

industry executives advising the Pentagon, new counter-terrorism measures will 

include "cover and deception" and secret military missions to stimulate terrorists 

into making attacks, thereby leaving them open to counterattacks by US forces. 

Plainly put, the so-called "<a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views02/1028-11.htm" target="_new">Proactive, 

Preemptive Operations Group</a> (P2OG)" aims to save citizens from terrorist attacks 

by actively provoking terrorist attacks against citizens. Got that? 

<p>It's no wonder many normal people are feeling devastated and disillusioned 

right now, ready to draw back from this whole damn dysfunctional mess. 

<p>But now is not the time. 

<p>This train has barely left the station and its destination can still be changed. 

The only chance to alter the current sorry state of events and prevent matters 

from getting much, much worse, is a vigilant and involved population. That's you 

and me - actively assuming responsibility on a daily basis to name this societal 

rollback for what it is, then confronting each step away from sanity, while presenting 

a more humane and equitable alternative. 

<p>It's our only chance.</p>
