<p>Wars and rumors of wars, famine, drought, floods, plagues and pestilence - it's all beginning to feel a bit apocalyptic. This rhetoric of disorder, depravity and decadence is the lingua franca of faith communities. It expresses the doctrinal need to balance their bleak explanations of original sin with promises of rapturous redemption. The imagery of Armageddon has a dangerous evangelical quality which is liable to be used by warmongers to provide sacred authority to their secular enterprise. 

<P>It is time for a doctrinal regime change. There is nothing remotely apocalyptic about the present time. Rather, we are on the cusp of a most exciting and hopeful era, the age of enablement.  <P>For millennia the man in the street, the woman in the field, the child down the mine, the publicans, sinners and invalids were collateral in the grand schemes of the high and mighty. Gradually they have been manumitted; the slaves are free, women vote, young people have a childhood and a charter, homosexuality is permitted, the mentally unstable given a place, the disabled access.  <P>At home, a new social infrastructure is being put in place as the excluded take on ownership, through small-scale initiatives, with buddies, mentors, citizen advocates, careworkers, outreach, mediation services, personal advisers, community clinics, credit unions, grassroots multi-agencies. This is serious social capital and its "interest" is exponential. If Christ had been born this Christmas, it is unlikely that his parents would have had to seek sanctuary in a stable. There might not have been room at the inn, but there would have been many alternative refuges.  <P>In the wider world, the hungry are getting seeds, the thirsty wells, the naked sewing machines, the imprisoned advocates, the poor fair trade. These are the solutions of empowerment and they reveal the true nature of humanity; only people who themselves have been powerless could devise the hand-up option, in place of the hand-out solution. These are the hands-on builders of the kingdom; artisans who have no need of grand designs. Instead they use the simple blueprints handed down by the social gospel of respect for our fellow creatures and care for the weak.  

<P>This good news suggests a dangerous perspective on human behavior. We are indeed made in the image of God. Wrongdoing is the product of circumstance, not the attribute of creation, apple or gene. We are beginning to identify cause; we no longer stumble round the battlefields and ghettos of the world dispensing band-aid and blessing. We have begun to make the connections between poverty and power, disease and disorder, bombs and bread. We are offering joined-up solutions, and crying havoc on those who create the inequity and declare the wars.  

<P>No longer conscripts in their schemes, we have realized our capacity for good. The fruit is already apparent on the tree, token of what can happen when the invalid and excluded are included and empowered. Control by the few gives way to enablement for the whole, while the ethos of competition and advantage yields to that of collaboration and benefit - the deaf lead the blind, the lame speak for the dumb.  

<P>Enablement on this scale is a great feast indeed, and although it is not a comfortable process for religions, which are by definition concerned with containment, it is wrong of them to allow outmoded doctrine to keep them from its celebration. It was after all they who sowed the seed in good soil which has come to flower in stony ground. Yet while they perversely view God's children as originally cursed rather than creatively blessed, they are ill-dressed for the occasion.  <P>And disqualified. It is not simply perverse to allow the words which carry the good news to be translated from peacemaking into the language of mass destruction. At this season of God's incarnation which proclaimed an end to that prospect, it is a betrayal.  <P><i> Stewart Dakers is a secular, street youth worker</i></p>
