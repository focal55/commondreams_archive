<p>On April 20, when 75,000 US citizens marched on Washington to oppose 

the war, others asked:  Why?  How can the marchers object, given what 

we've been told since September?  



<p>The reason:  Peace advocates don't believe the official stories, as I 

learned by surveying a peace rally in Detroit.



<p>To be specific, I asked two main questions.  First:  to what extent 

does US foreign policy try to promote human rights and democracy in 

the world?  Second:  to what extent does the mainstream media 

accurately inform the public?  On a scale from zero to ten (zero = 

"not at all"), the average score on foreign policy was 2.0.  For the 

media, 2.3.  (from 78 responses of 500 attendees)



<p>A Republican senator once said the first casualty of war is truth, 

and at some level, we all know this.  We never expect to know details 

that might endanger our soldiers.  But in a country that prides 

itself on democratic ideals, we do expect to know the motives behind 

a war, and expect those motives to align with our values.  



<p>But should we be as skeptical as the peace advocates?



<p>History is a helpful guide.  Our leaders have considered significant 

deceptions in the past -- such as "Operation Northwoods," easily 

found on the web at the George Washington University National 

Security Archive (<a href="http://www.gwu.edu/%7Ensarchiv/news/20010430" target="_new">http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/news/20010430</a>).



<p>In March 1962, US policy planners wanted to overthrow the Cuban 

government. Northwoods recommended &quot;developing the international 

image of the Cuban government as an alarming and unpredictable 

threat&quot; -- by conducting real and simulated attacks on America which 

would then be blamed on Cuba.

<p>The plan proposed a simulated "Communist Cuban terror campaign" -- 

which would include "attempts on lives of Cuban refugees in the 

United States", exploding bombs in Washington, hijacking civilian 

airliners, and even to "sink a boatload of Cubans en route to Florida 

(real or simulated)."



<p>Proposed by the Joint Chiefs to the Kennedy administration, Operation 

Northwoods was not carried out.  This might be comforting were it not 

for the fact that many such documents are still classified, like 

those from the 1950's when the CIA orchestrated the overthrow of 

Iranian and Guatemalan democracies.



<p>With our skepticism properly calibrated by Northwoods, it's easier to 

interpret more recent events.   Iraq's story is particularly relevant.



<p>We were told during the Gulf War that smart bombs precisely targeted 

Iraq's military.  But they also targeted Iraq's water treatment 

plants, which could not be rebuilt under the sanctions.  Declassified 

military documents from 1991 explaining this were revealed last year 

by Thomas Nagy in "The Secret Behind the Sanctions" 

(<a href="http://www.progressive.org/0801issue/nagy0901.html" target="_new">http://www.progressive.org/0801issue/nagy0901.html</a>).



<p>Since 1990, lack of safe water, medicines, and other essentials have 

caused the deaths of 500,000 Iraqi children.  We could blame it all 

on the tyrant, Saddam Hussein, were it not for another unfortunate 

fact:  US planners supported his regime before and after the war.



<p>From 1980-88, Iraq was at war with Iran.  We supported Saddam so 

strongly that we did nothing when an Iraqi cruise missile struck the 

USS Stark in May 1987, killing 37 sailors.  We also supported Hussein 

throughout his worst crimes, including his use of mustard gas against 

the Kurds in 1988.



<p>When Iraq invaded Kuwait, US leaders encouraged Iraqis to rebel 

against Hussein.  Immediately after the war, they did rebel, but were 

crushed while US forces, following orders, did nothing.   As ABC News 

anchor Peter Jennings put it, "The United States did want Saddam 

Hussein to go, they just didn't want the Iraqi people to take over."



<p>Declassified government records explain why the US supports 

dictators.  For example, in 1948 the State Department advised:  "We 

have about 50% of the world's wealth, but only 6.3% of its 

population. ... Our real task in the coming period is to devise a 

pattern of relationships which will permit us to maintain this 

position of disparity.... To do so, we will have to dispense with all 

sentimentality and day-dreaming.... We should cease to talk about 

vague ... objectives such as human rights ...." (Policy Planning 

Study 23 in Foreign Relations of the United States, 1948, vol 1, p 

524)  This was written in secret, of course, whereas in public that 

same year, the US signed the UN Declaration of Human Rights.



<p>In short, the skeptics are unfortunately correct:  US planners do not 

strive for democracy and human rights.  They project power and 

control the third world's resources.  Dictators in the Gulf are 

beneficial because they give us oil on better terms than democracies 

would.  Unfortunately, this approach has led to many innocent deaths 

and hatred of the US among Arabs and Muslims worldwide.  That is why 

citizens marched in DC:  They don't just want peace.  They want moral 

US foreign policy - both for its own sake and as a means to peace.



<p>Through their demonstrations, peace advocates have raised important 

questions in these critical times:  Are we willing to insist on moral 

foreign policy?   Is the Golden Rule something to live by or merely 

the impractical musings of an ancient philosopher?  What does it mean 

to be "patriotic" when leaders are violating our shared values?



<p>And is the "war on terrorism" what it seems?
