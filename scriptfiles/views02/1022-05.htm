<p>The Weather Channel has that "Weather on the Eights" feature, the local forecast 

that comes on at eight minutes past the hour and repeats at 10-minute intervals. 

<p> We had something similar in Beirut after 1975. It was something like "Sniper 

on the Eights," a regular radio report on Voice of Lebanon that gave us the latest 

on sniper activity in the city as if it were a weather or traffic report, which 

is actually what it was. We listened to the radio before going anywhere to know 

what streets were safe and what streets were "hot," as the usually female, usually 

sultry voice on the radio described it, meaning nothing sultry by "hot," obviously. 

<p> Snipers very quickly became the roving demons of the Lebanese Civil War. They 

were mercenaries with no conscience or convictions. They took up posts on rooftops 

and accepted paychecks from whichever side paid best. It was a job that promised 

plenty of work and no chance of unemployment. They had their favorite haunts -- 

bridges, major crossings, the so-called "Ring" highway that was Beirut's equivalent 

of a crosstown expressway, and which was the inaugural Highway of Death (by 1980 

even dirt roads and back alleys were highways of death in Lebanon). 

<p> They slouched in their sandbagged nests like the lethal dregs they were, alone 

or in teams of twos, drinking coffee, smoking cigarettes (preferably American), 

reading paperbacks, murdering civilians. A handful could paralyze the whole city. 

<p> Their kills were tallied in the morning paper in bullet form. It was an unintentional 

visual pun that sometimes took up two or three columns, because it also included 

the kidnappings and the throat-slashings of the day before. So Beirut's equivalent 

of a crime blotter was made up of the finds of young mothers or elderly men with 

bullets in the head, of children who'd bled to death where they'd been playing 

moments before, of the occasional victory bullet listing the kill of a sniper. 

<p> I read these accounts with more fascination than fear. I was 10. The smell 

of newsprint and the coolness of the sentences in their linear layout immunized 

me from the magnitude of what I was reading about. It made the accounts seem more 

like edgy adventure stories than tallies of atrocities a neighborhood away. Sickening 

to think of it now, but I looked forward to those accounts. Blame it on the immaturity 

of a 10-year-old who'd yet to realize the difference between the prurient thrill 

of war stories and the indiscriminate brutality of the real thing. I'd like to 

think that I know better today. 

<p> Watching the reaction to the Washington area sniper in the last couple of 

weeks, it's as if that immature 10-year-old was at the media's controls, playing 

up the story's prurience as if it were a multipart series with the promise of 

daily installments. The major newsmagazines are mythologizing the sniper ("I Am 

God," in red letters on U.S. News & World Report's cover) and playing into his 

Tarot-trap of death cards (Newsweek dubs him "The Tarot Card Killer"). The news 

networks have serialized him in the language of promos and logos. CNN's is "A 

trail of terror." CBS has a hurricane-like track-the-killer map. User-friendly, 

too. 

<p> To be fair, that's how most news reporting is done these days. Whether it's 

the assault on Tora Bora or the flooding of subdivisions in Louisiana, the stuff 

is packaged as a reality show no more or less momentous than the prime-time lineup 

that follows it. It's an interactive entertainment. Only this time, in a remarkable 

leap over the conventional image-makers, the scripts have been inspired less by 

Hollywood than the Web's many and furtive sniper sites. 

<p> Like other fringe elements the Internet has congealed into charter-certified 

hobbies -- weekend survivalists, Confederate hold-outs, warriors without a cause 

-- the sniper sites form a thriving subculture of arrested adolescence camouflaged 

as something "noble," "heroic," "an art and science" practiced by "heroes of unrecognized 

proportions, doing a hard, miserable job in the name of the people they have sworn 

to protect," to quote from a couple of home pages. From there newscasters have 

cribbed phrases like "one shot one kill," "precision ammo," "stalk and kill" and 

other catch phrases to dress up their teleprompters in knowingness. It's as if 

the news were wearing a pair of designer shades. The result is as divorced from 

reality as a dandy in a slum. 

<p> Maybe we should be thankful for the imbecility of the coverage. It is blameless 

in that there is no frame of reference for that kind of terrorism on American 

soil other than the Web. The language to explain it must come from somewhere while 

shock matures into understanding. The designer shades are a protective mechanism. 

That, anyway, is the optimistic view. 

<p> The less optimistic view is that the reaction to the sniper's murder spree 

points to an obstinate belief in inalienable safety. Mayhem as we know it can 

always be narrowed down to a target and excised like a tumor, a one-size-fits-all 

sort of "regime change" from tyrants to snipers. That kind of fantasy should have 

expired with Sept. 11. It seems instead to have hardened into a hazardous illusion 

of invulnerability. Look only for the distance between those adolescent Web sites 

and the White House's paint-ball mentality. There is none. That imbecility, which 

will outlast the sniper's terror, we can't afford.
