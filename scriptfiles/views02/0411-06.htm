<i>"A government which spends more on its military than on programs of social 

uplift is approaching spiritual death."</i>

-       Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.



<p>As April 15th  nears and Americans devote countless grueling hours toward 

tax preparation, how many people examine where their money actually goes?



<p>Certainly the prospect of shelling out money each spring to the Internal 

Revenue Service does not contribute to an atmosphere of personal 

tranquility and peace in the days and hours before the postmarked envelopes 

and begrudgingly-written checks are sent to the faceless bureaucracy which 

keeps our country afloat.  The process of relinquishing hard-earned money 

sends pangs of frustration and resentment through many people.



<p>Is there a way to make this less painful?  Can we envision a day when we 

give with glee because we know that our taxes ending up in the right 

places, helping the right people and addressing the problems in our society 

which affect us all?  Can we ever become less resentful about paying 

taxes?  Perhaps the answer is found in our priorities.



<p>If you want to personally quantify your values, follow where you spend your 

money.  Are you buying movie tickets, supporting millionaires?  Are you 

buying gasoline?  Shopping at the GAP?  Eating out?  Are you donating to 

worthy causes?  Are you sponsoring an underprivileged child overseas or in 

your town?  If we want to know on an individual level where our priorities 

are, our expenses can provide important clues.



<p>If we want to know where our priorities are on a national scale, we can 

follow our federal spending as well.  This year, our federal budget gives a 

big boost to the military, our way of solving problems 

internationally.  The Osprey aircraft and Virginia attack submarines 

received a combined $4.2 billion dollars and nearly half our budget is 

allocated for past and present military spending.  At the same time, 

significant cuts were made in "programs of social uplift": $700 million in 

job training and employment, $85 million to train doctors in children's 

hospitals, $596 million from the Department of Education and $417 million 

to repair housing.  Interesting.



<p>And the core values which we hold dear are reflected in the national 

budget: power, authority, defense and protection.  Education, healthcare, 

social services and investment in workers get short shrift this year.  Nine 

million children (one in seven) have no health insurance in the United 

States.  One in eight never graduate high school.  One-fourth live with 

only one parent.  Over the next ten years, more than 2.2 million teachers 

will be needed to address the high turnover rate in the educational system 

and compensate for retiring teachers.  The average length of time a new 

teacher sticks with the profession?  Two years.



<p>At the heart of the matter is what really will make us more secure - a big 

military or a healthy, smart, fulfilled population.  Can we actually become 

safer if we are better educated, well-nourished and have well-paying stable 

employment and hope for the future?  Or is a big military the only 

way?  And what do taxes have to do with this?



<p>Almost half of our taxes are applied to keeping our country safe through a 

strong military.



<p>The quote by Dr. King gets at the heart of the matter.  On a personal 

level, we are taught to rely on gadgets like mace, tasers, martial arts and 

self-defense, The Club and complex home security devices to protect our 

stuff and our well-being.  On a national level, we are taught to rely on 

national missile defense, nuclear weapons, a large well-equipped military 

and the theory of mutually assured destruction.  These ploys play upon our 

fears of death and insecurity, and they make a great deal of money for a 

small amount of people.  Imagine if we began to embrace the idea that life 

is fundamentally insecure and that regardless of all the protective 

measures, the gizmos, the gimmicks and the firepower we buy or rely on, 

that our time on earth is limited and fragile.



<p>Moreover, do we need to live in fear and suspicion of others in order to be 

safe?



<p>By addressing the root causes rather than effects of violence - like lack 

of education, low-paying jobs, poor health care, stress and relationship 

problems - through adequate funding and appropriation of financial 

resources shows that American people are at the heart of our concern.  In 

contrast, focusing only on tragedy and insecurity detracts from the 

positive components in American society.



<p>This year, Hart High School in Valencia, CA had to cut funding for its bus 

transportation for extra-curricular activities which require distance 

travel; many other high schools nationwide have experienced similar 

cutbacks.  Is it morally right to deprive students of after school 

activities, thus increasing the likelihood that they will end up 

unsupervised and getting into trouble?  Can we justify spending $1.1 

billion in military aid to Colombia rather than funding buses for high 

school sports teams and bands?



<p>As tax day draws nigh, we as Americans are challenged to examine our lives, 

our budgets, our bank account balances and our priorities.  We have power 

through deliberate acts of conscience to challenge the IRS to appropriate a 

portion of our money to a peace tax fund.  We can ask Congress to fund a 

cabinet-level Presidential advisory Department of Peace.  Our paycheck is 

our power and our voice.  How should our money be spent?



<p>We decide.



<p><i>An admirer of Henry David Thoreau, Leah C. Wells advocates peaceful 

applications of tax dollars toward increasing teachers' salaries, funding 

to after school programs, college scholarships and social services.  She
