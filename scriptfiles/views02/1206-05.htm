<p>When I was growing up in Nicaragua, I used to spend my summer vacations in 

the beautiful mountains of Matagalpa and Jinotega, an area with some of the best 

coffee plantations in the country. My father would say with pride, ``Coffee produced 

in this region is among the finest in the world.''</p>

<p>Today the mountains remain as beautiful as ever, and Nicaraguans continue to 

rely on coffee as a main source of income. But coffee growers, who have faced 

difficult conditions throughout Nicaragua's tumultuous history, are coping with 

an unprecedented disaster. The relief organization Oxfam has documented in its 

new report ''Mugged: Poverty in Your Coffee Cup'' how a nearly 50 percent drop 

in the world coffee price in the past three years has left 25 million small-scale 

coffee producers in abject poverty around the world.</p>

<p>In Central America alone, some 600,000 coffee workers have been left unemployed 

in the past two years, according to a World Bank report. The plantations are being 

shut down as prices have plummeted to their lowest levels in a century. In Nicaragua, 

thousands of coffee farm workers are without food, land or hope.</p>

<p>The current coffee crisis must be placed in a historical perspective. The coffee 

exporting and importing countries created the International Coffee Agreement in 

1962 to manage worldwide supply and demand, and as a result, prices remained relatively 

high and stable. But in 1989 the agreement collapsed, in part because the U.S. 

government no longer viewed a managed coffee market as vital to national security. 

Instead it championed the ideology of free trade, coupled with ''structural adjustment'' 

policies imposed on developing countries by the International Monetary Fund and 

the World Bank. These institutions promoted a general model of export-led growth 

tied to developing countries' ``comparative advantage.''</p>

<p>This strategy often encouraged poor nations to increase production of green 

coffee and other raw materials, thereby deepening their dependence on primary 

commodities whose value has plummeted in the global marketplace. Not surprisingly, 

these production increases resulted in an oversupply of coffee that has depressed 

prices to record lows.</p>

<p>A decade ago, coffee-producing countries were receiving about $10 billion of 

a $30 billion annual retail market. Today, exporting countries' share has shrunk 

to less than $6 billion, while the value of the annual coffee retail market has 

nearly doubled, to $55 billion.</p>

<p>Who is getting ever-larger portions of the coffee bounty while everyone else 

is going hungry? The world's biggest coffee companies: Procter &amp; Gamble, Kraft, 

Sara Lee and Nestle. Meanwhile, millions of poor coffee growers have been left 

in economic ruin.</p>

<p>The system must be changed. I urge coffee companies, governments, international 

institutions and consumers to join me in supporting Oxfam's campaign to alleviate 

this humanitarian crisis. The campaign calls for these actions:</p>

<p><span class="bullet">&#149;&nbsp;</span>The ''Big Four'' coffee companies should 

demonstrate their commitment to addressing the crisis by paying farmers a decent 

price. Companies should review and overhaul their core sourcing practices and, 

as a down payment, immediately commit to buying at least 2 percent of their coffee 

on fair-trade terms. Fair-trade certification guarantees that farmers receive 

a minimum price of $1.26 per pound ($1.41 for organic beans) -- a far cry from 

the meager 20 to 30 cents per pound they receive now.</p>

<p><span class="bullet">&#149;&nbsp;</span>The United States and other coffee-consuming 

countries should provide political and financial support to resolve the oversupply 

problem, including monitoring coffee quality and destroying lowest-quality coffee 

stocks. The United States should rejoin the International Coffee Organization 

to contribute to multilateral efforts to address this global crisis.</p>

<p>I applaud the House of Representatives and the Senate for having passed resolutions 

that call on the United States to ''adopt a global strategy to respond to the 

current coffee crisis.'' In the next session they must take meaningful action 

to support a sustainable solution to this crisis.</p>

<p><span class="bullet">&#149;&nbsp;</span>International institutions such as 

the World Bank and the United Nations should develop a long-term strategy to tackle 

the problem of commodities pricing, provide additional debt relief, and support 

a major international stakeholders' conference on the coffee crisis next spring.</p>

<p>The price of coffee is a matter of life or death to millions of small-scale 

producers throughout the developing world. Free trade has left them in economic 

ruin. The time has come to make the coffee trade fair.</p>
