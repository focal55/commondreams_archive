<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->The mood was somber in Public School 3 this Tuesday, when members 

of New Yorkers Say No To War gathered to talk about Israel, Palestine and Us. 

New Yorkers Say No has been meeting each week since September 18th Each 

Tuesday the group gathers and not since that first week has the feeling in 

the room been so heavy, so tangible: Grief. 



<p>Grief sank the shoulders of the progressive, activist Jews in the room. New 

Yorkers Say No is full of them. A public school teacher, a professor, a 

therapist, a civil rights attorney, a performer, a theater critic, a 

politician, a journalist. The Jews in the room are men and women who've 

dedicated their lives to fighting racism, segregation, the slighting of the 

poor, the eradication of culture. Their parents did likewise, in this country 

and elsewhere. 



<p>"My father's dream of Israel is dead," said one who grew up in a Jewish 

family fighting apartheid in South Africa. "I believed there could be a 

democratic secular state," said another, who was born, as she put it "A 

Palestinian. In Palestine, before the founding of Israel."



<p>"We are losing what I thought it was to be a Jew," said one and then another. 

The Jewish tradition dying before us, explained the second, was the tradition 

of socialism, internationalism and standing up for justice for oppressed 

people everywhere. In face of Ariel Sharon's assault on the human rights of 

all West Bank Palestinians and in defiance of global opinion, she said, "I 

fear it's over. It's dead." 



<p>There are reasons to fear as well as to grieve. The weekend saw two marches 

in this city. On Saturday, thousands, largely but not exclusively Palestinian 

and Arab, marched against Israel's re-occupation of Palestinian lands. There 

were a handful of signs on the march which read "Sharon=Hitler," that equated 

the Star of David with the Swastika, one that read "Palestine Yes/Israel No."



<p>"I've marched many times," said a NYSAYNO member who had talked about 

travelling from Oklahoma to Israel in her youth and finding -- to her horror 

and disappointment -- racism in the so-called "promised land." A civil rights 

activist, a feminist, a leftist, she said she'd participated in no end of 

marches alongside Palestinians. "This was the first time I felt bad, scared, 

so sad." Tears cut off her voice. 



<p>Sunday brought thousands more, mostly Jewish New Yorkers into the streets in 

"solidarity with Israel." A couple of NYSAYNO members, like those who belong 

to the Israeli-based peace group, "Women in Black" had attended that march 

too. The Israeli Defense Force's assault on Palestinians puts Israel in more 

peril, not less, they say. To be "in solidarity" means to call for an end to 

occupation, they believe, but among the marchers for Israel they were a tiny 

few. "I felt entirely alone, and scared there, too." Said one.



<p>Grief brought tears to young eyes as well. Kate is quickly becoming a veteran 

activist through her work with the Direct Action Network of New York. She 

talked about a woman she knows: 21-year Palestinian American, Suraida Saleh, 

who was born in Washington DC at George Washington hospital. On April 5, 

undercover Israeli agents shot Saleh dead as her husband drove her to 

hospital in Ramallah, Kate explained, through sobs. She died protecting the 

18-month-old baby she was cradling in her lap. 



<p>Twenty-something year-old Trevor, a visitor from Seattle, was red-eyed when 

he talked about Hurriya. Hurriya is an eleven year-old Palestinian in whose 

family Trevor stayed this winter in Ramallah. A member of the ad-hoc 

International Solidarity Movement, Trevor is returning to Ramallah next week, 

he told NYSAYNO. Hurriya called him Easter morning to say that Israeli troops 

were on her doorstep. Her older brother Majid was taken away, she said. He 

has not returned. Hurriya is "a walking sun," said Trevor. When the young 

Israeli soldiers invaded her home, they told her they felt like monsters 

doing it, she told him. "One told her it made him feel sick," said Trevor. 



<p>Ariel, was born in Israel and served his time in the army there. "I 

discovered my "enemy" was human too," he said on Tuesday. "I remember my 

surprise."



<p>Is it possible to have a heart-to-heart talk about the Middle East in the 

heart of Manhattan? It's by no means easy, but it's possible, yes. Is there a 

hunger for this kind of talk? Absolutely. I had the honor of facilitating the 

conversation I've described here. On Working Assets Radio we've aired similar 

conversations with listeners, too. 



<p>It only takes two questions to start: What are we feeling? What can we do? 



<p>As Americans we're involved, politically and economically. Jew and non-Jew, 

Arab, Muslim, Buddhist, Hindu, WASP, our tax-dollars and our failure to act 

make the Sharon/Bush alliance possible. And people who believe in peace and 

justice are particularly summoned right now. Like the Israelis, we live in a 

nation that is waging war in "self defense." We too, live in a nation in 

which the context for what violence has been committed against us is roundly 

ignored; even considering that context is criticized as "capitulating to 

violence." 



<p>We too, live in a nation where the overwhelming majority of our peers support 

the use of violence to respond to violence and those who favor other 

responses have found no way yet to turn their neighbors around. You hear 

voices calling for Israelis to rise up against their government -- and many 

thousands have been doing just that this week, and been gassed and beaten by 

soldiers for their efforts. Do Americans think that Israelis can do in their 

democracy what we in the U.S. have so far not? 



<p>Many peoples of many lands have had unspeakable wrongs committed against 

them. Those wrongs smolder and will get expressed. Three of the last to speak 

at this week's New Yorkers Say No meeting were an African American man, a 

Persian woman, and a Native American. "I'm going to the West Bank on Sunday," 

said the last. "As a Native American I recognize occupation. I feel it." 



<p>A cycle of violence is taking us all down. Can we build a global movement 

that models a response to political violence that gets beyond talk of 

"capitulation to terrorism" and gets to the business of righting injustice? 

Can we begin to air our feelings about what we're seeing and on the basis of 

those feelings act? I believe we can.
