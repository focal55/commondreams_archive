<i> "You see, I stand in good relation to all that is beautiful."</i>

                            - from a poem by N. Scott Momaday



<p>This past week in D.C., the cherry blossom season peaked and is slowly 

ending.  Everywhere, branches raise swaying limbs coated tip to trunk with 

creamy blossoms.  This is what is real:  the single perfect pink-white 

cluster springing directly from the dark raw silk trunk of the cherry tree, 

just because.  Beauty, wherever we can find it, for the moment that it's 

granted. 



<p>Images from here, from there:  In Bethlehem, a woman weeping because the 

wounded man who sheltered in her home for a night, and immediately became her 

family, bled to death on her kitchen floor.  Ambulances are not allowed in 

Sharon's Operation Enduring Freedom.  In Washington, asked about the crisis 

in the Middle East and the rising price of oil, the White House said it sure 

showed the Senate needs to sign the president's energy plan.



<p>We stand in good relation to all that is beautiful.



<p>Our "war on terrorism," for example.  What we find beautiful includes Lady 

Liberty lifting her torch for immigrants, for the poor and the oppressed.  

Yet the war has put a blanket over the torch with secret imprisonments, 

selective rights for people on trial, and massive police roundups of 

immigrants.  What we find beautiful is the hope that America will be the 

voice for human rights everywhere.  Yet we're aligning with whoever will aid 

the "war," regardless of their rights abuses, and the administration urges 

the Voice of America (the very voice of the land that symbolizes freedom to 

the world) to censor its broadcasts.



<p>Isn't all the carnage that is happening in the world supposed to be for the 

sake of preserving what we love?  These wars we are fighting--Bush's war, 

Sharon's war with our money and weapons--are too crude and cruel and 

indiscriminate for that.  They're simply about killing "them" so that more of 

"us" might live.



<p>This is what is real:  individuals loving their lives.  That is all that we 

have.  It's fragile enough, scarce enough, without wars we don't believe in.



<p>There is a huge divide between the government's reality and our own.  It 

exists to perpetuate itself and its own aims.  But we can separate from it 

philosophically, spiritually, and take a stand.  "You see, I stand in good 

relation to all that is beautiful" isn't a boast.  It's an act of will, 

respect, and self-restraint in order that there will be beauty--reasons to 

live.



<p>It seems as if those leading us into insanity have all the power.  Our 

dissent is "disappeared" from the mainstream media, Congress is nearly 

silent, and Bush takes actions without constitutional authority at every 

opportunity.   But the world changes when beliefs change, regardless of the 

wishes of governments.  This time it may not take massive marches, or riots.  

Thoughts are changing; hearts are changing, quietly, about our relation to 

the earth, to things and to people.  Jim Hightower's Rolling Thunder movement 

is one that seeks to "take back the world."  The passionate, thoughtful words 

of many, many people on Internet sites make it clear there's something like a 

populist wildfire occurring in this country.  And around the world, in the 

midst of soldiers and demonstrators, there are thousands of peace activists.  

There's a sense that the governments of the world, with their love of wars 

and weapons, are on a separate evolutionary track from the people of the 

planet.  



<p>Is it possible in this age for us to control events?  It must be.  The 

conduct of war involves the destruction of everything that means life for the 

"enemy" and, utterly without intending it, for ourselves.



<p>The people taking a separate path are like individually rooted leaves of 

grass.  We have the whole force of the earth with us.  We are more powerful 

than we know.



<p>I propose a populist pledge.  "To all the people of the world (with your 

innocent children, your beloved hills and valleys, your joyful ceremonies, 

your blossoms and branches, your cherished dreams and memories):  'I stand in 

good relation to all that is beautiful."  Including you.



<p>Including you.</p>
