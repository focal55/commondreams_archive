<p>Democrats and Greens seem intent on re-fighting the last war

indefinitely as Democrats continue to blame Ralph Nader and the

Greens for sabotaging Al Gore's election chances in 2000. Greens

reply that Gore beat himself, though they add that even if they

helped Gore beat himself they had every right to do so.</P>



<P> It's a fascinating argument replayed on our letters page nearly

every edition since the election, but we're not so much interested in

fighting over the last war as we are in winning the next one. As we

have said before, a big part of that effort is to see that

Republicans don't regain control of the Senate.</P>



<P> Greens are now nominating candidates for this fall's election and

they promise aggressive slates. But Minnesota Greens haven't done

progressive populists any favors with their decision to challenge

Sen. Paul Wellstone. </P>



<P> Wellstone, perhaps the most progressive populist in the Senate,

already faced the determined opposition of the White House, which

recruited former St. Paul mayor Norm Coleman to run against him.

Republicans have made ousting Wellstone a priority precisely because

of his vocal opposition to most of what George W. Bush stands

for.</P>



<P> Ken Jerome-Stern writes on page 17 that a maturing Green Party

decided to nominate Ed McGaa, a political novice also known as "Eagle

Man," for the Senate. We disagree. Causing this mischief for

Wellstone, who supports many of the Green Party's core values, looks

more like a sign of the party's immaturity. </P>



<P> Green leaders in other parts of the country have said they intend

to put up candidates against moderate and conservative Democrats in

part to force Democrats to adopt more progressive positions. </P>



<P> Some Minnesota Greens said they supported McGaa because Wellstone

supported the use of military force against the perpetrators of the

Sept. 11 terrorist attack and he also voted for the USA PATRIOT Act.

However, McGaa, a US Marine Corps veteran of Korean and Vietnam wars,

also supports those measures and has professed that he is unfamiliar

with the Green Party's values. </P>



<P> The main attraction of McGaa appears to be that he is a Sioux and

and an author of books on Native American spirituality. Reports from

the convention indicate that delegates did not know much more about

his position on political issues.</P>



<P> Winona LaDuke, Nader's running mate in the 2000 race, appealed to

the convention to pass up the Senate race, but as Green spokeswoman

Holle Brian told The Progressive's Ruth Conniff, "People came to the

convention with the goal of endorsing a candidate come hell or high

water."</P>



<P> Ultimately, as we have said before, voters will make the choice.

We hope they recognize that Wellstone needs their support for a third

term. We also hope the Greens will choose their fights better.</P>



<P> A better course this year would be for Greens to offer to pull

back races this fall against Democrats who agree to support instant

runoff voting (IRV) and proportional representation.</P>



<P> Under the plurality voting system used in most Senate and

congressional races, it would be hard to endorse even so estimable a

candidate as our own columnist Ted Glick against as flawed a product

as Sen. Bob Torricelli, D-N.J., knowing that a vote for Glick would

help to reinstate Trent Lott as majority leader and remove the last

meaningful oversight to Dubya's rule by executive decree.</P>



<P> It would be better to see if Torricelli would commit to support

IRV, which would eliminate the threat of spoiler candidacies, and

proportional representation, which could be used to replace

congressional gerrymandering and ensure minority representation.</P>



<P> State legislatures can adopt instant runoff voting in state and

federal races but they need the approval of Congress to set up

proportional representation in congressional districts. Having

prominent Congress members pushing for those changes will perhaps

help get them out of committee. Republicans should be amenable, with

Ross Perot's spoiler role in 1992 and '96 presidential races vivid in

their memory.</P>



<P> If Torricelli and other Democrats agree by Oct. 1 to push for IRV

in statewide races and proportional representation in congressional

races, Greens might withdraw from those races. They could still

concentrate on races where they need a certain proportion of the vote

to remain on the ballot for the next election, as well as races

against those Demos who refuse to commit their support to IRV and

proportional representation.</P>



<P> In the meantime, Democrats had better get over their murderous

rage at the upstart Greens. They are here, they are determined to be

heard, and there are just enough of them to make life difficult for

the Democrats. It would be better for Democrats to work in coalition

with Greens, particularly when IRV would do away with the spoiler

role that neither side wants the Greens to maintain. And with Bush's

Justice Department bringing back the FBI's domestic spying program

and sending off US citizens to military brigs for indeterminate

detention, there just aren't enough progressive voters out there to

allow us the luxury of splitting our side and allowing Bush and his

right-wing cohorts to consolidate their hold on the government.</P>
