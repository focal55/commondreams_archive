<p> It seems that the FBI is likely to be

rewarded for the missed warnings, fumbled

intelligence, and bureaucratic foul-ups that

preceded September 11. Attorney General John

Ashcroft has announced that the FBI is

changing its rules so that it can spy on domestic organizations, even where there is no evidence of specific criminal activity.



         <p>It is doubtful that the Administration

could get away with these changes if the real

functioning of the FBI as a political police force

were better known. The press has referred to the

agency's COINTELPRO (from

counterintelligence program) operation of the

1960s and 70s as though it were ancient history,

a minor aberration of the FBI's quirky and

fanatical director J. Edgar Hoover.



         <p>In fact COINTELPRO was a massive

operation to infiltrate, disrupt, harass, and

otherwise interfere with the lawful activities of

civil rights advocates, peace activists, religious organizations, and others. One of the FBI's most famous and hated targets was the late Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. In a covert operation that now reads like a B-grade movie script, the FBI actually made a serious effort to blackmail Dr. King into committing suicide.



         <p>Less well known is that FBI operations

against law-abiding citizens did not end when

these abuses were exposed in the 1970s. We

know that they continued well into the 1980s,

when the Reagan and then Bush (the elder)

administrations faced mounting domestic

opposition to their wars in Central America.

Death squads in El Salvador were murdering

religious workers and clergy, the Guatemalan

military was carrying out what is now

acknowledged as genocide against its

indigenous population, and an army of terrorists

was trying to overthrow the government of

Nicaragua.



         <p>The US government was supporting and

sponsoring all of these crimes with billions of

dollars, and that did not sit well with many

Americans. I was one of them, and joined a

student group called the Latin American

Solidarity Committee at the University of

Michigan. Unbeknownst to us, the watchful

eyes of the FBI were closely monitoring our

actions.



         <p>So closely, in fact, that one of our

members wrote a history of the group's activities

with the help of documents obtained from the

FBI under the Freedom of Information Act. We

enjoyed seeing all of our names in print, and

pored over the documents with a mixture of awe

and laughter, amazed that the federal

government could have taken our little student

group so seriously as to keep track of everything

we did and who attended our meetings.



         <p>As it turned out, this was part of a

nationwide spying operation involving all 59

FBI field offices. The whole thing might be

secret to this day, if not for fact that one of the

Bureau's informants had a change of heart. He

had infiltrated a community of religious activists

in Texas, and later said that he had second

thoughts when his supervisor suggested that he

sleep with a nun in order to discredit them.



         <p>The Dallas Morning News broke the

story, and the FBI was forced to conduct an

internal investigation. FBI director William S.

Sessions (1987-93) told Congress that the

investigation had left "no stone unturned" and

that his G-men had stopped their "counter-

terrorism" -- yes, they actually called it that --

operations by June of 1985.



         <p>Sessions was lying: documents released

to our local group showed that their spying in

Ann Arbor continued well beyond that date. But

the press accepted that the FBI had changed its

ways, and today the whole story of their illicit

activities in the 1980s has disappeared into the

memory hole.



         <p>That is a shame, because there is no

evidence that the FBI ever reformed itself, and

now we have two new reasons to worry about it.

One is the blank check that Ashcroft has handed

to the FBI, which threatens our civil liberties.

The second is that after decades of crying

"wolf" to justify its functioning as an American

KGB, the FBI is now charged with protecting us

from real terrorist threats.



         <p>There has never been an accounting of

how much of the FBI's resources have been

devoted to policing the constitutionally

protected activities of our citizens. Congress

should demand this accounting as it examines

the massive intelligence failure that preceded

September 11.



         <p>Historians like to say that we ignore the

past at our own peril; in the case of the FBI, it

may be literally true.
