<p>WASHINGTON, DC - It is becoming increasingly apparent these days that corporate 

reform isn’t really happening in Washington. 

<p>In the last few weeks, we’ve witnessed a below-the-radar rollback of the Sarbanes-Oxley 

Act, continued corporate earnings restatements, foot-dragging by a Congress unwilling 

to move ahead on the next round of critical corporate reforms, and the continuation 

of brazen Bush administration policies to further deregulate the energy and telecom 

sectors. 

<p>Chances are, though, most people didn’t really notice. That’s because they’ve 

probably been paying attention to the latest developments on Iraq. How cleverly 

Bush has been able to change the subject. 

<p>Whatever happened to all that concern about the more than one million Americans 

who lost their jobs in the cascading corporate scandals? What about the $175 billion 

investors lost in their retirement accounts? Have we forgotten already about the 

despicable behavior by executives at Enron, WorldCom, Tyco? 

<p>Not so fast, say more than 200 groups who this week joined forces to release 

the Unity Platform on Corporate Accountability, a comprehensive outline of specific 

proposals designed to significantly transform the relationship between corporations 

and society. 

<p>The groups, which include Public Citizen, Global Exchange, the Institute for 

Policy Studies, Rainforest Action Network, Co-op America, 50 Years is Enough, 

CorpWatch, the Alliance for Democracy, and Citizen Works, want to make sure corporate 

excess doesn’t go away as an issue until it goes away as a problem. 

<p>The Unity Platform "represents a cohesive analysis shared by diverse strands 

of the grassroots corporate accountability movement," said Charlie Cray, director 

of the Corporate Reform Campaign at Citizen Works. "Despite the inertia in Washington, 

it reflects the popular view that there needs to be further and deeper change 

in how we govern corporations." 

<p>“Corporate greed and abuse remains one of the top issues for most Americans; 

it will be a factor in the elections and will come back strong in the months to 

come,” added John Cavanagh, Director of the Institute for Policy Studies. 

<p>The groups’ agenda calls for public funding of elections, an overhaul of corporate 

governance, controls on speculative investment, stronger labor and environmental 

obligations, an end to international corporate welfare, and a redefinition of 

financial accountability, among other proposals. 

<p>“We should be at a political crossroads today, developing ways to foster real 

corporate accountability,” said Joshua Karliner, Senior Adviser to San Francisco-based 

CorpWatch. “Unfortunately the drum beat of war is drowning out the public outcry 

against corporate corruption. This not only undermines corporate reform, but also 

creates a climate in which Bush's agenda to further deregulate big business, one 

of the principle causes of Enron, may well prevail." 

<p>As Wenonah Hauter, Director of Public Citizen's Critical Mass Energy & Environment 

Program notes: "Despite the crushing failure of telecom and energy deregulation, 

the Bush Administration continues to advocate for increased deregulation of these 

sectors.” 

<p>The groups decided to release the platform this week in response to the disappointing 

corporate reform inertia in Washington to return some energy back into the important 

work of curbing corporate power and greed. 

<p>Such a spark is much needed. After all, consider these recent developments:

<p> 

<ul>

<li>Instead of choosing someone with the relevant skills to head the accounting 

industry oversight board created by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, Harvey Pitt nominated 

William Webster, the retired CIA and FBI head whom even the Wall St. Journal described 

as “Pitt’s factotum.”<br>

</li>

<li>Bush recently proposed cutting the SEC’s budget from the $776 million targeted 

in Sarbanes-Oxley to $568 million. Even Harvey Pitt has said this will prevent 

the agency from undertaking key initiatives to protect investors.<br>

</li>

<li>Under the guise of simplifying the tax code, the Treasury Department hinted 

to the Washington Post that it is developing plans to scrap the corporate income 

tax altogether and replace it with a regressive value-added tax.<br>

</li>

<li>Although deregulation has cost consumers billions and resulted in the inefficient 

allocation of capital due to fraudulent corporate practices, key Bush Administration 

appointees - Pat Wood at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and Michael 

Powell at the Federal Communications Commission – continue to call for increased 

deregulation. “Wood is pushing his Standard Market Design despite the pleas by 

18 states to cease this deregulation nightmare,” says Public Citizen’s Wenonah 

Hauter. “And Powell has publicly stated that much of the $2 trillion meltdown 

in the telecom industry is not the FCC's concern, and instead is pushing for increased 

deregulation of the Baby Bells."<br>

</li>

<li>International financial institutions continue to subsidize irresponsible corporations 

like Enron. In the coming weeks, the U.S. taxpayer-funded Inter-American Development 

Bank is expected to vote on financing $125 million in loans to Enron and Shell 

for a controversial pipeline in Bolivia.<br>

</li>

<li>Congressional foot-dragging has failed to fix even the most obvious problems 

of corporate greed, such as a broken pension system and a wave of corporate relocations 

to offshore tax havens. </li>

</ul>

<p>Meanwhile, little has changed in Corporate America. According to an October 

2002 study of 1,245 US firms by the Investor Research Center, 72% of fees paid 

by firms to their auditors were actually for non-audit services, the same exact 

percentage as one year ago. And the General Accounting Office (GAO) recently reported 

that corporate restatements rose from 225 in 2001 to an estimated 250 in 2002. 

In the last week alone Qwest, AOL, Tyco, MTS Systems, and Bristol-Myers Squibb 

have all announced new restatements.
