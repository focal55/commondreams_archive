<p>Some of the worst tragedies of human history occur when elites are incapable 

of acting in their own interest. The waning years of ancient Rome, for example, 

were full of misguided political and military adventures that brought death and 

destruction to the elites, their allies and their enemies alike. Unfortunately 

we are again facing such a situation. 

<P>It seems inevitable that the United States will soon conduct a full-scale war 

in Iraq. The US is also engaged in a war on terrorism that may extend to all regions 

of the globe. And, most importantly, the US has embarked on a foreign policy of 

"security" that dictates that it not merely react to threats but anticipate them 

with pre-emptive strikes. 

<P>These military adventures are one sign that the US is fast becoming an imperialist 

power along the old European model, but on a global scale. It is imposing itself 

as the active and determining center of the full range of world affairs, military, 

political, and economic. All exchanges and decisions are being forced, in effect, 

to pass through the US. 

<P>The ultimate hubris of the US political leaders is their belief that they can 

not only force regime change and name new leaders for various countries, but also 

actually shape the global environment - an audacious extension of the old imperialist 

ideology of mission civilisatrice . Regime change in Iraq is only the first step 

in an ambitious project to reconstruct the political order of the entire Middle 

East. And their designs of power extend well beyond that. 

<P>Many political and economic elites around the world, however, do not favor 

the creation of a new US imperialism. One common view is that European political 

leaders generally oppose US unilateralism because it excludes them and prefer 

instead multilateral political and military solutions. What are most significant, 

however, are not the conflicting interests that separate US elites from others, 

but rather their common interests. 

<P>The common interests of the global elites are most visible in the economic 

sphere. Business leaders around the globe recognize that imperialism is bad for 

business because it sets up barriers that hinder global flows. The potential profits 

of capitalist globalization, which whet the appetites of business elites everywhere 

only a few years ago, depend on open systems of production and exchange. This 

is equally true for the captains of capital in the US. Even for the US industrialists 

drunk on oil, their real interests lie in the potential profits of capitalist 

globalization

<P>Their common interests are equally visible from the perspective of security. 

It is foolish to believe that the removal of a few malefactors, such as Osama 

bin Laden and Saddam Hussein, will provide security. Not even the US leaders have 

the illusion that this war will bring peace. They see it rather as a long-lasting 

and perhaps interminable war driven by continually emerging threats. US military 

actions will, in fact, most likely only feed the antagonisms created by the inequalities 

of wealth and power around the world, increasing exponentially the insecurity 

of global elites. This is doubly true for US elites since unilateral military 

actions paint a bull's-eye on the US for anyone seeking to attack the center of 

global domination. 

<P>However, there is an alternative to US imperialism: global power can be organized 

in a decentered form, which Toni Negri and I call "empire". This is not merely 

a multilateral coalition of leading nation states. Think of it as multilateralism 

squared. Empire is a network composed of different kinds of powers, including 

the dominant nation states, supranational organizations, such as the United Nations 

and the IMF, multinational corporations, NGOs, the media, and others. There are 

hierarchies among the powers that constitute empire but despite their differences 

they function together in the network. 

<P>This decentered network power of empire corresponds to the interests of global 

elites because it both facilitates the potential profits of capitalist globalization 

and displaces or defuses potential security threats. Once empire is firmly established 

as the prevailing form of global rule, those who oppose the domination of global 

elites in the name of equality, freedom, and democracy will certainly find ways 

to struggle against it. But that does not mean that we prefer imperialism today. 

<P>We can be confident that in the long run their real interests will lead global 

elites to support empire and refuse any project of US imperialism. In the coming 

months, and perhaps years, we may face a tragedy that we read about in the darkest 

periods of human history, when elites are incapable of acting in their own interest.</p>
