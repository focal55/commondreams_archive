<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->Americans live in precarious times.  I mean the ending of the nation’s 

record economic expansion last March and the terrorist crimes of Sept. 11.



<p>Keeping a job is becoming more difficult.  The last hired are the first laid 

off.  The Northeastern University's Center for Labor Market Studies found 

that young workers, ages 16 to 24, accounted for 95 percent of those fired 

after Sept. 11.



<p>Northeastern University professor Andrew Sum, who co-authored the study, 

said the collapse of technology companies that employed recent graduates and 

those still enrolled in college was also a factor driving the increase in 

youth out of work.  In addition, many fired young workers are not eligible 

for jobless benefits because their earnings fail to meet the minimum 

required to collect, he noted.



<p>As the full extent of faked corporate debt and earnings emerges from the 

collapses of Enron and Global Crossing, the 401(k) retirement funds of these 

companies’ employees have vanished like a fist when you open your palm.  

Falling stock prices that flattened these companies hit workers the hardest. 

  This is a preview of what privatizing Social Security could mean for 

millions of Americans’ retirements.  There’s still plenty of bad 

private-sector debt out there.



<p>In the meantime, the U.S. government has installed an interim government in 

Afghanistan.  This is basically what the old European empires did in their 

colonies.  Corporate journalists don’t cover American imperialism and stay 

employed for long.  Just ask journalist Robert Parry, whose honest coverage 

of U.S. foreign policy under the Reagan/Bush I administrations earned him a 

ticket out of corporate  magazines and newspapers.



<p>Closer to home, many states are facing fiscal crises.  California is no 

exception.  Electricity deregulation drained the state’s coffers as sales 

tax revenue tumbled.  At the same time there are people nearing the end of 

the 60-month term limits for federal cash assistance mandated by former 

President Clinton’s 1996 welfare reform.  Can California and other 

cash-strapped states pick up where the federal government walked away?



<p>Currently, Democrats and Republicans echo the Bush administration’s call for 

global war against the threat of terrorism, personified in the “axis of 

evil” the president outlined in his recent State of the Union address.  Rep. 

Barbara Lee is the exception that proves the rule.  Meanwhile, the U.S. 

military-industrial complex marches on.  The president has proposed a fiscal 

year 2003 budget that is a cash cow for weapons contractors.  The general 

public should be so lucky with his budget proposal.



<p>Luck, if you can call it that with a straight face, is what America had 

during the 1990s.  Then, a big, overvalued credit bubble drove economic 

growth.  This bubble depended in part on a strong dollar, the world’s main 

currency.  Continually rising stock prices also helped spur consumer 

spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of the nation’s economic 

activity.



<p>This decade of debt-driven growth followed the end of the Cold War.  One of 

this war’s hallmarks was U.S. politicians and pundits scorning the lack of 

press freedom in the state-run propaganda outlets of America’s official 

enemies.



<p>In the U.S. now there is a similar totalitarian compliance in corporate 

journalism to political power.  Take the slant on the Bush administration’s 

Iraq policy, which claims that this nation is a threat to the security of 

the United States.  Virtually the rest of the world opposes this view that 

Iraq, a vanquished Middle East nation, is a security threat to the U.S. way 

of life.



<p>To be sure, the threat to world security, environmental and social, is the 

U.S. lifestyle of being the world's largest consumer of oil.  What is at 

stake for the Bush administration is U.S. energy corporations' control of 

Iraq, which has the world’s second-largest estimated crude oil reserves.



<p>An American military invasion of Iraq to overthrow Iraqi leader Saddam 

Hussein, a pre-Gulf War ally turned American enemy, would ultimately 

increase U.S. control over Iraq’s capacity to produce oil.  Such a move by 

the Bush administration would hamper U.S. competitors such as France and 

Russia. Meanwhile, lethal economic sanctions persist against the Iraqi 

people, devastating the children, aged and infirm.  Their bitter fate is a 

crime against humanity.



<p>At this writing, corporate editors and reporters are far too busy painting 

U.S. foreign policy as a morality play between the forces of lightness and 

darkness.  Accordingly, the American public is largely uninformed about 

deadly policies in Iraq and other countries such as Afghanistan and Colombia 

where acquiring more energy resources is the corporate prize behind the 

smoke about a battle between good and evil.  Corporate-led foreign policies 

lead to war.  The populations of  warrior nations such as the U.S. foot the 

bill.



<p>In America now there are 40 million people who lack health care, while 

upper-income households get tax cuts.  The poor and nonwhite fill the 

nation’s prisons and jails, as corporate executives fleece taxpayers and 

workers.



<p>Now it’s certainly true that many Americans may not want to spend time with 

U.S. government foes such as Iraq’s Hussein.  However, he’s not making it 

harder for them to find and keep a job that covers the costs of living.  The 

bottom line?  It is unclear if the American public will continue to support 

war abroad while turning a blind eye to class conflict at home.



<p>America's economic contraction and militaristic expansion are the terrible 

twins of corporate capitalism, impacting many people domestically and 

globally.  It’s a small world and getting smaller.
