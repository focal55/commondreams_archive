Is there a limit to economic growth?  To publicly ask this question is 

almost heresy in the U.S., where the public mind is washed daily with images 

of and phrases about corporate commodities.



<p>Meanwhile, rising U.S. oil consumption helped increase the nation’s trade 

deficit in January.  There’s more than meets the eye to the growth of both.



<p>With about five percent of the Earth’s population, the U.S. has the world’s 

biggest economy and is the leading user of oil.  These two factors are 

related.



<p>A modern capitalist economy runs on oil.  In the U.S. now, some two-thirds 

of that oil is used to power ground transportation vehicles—cars, busses, 

trucks and vans.



<p>In early March, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan suggested that the U.S. economy 

has begun to grow again.  Officially, the economy had been in a year-long 

recession.



<p>Crucially, U.S. economic growth means more oil consumption. This, in turn, 

is helping to warm the planet through the emission of greenhouse gasses.



<p>These gases trap the Sun’s heat near the Earth. We get global warming that 

changes the Earth’s climate.



<p>There are many examples of this happening.  Here’s one, distant but very 

important.



<p>Global climate change is probably the main reason that the Larsen B Ice 

Shelf recently collapsed at the Antarctic Peninsula.  The collapse of this 

ice shelf and others could make world sea levels rise catastrophically, 

several scientists have warned.



<p>Terrifying?  Absolutely.



<p>However, the world’s leading economy, run by industrial corporations and 

financial institutions, sneers at an ecological limit to economic growth.  

Thus U.S. elites shape the world around us.



<p>Still, the Earth’s capacity to absorb greenhouse gasses and sustain life is 

finite.  My 12-year-old understands this concept.



<p>Yet the power of industrial and financial elites in the U.S. trumps such 

knowledge.  This is the path of unsustainability.



<p>Speaking of unsustainable growth, we turn to the U.S. trade deficit, which 

reached $28.5 billion in January, up 15.4 percent from December.  Fueled in 

part by borrowed money mainly from the European Union and Japan, the U.S. 

trade deficit—which dropped last year to $417.4 billion from the all-time 

high of $444.7 billion in 2000—is the difference between what the nation 

imports and exports.



<p>Contributing to the trade deficit in January was the oil bill paid by the 

U.S. to foreigners, who supply over half of the oil the nation used.  In 

January, foreign oil was priced higher and the U.S. consumption of it 

increased.



<p>The nation’s oil production peaked in 1971, as geophysicist M. King Hubbert 

had predicted it would in 1956 http://www.hubbertpeak.com/.  Currently, the 

Persian Gulf region supplies about a quarter of the oil used in the U.S.



<p>And a U.S.-led military campaign against Iraq?  It could increase the price 

of the region’s oil by disrupting its production.



<p>Note that when the U.S. economy went into slow/no growth last year, the 

trade deficit dropped.  Apparently last January, growth  began and the use 

of oil rose, widening the deficit.



<p>For a moment, let’s put aside the contradiction between ecology and the 

economy.  Consider how long the U.S. economy can sustain its trade imbalance 

with the rest of the world.



<p>A recent forecast by Goldman Sachs warned that as the U.S. economy grows, 

private-sector debt held by foreigners rises.  Thus the interest payments on 

that debt will also rise.



<p>Today, the high security and value of the dollar versus other world 

currencies (euro and yen) play a big part in attracting funds from abroad.  

Yet what if in the future, despite the strong dollar, the growing 

indebtedness (principal and interest) of the U.S. deficit begins to make 

foreign lenders nervous?



<p>It’s been said that capitalism’s critics have accurately predicted one of 

its past nine economic crises.  Hardly such a critic, Goldman Sachs is 

forecasting that "the long-term outlook for the dollar remains very 

precarious," as <a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/business/comment/story.jsp?story=3D274182" target="_new">reported in The Independent</a> on Mar. 14.



<p>Thus a leading financial firm is painting a gloomy picture about foreigners 

continuing to lend money to the U.S. for the nation to buy commodities such 

as oil on credit.  Economists have a technical name for this: capital 

flight, and it  would cause financial hardship for the U.S. economy and 

major aftereffects around the world.



<p>Alarming?  Yes.  Avoidable?  Maybe, if for starters the U.S. public can wake 

up and reject a world of corporate commodities for something better.



<p>For now, however, the U.S. economy is a driving force behind world 

ecological and financial fragility.  If this doesn’t indicate future shocks, 

perhaps we need a new definition of the term.
