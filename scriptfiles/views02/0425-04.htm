How many Palestinians are dead in Jenin? Dozens? Hundreds?

How many hundreds? If the number turns out to be exactly

641, or exactly 139, will that be a PR "victory"

for the Palestinians, or for the Israelis? As journalists

are lining up to declare the "victor," CNN runs a web poll about each side's credibility. Soon we may see the dead jostling with the living in CNN's sordidly

named "crossfire." 

<P>

As a mental exercise, let each of us decide at exactly how

many deaths the scale tips from the Israeli side to the

Palestinian side, at what point an incursion becomes a slaughter,

at what point a slaughter becomes a massacre, at what point

a massacre becomes a genocide.

<P>

This is all very important, PR-wise. 

<P>

For eleven days, IDF soldiers have been preventing journalists,

medics, rescue teams and aid convoys from entering Jenin.

<P>

This is how they "protect" the truth inside from all those outside who might want to

"misuse" it against Israel. 

<P>

After all, the truth is such a terrible weapon. It would

be wrong to allow one side to have more of it than the other.

There must be balance. But only regarding the truth. There

need not be balance in firepower, for example. It is O.K.

that Israel has nuclear weapons and Apache helicopters,

paid for by American taxpayers who can't afford

to pay for adequate health care, while Palestinians fight

with rifles and home-made explosives. 

<P>

There need not be

balance about land either. It is O.K. that Israelis control

all the land and Palestinians none.

<P>

Nor is balance a requirement

regarding liberty, or human rights, which Israelis enjoy

and Palestinians do not. But there must be balance in describing

what happened in Jenin. 

<P>

That is why accuracy is very important in Jenin. Was it exactly

a "massacre," as Perez called it and then denied,

or a "devastation," or just an "incursion"

that used "minimal force"

to achieve "necessary goals,"

such as showing Palestinians who's the boss and what you

get for upsetting him? If you use too strong a word, if

you match the expression to the stench of the decomposing bodies, Israel

will reprimand you, brand you an anti-Semite, maybe even

expel you. Be forewarned.

<P>

<P>

But what can one do? Even the cautious and pro-Israeli <I>The Economist</I> saw clear evidence of war crimes. U.N. envoy Terje Roed-Larsen described the devastation in Jenin

as "horrific beyond belief," and said it was "morally repugnant"

that Israel blocked humanitarian emergency workers from

entering Jenin for 11 days. Israel is still blocking rescue

teams, while Perez is pondering whether to send Roed-Larsen

home with a note to his parents or merely revoke his weekly

allowance. The undiplomatic words of the Norwegian diplomat,

but not the undiplomatic reality these words refer to, really

hurt Israel's highly evolved moral sensibility.

<P>

Having agreed to it earlier, the government of Israel is

now blocking the UN fact-finding mission to Jenin. The

problem, according to Israel, is that too many of the members

have "humanitarian" experience, and

might not understand the requirements of warfare. It is

easy to imagine the people and the resumes Israel would

want to see instead: maybe a few Latin American death-squad

leaders; or Lt. William Calley, whose experience at Mai

Lai could prove invaluable in determining what is and what

isn't a massacre; or perhaps the French General Paul Aussaresses,

commander of the 1957 French paratroopers' attack on the

Casbah of Algier. To top it all, war crimes connoisseur Madeleine

Albright, or even Henri Kissinger, could provide moral leadership,

as well as much needed verbal elasticity. 

<P>

As long as there is balance.



<P>

For the Israeli public and politicians, the widespread, and

very unbalanced, opprobrium is just one more affirmation

that the "whole world is against us."

<P>

Echoing popular sentiment, Israel's President Moshe Katsav

whines: "with all due respect and esteem for people of conscience

and the bleeding-heart liberals of the world, I don't understand

why they've clamped their mouths shut for a year and a half

while the cruelest of unprecedented terrorist acts were

committed against Israelis citizens everywhere." 

<P>

President Katsav, are all the inhabitants of Jenin terrorists? Are most?

Is God's own standard, of requiring only ten righteous men to save a city,

too lax for you? What part of "collective punishment is a war crime" don't

you understand?

<P>

The fact that the eruption of violence during the last eighteen months

baffles you so much makes me wonder, President Katsav. Do you understand the idea of

liberty? Have you ever read the universal declaration of human rights? 

<P>

Do you understand that "universal" means "applies to everybody equally"?

<P>

Does the declination of possessive pronouns confuse

you? Surely you are at ease with "mine" and "ours." But do you also

understand the concepts behind "yours," "his," "hers," and "theirs"? When I

look at the map of the land grab for your illegal settlements, I have

serious doubts.

<P>

Are you troubled why "people of conscience"

do not condemn terrorism? Even to make such an accusation

you must be living in an alternate universe. But I will

answer your whining twice nevertheless. 

<P>

The long answer, President Katsav, "with

all due respect and esteem," is

that the suicide bombers did not land in Israel from outer

space. The explosive belts might as well carry a label that

reads "made in the Greater Eretz Israel."

<P>

The suicide bombs are the mutant flowers of Israel's brutalizing

occupation, springing from the seeds of the 54-year-long

dehumanization of Palestinians. They are the ghosts of your

brutality coming back to haunt you, the mementos of your

war against memory. 

<P>

The massive and deliberate destruction of Palestinian civil

records in the West Bank in the last weeks is but the most

recent chapter in a war against Palestinian memory that

began in 1948, with the annihilation of 400 Palestinian

villages. But you seem to learn nothing from history, indeed

from your own history: ghosts always return, each time more

violently.

<P>

For those ready to die, their spiritless hatred towards you

is what remains after you have bulldozed their past and

their future. Whether you like it or not, they are your

bastard offspring. Everything they know about hate,

you taught them.  Everything they forgot about humanity,

you made them forget. Give them a hug now, as they have proven

themselves worthy of their parents – you.

<P>



The short answer, President Katsav, is really short: just

get out!

<P>

Call the army home. Call the occupation off. And get out

of the Occupied Territories. Just get out!

<P>

Don't mumble about how "difficult"

or "complex" the situation is. It isn't. You

are the oppressor. You are the occupier. You park your tanks

on plundered land. You fill your swimming pools with stolen

water. You kill and destroy in order to inherit. So don't

bullshit about "the situation." Just get out!

<P>

Stop abusing people. Stop abusing language. Stop spinning

your own moral cocoon. Stop turning your country and your

people into a metaphor of evil. Just get out! 

<P>

Don't wait for Bush. Don't wait for Arafat. Don't wait to

negotiate with the mythical Palestinian leader who will

finally accept your dominion. There is nothing to negotiate

about. Just get out! 

<P>

Take your rabid Jewish fundamentalists from Kiriat Arba and

Beit El with you. Load them on buses and pump the gas pedal

until the hills of the West Bank vanish in the rear mirror.

Just get out! 

<P>

Gather your thugs from the borderless "border

police," give them scholarships and send them to school

again. Let them discover there is more to life than beating

people to a pulp. Just get out! 

<P>

Take your checkpoints, with all their petty humiliations

and deadly snipers, with you. And just get out!

<P>

Send the Shin-Bet packing. After 35 years, the world had

enough of your clever jailers and torturers. Take them with

you and just get out!

<P>

Let your hideous bulldozers loose on the illegal settlements

of Ma'ale Edomim, Har Homa and Gilo. There is plenty of

demolition work for them there. Let them continue until

the mountain line bears no more memory of your rape. Then

just get out!

<P>

Don't apologize. Don't justify. Don't explain. There is nothing

left to explain. Honestly. Just get out!

<P>

Don't even worry about the thousands of olive trees, symbols

of peace, you uprooted. Someone will plant them again. 

<P>

Just get out!
