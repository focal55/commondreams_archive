<p>Like a lung cancer patient reaching for a pack of smokes, the Bush administration 

has greeted the latest run of gloomy economic news -- Tuesday's stock market plunge, 

a ballooning federal deficit, flagging consumer confidence, mounting unemployment, 

not to mention those pictures of Dennis Kozlowski literally wrapping himself in 

the flag in his yacht over Labor Day -- with a nerve-settling puff of its favorite 

brand of economic relief: tax cuts for the rich. And considering the imprudence 

of that idea, maybe they're smoking something a little stronger than Marlboros. 

<p>According to the White House, the proposals being considered include tax incentives 

to encourage stock market investment and capital gains tax cuts -- on top, of 

course, of the massive impending tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans already 

signed into law. Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill defined the party line this way 

earlier this summer: "This is how we create economic prosperity -- not by strangling 

people with interference and regulation and punishing restrictions on trade and 

job creation, but by opening the world up." 

<p>In other words, meet the new New Economy, same as the old New Economy. Forget 

the inconvenient fact that deregulation hasn't worked -- that it's given us an 

airline industry on the verge of collapse, higher electric and cable bills, a 

savings and loan disaster, to say nothing of Enron, WorldCom, Adelphia, AOL, Xerox, 

Merrill Lynch, et al -- the invisible hand is still the magical answer to all 

our woes. 

<p>How did the free-market ideology of the Reagan revolution come to be the political 

consensus of our times? How did we get suckered by the fairy tale that as long 

as people kept shopping, the market could keep our prosperity going as far as 

the eye could see? And that by voting with our credit cards, we could spread the 

gospel of prosperous democracy to any corner of the earth where American products 

were made or consumed. Like all fairy tales, it's a nice story. But it's time 

to acknowledge that this one didn't have a happily-ever-after ending. 

<p>Over the last twenty years, Americans have been doused with regular sermons 

on the supposed correlation between unregulated markets and higher standards of 

living. In the process, the American people were demoted from citizens to consumers, 

and sold a bill of goods about how the almighty market was the essential foundation 

of democracy. Accepted notions of public protections -- of the environment, of 

workers, of the poor -- were scrapped, cast out as superannuated relics. Compassion 

became the 8-track player of public policy. 

<p>In the course of selling us on buying, the market-worshippers shredded the 

modern social contract, the hard-fought consensus that had emerged since the New 

Deal, and which ordered our political priorities, our communal concern for the 

most vulnerable, and our disapproval of huge inequalities. We were now supposed 

to believe that all that could be left up to the soulless, self-correcting calculus 

of supply and demand. The free market had become the People's Market and would, 

of course, take care of the people. 

<p>Once the province of Republican supply-siders, this all-encompassing faith 

was warmly embraced in the 90s by New Democrats. And some old ones, too. Even 

Jesse Jackson rang the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange and created 

a Wall Street Project. And according to a representative of the NYSE, there is 

"no shortage" of celebrities willing to ring the bell, smiling and applauding 

even after a 300-point drop. 

<p>The media also did their part, hyping stories that made it seem like everyone 

was making money investing. Who can forget the Beardstown Ladies, those best-selling, 

stock-pickin' grannies from Illinois who were supposedly making a 23 percent return 

in the market? Or all those Millionaires Next Door -- like Anne Scheiber, the 

lowly government auditor who, by patiently investing in stocks, turned $5,000 

into a $22 million fortune? 

<p>Stressed out about retirement? Your kids' college tuition? A family health 

emergency? Not to worry! The Market would take care of all that. Even being downsized 

could be made fun and profitable. After AT&T laid off 40,000 workers in January 

1996, hedge-fund manager Jim Cramer wrote a cover story for the New Republic entitled 

"Let Them Eat Stocks." In it he proposed a simple solution. "Just give the laid-off 

employees stock options," he exulted, "let them participate in the stock appreciation 

that their firings caused." And why not toss in a year's-worth of Turtle Wax while 

you're at it, Jim? 

<p>The future that Wall Street had dreamt of for decades -- free of pesky regulators, 

snooping politicians and profit-sapping social activists -- had finally arrived 

in a golden, irrationally exuberant dawn. Just as communists had promised a utopia 

in which the state would wither away, the free-market ideologues in control in 

the nineties promised us that we would reach Nirvana when all government intervention 

would, well, just wither away. 

<p>We would then find ourselves in a glorious Brave New World. Marxists and MSNBC 

stock analysts together at last, holding hands and feverishly chanting: "From 

each according to his culpability, to each according to his greed." 

<p>It would take a while -- and the fall of Ken Lay, Bernie Ebbers, Sam Waksal, 

et al -- before the invisible hand was exposed as a pickpocket. But even after 

the free market parade had to be called off on account, not of rain, but of fraud, 

we have begun to hear the trickle-down marching bands warming up in the distance, 

ready to play their familiar siren songs. It's time we resuscitated Mark Russell's 

definition of trickle-down as "something that benefits David Rockefeller now and 

Jay Rockefeller later." Or, to be a bit more current, George Herbert Walker Bush 

then, and George Walker Bush now. 

<p>There's another blast from the Reagan past that is a little more relevant to 

most Americans' current financial health than trickle down dreams. Ask yourself, 

my friends, are you better off today, after all that tax cutting and deregulating, 

than you were four years ago?
