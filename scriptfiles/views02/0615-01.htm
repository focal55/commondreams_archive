<p> In the U.S., the attack on nonwhite people generally has foreshadowed the 

current assault on the general public’s civil rights.  The concealment of 

this connection reveals its importance.



<p>That is, skin-color has been a fault line in the class war waged by the few 

against the many in the U.S.  This aggression has taken different forms in 

different places.



<p>One recent form is the fraudulent Drug War.  In brief, this war has been an 

exercise in state power (executive, legislative and judicial branches of 

government) against the nonwhite population in the U.S.



<p>The Drug War has partly resulted in the incarceration of low-level illegal 

drug sellers and users, mainly people of color, with longer and longer 

prison sentences.  Locking them up has dovetailed with the attack on living 

and working standards by the owners of the country during the past 25 years 

of slow/no economic growth.



<p>Racial profiling was also a weapon of state power against people of color 

during the voting rights purge in the Florida 2000 elections.  What goes 

around comes around.



<p>Now, under the War on Terror, the white population in the U.S. is also the 

target of state power.  In the name of security, their civil rights are 

at-risk.



<p>Perhaps some with white skin believed, or never perhaps thought they could 

be profiled by the state.  That was for the other woman or man.



<p>Well, that’s not how the system works during crises.  We live in such a time 

now.



<p>During a crisis, the nation’s rulers swing state power with full force 

against those who dare to dissent.  The FBI’s COINTELPRO campaigns to ruin 

and wreck the Civil Rights and anti-Vietnam War movements of the 1960s are 

cases in point.



<p>Richard Cohen, whose work is distributed by the Washington Post Writers 

Group, recently criticized Attorney General John Ashcroft.  Cohen continued: 

“Not since J. Edgar (Hoover, former FBI director) has Washington seen such a 

publicity hound.”



<p>But using the cloud cover of national security to roll back the civil rights 

of U.S. citizens is hardly a matter of Ashcroft seeking the political 

spotlight.  State power has been used against organized labor and the 

freedom movements of nonwhite people for decades.



<p>For reasons of keeping the nation and the world safe for the market economy, 

the owners of the country have relied on the state to keep the U.S. working 

population under control.  Too much freedom threatens the power, privilege 

and wealth of these rulers.



<p>Accordingly, those who run the system have billions of reasons to maintain 

divisions within the diverse working-class.  Some workers perpetuate these 

skin-color divisions, to their great disadvantage.



<p>In fact, the blind spot of white workers in their relations with nonwhite 

workers in the U.S. is perhaps the major point of disunity.  Throughout the 

nation's history, this division has served to weaken workers as a class.



<p>But that weakness has changed and can change again.  Two examples are 

agitation against slavery and for the eight-hour day after the Civil War, 

and mobilization against racism and for increased labor union strength 

during the 1930s.



<p>Weakening the color line in U.S. society benefits the majority, a point 

obscured by the priesthood of politicians and pundits.  The wielding of 

state power against those whose white-privilege previously shielded them 

follows from the state’s treatment of its nonwhite population.



<p>Hush now?  I think not.
