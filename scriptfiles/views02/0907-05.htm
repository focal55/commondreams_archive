<p><i>"[Rohrabacher] says the Taliban are devout traditionalists—not terrorists 

or revolutionaries. He believes a Taliban takeover [of Afghanistan] would be a 

positive development."</i></P>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><i>—Washington Report on Middle East Affairs,</i> November/December 

1996 issue</P>

<P>In the hours after the deadly Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist strikes, fear loomed 

that the federal government had fallen into disarray and would be impotent to 

stop additional attacks. It didn’t help that President George W. Bush hid for 

several hours at military installations in middle America or that a Bush staffer 

claimed (without evidence) that <I>Air Force One</I> was a target of foreign terrorists. 

Members of a special House Intelligence subcommittee on international terrorism 

evacuated the U.S. Capitol and, in hopes of calming public anxiety, called an 

emergency press conference. </P>

<P>"Today’s vicious attacks were clearly intended to instill fear, cause panic 

and kill innocent Americans in large numbers," said Representative Saxby Chambliss 

(R-Georgia), head of the House terrorism group. "If terrorists believe they could 

shut down the U.S. government and paralyze the American people, they were simply 

mistaken. The government is functioning."</P>

<P>Then Chambliss turned to a bigger question: How could Middle Eastern terrorists 

hijack four loaded passenger jets and convert them into missiles without any detection 

by U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies? </P>

<P>"Obviously, nobody knew that this threat was imminent in the way that it happened," 

Chambliss said. "But terrorism throughout the world, particularly directed at 

Americans, has been in existence for any number of years. And our committee is 

striving hard to ensure that we provide the best intelligence possible to hopefully 

ensure that these types of incidents don’t ever happen again."</P>

<P>California’s Jane Harman, the ranking Democrat in Chambliss’ group, expressed 

sadness at the death toll but struck a confident note. "Understand that we are 

getting you the information as fast as we can and that we’re taking the steps 

necessary to protect you and your families from further harm," said Harman (D-Redondo 

Beach). "The bottom line here is that the U.S. is strong." </P>

<P>But Chambliss and Harman’s hope to present a rosy, bipartisan façade for the 

national C-SPAN audience faded quickly. Representative Dana Rohrabacher—not a 

member of the terrorism committee—appeared and demanded to speak. Unlike his colleagues, 

the Huntington Beach Republican had no plans to offer sweet-sounding reassurances.</P>

<P>"Listen! Hold on!" said Rohrabacher. "I am a bigger expert on Afghanistan than 

any member of Congress."</P>

<P>As a speechwriter and special assistant to President Ronald Reagan, Rohrabacher 

played a key role in the late 1980s getting money and arms, including U.S.-made 

Stinger missiles, to Afghan holy warriors, then at war with the Soviet Union. 

He once bragged of being "certainly a major player" in a coalition inside the 

White House that supported anyone "opposing Communist domination around the world." 

In November 1988, he even visited the Afghan front lines during a five-day hike 

with an armed mujahideen patrol in eastern Afghanistan. Among those fighters he 

encountered, he later recalled, were "Saudi Arabians under a crazy commander named 

bin Laden."</P>

<P>Rohrabacher carried that record to a C-SPAN microphone on Sept. 11. "Let me 

just tell you, this is not just a day of infamy; this is a tragedy," he said. 

"It’s a day of disgrace." Excoriating the intelligence community, he demanded 

to know, "Where’s the FBI? Where’s the CIA?" and asked how they would explain 

their "catastrophic incompetence." </P>

<P>"I’ve been begging people to do something about Afghanistan," he said. "And 

I said if we didn’t do anything about the Taliban, we would pay a dear price."</P>

<P>The next day, <I>The Orange County Register</I> reported in a top story, "Horror 

and Hindsight," that the terrorist attacks "could turn out to be a horrific told-you-so" 

for Rohrabacher. To make sure his "angry" comments were amplified, the congressman 

granted multiple television, radio and newspaper interviews and authored an unsolicited 

column that carried this note: "A <I>must</I> read. You will be livid over the 

level of incompetency [sic] in our intelligence agencies." In it, Rohrabacher 

claimed that the Clinton administration—out of office for eight months when the 

attacks occurred—had ignored his pleas not to negotiate with the Taliban, a fundamentalist 

Islamic party controlling most of Afghanistan since 1996. (A hardcore partisan 

Republican, Rohrabacher remained silent about numerous meetings between George 

W. Bush’s advisors and the Taliban throughout 2001.) On Sept. 17, 2001, the congressman 

declared, "There is rage in my soul."</P>

<P>Right-wing organizations across the nation immediately picked up on Rohrabacher’s 

anti-Taliban, anti-Clinton statements and hailed him a "hero." </P>

<P>In fact, Rohrabacher’s post-Sept. 11 finger-pointing was a fraud designed to 

distract attention from his own ongoing meddling in the foreign-policy nightmare. 

Federal documents reviewed by the <I>Weekly</I> show that Rohrabacher maintained 

a cordial, behind-the-scenes relationship with Osama bin Laden’s associates in 

the Middle East—even while he mouthed his most severe anti-Taliban comments at 

public forums across the U.S. There’s worse: despite the federal Logan Act ban 

on unauthorized individual attempts to conduct American foreign policy, the congressman 

dangerously acted as a self-appointed secretary of state, constructing what foreign-affairs 

experts call a "dual tract" policy with the Taliban. </P>

<P>A veteran U.S. foreign-policy expert told the <I>Weekly</I>, "If Dana’s right-wing 

fans knew the truth about his actual, working relationship with the Taliban and 

its representatives in the Middle East and in the United States, they wouldn’t 

be so happy."</P>

<P>Nowadays, Rohrabacher and his numerous aides are quick to provide copies of 

the congressman’s pre-Sept. 11 rants against the Taliban. They will tell you that 

he labeled them "a pack of dogs killing anyone" and "the most anti-Western, anti-female, 

anti-human rights regime in the world." They will also show you records of the 

congressman berating Clinton administration foreign-policy advisors for misreading 

Taliban intentions and for trying to negotiate peace in Afghanistan with the militant 

Islamic group’s Mullah Mohammed Omar, a bin Laden associate. </P>

<P>What they won’t mention is that Rohrabacher also once lobbied shamelessly for 

the Taliban. A November/December 1996 article in <I>Washington Report on Middle 

East Affairs</I> reported, "The potential rise of power of the Taliban does not 

alarm Rohrabacher" because the congressman believes the "Taliban could provide 

stability in an area where chaos was creating a real threat to the U.S." Later 

in the article, Rohrabacher claimed that: </P>

<P>•Taliban leaders are "not terrorists or revolutionaries." </P>

<P>•Media reports documenting the Taliban’s harsh, radical beliefs were "nonsense."</P>

<P>•The Taliban would develop a "disciplined, moral society" that did not harbor 

terrorists.</P>

<P>•The Taliban posed no threat to the U.S.</P>

<P>Although he continues to describe himself as an expert on Afghan history and 

politics, Rohrabacher was obviously dead wrong on all counts. </P>

<P>Evidence of Rohrabacher’s attempts to conduct his own foreign policy became 

public on April 10, 2001, not in the U.S., but in the Middle East. On that day, 

ignoring his own lack of official authority, Rohrabacher opened negotiations with 

the Taliban at the Sheraton Hotel in Doha, Qatar, ostensibly for a "Free Markets 

and Democracy" conference. There, Rohrabacher secretly met with Taliban Foreign 

Minister Mullah Wakil Ahmed Muttawakil, an advisor to Mullah Omar. Diplomatic 

sources claim Muttawakil sought the congressman’s assistance in increasing U.S. 

aid—already more than $100 million annually—to Afghanistan and indicated that 

the Taliban would not hand over bin Laden, wanted by the Clinton administration 

for the fatal bombings of two American embassies in Africa and the <I>USS Cole</I>. 

For his part, Rohrabacher handed Muttawakil his unsolicited plans for war-torn 

Afghanistan. "We examined a peace plan," he laconically told reporters in Qatar.</P>

<P>To this day, the congressman has refused to divulge the contents of his plan. 

However, several diplomatic sources say it’s likely he asked the extremists to 

let former Afghan King Zahir Shah return as the figurehead of a new coalition 

government. In numerous speeches before and after Sept. 11, Rohrabacher has claimed 

the move would help stabilize Afghanistan for an important purpose: the construction 

of an oil pipeline there. In return, the plan would reportedly have allowed the 

Taliban to maintain power until "free" elections could be called. </P>

<P>The idea was outlandish and even provocative. Though he is a member of the 

same ethnic tribe as the Taliban leadership, the 87-year-old exiled former king—who 

lost his throne in 1973—is known not for his appreciation of democracy, but for 

his coziness to Western corporate interests. With good reason, he was considered 

a U.S. puppet by the Taliban.</P>

<P>After Taliban-related terrorists attacked the U.S. last September, Rohrabacher 

associates worked hard to downplay the Qatar meeting. Republican strategist Grover 

Norquist told a reporter that the congressman had accidentally encountered the 

Taliban official in a hotel hallway.</P>

<P>But that preposterous assertion is contradicted by much evidence: </P>

<P>•Qatari government officials who told Al-Jazeera television on April 10, 2001, 

that Rohrabacher sought the meeting in advance and that they had assisted in the 

arrangements. Muttawakil said he agreed to the meeting "on the basis of allowing 

each party to express their point of view." </P>

<P>•The congressman himself told other Middle Eastern news outlets that his discussions 

with the Taliban were "frank and open" and their officials were "thoughtful and 

inquisitive." Hardly a casual chat in the hallway.</P>

<P>•Similarly, in an interview with Agence France-Presse, Rohrabacher’s entourage 

described the meeting as "a high-level talk." </P>

<P>What’s remarkable is not only Rohrabacher’s attempt to rewrite history after 

Sept. 11, but there’s also his glaring naivete, evident in his bungling assessment 

of the Qatar meeting. One member of his entourage, Khaled Saffuri, executive director 

of the Islamic Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based group that partially bankrolled 

Rohrabacher’s trip, said he was impressed by how "flexible" Taliban officials 

appeared. Rohrabacher came away equally impressed. He announced he would travel 

to Afghanistan to work out details with the Taliban. </P>

<P>But Rohrabacher was out of his league. In the Afghan capital of Kabul the next 

day, Muttawakil presented Rohrabacher’s plan to the Taliban. Mullah Omar immediately 

issued a statement denouncing American efforts to orchestrate a new Afghanistan 

government. "The infidel world is not letting Muslims form a government of their 

own choice," he declared. </P>

<P>More darkly, 137 miles east across the border in Pakistan, Osama bin Laden 

measured the distance between Rohrabacher and diplomatic reality. "I issue a call 

to the young generation to get ready for the holy war and to prepare for that 

in Afghanistan," he said during an April 11, 2001, pro-Taliban rally in Peshawar 

broadcast throughout the region. "I appeal to you to teach Muslims that there 

is no honor except in holy war." The hard-line crowd of 200,000 carried pictures 

of burning American flags and chanted, "U.S., listen to us! We are the death of 

you!"</P>

<P>While Rohrabacher waxed optimistic, American diplomats became increasingly 

suspicious of the Taliban. On April 27, 2001, the U.S. State Department officially 

rebuked Rohrabacher’s meddling. Alan Eastham, assistant secretary of state for 

South Asia, told reporters that while the congressman belongs to the president’s 

Republican party, he did not have authorization for a diplomatic mission. Rohrabacher 

"did not inform us in advance of his plans with the Taliban," Eastham said. </P>

<P>News of Rohrabacher’s Qatar meeting with the Taliban was unreported in the 

U.S. for 16 months. Then, last month, Gerrie Schipske—Rohrabacher’s Democratic 

challenger in the November elections—issued a press release calling the congressman’s 

unauthorized discussions "not only illegal but dangerous to our country." She 

believes he violated the Logan Act by meddling in American foreign policy and 

should be prosecuted. </P>

<P>"It is simply outrageous that this rogue congressman engaged in negotiations 

with the Taliban," Schipske said. "He needs to explain why he tried to cut a deal 

on his own and what he promised the Taliban during the meeting."</P>

<P>According to Schipske, Rohrabacher also lied to Congress about his April 2001 

trip to Qatar. "He told the House that he was attending a conference. He did not 

disclose the meeting with the Taliban. Members of Congress are only allowed to 

accept paid trips that are connected with their official duties. Negotiating with 

Osama bin Laden’s protégé isn’t one of them."</P>

<P>Despite Rohrabacher’s own April 2001 overseas admission of his Taliban dalliance, 

only a few media outlets on the East Coast picked up Schipske’s press release. 

Mainstream news organizations in Orange County—including the <I>Los Angeles Times</I> 

and the <I>Register</I>—have so far ignored this tale of international intrigue. 

(For the record, the <I>Times OC </I>likely<I> </I>still reels from the congressman’s 

wrath over its reports of his role in a 1996 voter-fraud scandal; the <I>Register</I> 

is Rohrabacher’s ideological soulmate and former employer.) </P>

<P>"It’s amazing that the local media won’t touch this story," said Schipske. 

"I guess either it’s hard to imagine Dana Rohrabacher negotiating with the Taliban 

or the story is just too big for them." </P>
