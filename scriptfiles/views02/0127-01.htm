A pumped-up corporate definition of intelligence is making headway in US 

society. CEOs are regarded as experts on political and sociological change, 

and excellence in public education is defined in terms of its service to the 

private sector. Equating intelligence with conformity to corporate values is 

not a new concept, but the extent to which wisdom is being confused with 

business savvy is an increasingly insidious trend.



<p>A popular magazine recently surveyed "some of the smartest people we know," 

and their choice of intellectual luminaries consisted primarily of Fortune 

500 CEOs. When asked to devise post-September 11 paths to peace and 

prosperity, respondents such as Disney CEO Michael Eisner offered, "America 

is hated not because of our ideology, but because of our freedom, our 

lifestyle and our products ... so the solution is to make our things 

available around the world." Ogilvy & Mather CEO Shelly Lazarus discussed 

the "interesting marketing challenge" of stimulating US consumer demand in 

the current economic slump: "What people are saying is, 'You know what? I 

just don't feel like going out,' ... and we've got to tell them, 'That's 

what the terrorists want. I don't care if you feel like it or not - go buy a 

bra.'" In other words, recession, inequity and poverty are nothing that 

Goofy dolls and underwires can't fix; throw money at a problem and it will 

magically disappear.



<p>This same "smartest people we know" attitude echoes in "No Child Left 

Behind," the sweeping educational reforms signed into US law January 8th. 

Having said, "If you teach a child to read, he or her will be able to pass a 

literacy test," President Bush helped push through the mandate for annual 

standardized testing of all US students from the third to eighth grade. But 

while parents and teachers argue against the diversion of already tight 

educational funds into dubious new programs, the testing and textbook 

publishing industries have settled in for the kill.



<p>Small wonder. The necessary expenditures for mandated testing have been 

estimated to run $2.7 to $7 billion annually, and Harold McGraw, the CEO of 

McGraw-Hill and a long-time friend of the Bush family, is one of those few 

poised to make exorbitant profits from the new law.



<p>The importance of literacy is clear; as President Bush himself has said, 

"Reading is the basics for all learning." The question is simply whether 

throwing billions at testing and textbook publishers, then punishing lagging 

schools is really the smart way to go.  Tackling the roots of student 

underperformance, such as child poverty (with its attending lack of 

healthcare, poor nutrition, and inequity in the distribution of educational 

resources) would seem a more humane and effective long-term strategy. But 

sociological implications, have-nots and other minor details get left out in 

a profit-motivated approach to social services. Short-term gains and 

self-serving interests take hold as dangerous new paths to the future are 

institutionalized.



<p><a href="http://commondreams.org/headlines01/1207-01.htm">A recent statement by 100 Nobel laureates</a>, "smart people" by anyone's 

standard, warned against the current trend of lining corporate pockets as 

the environment and its masses tumble. Citing "global warming and a 

weaponized world" as the most profound dangers to world peace, the laureates 

condemned a "unilateral search for security, in which we seek to shelter 

behind  walls." They called for united action to "move towards a wider 

degree of social justice" which acknowledges the "legitimate demands of the 

world's dispossessed," and they specifically demanded international support 

for legal instruments such as the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and the 

Convention on Climate Change.



<p>Intriguing that the Bush administration has decided to abandon the above 

treaties, preferring to increase the profits of big energy and weapons 

producers instead. But as a recent Newsweek tribute to Bush reported, in 

explaining why the president doesn't choose to read many books, "He's busy 

making history, but doesn't look back on his own, or the world's ... Bush 

would rather look forward than backward. It's the way he's built, and the 

result is a president who operates without evident remorse or 

second-guessing."



<p>So what's the most intelligent path forward?  Does it really lie in 

standardized testing and escalated consumer demand, or rather in tearing 

down walls of inequity? If we allow our government to focus on short-term 

profit for a few, while ignoring both the lessons of history and the needs 

of the majority, isn't it tantamount to complicity in creating an 

increasingly unbalanced world? Long-term global sustainability will be 

reached only by laws and decisions of wisdom and insight. We should expect - 

and demand - no less from those who call themselves our leaders.
