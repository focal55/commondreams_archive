<p>WASHINGTON -- Like most Americans, I've reflected this week on the personal 

impact of the tragedy of Sept. 11, recalling most vividly the trauma of emptiness 

I felt in the pit of my stomach as I watched the towers of the World Trade Center 

vanish from my television screen. The feeling still periodically recurs. In a 

flash, the inconceivable had become real, the horror of the unbelievable had become 

part of my and every American's existence.</p>

<P> During the cold war, the futurists who studied world conflict had devised 

a clever name for such an event: the "worst-case scenario." Implied in this phrase, 

however, was the sense that the event was unlikely to happen. Government and policy 

professionals hypothesized less severe outcomes, dismissing the doomsayers. But 

on Sept. 11 we all learned that even disasters can be of an unexpected magnitude. 

Forthrightness now demands that we gird not for some tepid end to our conflicts 

but for catastrophes hitherto unimaginable.</p>

<P> In preparing for a war against Iraq, President Bush urges us to overlook that 

lesson. Categorizing Saddam Hussein as "evil," he warns that the Iraqis have nuclear, 

chemical and biological weapons with which to attack us. Mr. Bush's concern is 

justified, though some responsible statesmen at home and abroad believe he overstates 

the danger. But in suggesting that our forces will dispose of Saddam Hussein in 

a war that is quick and painless, like the Persian Gulf war or the war in Afghanistan, 

the president is clearly choosing not to consider the worst-case scenario at all.</p>

<P> Mr. Bush asserts a new doctrine for America, the right of preemptive attack, 

to keep Saddam Hussein from using his weapons. Preemption, Mr. Bush tells us, 

is what the proposed war is all about. But the doctrine does not take Saddam Hussein's 

own efforts at pre-emption into account; it assumes that he will wait around for 

America to attack at its convenience.</p>

<P> Surely Saddam Hussein will not repeat the strategic mistake he made after 

swallowing Kuwait in 1990 when, in choosing not to invade Saudi Arabia, he allowed 

half a million allied troops to assemble over several months time for invasion. 

Saudi Arabia is hardly less vulnerable now. By moving into Saudi Arabia, Saddam 

Hussein would shift the battlefield far to the south, imposing on American forces 

a much heavier burden than just the capture of Baghdad. We should also recall 

that in the last war Saddam Hussein blew up almost all of Kuwait's oil wells; 

in the next he could blow up Saudi Arabian wells, with significant repercussions 

for the international economy.</p>

<P> That's one scenario. Another is that Saddam Hussein, prior to an American 

attack, goes after Israel with the chemical or biological weapons that Mr. Bush 

says Iraq possesses. Israel, if it survives, will retaliate, perhaps even with 

nuclear weapons. Such retaliation might indeed bring about the "regime change" 

Mr. Bush seeks, but it would not end the story.</p>

<P> Just over the horizon lies Pakistan, a Muslim country armed with nuclear weapons 

and permeated by extremists. Pervez Musharraf, its president, has joined America's 

war on terrorism but he is unlikely to survive politically should there be a nuclear 

attack by an American ally on Iraq's Muslims. Islamists, overthrowing him, would 

take control of Pakistan's nuclear arsenal; lacking the ability to launch missiles 

that would reach Israel, they would turn on India, their more proximate enemy. 

A nuclear attack would set off global chaos.</p>

<P> Before Sept. 11, I probably would not have written the above lines. I have 

covered the Middle East conflict as a journalist for several decades, but I would 

have considered such scenarios fantasy, if not madness. Now they seem to me at 

least plausible.</p>

<P> The responsibility of America's leadership is to prevent the plausible from 

becoming reality. The cold war is a useful precedent. Saddam Hussein's power, 

and perhaps his evil too, pale next to that of Stalin. Yet even when we had clear 

military superiority over Stalin we chose not to attack him.</p>

<P> All our presidents, Republican and Democratic alike, accepted the principle 

of avoiding a war that might wreck the planet. Mr. Bush is the first to question 

this principle, and his resolve is bolstered by Vice President Dick Cheney and 

Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, both of whom close their eyes to the potential 

ramifications of a war with Iraq.</p>

<P>   Iraq, as a highly centralized tyranny dedicated to its own preservation, 

is not that different from the old Soviet Union, and it is no coincidence that 

the same deterrence that restrained the Kremlin has kept Iraq in line for a decade. 

The Soviet Union's ultimate fall with barely a whimper vindicated America's patience, 

and in time Saddam Hussein too will vanish. Is not Sept. 11 a compelling reminder 

that the steadfast vigilance exercised by our leaders for a half-century of cold 

war is wiser than rushing toward a worst-case outcome? </p>
