<p>WASHINGTON &#151; Lino Graglia was standing in a meeting room at the Mayflower 

Hotel, and he was hopping mad. The only question was, Why?</p>

<P> Mr. Graglia, a self-described "far right" law professor at the University 

of Texas, was attending the Federalist Society's 20th anniversary gala at what 

could only be called a triumphal moment. The Federalist Society, a group of conservative 

lawyers and academics, has emerged from obscurity to become perhaps the most powerful 

force in the law today.</p>

<P> Over four days of panels and soirees, the Federalists were the toast of official 

Washington. Members of the Bush cabinet, including Attorney General John Ashcroft, 

joined in the festivities. And Justice Antonin Scalia mused to a packed banquet 

hall, "Who would have thought 20 years ago that that little organization of students 

at a couple of law schools would have evolved today to a power of such proportions?"</p>

<P> At the legal panels, administration officials fell over themselves to say 

what the crowd wanted to hear. At a business-law panel, a top Justice Department 

lawyer talked about settling the <org idsrc="NASDAQ" value="MSFT">Microsoft</org> 

antitrust case, a move applauded by conservatives, who saw the suit as Clinton-era 

interference with the prerogatives of big business.</p>

<P> But to Mr. Graglia, the administration's business-friendly line sounded like 

so much liberal claptrap. During the question period, he demanded to know why 

the administration was bothering to enforce antitrust laws at all. "It really 

is time to be bold," he insisted. "The boldest thing to do would be to repeal 

all the laws."</p>

<P> Mr. Graglia wasn't the only conservative who was suffering. A woman stood 

up to declare herself "dissatisfied and frustrated" because the panel had not 

attacked the states for suing tobacco companies. A law professor fulminated against 

state attorneys general, like Eliot Spitzer of New York, who, by crusading to 

clean up the Enrons and WorldComs of the world, have become self-appointed securities 

commissioners.</p>

<P> I must admit that when I headed down to Washington last week, I was expecting 

to encounter a good deal of gloating. The last time I spent any time with the 

Federalist Society crowd was on the Harvard Law Review, where a claque of right-leaning 

law students used to hang out late into the evening, grumbling about affirmative 

action and the New Deal.</p>

<P> But now this same crowd is setting the nation's legal policy and selecting 

its judges — with a freer hand than ever since the Republicans retook the Senate. 

They are using their informal network to place conservative true believers in 

influential positions throughout the federal government, from Supreme Court clerkships 

to top agency posts. In fact, one of the late-night Harvard Law Review grumblers 

from way back when, Miguel Estrada, is now a Federalist Society favorite for the 

next vacancy on the Supreme Court.</p>

<P> Given the Federalists' remarkable good fortune, I had expected the banter 

to be heavy with congratulations and plans for the future. But much of the rumbling 

in the hallways was of grudges' being lovingly nursed and of potshots' being fired 

against liberal enemies long ago vanquished.</p>

<P> Before one event, a graybeard in the audience tutored a wet-behind-the-ears 

Federalist on the horrors of Travelgate, in which the Clinton White House did 

— well, nothing much, really. At the black-tie banquet, a satirical song took 

aim at "Brennan, Marx and Lenin." William Brennan, the Supreme Court justice who 

was being gleefully branded a communist, died in 1997.</p>

<P> The search for fictive liberal enemies reached a loopy low on the convention's 

last day, when an archconservative federal appeals court judge, Laurence Silberman, 

accused William Rehnquist's archconservative Supreme Court of having a secret 

plan to declare the death penalty unconstitutional. In an opinion just last month, 

the court reiterated its view that capital punishment is constitutional even for 

16-year-olds.</p>

<P> But the event that most captured the spirit of the week was Kenneth Starr's 

speech and his introduction by Barbara Comstock, the head of the Justice Department's 

Office of Public Affairs. Between them, Ms. Comstock and Mr. Starr managed to 

rail against Bill Clinton, James Carville, Lanny Davis, James Jeffords, Alan Dershowitz, 

the Warren court, trial lawyers and Barbra Streisand.</p>

<P> Mr. Starr was particularly exercised about liberals' being result-oriented, 

abandoning their principles to reach the outcomes they favor. But he would have 

made a more compelling case if he had not proceeded to abandon his — and the Federalist 

Society's — own oft-repeated commitment to judicial restraint to praise the Supreme 

Court for striking down the Gun-Free School <org idsrc="NASDAQ" value="ZONS">Zones</org> 

Act and the Violence Against Women Act in a burst of conservative activism.</p>

<P> What was the take-away, as meeting planners like to say, from the Federalist 

Society's big convention? First, if these are the folks choosing federal judges 

for the Bush administration — and they are — Senate Democrats and moderate Republicans 

need to be vigilant about investigating nominees' backgrounds, and using the filibuster, 

to prevent a far-right takeover of the courts. Second, Democrats and moderate 

Republicans in both houses will need to stand up for mainstream principles that 

are now under assault, like antitrust law and health and safety regulations. And 

finally, a point of sportsmanship: the only thing less appealing than a sore loser 

is a sore winner.</p>
