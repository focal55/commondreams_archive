<P><i>"High finance ain't burglary, an' it ain't obtaining money under false pretenses, 

an' it ain't manslaughter. It's what ye might call a judicious selection from 

th' best feature of them arts."<br>

</i> -- Finley Peter Dunne 

<P>OLD WISDOM: WHEN the system doesn't work, work outside the system. New wisdom: 

When the system doesn't work, hack the system. The political system is currently 

being run by corporate executives for the benefit of corporate executives. Other 

people may also benefit or suffer, but their joy or sorrow is incidental. 

<P>This is not a new trend, nor it is a trend started by or maintained by the 

Republican Party. Bill Clinton took all the money he could get, and he made sure 

that the quid always matched the quo. He wrote a real bad welfare law, and he 

continued the lunatic war on drugs. He betrayed his radical friends -- many of 

them, curiously, black women. The number of hungry children rose. The soft money 

flowed like wine -- as it always has. Democrats suck at the same teat as Republicans. 

<P>That is not to say there is no difference between the two parties. There is, 

and some of the differences are significant. But the cowardly Democrats wave the 

Roe vs. Wade voodoo doll around, and we're supposed to forget about their Bush-like 

fund-raisers and their Bush-like sound bites. 

<P>The Cheney/Bush administration has done us a favor by taking off the masks. 

It does not bother to hide its contempt or disguise its motives. Calvinist morality 

for the masses and yachts for the powerful. 

<P>IN THIS COUNTRY, once upon a time, there was a great radical tradition. John 

Leonard has written about it a lot. He quotes the writer Harvey Swados, who has 

one character say, "One way or another, we tried to keep an idea alive. 

<P>There weren't enough of us, there never are. We were ridiculously wrong about 

a lot of things but who wasn't? And what idea did they keep alive, the others?" 

<P>The ideas we try to keep alive are such a tired litany that Karl Rove has taught 

America to roll its eyes when they are mentioned: equal justice, racial equality, 

living softly on the earth, living modestly in the community of nations. 

<P>There's no money in any of that. But some of us remember. The writer Clancy 

Sigal: "We are the residual legatees of struggle, of cultural involvement, of 

personal meaning, of the search for justice and honesty. Why is there no place 

for us in America?" 

<P>Some of the people who remember are two generations younger than I am. You 

think there's no hope? Maybe you should get out more. 

<P>YOU TIRED, BUNKY? You depressed by the clouds of war and toxic emissions? You 

wondering why you're not getting smallpox vaccinations? 

<P>A movement starts where it can; it wins whatever victories are available. Ralph 

Nader runs for president, and he can't win, and that is considered noble. 

<P>Noam Chomsky preaches about "manufactured consent" to a self-selected group 

of people who understand that phrase because they've already read the book. That's 

not radicalism; that's a lecture tour. 

<P>There are 10,000 political offices for which to run in this country. There 

are committees and leaflets and polling places and demonstrations. Of course corporate 

politicians are interested in promoting a sense of futility about those efforts. 

Why should we believe them? 

<P>Do not seek differences; seek similarities. Remember that community is still 

a universal value, that safe children and safe water and safe savings are goals 

shared by all. Organize. Speak softly and carry a big pillow -- you're going to 

be sitting at that meeting for a while. 

<P>If the culture has been co-opted, make a new culture. Write your own songs. 

Invent a new language. Practice resurrection.

<P>You still do not require a meteorologist to know the direction of the wind.
