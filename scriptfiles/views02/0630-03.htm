<p>NEW YORK -- It's hard to know whether to laugh or to cry at U.S. President 

George Bush's much-awaited "vision" of Mideast peace unveiled last week, a speech 

so obviously crafted by special interests and driven by domestic politics that 

the rest of the world winced in embarrassment. Even moderate Israeli leader Shimon 

Peres called it a "fatal mistake." 

<p>The view abroad was captured by veteran British journalist Robert Fisk, who 

acidly wrote that Israeli PM Ariel Sharon, who has made six visits to Bush's White 

House, should be allowed to run the White House press office, to "spare the American 

president the ignominy of parroting everything he is told by the Israelis." 

<p>Bush's message to Palestinians: basically, no state until you kick out Yasser 

Arafat, stop resisting Israeli occupation, develop true democracy, do what Israel 

tells you, create capitalism, eliminate corruption and stop causing trouble. Then, 

some day, the U.S. might consider an "interim" Palestinian state whose borders 

and sovereignty would be "provisional," provided Israel agrees. 

<p>Bush might as well have told Palestinians they won't get their freedom and 

homeland until they can recite the U.S. Tax Code in Apache. 

<p>Bush, a man untroubled by deep thought or irony, had the chutzpah, as we New 

Yorkers say, to urge Palestinians to adopt Scandinavian-style democracy, while 

telling them they cannot re-elect Arafat, who was elected in a fair vote by over 

80% of his people - rather better than President Bush, who slid into office thanks 

to court orders and voter exclusions in Florida. 

<p>As for corruption, Arafat's thieving PLO cronies look like the homeless compared 

to Bush's mega-crook pals at Enron who helped finance his elections. 

<p><B>Corrupt autocracies</B> 

<p>Why didn't Bush urge free elections on America's other Mideast clients - Egypt, 

Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Morocco and the Gulf states, mostly corrupt autocracies 

run by generals or feudal monarchs? What the president wants is an obedient Palestinian 

version of Afghanistan's new leader, CIA "asset" Hamid Karzai, who was put into 

power with U.S. and British bayonets and billions in bribes. 

<p>Bush politely suggested Israel stop building settlements. Considering that 

Sharon scorned Bush when the president ordered him to pull his U.S.-armed and 

financed troops out of the West Bank, there is zero chance Israel will stop gobbling 

it up. Sharon has made it perfectly clear by his actions that he will never withdraw 

from the West Bank or Golan, which Israel occupies illegally, and will never accept 

a viable Palestinian state. Worse, Sharon appears likely to be succeeded by rival 

Benjamin Netanyahu, who actually calls Sharon "soft" on Palestinians. 

<p>What Bush and Israel's rightists want is apartheid-style bantustans - tribal 

reservations policed by Palestinian kapos, surrounded by Israeli troops, covering 

about 40% of Palestine. Israel will get the rest. In fact, Israeli peace groups 

recently revealed there are now 400,000 Jewish settlers in the Occupied Territories 

and Golan, not the 200,000 previously believed. When the Oslo Accords were signed 

in 1993, there were 85,000 Jewish settlers. 

<p>Arafat's U.S.-financed Palestinian Authority and its security apparatus are 

dictatorial, thoroughly corrupt and abuse human rights. Arafat winks at terror 

attacks on Israeli civilians, is a liability to his people and should make way 

for new leadership. But so should Sharon and Israel's expansionists, who have 

plunged their nation into a bloody morass and provoked anti-Semitism around the 

globe. A pox on both houses. 

<p>Israel, at least, has moderate, capable alternative leaders like Peres and 

Yossi Beilin, who can bring some sanity to the political scene. The only real 

Palestinian candidate, Marawan Barghouti, is in an Israel prison. The PLO is totally 

discredited among Palestinians because of corruption and close co-operation with 

the U.S. and Israel. This leaves the extremist groups - Hamas and Islamic Jihad 

- as the choice of a majority of Palestinians. Bush's relentless undermining of 

Arafat's PLO has strengthened Palestinian radicals and played into the hands of 

Sharon, who vows he will never deal with "terrorists." 

<p>Israelis and their American supporters greeted Bush's speech with predictable 

adulation. Bush and his advisers hope to increase their share of the Jewish vote 

in November's critical U.S. mid-term elections from 19% to over 50%. Embracing 

Israel's far right also delighted ardent Bush supporters on the Christian far 

right. Many of these rustic fundamentalists believe that when all Jews are moved 

into Biblical Israel (including the West Bank), their Christian Messiah will return 

and destroy the world in Armageddon. Good Christians will then go to paradise. 

<p>President Bush's "vision" for Palestine is a myopic fantasy seen through rose-colored 

glasses supplied by his alter ego, Ariel Sharon. The plan is frightful news for 

Palestinians, bad news for Israelis seeking peace, and bad news for Americans. 

<p>Bush has put domestic politics and his re-election before America's proper 

national interests. He has undermined real peacemakers among the Israelis and 

Arabs. Worse, instead of playing honest peace broker in the Mideast, Bush's total 

identification with Israel's far right ensures America will again become the target 

of extremists from an increasingly enraged Muslim world - and of furious Palestinians 

who now have nothing to lose except the cruel mirage of a fraudulent "provisional 

interim" state. </p>
