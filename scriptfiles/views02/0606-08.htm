<p>Just what is it about pleasure and danger that the power media don't 

understand? The answer is just about everything, as the brouhaha about Judith 

Levine's book on children and sexuality reveals.  Instead of discussing the 

very real perils Levine begs us to address in our culture, the Religious 

Right have succeeded in casting hers a "dangerous book." That will help us 

not one jot and we're very much in need.

<P>

Fury rained down on Levine's <I>Harmful to Minors: the Perils of Protecting 

Children From Sex</I> (Minnesota University Press, 2002) even before the book 

itself hit the shelves. 

<P>

Concerned Women for America and the Christian Right "Culture and Family 

Institute" went so far as to hold a forum in Washington to discuss whether 

the as-yet-unpublished book "encouraged pedophilia." It did, declared CFI's 

Robert Knight. It did, said Sandy Rios, president of the CWA. The Concerned 

Women sent out a press release claiming that Levine, a New York journalist 

with a long history of researching and writing about sexuality and gender, 

"advocates" molesting children. CWA's release called on the University of 

Minnesota's Regents to fire "those responsible" for the publication of this 

"evil tome." 

<P>

The Right's attack guaranteed the book attention, but mostly of the wrong 

sort. Dr. Laura railed on radio, Bill O'Reilly railed on TV. Too busy foaming 

at the mouth to pick up a copy of <I>Harmful to Minors</I>, O'Reilly said actual reading wasn't 

necessary, that you don't have to read all of <I>Mein Kampf</I> to get <I>its</I> 

gist. (O'Reilly didn't even make up his own hate-filled rhetoric. The quip comparing Levine to Hitler came from Dr. Laura crony Judith Reisner, <a 

href=http://www.startribune.com/stories/389/2254674.html target="_new">explains <I>Star-Tribune</I> columnist Kristin Tillotson</a>, who did her best 

to defend Levine's work on O'Reilly's Fox News slug-fest.)

<P>

So it continues. Thanks to a  handful of radical Religious Right outfits and their media cronies,  Levine's good book is now associated in the public mind with pedophilia and child abuse. Almost two months after the CWA event in Washington, <a href=http://slate.msn.com/ target="_new">Slate.com</a> 

ran a feature this week on <I>Harmful to Minors</I> beneath the banner, "What a 

new pedophilia book gets right and wrong."  

<P>

The trouble with all this isn't just that the "promoting abuse" allegations are false. (Since the initial bout of bashing, <a href=http://www.startribune.com/stories/389/2254674.html target="_new">some reporters have taken a deeper look</a>, and the charges quickly collapse.) The bigger problem is that 

ideological hysteria has helped the mass media miss yet another 

opportunity to discuss something serious and urgent. So much attention has gone to what 

Judith Levine <I>didn't</I> say that there's been precious little scrutiny of what 

she did.  

<P>

Levine's book is not dangerous, but there are dangers out there — dangers that 

ravage at least as many lives as the pedophiles the cultish Concerned Women 

want everyone to worry about. (Concerned Women, by the way, is dedicated to 

bringing <a href="http://www.cwfa.org/about/" target="_new">"biblical principles into public 

policy"</a>, a point those who quote them have been reluctant to tell their 

audiences.) 

<P>

Take the dread "pedophilia" chapter in <I>Harmful to Minors</I>.  It's short,

Levine looks at lots of data, among which is a Mayo Clinic study revealing that three-quarters of parents are afraid their children will be abducted by pedophiles. It's a more frequent worry than fretting over car accidents. This, despite the fact that a child's risk of dying in a car accident is 

25 to 75 times greater than his or her chances of being abducted and murdered by non-family members. Ninety-five percent of allegedly abducted children turn out to be "runaways or throwaways" from home, she reports, or kids 

snatched by one of their own parents in divorce or custody disputes.

<P>

In other words, we're worrying about the wrong things and quite possibly the 

wrong people: "Rather than indict our Monday night football buddies, rather 

than indict the family... we circle the wagons and project danger outward," 

writes Levine. "Screen out anyone who might be damaging to your child," the 

FBI's Kenneth Lanning is quoted as having advised the readers of <I>Life 

Magazine</I> in 1995. 

<P>

We've got some pretty vague ideas of what "damages" children, too. When 

she appeared on <a href="http://www.workingassetsradio.com" target="_new">Working Assets Radio last 

month</a>, Levine was clear: abuse exists, such as when one party does 

not consent to sex or when an adult in a position of authority uses his or 

her status to abuse a victim's trust. Children can explore their sexuality 

from babyhood on, she said, but pre-pubescent children shouldn't be out there 

having intercourse.

<P>

But beyond that, says Levine, we as a society are way too quick to see 

aggression, molestation and outright deviance in healthy expressions of 

youthful sexuality — and way too quick to shame, criminalize and 

patholologize healthy children for making all sorts of sexual explorations that are just part of their natural development.

 

<P>

Panicked by the dangers of "premature" or "perverse" or "unnatural" sex, our society 

almost entirely ignores the true risks of all that fear and shame.  

Think it doesn't hurt to be "too careful?" When it comes to "protecting" your 

kids from sex, it hurts.  "Protection" enforced in the way CWA would have it done 

denies young people information about AIDS and other 

sexually-transmitted diseases. (CWA's all for government-funded "abstinence" programs  which penalize educators and social workers if they so much as mention ways to have sex and also to be safe.) 

<P>

What makes sex dangerous is having it when you don't want it, or having it when 

you're too scared to ask questions, too afraid to demand condoms or too ignorant to demand touch that feels good. What makes sex dangerous is being too ashamed or too sad to know that you deserve a right to say <I>no</I>, or 

<I>not that way,</I> — or even, whole-heartedly, <I>yes</I>.  

<P>

The CWA has an axe to grind against Levine and all those who believe young people should get the information they need to make informed and safe choices when it comes to sex. Sadly, it's an axe that is grinding into our children and our society.  Levine just wants it to stop.
