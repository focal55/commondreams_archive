<p>While US plans for the production of Gulf War II rumble on relentlessly, the 

Danish campaign to abolish the sanctions against Iraq was given a huge boost by 

the visit of Professor Tom Nagy at the start of June. Here, Nagy presented unshakeable 

documentation for how the sanctions have been applied to ban the import of water 

purification equipment and chemicals, thus provoking epidemics of diseases such 

as cholera, hepatitis and typhoid fever. 

<p>Nagy’s current position is Associate Professor in the school of business and 

public management at George Washington University, and has previously held full-time 

research posts in the area of public health. 

<p>While searching on the Pentagon’s Gulflink site for data that might shed some 

light on Gulf syndrome, Professor Nagy almost accidentally entered the search 

term “water”, and was horrified by one of the reports he turned up. Headed “Iraq 

water treatment vulnerabilities” and dated January 1991, the Defense Intelligence 

Agency report details the difficulties the civilian population of Iraq were predicted 

to experience in finding potable water in the presence of restrictions on the 

import of water purification equipment and chemicals. 

<p>Like a warder doing his rounds to ensure that all doors are securely locked, 

the report addresses, point by point, the various sources of water that might 

be considered, explaining why each one is precluded:

<p>

<ul>

<li>Most of Iraq’s water supply “is heavily mineralized and frequently brackish 

to saline.” </li>

<li>“Precipitation occurs in Iraq during the winter and spring, but it falls primarily 

in the northern mountains.” </li>

<li>Iraq's rivers "contain biological materials, pollutants, and are laden with 

bacteria.” </li>

</ul>



<p>The document states: “Unless water treatment supplies are exempted from the 

UN sanctions for humanitarian reasons, no adequate solution exists for Iraq's 

water purification dilemma ...” And it explicitly presents the expected consequences 

for the civilian population: “Unless the water is purified with chlorine, epidemics 

of such diseases as cholera, hepatitis, and typhoid could occur.” 

<p>A series of six related reports document the degradation of the Iraqi water 

supply that took place in the first half of 1991. Predictions were made of outbreaks 

or epidemics of hepatitis and cholera, and the fulfillment of these predictions 

was subsequently documented in detail. 

<p>In an article published in The Progressive magazine, Nagy quoted Representative 

Tony Hall, Democrat of Ohio, who wrote to then-Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, 

expressing his concern about blocks and holds placed on contracts for import of 

water purification equipment and chemicals in the UN Security Council. Holds on 

seventeen out of eighteen contracts were placed by the United States, and the 

last was placed by the United Kingdom. 

<p>Professor Nagy’s article, “The Secret Behind the Sanctions”, has been nominated 

by Project Censored as one of the top ten censored stories of the year 2001. In 

contrast, Nagy was overwhelmed by the level of attention he received in the Danish 

media. Two national newspapers and one of the foremost current affairs programs 

on national radio lined up for in-depth interviews. 

<p>And the reception from the Danish public was equally powerful. The audience 

at a meeting entitled “Stop the Cholera War”, held at Copenhagen University on 

June 4, was by turns curious, appalled, moved, and many of those present were 

ultimately inspired to participate in an ongoing campaign to abolish the sanctions. 

<p>Nagy’s presentation was remarkably up-beat, culminating in a patriotic proposal 

that the US make atonement for its inhumane policies of the past by investing 

in a global clean water project: "According to the World Health Organization, 

2.3 million children under the age of five are dying every year as a result of 

water-borne diseases. This could be globally prevented for the sum of nine billion 

dollars annually. The United States should pay this sum as a memorial to the children 

who have died in Iraq, and as a sign of remorse." This measure, he argued, would 

likely be more valuable in countering terrorism than any increase in military 

expenditure. 

<p>The next day was Constitution Day, on which Danes traditionally take a half 

day off to listen to elected representatives making cheerful speeches about the 

thriving state of Danish democracy. First stop for Nagy was the Christiansborg 

Peace Watch, which has been standing in protest outside the Danish house of parliament 

every day since Denmark entered the War on Terrorism on October 19 last year. 

An interview for the radio was followed by a photo session for one of the newspapers 

and a train ride to the provincial capital of Odense, for a Constitution Day meeting 

with a distinctly different flavor. 

<p>Coverage in the newspapers and on radio over the next weekend and into the 

following week was very gratifying for the visiting professor. A double-page spread 

appeared in the Sunday edition of the daily Politiken, under the heading: “When 

Water is a Weapon”. The Monday interview in the independent intellectual broadsheet, 

Information, bore the heading: “US Deliberately Lets Children Die”. 

<p>A follow-up article in Information, under the title “Denmark Shuts Its Eyes”, 

presented the responses of the foreign policy spokespersons of a range of Danish 

political parties. Perhaps most significantly, the press secretary of the Conservative 

Minister of Foreign Affairs stated that the minister was unable to make a statement, 

as the ministry was unaware of documentation for the assertion that the United 

States has banned the import of water purification equipment. 

<p>Clearly, the Danish Committee for Peace and Development in Iraq has a significant 

level of ignorance to address. But with the success of Tom Nagy’s visit behind 

it, the committee is confident that an October visit from former UN humanitarian 

coordinator in Iraq, Hans-Christof von Sponeck, will do much to create enlightenment. 

<p>Meanwhile, Professor Nagy has returned to Washington more than content with 

a level of media coverage that currently seems almost unimaginable within the 

United States. But perhaps it is still possible that he will be recognized as 

a prophet in his own land. <i>Norbert Payne is a technical writer who regularly
