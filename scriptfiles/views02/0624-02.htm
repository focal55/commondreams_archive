<p>In the heady days after the Taliban fell, western politicians developed a simple 

refrain. "This time we will not walk away," they promised. By that they meant 

no repetition of what happened after western-supported mojahedin forces gained 

control of Afghanistan a decade earlier. Foreign governments had cheered their 

allies' victory, but when the mojahedin factions fell out and destroyed Kabul 

in an orgy of artillery shelling, rape and murder, they turned a blind eye.

<P>It was an experience that Mohammed Latif will never forget. A civil servant 

who now earns more by driving a taxi, he lives across the street from the site 

of the loya jirga or grand tribal council which chose the country's new government 

last week. His house was damaged during the mojahedin fighting. Huge shell-holes 

are still visible on the two-story facade, now partly filled by bricks. Latif 

pointed up the hill to the Intercontinental Hotel (where most of the loya jirga 

press corps was staying) and described how forces loyal to the main Tajik mojahedin 

commander, Ahmed Shah Massoud, had fired down from the ridge on to his neighborhood 

during the years of anarchy. 

<P>He hoped the west would exert a restraining hand this time. Yet, as the loya 

jirga ended, it was hard to be optimistic. Admittedly, there had been unprecedentedly 

open debate. Around half the delegates were chosen in elections which were reasonably 

free. When it came to sharing jobs in President Hamid Karzai's new government 

a balance was struck between the country's main ethnic groups, the Tajiks and 

the Pashtun. But on the major issue of whether Afghanistan will be run by educated 

people with a vision of democratic development, the loya jirga was a disaster. 

The struggle between the modernizers and the old mojahedin leaders was won decisively 

by the latter. Men responsible for the mayhem of the early 1990s hogged the microphones 

to boast of their role in resisting Soviet occupation but ignored the more recent 

destruction they caused and the fact that ordinary Afghans despise them as reactionary 

warlords. They forced their fundamentalist views of Islam on to the assembly, 

demanding - and getting from Karzai - the right to call the government "Islamic". 

A chief justice was appointed who believes in a strict interpretation of sharia 

law. The minister for women's affairs was denounced as "Afghanistan's Salman Rushdie". 

<P>The loya jirga also failed to enhance the power of the central government and 

extend it to the provinces. The thugs who run the cities of Herat and Mazar-i-Sharif 

rejected offers to join Karzai's government in Kabul, preferring to stay in monopoly 

control of their regional fiefdoms. How much western governments could do to stop 

these internal processes can be debated. But by refusing to send international 

peacekeepers out of Kabul to help Karzai to disarm the warlords the west is helping 

the forces of conservatism. By declining to make aid for regional government projects 

conditional on human rights progress, it is doing the same. Indeed, it is not 

even providing all the aid it promised, with or without strings attached. 

<P>The World Food Program estimates that over half of all Afghan families are 

in need of emergency supplies, but it has received only 57% of the food it asked 

for from foreign donors. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees is 

also short of funds. Afghan refugees in Pakistan have been coming home in far 

higher numbers than the UN anticipated. Their mass return is not necessarily a 

sign of confidence in the "new" Afghanistan. Many lived in Pakistani cities rather 

than refugee camps, and complain that government-encouraged police harassment 

forced them to leave Pakistan. They come back to a country where homes are destroyed 

and livestock is dead. Yet the UNHCR had to cut food rations to the returnees 

by two-thirds last month. Now it is warning it may have to end all food handouts 

if foreign governments do not deliver the cash they promised. 

<P>Removing the Taliban was not the primary purpose of the US air strikes on Afghanistan 

last autumn. "Regime change" became a war aim relatively late in the day. The 

main goals were to capture Osama bin Laden and eliminate the danger of further 

al-Qaida attacks. But neither Bin Laden nor his main lieutenants have been found. 

A new audio tape obtained by the al-Jazeera TV station says they are alive and 

ready for more outrages. So the hunt for al-Qaida inside Afghanistan has failed, 

as Britain's decision to abandon its help for the United States and withdraw its 

marines next month demonstrates. 

<P>And the Bush administration now admits the threat may be greater than it was 

before it bombed Afghanistan. The New York Times last week reported senior US 

government officials as saying that a group of mid-level operatives have taken 

over from Bin Laden and have forged links with extremists in several Islamic countries. 

"This new alliance of terrorists, though loosely knit, is as fully capable of 

planning and carrying out potent attacks on American targets as the more centralized 

network once led by Osama bin Laden. Classified investigations of the Qaida threat 

now under way at the FBI and CIA have concluded that the war in Afghanistan failed 

to diminish the threat to the United States, the officials said. Instead, the 

war might have complicated counterterrorism efforts by dispersing potential attackers 

across a wider geographic area," the paper wrote. 

<P>By this analysis the internal politics of Afghanistan are the only area where 

the United States can claim success from its decision to respond to the September 

11 attacks with military force. Forget, for a moment, the hundreds of civilians 

killed by bombs and the thousands who died of hunger during the disruption of 

aid supplies. Ignore the dangerous precedent of accepting one nation's right to 

overthrow a foreign government, however brutal, by bombing another country. The 

crude test of the operation depends on whether the fall of the Taliban outweighs 

the high costs. In the euphoria of last December many people felt it did. Can 

they feel so sure six months down the line? 

<P>The Taliban's collapse created real opportunities for progress and Kabul has 

become a vibrant city once again. Women are able to lead normal public lives, 

and at the loya jirga, in spite of efforts at intimidation, many spoke out against 

the warlords with more courage than the men. But signs of regression are already 

emerging. Many delegates were concerned that when they left the spotlight of publicity 

and returned to the provinces they could be targeted. The fundamentalists are 

reasserting their authoritarian rule. In spite of its loud promises the west has 

begun to "walk away".</p>
