<p>I am saddened to say that in Peru the government's propaganda against those

who stand up for their rights and seek social change continues.  New laws

have been passed which put greater restriction on social mobilization.  And

following the March car bombing in Lima, the responsibility for which still

has not yet been determined, the government has proposed new anti-terrorist

laws which perpetuate the internationally condemned laws pushed through by

Alberto Fujimori a decade ago that are in violation of fundamental human

rights.  On the other hand, recently passed labor legislation to respect the

eight-hour workday and overtime pay is not being enforced.  It sometimes

seems that the only law enforcement that exists in Peru is that which

represses.



<p>Once again political prisoners are being abused.  In late April, political

prisoners were transferred to Challapalca, a jail located high in the

mountains in a military base close to the Andean border with Bolivia and

Chile at an altitude exceeding 16,000 feet.  Several human rights

organizations including the International Red Cross and Amnesty

International stated strong objections to the opening of the Challapalca

jail in 1996.  It was originally used for holding common prisoners but seven

months ago, early in the Toledo administration, the first group of political

prisoners was moved to Challapalca.   The health of all prisoners is

seriously threatened in that jail, as is their general well being.  The

Challapalca jail is so remote and so isolated that any abuse can occur there

with total impunity -- proof of which is that about a year or so ago two

common prisoners were beaten to death by prison guards and this incident

wasn't even known until much later.  Owing to the cost and the difficulty of

traveling there, as well as the difficulty of adjusting to the altitude,

visits to prisoners at this jail are minimal.



<p>In addition to continuing threats to move more political prisoners to

Challapalca, now that Puno's high-plane Yanamayo jail was recently repaired,

political prisoners also are being threatened with transfer there.



<p>We political prisoners are living in a generalized atmosphere of

provocation  -- problems with the food, harassment of visitors, suspension of

privileges, etc.   Over the last months, and especially in the last weeks,

prisoners' families and friends and even prisoners' lawyers as well as human

rights workers who visit jails have been threatened and treated with

hostility.



<p>When prison authorities remark disdainfully about the presence of

international human rights organizations it is because of the pressure that

such groups put on limiting the authorities' impunity.  The Justice Ministry

claims that the denouncements of abuse by political prisoners are false,

maintaining that prisoners' human rights are respected.  This is simply not

true.  But in a country in which there is little concern if the majority of

the population suffers daily violation of their fundamental human rights as

stipulated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, who will care if

our rights are not respected, more so because political prisoners aren't

even considered to be human beings?



<p>These latest actions by the Peruvian government are a renewed reprisal

against political prisoners who struggle for their rights.  I fear for the

well being of those prisoners who have been moved to Challapalca, as I do

for all political prisoners in Peru who may be abused in any jail at any

time.  One cannot remain quiet when the government hypes false images of the

supposed "danger of terrorism" as represented by political prisoners, and

diverts attention from resolving the problems of poverty and the root causes

of social unrest.



<p>Coming so soon after the decade of Fujimori-Montesinos repression, I am

concerned that the worsening of this current situation and the continued

serious infringement of basic rights in a country that calls itself a

democracy will cause irreconcilable conflict that will take years to

eradicate.



<p>It is necessary these things be known and, as I am able to, I will keep you

informed of how this situation progresses.  Meanwhile, you can help by

writing to Justice Minister Olivera, President Toledo, and the national

human rights organizations to demand that the Peruvian government stop the

repression against political prisoners and demonstrate respect for human

rights by closing the Challapalca jail and moving all the prisoners to other

jails.



<p>Thank you.
