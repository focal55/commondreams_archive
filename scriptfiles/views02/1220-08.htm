<p>THE day has been marked in President Bush's diary. January 27, 2003. The date when he will decide on war against Iraq.</p> <p>But no one really believes that a big decision will be taken in the White House on that day. The die was cast long ago.</p> <p>Mr Bush and the warmongers in his cabinet want a war against Saddam Hussein. They say they must stop him because he has weapons of mass destruction.</p> <p>But only one leader has weapons of mass destruction and plans to use them. His name is George W Bush and it is he who must be stopped.</p> <p>What

  he plans to do against Iraq will not save lives or make peace. It will destabilize

  the world and threaten thousands, possibly millions.</p> <p>President Bush is determined to go to war to demonstrate to the United States' rednecks that he is committed to the war on terrorism launched after 9/11.</p> <p>Yesterday the Americans declared that Iraq is in "material breach" - the key words - of United Nations resolutions.</p> <p>Not even the British government went that far. Though Jack Straw came close to it and will doubtless take the short step to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Mr Bush.</p> <p>But they must be stopped. Before this mad, dangerous war is begun. The cost in human life could be enormous. It would far outweigh the current threat from Saddam.</p> <p>It is true that weapons of mass destruction should not be allowed in the wrong hands.</p> <p>But they are. They are in President Bush's. That is the greatest threat facing the world.
