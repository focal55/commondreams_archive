George W. Bush took the images of September 11 and built a false mandate on 

the terror, anguish, and rage, a mandate to claim "Operation Infinite 

Justice" for America's heart.  It's a name that sounds worthy, but doesn't 

fit comfortably with reports that the body counts in Afghanistan may not 

include humans who were simply pulverized by our bombs.



<p>"Sweet land of liberty"--that's the old image at the heart of America.  It's 

the poem missing from Operation Infinite Justice, which has nothing sweet or 

good in it, and little of liberty.  The dream of liberty and justice gets 

lost in shadow governments, super-hard nuclear-tipped missiles, body counts, 

secret imprisonments, and the glorification of world war.  But the old dream 

of "sweet liberty" is the one I'm convinced is in the hearts of people who 

are letting Bush lead without question, and the one they believe they're 

protecting.  Bush has painted a black and white world that's recognizable to 

people who live daily with the black and white realities of unemployment, 

sick kids, lack of money, crime, the need to survive.  They want to be strong 

and help protect America against the evil world Bush claims to see:  a world 

filled with terrorists who will kill us if we don't keep constant guard, 

rogue nations ready and anxious to use nuclear and chemical weapons against 

us, and allies who would endanger us by their passivity.



<p>I want to tell these people:  hang onto the reality of this moment and look, 

really look at the future that we're creating in this moment.  What we're 

creating by ourselves, not at the hand of others.  By our own hands, we're 

killing innocent people.  We're creating new fighters out of people who may 

believe they're only protecting their lives and homes against us.  We're 

enraging people who've lost people they love to our bombs, and we're 

inflaming their neighbors, who relate to their lives in ways they can never 

relate to ours.  We're alienating the allies who rushed to help us after 

September 11 by treating them with contemptuous disrespect.



<p>This war machine that's meant to edge out beauty and idealism for America's 

heart has an insatiable hunger that needs to be fed by hundreds of billions 

of the dollars we make in our workaday jobs.  The taxpayer dollars from the 

jobs we go to so we can feed the kids and try to afford a decent life are 

feeding the voracious war-beast.  We have to choose.  If the administration 

is left to build, on our fear and sorrow, new, implacable realities of bombs, 

deaths and nuclear threats, the old image--of justice, truth, freedom, honor, 

generosity, goodness, and peace--may never return.  Is the war-beast really 

the image at America's heart, or just at the heart of George W. Bush?



<p>We didn't lose everything on September 11, but that's the illusion the 

administration is exploiting.  We've lost everything only if we act as if we 

have, as if liberty no longer matters, rights no longer matter, our 

relationship to the rest of the world no longer matters.  We've dealt with al 

Qaeda and we're seeking out more war for the beast, endless money for the 

beast.  We're choosing survival devoid of love for civil rights or openness 

in our government.  We risk losing sweet liberty by replacing her image with 

vengeance and war, might and power.



<p>There are other choices.  We can build, on the brokenness of September 11, a 

careful structure dedicated to liberty, which did not die and will not die as 

long as its image is in our hearts.  A careful structure that deals with the 

need for physical protection without turning our nation into a prison.  A 

careful structure--safe but open to the light, more careful of safeguarding 

sweet liberty than ever.



<p>We risk losing the beauty in our nation's soul, but not because of "them."  

We have to choose, not because hatred and fear aren't warranted, but because 

no person or nation can hold two images at once, can have two souls.  In the 

face of gross injustice, we must still choose love or fear.  It's the 

ultimate freedom, the only one we ever really have.



<p>Choose one, just choose and follow.  The choice determines all the outcomes; 

it determines the poem.
