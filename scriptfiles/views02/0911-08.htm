<p><i>From an extemporaneous speech (edited) given by Rep. Dennis Kucinich on 

September 7, 2002 in Baraboo, Wisconsin. Kucinich was the keynote speaker at 'Fighting 

Bob Fest'. </i> 

<p>This is the time. This is the place. 

<p>This is the place to begin a national movement for renewal, for peace, for 

reconciliation, and for justice. 

<p>Wisconsin, the workshop of political wonders! This is the time and this is 

the place where we begin to slip from the hold which terror has on our minds and 

our hearts. On Wisconsin! 

<p>Our presence here is the call for a political philosophy which is constructive, 

transformative, and transcendent. A philosophy based on moral principles and enshrined 

in law. These self-evident truths of inherent equality of all, the rights of all, 

and the connection of all are the highest creative forces recognized in our Declaration 

of Independence, written into our Bill of Rights, and actively present in the 

soul of every American and freedom-loving person. This is the time today, to reconnect 

with the highest purposes of our nation. 

<p>This was a gift. This was the gift of our founders: A new nation with the ability 

to adapt to the future of our dreams. Now is the time to restore that gift through 

traveling with faith and with courage, to follow the upward spiral path to the 

unseen heights of human endeavor; to create an evolutionary politics of creativity, 

of vision, of heart, of compassion, of joy; to create a new nation and a new world 

using the power of love, of community, of participation, to transform our politics, 

and yes, to transform ourselves. 

<p>As we begin, let us recall the power of a dream. "We are such stuff as dreams 

are made on," wrote Shakespeare in The Tempest. Let us recall the dreamers, the 

architects of new worlds, as we reflect on the power of our plans to bring architecture 

and substance to our dreams. 

<p>The dreamers: 

<p>- The dream of peace and personal transcendence, in the life of Christ. 

<p>- The dream of racial equality, the life of Dr. King. 

<p>- The dream of union through equality, the life of Lincoln. 

<p>- The dream of gender equality, Susan B. Anthony. 

<p>- The dream of freedom through soul force, Gandhi. 

<p>- Nationhood, Washington. 

<p>- Democracy, Jefferson. 

<p>- Compassion, Mother Teresa. 

<p>- Environmental justice, Rachel Carson. 

<p>- Justice for workers, John L. Lewis. 

<p>- Corporate accountability, Ralph Nader. 

<p>- Progressive economics, Bob La Follette. 

<p>Let us today seek to find that place within each of us where dreams are made, 

where our highest aspirations take shape. Let us confirm the power of our humanity 

by giving architecture and substance to the dreams we have for our nation. That 

the promised land of social and economic justice that is within our dreams will 

soon be within our sight. 

<p>We seek a newer nation, in the spirit of Bob La Follette who said "America 

is not made, it's in the making." And when he said that, years ago in 1924, as 

an independent progressive candidate for President, you and I know there was one 

major city that he carried in this nation. One major city that matched this major 

state, and that city was Cleveland, Ohio. So it's good to be here today, reconnecting 

with that progressive position, which is where we all ought to be in this nation. 

Wisconsin shows the way; Cleveland replies. 

<p>Let us remake America by reconnecting with a higher purpose to bring peace 

within and without, to come into harmony with nature, to confirm and to secure 

the basic rights of our brothers and sisters. 

<p>Ours is a worthy purpose which can be addressed through addressing the practical 

aspirations of all people for economic opportunity, for peace, for jobs, for a 

living wage, for education, for housing, for health care, for clean air and clean 

water, and for retirement security. 

<p>Let us remake America through calling for establishment of a Department of 

Peace. It is time to make non-violence an organizing principle in our society 

for domestic as well as international policy. 

<p>The only weapon that can save the world is non-violence, said Gandhi. We can 

begin this practice today, not only here in Wisconsin as you do, but all over 

this country by calling upon the administration in Washington to stop the talk 

of war, stop the planning for war, stop the bombing, and stop plans for an invasion 

of Iraq! 

<p>The American people do not want war on Iraq! 

<p>The American people want peace. 

<p>They do not want war on Iraq! 

<p>Iraq did not cause 9/11. Iraq is not connected with Al Qaeda. Iraq had no connection 

to the anthrax attacks on our nations. There's no evidence Iraq has weapons of 

mass destruction, or the ability to deliver such weapons if it had them or the 

intention to do so. 

<p>There is no reason for war against Iraq. Stop the drumbeat. Stop the war talk. 

Pull back from the abyss of unilateral action and preemptive strikes. 

<p>It is time, instead, to explore more peaceful, consistent rhythms of the language 

of peace, of cooperation, mutuality, of recognition that all people - all people 

- have a right to life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness. 

<p>America should reach out to the global community to establish global security, 

work with the nations of the world, work with the United Nations. We should use 

our allies - allies like Russia which just concluded a forty billion dollar trade 

agreement with Iraq - to begin anew honest negotiations for honest weapons inspection. 

<p>The time has come for us to end the sanctions against Iraq, because those sanctions 

punish the people of Iraq because they have Saddam Hussein as their leader. We 

should end the sanctions against Iraq which have been instrumental in causing 

the deaths of hundreds of thousands of children. We should also drop the self-defeating 

policy of regime change. 

<p>Policies of aggression and assassination are not worthy of any nation with 

a democratic tradition, let alone a nation of people who love liberty and whose 

sons and daughters sacrifice to maintain that democracy. 

<p>The question isn't whether or not America has the military power for victory. 

The question is not whether America has the ability to destroy Saddam Hussein 

and Iraq. The question is whether we destroy something essential in this nation, 

by asserting that America has the right to do so anytime we well please. 

<p>America cannot and should not be the world's policeman. America cannot and 

should not try to pick the leaders of other nations. Nor should America and the 

American people be impressed into the service of international oil interests and 

arms dealers. 

<p>We must work to bring Iraq back into the community of nations, not through 

destruction, but through constructive action worldwide. America, with the international 

community, can help negotiate a resolution with Iraq which encompasses unfettered 

inspections, the end of sanctions, and the cessation of the regime-change policy. 

America can do this. We have the power to do this. We must have the will to do 

this. It must be the will of the American people expressed through the direct 

action of peaceful insistence, and this is the place to begin that. If we begin 

this in any place in America, begin it here! 

<p>We must change the metaphor of our society from one of war to peace. The Department 

of Defense now requires in excess of four hundred billion dollars for its activities. 

A Department of Peace can be an effective counterbalance, redirecting our national 

energies towards non-violent intervention, mediation, and conflict resolution 

on all matters of human security. 

<p>A Department of Peace can look at the domestic issues which our society faces 

and often ignores as we focus on matters international, because we have a problem 

with violence in our own society, and we need to look at it and address it in 

a structured way. And so a Department of Peace on a domestic level would look 

at issues of domestic violence, spousal abuse, violence in our schools, police-community 

relations, racial violence, violence against gays: that entire social pathology 

which is reflected in a nation which doesn't live up to its potential. 

<p>And yet we know, Americans have proven over and over again we're a nation that 

can rise to the challenges of our times, because our people have that capacity. 

And so, the concept of a Department of Peace is the vehicle by which we express 

our belief that we have the capacity to evolve as a people, that someday we could 

look back at this moment and understand that we took the steps along the way to 

make war archaic. War is not inevitable. Peace is inevitable! 

<p>This is our birthright, as citizens of a common planet. This is our birthright 

as citizens of a democracic society. 

<p>Today, America's attention is riveted on whether or not we're going to war. 

America's attentions would be much better placed if we found a way to bring universal 

health care into our society. 

<p>- If we found a way to guarantee that every young person in every state in 

our union could have free college education because we can afford it. 

<p>- If we found a way to wipe out unemployment, and bring a new WPA program, 

so everyone could have a job, so we could rebuild our cities. America has work 

to do. 

<p>In my district, senior citizens tell me about the high cost of prescription 

drugs. Drug companies are marking up those prescription drugs ten and twenty times. 

People are splitting their pills in order to try to make prescriptions last. They're 

forgoing meals in order to make their prescriptions last. 

<p>We need an America that is humane enough to recognize the basic needs of our 

own people. We have the ability and we certainly have the resources to do it. 

We must have the will. America has much work to do. 

<p>We have much work to do as a nation among nations. America should be leading 

the way in international cooperation. 

<p>I just came back from Johannesburg, South Africa at the World Summit on Sustainable 

Development. I will tell you that nations around the world are waiting for America 

to participate in world efforts to deal with the challenge of global climate change. 

It's time that we did! 

<p>- It's time that we ratified the Kyoto Agreement! 

<p>- It's time that we worked towards global reductions in nuclear arms! 

<p>- It's time that we got rid of nuclear weapons! 

<p>- It's time that we ended once and for all nuclear testing! 

<p>It's time that we begin to have an International Criminal Court, a biological 

weapons convention, a chemical weapons convention, and to recognize in all areas 

that international cooperation is the path to the future. International cooperation 

is the path of peace. International cooperation is the path that all Americans 

want to take. We have to insist our leaders take us in that direction. 

<p>It's time for peace. It's time for cooperation. 

<p>It's time for recognition of our interdependence. It's time for realizing the 

human family as one. What affects any one of us affects all of us. Our brothers 

and sisters in some faraway lands rely on us for attention, for conscious application 

of our hearts and our concerns about their rights. They rely on us for food. They 

do not rely on us for bombs. We should not be sending them bombs! 

<p>Today, in Wisconsin, here in Baraboo; you have the opportunity to restart the 

American evolution. To cause our country to evolve into a country which truly 

cares about the economic progress of all people. 

<p>- Which is truly invested in the unfolding of the higher cause of each person's 

life. 

<p>- Which recognizes its responsibility to regulate capital markets. 

<p>- Which recognizes its responsibility to stop the further widening of gaps 

in wealth in this country. 

<p>- Which recognizes its responsibility to make for more equitable distribution 

of the wealth in our society. 

<p>- Which recognizes its responsibility to make sure that this doesn't become 

a society where the rich get richer, and the poor get poorer, and the middle class 

disappears. 

<p>We're at an important moment in this country's history. It's a moment when 

we cannot afford to be on the sidelines. We have to be involved, with our heads 

and with our hearts and with a passionate belief in the destiny of our country 

and the destiny we still have to fulfill in realizing the dream of democracy. 

Of not simply political democracy, but of economic democracy, because you cannot 

have a political democracy until you have an economic democracy. 

<p>So our efforts must be for corporate accountability, for making sure corporations 

pay a fair share of the taxes; to make sure that people who work for a corporation 

have their pensions protected. 

<p>Our efforts have to be directed at the functions of those engines of international 

corporate capitalism: those organizations embodied in the World Trade Organization 

and the IMF. We must make sure that we take a strong stand on behalf of workers' 

rights and human rights and environmental quality principles in all of our trade 

agreements. It's essential. 

<p>It's time that we reclaim the power of the American people and begin the federal 

chartering of corporations. 

<p>And it's time we begin to reclaim our government. Senator Feingold made a valiant 

effort and needs to be applauded and congratulated. What we need in this country, 

once and for all, is public financing of elections. Take the corporations out 

of it! 

<p>Yesterday I joined with members of Congress in New York City in a special commemoration. 

For the second time in more than two hundred years we met in New York City in 

Federal Hall. We were there in solidarity with the people of New York and all 

those people everywhere who lost loved ones on 9/11. 

<p>And as we sat there in Federal Hall, as the Star Spangled Banner was being 

sung, I thought of those words of Francis Scott Key, who wrote "Oh say, does that 

Star Spangled Banner yet wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave." 

<p>In his writing, he connected, plaintively, freedom and bravery. Every time 

Americans sing this, we need to remember: to remain the land of the free, it will 

take courage. 

<p>- It will take courage to stand up. 

<p>- It will take courage to speak out. 

<p>- It will take courage to challenge a government that goes the wrong way. 

<p>- It will take courage in order to save our democracy. 

<p>- It will take courage in order to save a benevolent role for America in the 

world. 

<p>Oh say, does that Star Spangled Banner yet wave O'er the land of the free and 

the home of the brave! 

<p>Does it? Does it? Does it? 

<p>We begin today to renew this country, to bring this country back towards an 

upward path. The future of humanity can be secure, because we stand for democratic 

values. Because we stand for peace and because we stand for social and economic 

justice. Because we care enough to challenge our government in a moment of crisis 

to set our government back on the right path. 

<p>God bless you and Wisconsin for all that you have done in renewing a long tradition 

for progressive politics to ensure that the conscience of America remains alert 

to the challenges of the present day and the challenges of the future. 

<p>God bless America, and God bless Wisconsin. 

<p>Thank you very much.
