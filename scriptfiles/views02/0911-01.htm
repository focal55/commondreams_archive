<p>WASHINGTON -- One year after the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center 

and the Pentagon, how as a nation are we different? 

<P> Sometimes it takes fresh eyes to see the big picture. At dinner a few nights 

ago with friends who had been living in South Africa for two years, one of them 

remarked: &quot;I don&#39;t recognize the country I&#39;ve come back to.&quot; 

<P> She didn&#39;t refer, obviously, to any physical transformation, but rather 

to what struck her as an America that had lost its bearings and sense of self 

in its posture both abroad and at home. 

<P> She expressed concern that the imperative war on terrorism led by President 

Bush had become an umbrella for policies that have taken the country off its traditional 

course of multilateral cooperation overseas and respect for individual rights 

here. 

<P> Of particular distress to her was the notion that an American president had 

been openly and repeatedly speaking about invading another country as if it were 

no business of Congress, which constitutionally has the sole power to declare 

war, and only recently -- if reluctantly -- expressing a willingness to seek its 

authorization. 

<P> She said she was worried particularly about the new president&#39;s apparent 

willingness, if necessary, to go it alone against the Iraqi regime in the face 

of wide disaffection from many of the allies who stood shoulder to shoulder with 

his own father against it more than a decade ago. 

<P> This recent returnee to her own country also spoke with a certain bewilderment 

about what was going on here when American citizens and others could be taken 

into government custody and held for indeterminate periods without public disclosure 

of their identities or access to a lawyer. 

<P> All these sentiments have likewise been expressed by many Americans who never 

left the country, but perhaps have been more conditioned to these policies for 

having lived here through the trauma delivered upon them and their families directly 

or indirectly by the despicable events of Sept. 11. 

<P> Nevertheless, it does serve a useful purpose to stand back after the last 

year and look at where we have come as a country, and where we may be going. Before 

the terrorist attacks of a year ago, government policy was focused abroad on detachment 

from multilateral commitments in a variety of fields and at home on a pursuit 

of tax cuts amid the bounty of a federal budget surplus. 

<P> The attacks converted President Bush overnight into a multilateralist in his 

effort to convince other countries of their mutual stake in responding. But since 

then, as he has sought to link &quot;regime change&quot; in Iraq to the war on 

terrorism, he has indicated he will act unilaterally if recalcitrant allies can&#39;t 

be brought around. His lawyers have continued to insist he doesn&#39;t need a 

further resolution from Capitol Hill to invade Iraq, and not until a week ago, 

amid rising public concern, did he say he would seek it. 

<P> Meanwhile, at home, his infelicitous choice of John Ashcroft, a man seemingly 

blind, or at least indifferent, to civil liberties imperatives in a democratic 

society, sets policy at a Justice Department running rampant over constitutional 

rights, with not a word of concern from the Oval Office. 

<P> All this, when expressed by an American who left the country before the terrorists 

struck and, as we all like to say, &quot;changed the world,&quot; may seem overwrought 

to those of us who have been here all along. We may feel a greater justification 

for these breaks from traditional American postures in the face of the threats, 

open and clandestine, that confront us. 

<P> But at this notable time, a year to the day since the worst enemy attack on 

continental American soil, we need to balance our determination to eradicate the 

terrorist threat with a more disciplined respect for our democratic institutions, 

especially the constitutional limits on the exercise of power, at home and abroad.
