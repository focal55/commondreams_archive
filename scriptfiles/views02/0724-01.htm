<p> U.S. Rep. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent who has for years been Congress' 

most consistent critic of corporate excess, is worried about the current controversy 

about corporate governance. 

<P>Don't get Sanders wrong: He's delighted that revelations about wrongdoing by 

executives of Enron, WorldCom and other corporations has forced everyone from 

President Bush to Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., to recognize that 

government must regulate business behavior. 

<P>The problem, says Sanders, is that, while today's corporations are just as 

bad as the trusts that needed busting at the start of the last century, Bush is 

no Teddy Roosevelt and Daschle is no William Jennings Bryan. Instead of real reform, 

Republican and Democratic leaders are proposing half-steps aimed at requiring 

accountants to produce better balance sheets. 

<P>"The American people have a much better understanding than members of the Bush 

administration or Congress that this is not just about a few bad rules or a few 

bad apples. This is about how corporations do business in America today, and about 

what members of Congress who take immense amounts of corporate money to finance 

their campaigns allow those corporations to get away with," says Sanders. "If 

all that comes out of this are a few accounting reforms - necessary as they may 

be - most Americans are going to say, rightly, that the corporations were let 

off the hook again." 

<P>Sanders is frustrated with the refusal of top Democrats to show even the level 

of leadership that some Republicans have displayed. It is notable that, while 

Daschle has pulled the brakes on some reform proposals, Sen. John McCain, the 

Arizona Republican, is busy denouncing "crony capitalism," calling for the resignation 

of Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey Pitt, and saying that Congress' 

actions so far "fall short of doing all that is necessary." 

<P>Sanders argues that the dialogue itself falls short. Yes, the Vermont socialist 

says, corporations have used their lobbying muscle to warp accounting standards. 

But if Democrats think those are the only places where corporations have overstepped 

their bounds, they are destined to squander an opportunity to open a great debate 

about corporate influence over government. 

<P>"These (corporate executives and their representatives) are the same people 

who lobbied against having corporations pay their fair share of taxes," Sanders 

says. "These are the same people who have done everything in their power to reshape 

regulations so they can steal the money from employee pension plans. These are 

the same people who pressure Congress to grant them the 'freedom' to close factories 

in America, send our jobs to China and then ship back products made using prison 

labor." 

<P>Democratic strategists want to make corporate abuses an election issue. But 

to do that, Sanders says, "We have to broaden the debate. We have to tie the debate 

into the trade issue. We have to tie the debate into the estate tax issue. We 

have to tie the debate into pension issues. What we should be saying is that this 

whole debate is about a culture of corporate greed that has wrecked our communities, 

robbed our retirees and lowered the standards for ethical business behavior to 

a level that disgusts average Americans." 

<P>If Democrats would just start to listen to Bernie Sanders, they could reshape 

American politics. Of course, that would require that Democrats to stop listening 

to the corporate campaign contributors, who still set far to much of the agenda 

for what is supposed to be the party of the people.
