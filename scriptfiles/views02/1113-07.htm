<p>CAMBRIDGE, Massachusetts -- So you're a big movie producer and I'm a struggling 

screenwriter. Here's my pitch: The U.S. government sends a young, fresh-faced 

American to a far-off land in the midst of political turmoil. His mission: Make 

sure the good guys win. He can't speak the language, hasn't studied the culture. 

In fact, he hasn't really asked the people what they want. But he knows that America 

is right. So he gives money and weapons to the good guys and tries to help them 

remake the country in America's image. Before long, the U.S. military is deeply 

involved. American soldiers are dying, and Americans begin to question why the 

young man was ever sent there in the first place.

<p>This is perfect, you say. With the United States mired in Afghanistan and about 

to go to war with Iraq, this story touches on everything Americans are worried 

about today. Why hasn't someone made this movie already?

<p>In fact, someone has. The Australian director Phillip Noyce's film adaptation 

of Graham Greene's 1955 novel, &quot;The Quiet American,&quot; is set in Saigon 

during the early years of America's involvement in Vietnam. Starring Brendan Fraser 

as a young American intelligence officer, the film critically examines the U.S. 

role in Vietnam's civil war. Ultimately, the title character is implicated in 

acts of terrorism that result in the deaths of innocent Vietnamese; under the 

guise of a U.S. medical aid program, he imports the plastics used to make the 

bombs. &quot;The Quiet American&quot; has been finished for more than a year, 

and it was a hit at the Toronto Film Festival. Critics at home and abroad have 

raved.

<p>But Americans still can't see it.

<p>The film was first previewed in the United States on Sept. 10, 2001, and the 

audience reportedly loved it. The next day, on Sept. 11, the world was turned 

upside down, and &quot;The Quiet American&quot; lost its voice. Worried about 

possible negative reactions to the film among American audiences, the producers 

postponed the film's release indefinitely. Miramax executives reasoned that Americans 

wouldn't accept a portrayal of a fellow citizen in anything other than a positive 

light.

<p>&quot;The Quiet American&quot; may force Americans to question their beliefs 

about their country. But it is hardly anti-American. The title character's deep 

dedication to freedom and justice is never questioned. In fact, in the novel, 

the narrator writes of the naive officer, &quot;I never knew a man who had better 

motives for all the trouble he caused.&quot; The quiet American genuinely wants 

to help the Vietnamese - but he ends up burning the village in order to save it.

<p>Today, America's role in the world is being debated as never before. Is the 

United States to be the world's police officer, or should it retreat and focus 

exclusively on defending a homeland under siege? War seems imminent, and an administration 

that once expressed disdain for nation-building now speaks of regime change. &quot;The 

Quiet American&quot; is just the sort of film Americans should see as they debate 

the policy options their leaders have put forth.

<p>Under pressure from Michael Caine - whose performance in the film has been 

called the best of his career - Miramax has agreed to a limited opening of &quot;The 

Quiet American&quot; in the United States to ensure that the film will qualify 

for the Academy Awards. But to really succeed, it needs a nationwide release and 

the full backing of the studio.

<p>Do Miramax executives actually believe American audiences can't stomach critical 

assessments of U.S. foreign policy? Do they really think Americans are too weak 

to handle a healthy debate about their country's motives and methods overseas? 

Americans are stronger than Miramax seems to think. In fact, Americans' willingness 

to question their leaders without fear is the very essence of their patriotism. 

It is time to let &quot;The Quiet American&quot; speak. 

<p><i>The writer is a student at Harvard Law School. His first book, &quot;Another 

Quiet American,&quot; a memoir of his time in Laos, will be published in 2003.</i></p>
