Let's see if I got this straight.  The feds need to get information from the 

elite Al Qaida and Taliban prisoners held at the U.S. base in Cuba. The FBI 

and CIA know these "detainees" are fanatic in their devotion to their 

restricted, fundamentalist religious view. Therefore, they are treated  

harshly.



<p>Now that makes sense. What might happen if the U.S. authorities treated these 

guys with more civility and brought in loyal American Muslims to talk to 

them? Let us not forget that the vast majority of these prisoners have never 

been outside their tiny little corner of Afghanistan or their Arab country of 

origin, have neither physically visited the West nor come into contact 

intellectually with outsiders to their narrow band of understanding. Why not 

wideband them? There are examples worth mentioning: 



<p>1. Khruschev's point of view about the U.S. was deeply affected by seeing all 

the cars owned by employees in a huge factory parking lot; previously, he 

thought such claims -- that ordinary blue-collar workers could make enough to 

afford automobiles of their own -- were nothing but American propaganda.



<p>2. Or remember Malcolm X's experience: He hated all white people, to the 

point of obsession, until he made his hajj to Mecca. His view of the world 

was extremely circumscribed. In Mecca, he met Muslims of all stripes -- 

whites, Asians, blacks, Arabs, et al. -- and suddenly had a revelation that 

it was ideas and spirituality that bound human beings together, not color.



<p>Something similar could happen here if the U.S. really wants to get vital 

information out of its Al Qaida prisoners. Certainly, it couldn't hurt, and 

might actually prove useful.



<p>Ancillary point: If the FBI specifically and the Justice Department in 

general have moved from a prosecutorial mode to a deterrence mode -- i.e., 

the aim is to prevent terrorist acts rather than to put suspected terrorists 

on trial and get them incarcerated for long stretches -- then it follows that 

eventually, the government will have to release these "detainees" and they'll 

go back to the terrorist organizations that spawned them, and to the 

countries from whence they came, to wreak more havoc on the world. 



<p>True, by following its present tactics, the U.S. in the short run may be 

preventing immediate terrorist atrocities from occurring, and that's mighty 

important in breaking the momentum of Al Qaida's terror operations. But, 

given the religious zealotry of the prisoners and their dedication to the 

cause of jihad, in the long run we're asking for trouble.  Better to put them 

on trial and, if guilty, send them to prison.



<p>Bin Laden and the other jihadists do think long-range, looking decades (and 

in some cases, centuries) ahead. Their aim is nothing less than the 

destruction of the decadent West of the infidels, and the resurgence of the 

old-style Islamic empire. We may think this silly, to want to return the 

world to 7th- or 12th-century medievalism, but these guys are serious about 

it, and are willing to carry on this holy war for as long as it takes.



<p>Fundamentalism, of whatever stripe,  Islamic or Christian, seeks to keep the 

real world from seeping into the accepted Wor(l)d of God. That's why our own 

Talibanists -- the  Falwells and Robertsons and Sheltons in the U.S.  -- must 

not be let anywhere near the corridors of public power, and why our Founders' 

wisdom in keeping religion and the state totally separate must be celebrated 

and adhered to with great scrupulousness.  There are enough holy warriors and 

puritanical ayatollahs out there without importing their narrow mindset into 

our own society. (Still, Bush feels he owes them big time, and caters to 

their point of view quite often, in everything from stem-cell research to 

abortion to the right-to-die.)



<p>Speaking of narrowness, it seems quite clear now, after a year of residency 

in the White House, that George W. has inherited "the vision thing" deficit 

from his dad. He knows how to react, he knows how to mouth the trigger words 

of patriotism and battle, he knows how to pay off his conservative and 

far-right corporate and social-agenda backers, but he hasn't a clue about 

what might be done, what could be done, to make this a better country, a 

better world. "Compassionate conservatism," alas, was just a campaign 

buzzphrase.



<p>Nixon, because he was a conservative, was able to get us out of Vietnam, sit 

down with the Chinese, enact some decent social legislation -- and not get 

mauled too badly by his right-wing constituency. He had "the vision thing." 



<p>But George W., with his limited sense and knowledge of history and the world, 

is missing a golden opportunity to grow into a great president. Instead, 

devoid of vision, he is incapable of doing anything other than business as 

usual domestically (tax breaks for the wealthy and for large corporations, 

environmental rapaciousness and increased reliance on oil) and, aside from 

hunting terrorists, in the area of foreign policy as well. 



<p>What may trip him up is the arrogance of his imperial-like reign, from his 

take-no-prisoners  campaign to his savaging of the Bill of Rights to his 

stonewalling and lieing in the Enron scandal. Usually, it takes a few years 

for a president to get this swell-headed and start making big mistakes. 

George W. is risking self-destruction at an early stage. One can only hope.
