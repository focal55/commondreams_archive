<p>The Bush administration has lobbied persistently for permission to scratch 

its apparently insatiable itch to make war on Iraq. Congress has rolled over without 

much of a fight, but the American public has been less compliant. In his September 

25 speech to the US Naval War College, William Arkin spoke for many people when 

he said: “I can’t help but feel cynical about the fact that we are going to war 

to enhance the economic interests of the Enron class.” Some two weeks later, President 

Bush gave his Cincinnati speech – a long list of the evil things Saddam might 

do to us unless evil things are done to him first. Favorable press described the 

speech as unusually and admirably “reasoned and deliberate”. And yet, to many 

ears nothing Bush said rang half so true as that comment about enhancing the economic 

interests of the Enron class. 

<p>Bush’s rhetoric may indeed have had some rough edges taken off, but as anyone 

who has bought a used car from a reasoned and deliberate con artist can testify, 

this is not necessarily a basis for trust. At some point one has to rely on a 

sense of smell. And there is more than a little post-Enron stench left in the 

air as this administration announces who it would like to bomb next, hints at 

a date, and slots the public a little democratic debate time before the attack. 

When the Cincinnati speech solemnly posits that, “As Americans, we want peace. 

We work and sacrifice for peace,” the smell induces a wave of nausea. When the 

speech spends 30 minutes touting the Iraqi threat, and 10 seconds on a smooth 

reassurance that “this resolution does not mean that military action is imminent 

or unavoidable,” the smell becomes painfully familiar, taking us back to Gulf 

War I, when Bush the Father was drumming up support for his own used car, the 

Desert Storm, driven only on Sundays for purely defensive purposes. It was an 

easy sell. Thirty-odd countries and an assortment of poor cousins signed on the 

dotted line, largely owing, apart from the cash incentives, to the 250,000 Iraqi 

troops said to be massed on the border threatening to roll over Saudi Arabia. 

<p>Few bothered to so much as kick Desert Storm’s tires, but among those who did, 

one discovered an astonishing wobble: “[The Iraqi buildup] was the whole justification 

for Bush sending troops in there, and it just didn’t exist.” According to Scott 

Petersen’s “In War, Some Facts Less Factual” (6 Sept Christian Science Monitor), 

experts examining satellite photos taken at the same time as the classified Pentagon 

photos on which Bush the Father based his pitch, were “surprised to see almost 

no sign of the Iraqis.” As the Pentagon has never declassified its “incriminating” 

photographs, we may never know who they actually incriminate. Jean Heller, the 

journalist who broke the story, repeatedly asked then Secretary of Defense Cheney’s 

office for an explanation for the quarter million evaporated Iraqi troops. The 

answer? “Trust us.” 

<p>Now we’re back on the car lot, and many of the salesmen look familiar. Cheney 

is back, and even Bush as Son Incarnate. “Trust us,” is back too. The car itself 

sounds familiar, a mint condition Regime Change, doesn’t use a drop of oil, a 

bargain at 200 billion dollars, not a scratch on it. Too often it feels like we’re 

in the middle of a stage play, “Demockery” let’s call it, a kind of Restoration 

comedy from hell involving a cast of salespeople with names like Richard Peril, 

Dick Chicanery, Dupeya, Conthepeople Rice, Rumsfeld Stiltskin, Paul Crywolfowitz…. 

Add to this rogues’ gallery one mustachioed stock villain, Sodom Insane, and the 

cast is complete. There is a more sobering reflection – that “Demockery” is not, 

after all, a comedic farce with some innocuous ending, but a tragedy – in the 

recent words of Anatol Lieven: “the tragedy of a great country, with noble impulses, 

successful institutions, magnificent historical achievements and immense energies, 

which has become a menace to itself and to mankind.” 

<p>In the absence of what governments these days like to call transparency, and 

given the Bush administration’s long list of ulterior motives for fighting a fresh 

war, the sooner the better, this does not quite smell like the moment for trust. 

No doubt there is some (perhaps much) truth in Bush’s assertions against the Iraqi 

regime. No doubt there is also some (perhaps much) duplicity in his underlying 

motives and intentions. This government would not be the first to have appropriated 

William Blake’s intended words of warning as a modus operandi: “A truth that’s 

told with bad intent beats all the lies you can invent.” 

<p>The current issue of trust hardly needs be boiled down to the with-us-or-against-us 

logic of a recent headline: “Whom should the US Trust: Bush or Hussein?” The answer 

for now is a fairly self-evident Neither One. And more pressing questions come 

to mind. What’s been happening to our economy? Why do we feel revulsion but not 

all that much surprise as a sniper terrorizes our national capital? Did 250,000 

Iraqi soldiers vanish into thin air during Gulf War I, and if so, why hasn’t the 

Vatican granted the event miracle status? And finally, if this is democracy, why 

does it so often smell like demockery? </p>
