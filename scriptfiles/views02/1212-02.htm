<p>ON TELEVISION, the good guys almost always catch the criminal by the 

last commercial. But in real life, criminals disappear and reappear with 

puzzling unpredictability.

<P>American intelligence operations, for example, have been unable to locate 

Osama bin Laden, the 6-foot-4 bearded al Qaeda leader who masterminded the 

terrorist attacks of Sept. 11. From somewhere -- a cave or a trawler on the 

high seas -- he still directs a multinational terrorist organization and 

taunts and threatens American officials.

<P>Mullah Omar, the one-eyed enigmatic Taliban leader, has also disappeared. 

Every so often, some farmer spots him wandering in the mountains of 

Afghanistan, but American forces have been unable to find him as well.

<P>The anthrax killer has also vanished -- after sending deadly spores through 

the postal system to members of Congress and the media. According to Barbara 

Hatch Rosenberg, a molecular biologist with the Federation of American 

Scientists, the FBI knew within two weeks that the strain of anthrax 

originated within the U.S. bio-defense program. This has led some to wonder if 

the government would prefer that the culprit remain undiscovered. If missing, 

he can't reveal secrets about our government's biological weapons research 

labs.

<P>But despite these intelligence lapses, give the Bush administration credit 

for capturing an impressive crowd of prominent former criminals.

<P>John Poindexter, for example, has emerged from relative obscurity to head 

the new Orwellian office of Total Information Awareness, housed in the 

Pentagon. Once a national security adviser to President Reagan, Poindexter 

helped mastermind the Iran-Contra arms-for-hostages scam that sought to evade 

congressional will. In 1990, he was convicted of five felony counts (later 

overturned on a technicality) for lying to Congress. Now he is armed with an 

immense database that can track all our of lives through government and 

commercial sources.

<P>Also resurrected is Elliot Abrams, another veteran of the Iran-Contra 

scandal. President Bush has just appointed him director of Middle Eastern 

affairs. In 1987, Abrams pleaded guilty to withholding information from 

Congress. Five years later, Bush senior pardoned him.

<P>Don't forget John Negroponte and Otto Reich, also veterans of the Iran-

Contra scam. They are now, respectively, our ambassador to the United Nations 

and special envoy for the Western Hemisphere affairs at the State Department.

<P>Henry Kissinger is also back, though not by popular demand. President Bush 

chose him to lead the independent commission that will investigate why our 

government failed to prevent the deadly terrorist attacks against American 

civilians. For the record, Kissinger has not been charged with any crime, 

though many believe he committed more than a few when he conducted government 

affairs in secrecy and with deceit. His harshest critics, moreover, have 

accused him of war crimes -- of orchestrating the secret bombing of Cambodia 

and the violent overthrow of Salvador Allende, the elected president of Chile, 

in 1973.

<P>Even Jim Crow -- long thought dead after the passage of civil rights laws 

in the 1960s -- made a surprise appearance when Senate Republican leader Trent 

Lott of Mississippi praised retiring Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., for having 

defended white supremacy and legal segregation.

<P>Well, there you have it. Call it what you will -- coddling criminals or 

compassionate conservatism -- but this is the Bush administration's quixotic 

record for finding and bringing criminals to justice.</p>
