Dear Soldiers,



<p>We've met with many of you in recent days, sometimes

at gunpoint, sometimes in more relaxed settings when

your guns weren't aimed at us.  Some of you, trained

as snipers,  have chosen to shoot over our heads.  



<p>We think many of you join us in desiring to inflame

passions for justice and peace rather than passions

for hatred and war.  



<p>Many of you have told us that you don't want to carry

and use weapons, that you have no choice, that you are

only doing your job, that you are only following

orders.  As we left the Jenin Camp, one of you called

out, "It's very comfortable for you to judge us from

New York City."  We don't want to be the judges, but

yes, there will be a judgment from Jenin, from

Nuremberg. 



<p>Others of you have said that you must follow orders to

kill and destroy because it is the only way to protect

your country.  



<p>But the brutality of the devastation wreaked upon

Jenin and other West Bank cities will never ease the

conflict between Israelis and Palestinians.



<p>We ask you please to consider Colin Powell's statement

made on September 11 after the second suicide attack

on the World Trade Center.  He said, "The people who perpetrated this barbarous act think that by killing people and destroying buildings you can achieve a political goal." And then he said, "They are always wrong."  All who support or enact violent means, whether random or systematic, whether as leaders or followers, need to look into the mirror which is held up to us in that statement.  



<p>Presidents Sharon, Arafat, and Bush, along with Mr.

Powell, share the attitude that it is they and their

emissaries who alone can resolve the conflict by

sitting down at negotiating tables.  Certainly

negotiation and dialogue are preferable to brute force

as means to at least temporarily enforce a ceasefire

and reinstate a peace process.  But when we who are

ordinary people emphasize negotiations by people in

power, we disempower ourselves.  The leadership on all

sides has been empowered and enriched, but it is also

exhausted and overstretched.  The leaders are not up

to the potential of their own people.



<p>So we are asking you not to follow those who would

lead you toward more killing and more destruction. 

We're asking you to find kindred spirits within your

ranks and beyond who will lead in new directions,

unarmed and reliant on focused nonviolent efforts to

achieve peace.  



<p>Sincerely,



<p>Kathy Kelly <br>

Father Jerry Zawada<br>
