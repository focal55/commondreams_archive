<p>WHEN ATTORNEY General John Ashcroft announced that the sniper suspects - John 

Allen Muhammad and Lee Boyd Malvo - would be tried first in Virginia, we all knew 

what he meant. 

<P> He said he wanted to have &quot;the best law, the best facts and the best 

range of available penalties.&quot; It&#39;s that last one that Mr. Ashcroft focused 

on. And he&#39;s not alone. 

<P> The instant Mr. Muhammad and Mr. Malvo were taken into custody, talk on the 

airwaves turned from the fear people felt during the reign of the alleged snipers 

to how best to kill them. 

<P> You would think that &quot;the ultimate sanction&quot; is the only one available. 

But it&#39;s not. Life in prison can both punish and keep accused killers from 

killing again. 

<P> Virginia has far broader death penalty statutes than Maryland or the federal 

government. In Maryland, it was possible that the snipers may not have been eligible 

for the death penalty. And in Maryland and under federal law, Mr. Malvo could 

not be executed if he were convicted because he was not 18 when he allegedly committed 

his crimes. 

<P> Eighteen is when someone is considered responsible for his own actions. Eighteen 

is when Americans are permitted to vote. Eighteen is when people can join the 

military without parental permission. Even though children under 18 can act like 

adults, the social contract is clear in saying they are not adults. 

<P> If children are committing crimes, accepted wisdom says we should help them, 

not execute them. 

<P> Shouldn&#39;t we be embarrassed over trying to figure out, almost desperately, 

how we can execute this 17-year-old who allegedly threatened to execute other 

children? Isn&#39;t it unseemly for prosecutors to be falling over themselves 

to see who can make sure the alleged snipers get a lethal injection? Will there 

be a trial? Or will we go completely through the looking glass? To paraphrase 

the Queen of Hearts, first the sentence, then the trial. Off with their heads, 

indeed. 

<P> Executing Mr. Muhammad and Mr. Malvo won&#39;t make us safer. It won&#39;t 

explain how this happened or help us figure out how to stop it from happening 

again. 

<P> Adding serial killing to the list of death-eligible crimes in Maryland or 

lowering the age at which people are eligible for the death penalty also won&#39;t 

make the streets safer. Capital punishment only gives politicians a way to appear 

tough on crime and addresses a deep lust for revenge. Revenge is not the purpose 

of justice. 

<P> The family members of murder victims do not always want the death penalty. 

Groups such as Murder Victims&#39; Families for Reconciliation are made up of 

people who have lost family members to violence and still oppose capital punishment. 

But often those opposing the death penalty are made to feel - by the media and 

the prosecutor&#39;s offices - as though they didn&#39;t really love their family 

members. The assumption, of course, is that if you love someone you would want 

to see his or her killer executed. 

<P> Some of the family members of the sniper victims have expressed similar positions. 

But Mr. Ashcroft has already signaled what he wants by moving the first trials 

to Virginia - the state with the second-highest number of executions in the United 

States after Texas. He&#39;d like the heads of both men on a plate. Is this what 

we want to be showing our children?
