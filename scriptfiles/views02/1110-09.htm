<p>The election in Georgia said it all. The Democrat governor, Roy Barnes, had 

dared to remove the Confederate symbol from the state flag last year. His Republican 

challenger wanted to bring it back, to honor, he said, 300,000 Confederate 'veterans'. 

A Republican has not occupied Georgia's governor's mansion since 1872. After last 

Tuesday, one does, courtesy of wanting to celebrate a civil war fought to defend 

slavery. 

<P>Europeans do not understand the curious civilization that the current America 

is becoming, and the grip that a visceral and idiosyncratic conservatism has on 

its national discourse. They especially do not understand the undercurrents of 

an increasingly self-confident and subtle racism that is its own variant of the 

forces that in Europe gave us Le Pen and Pim Fortuyn. George Bush Jr is a chip 

off the old multilateralist, transatlantic establishment, runs the European argument. 

He may seem hawkishly conservative but, in the end, he seeks UN resolutions like 

other American Presidents. Even at home, his bark is worse than his bite. 

<P>Wrong, wrong and wrong again. Anyone who thinks the Tory party is 'nasty' has 

not encountered contemporary American republicanism. Georgia's Republican Party, 

for example, is now lead by Ralph Reed, a long-time crusader against abortion, 

divorce and single parent families. He would regard last week's vote in the House 

of Lords allowing unmarried and gay couples to adopt as the work of Satan. He 

is part of US conservatism's ideological hard core. 

<P>Reed played every card he could. If the governorship was to be won celebrating 

the Confederacy, the race for the Senate seat would be no less shameless. The 

Democrat incumbent had lost three limbs fighting in Vietnam, but was attacked 

for being unpatriotic - the worst accusation in today's US - because he believed 

that unions should be able to recruit in the newly established Department of Homeland 

Security. 

<P>And so one of American liberalism's darkest days was repeated across the country. 

Minnesota and Missouri, long-time Democrat strongholds, fell. Governor Jeb Bush, 

despite the Democrats insisting that justice now be done for those infamous chads, 

won in Florida. As if to underscore conservatism's ascendancy, the only Democrat 

gain was in Arkansas where the Republican senator had suffered a messy divorce 

and his Democrat challenger was even more pro-gun and pro-Bible than the incumbent. 

<P>The result is that the Republicans now control the Senate, House and the presidency 

for the first time since President Eisenhower. The consolidation of America as 

an ultra conservative country is going to take place rapidly. Mr Bush may have 

offered a few tit-bits to show his credentials as a 'compassionate conservative', 

like his concern to reduce the price of prescription drugs for the elderly, but 

the core of the Republican program is anything but. There will be radical tax 

cuts for the rich and the corporations; a freezing of all efforts to stiffen regulation 

in the wake of America's corporate scandals; moves to privatize the social security 

system; and a roll-back of environmental protection. 

<P>Abroad, there will be the continued construction of a new international order 

built around the prejudices of the American Right; unqualified support for Israel, 

building the National Missile Defense System and tepid support for the framework 

of international law and treaties. 

<P>Nor do the Conservatives' ambitions stop there. Following the ideas of the 

high priest of ultra conservatism, Leo Strauss, they want to construct a republic 

of 'moral', god-fearing citizens who adhere to traditional virtues, rewarding 

the rich who can only have become rich through the virtue of hard work and penalizing 

the poor who are only poor because of their own fecklessness. Above all, by now 

having the opportunity to pack the judiciary with extreme right-wing judges, they 

intend to do away with the famous Roe v Wade judgment that legalized abortion. 

This is the most fiercely reactionary program to have emerged in any Western democracy 

since the war, and for which last Tuesday's vote, argue Republicans, is an explicit 

mandate. 

<P>Horseshit. George Bush has al-Qaeda and a low turn-out to thank for his victory. 

The central message of his five-day tour of 15 key states in the last week of 

the election was to play on Americans' fears about terrorism, rallying them behind 

their national leader. When the electorate voted locally, the Democrats had the 

edge, winning governorships in four of the biggest industrial states - Illinois, 

Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan. The Democrats I have spoken to are so traumatized 

by the overall defeat that they dismiss these gains as irrelevant; I think they 

are wrong. 

<P>America is not a happy place. A generation of increasingly conservative policies 

has shrunk the American middle and induced not just fantastic inequality but a 

sharp decline in social mobility and opportunity. The US's social contract, never 

more than minimalist, is now threadbare. Consumer confidence is low; job insecurity 

high. American capitalism is viewed with deep skepticism. Nor are the majority 

of Americans social conservatives and closet racists; they do not want the clock 

put back over women's rights, the environment and race. 

<P>The trouble was that this silent liberal majority was only prepared to voice 

its preoccupations at state rather than national level, if it bothered to vote 

at all. The Democrats had to find a way of voicing the concerns of the mass of 

Americans while not undermining the President during a national emergency, but 

to do that they had to have a powerful pitch based on a liberal ideology as animating 

and dynamic as that of the conservatives. They didn't and they lost. 

<P>But the game isn't up. America's conservatives, blinded by their ideology and 

in control of every lever of government, will overreach themselves and the reality 

of what they plan will become evident to all, stirring the apathetic voter and 

reminding the best of America what it stands for. Last week represented the highwater 

mark of American conservatism and, although it looks bleak, the beginnings of 

the long-awaited liberal revival. Not just the United States, but the world, needs 

it badly. In the meantime, despite its flaws, give thanks to the European Union 

for partial shelter from the conservative storm.</p>
