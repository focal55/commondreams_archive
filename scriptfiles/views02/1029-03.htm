<p>In this time of immeasurable grief I remember Paul Wellstone -- teacher, mentor, 

organizer, writer, senator -- but most of all friend. Paul was one of those rare 

individuals who despite moving in the circles of power and influence, never forgot 

where he came from, who he was or the people he represented.</P>

<P>Walking into the Senate office building with Paul was a remarkable experience. 

Every security guard, elevator operator and cafeteria worker in the building greeted 

Paul because they knew him and loved him. He despised elitism and did all that 

he could to honor the humanity of each person he met. He looked into the eyes 

of those who were invisible to so many other senators and saw his own mother and 

father and the countless ordinary people like them. The elevator operators were 

a reminder to Paul of why it was he had come to Washington.</P>

<P>Thousands of Minnesotans can attest to Paul and Sheila&#39;s deep humanity, 

expressed daily in handwritten notes, phone calls or visits when we lost a family 

member, were hospitalized or greeted the birth of a child. </P>

<P>I will never forget my daughter&#39;s high school graduation party five years 

ago. Thirty minutes before the party was to begin, the doorbell rang. I cursed 

the early arrivals, only to find Paul and Sheila on my front step. They had stopped 

on their way to the airport, apologetic for being early, but eager to wish our 

daughter well as she started off to college. </P>

<P>Those of us who had the privilege of working with Paul and Sheila on this campaign 

were touched daily by their humanity. They thanked us endlessly, laughed and shared 

their frustrations with us. They constantly told us to go home to get some sleep, 

even as they pushed on to the next event. Many people asked me about Paul&#39;s 

health throughout the campaign. I always assured them that Paul had more stamina 

and energy than anyone on staff. </P>

<P>Campaign staff have routinely worked 70-hour weeks for months. We would not 

have done it for anyone else. He was our hero -- a one-of-a-kind politician of 

principle and integrity with a fierce determination to make the state and country 

better for all people. He made us believe in politics and politicians. He was 

a powerful person because he worked for a vision greater than himself. He was 

a true public servant.</P>

<P>In the last four months I had the honor of watching Paul and Sheila meet with 

new immigrants from across the globe. We listened to the stories of people who 

had made their way to Minnesota from Tibet, Somalia, Laos, Mexico and elsewhere. 

Paul and Sheila shared their belief that the participation of new immigrants and 

other people of color in the coming election would be a strong and hopeful story 

from this campaign. They reminded the new Americans and all of us that by expanding 

the circle of participation, we renew our democracy. </P>

<P>That dream lives on in those of us who are left behind. We will continue to 

live those principles in honor of our dear lost friends.</P>
