<p>Amtrak's unexpected predictions of bankruptcy and shutdown late last month 

produced quite a bit of coverage in the press, but only a desultory debate in 

Washington, where the administration offered a band-aid solution that will just 

briefly postpone the serious consideration our nation's troubled passenger railroad 

deserves. 

<p>In exchange for $100 million needed to keep them functioning through mid-August, 

Amtrak agreed to cut $100 million from next year's budget and undertake a variety 

of management reforms. Amtrak also asked for another $100 million to $170 million 

to stay afloat through October 1, when the new fiscal year begins. However, Congress 

insists that the second payment be made in the form of a loan, instead of the 

appropriation Amtrak wants; meanwhile, the White House has said that next year's 

Amtrak budget would be only $521 million, less than half of the $1.2 billion Amtrak 

requires. 

<p>The Amtrak situation is obviously far from resolved, and will be one of the 

first issues considered when Congress returns from its Fourth of July recess. 

We can expect a repeat of the June debates. Amtrak's detractors will criticize 

its unprofitability and history of mismanagement, and renew their demands for 

its gutting and eventual privatization. Amtrak's supporters will argue that privatizing 

passenger rail has been disastrous elsewhere, especially in Britain, and that 

public transportation is inherently unprofitable. 

<p>Supporters will also point to the enormous federal subsidies given to highways 

and the notoriously insolvent airline industry. America's highways and roads received 

$32 billion last year, more than Amtrak has received in its thirty-one year existence; 

the airlines receive some $13 billion each year. While Amtrak lost $1.1 billion 

in 2001, United Airlines alone lost nearly twice that -- an amount that cannot 

be explained merely by invoking September 11, and makes it difficult to countenance 

their recent application for $2 billion in federal loan guarantees. Amtrak's defenders 

will also cite the relative environmental friendliness of passenger rail. Trains 

burn fewer fossil fuels than airplanes, and tend to be located in city centers 

rather than outskirts, helping to diminish urban sprawl. 

<p>However, conspicuously absent from all sides of the June debate was any sense 

of the actual experience of rail travel. When Secretary of Transportation Norman 

Mineta said that for the $350 the government spends to send someone by rail from 

New Orleans to Los Angeles, they could just as easily be sent on a plane, nobody 

told him that he was missing the point altogether. Traveling by train is a unique 

and valuable experience, in itself worth saving. 

<p>Air travel is, first and foremost, profoundly antisocial. On a plane, one hopes 

simply not to be bothered, and usually spends the voyage in a coccoon of silence 

and in-flight movies. Humanity's ancient dream of flight is reduced to long hours 

strapped uncomfortably in a metal cylinder, eating food that tastes like styrofoam 

and breathing recycled air, windows pulled shut to block the sun and facilitate 

the broadcast forgettable Hollywood pap. 

<p>On a train, however, one moves about, meets people, shares stories. I think 

back to a trip I took a few years ago, from Boston to Chicago and then to San 

Francisco. On the first leg of the journey, the woman beside me was on her way 

to find a man she'd met on a dating hotline and hoped to marry, sight unseen. 

As we passed through Ohio I had breakfast with an Irish exchange student, and 

during the stopover in Chicago was taken to lunch by a community college teacher 

from Albuquerque. I made a bet -- which I eventually lost -- on the Y2K bug with 

an overblown Texas businessman, and had drinks with an old Hawaiian who traveled 

the world twelve months a year visiting properties he'd acquired with a fortune 

begun as a teenage auto-factory worker. In the lounge car we helped an errant 

Boy Scout escape the wrath of his scoutmaster. I met a Vietnam veteran who claimed 

to have put himself through law school in order to prosecute the unsolved murder 

of his wife, and began a friendship with a young woman from rural New Mexico that 

I treasure to this day. 

<p>Traveling upon an airplane, it as if nothing existed between the points of 

departure and arrival. Everything beneath is bypassed. This is an unconscious 

reflection of that basic intention of modern consumerism: the reduction of distance 

by making all places the same. Planes remove us from the world, hiding both the 

beauty and ugliness of reality. On a train, one at least glimpses the world outside: 

the homes, the people, the land. On my trip I witnessed the deadening sprawl of 

the Eastern seaboard, the industrial graveyards that now stand deserted like the 

playgrounds of a race of giants. I awoke to midwestern fields as flat and endless 

as the ocean, with roads as straight as a beam of light disappearing on the horizon. 

I saw the snowcapped Rockies rise from the great plains, the red rocks of the 

Southwest at sunset, and the lushness of northern California spreading from the 

foot of the Sierras. At night I saw homes flash by as rectangles of cozy light 

in an infinite darkness, and fell asleep to the lullaby rhythym of the rails. 

For all that airplanes are a symbol of modern America, trains are far more fundamentally 

American. 

<p>Before the recession, America's economic boom was proclaimed as a new age of 

abundant time, luxury, and ease. This turned out to be a lie: the increased efficiency 

brought on by advances in technology and managment resulted in heavier workloads 

and longer hours. The market prevailed over all; 24/7/365 became part of the lexicon, 

and personal life was subjugated to imperatives of growth and profit. Passenger 

trains are a visible refutation of this, and perhaps that is the reason Amtrak 

is regarded so distastefully in Washington. 

<p>Certainly there are many improvements Amtrak should make in equipment and service 

and management -- but these require not less federal funding, but more, and for 

this to happen our legislators must acknowledge that the quality of a journey 

is not always measured by its speed. Faster is not necessarily better. In these 

unsettled times, trains are a reminder that sometimes we ought to slow down. </p>
