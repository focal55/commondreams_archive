<p>PARIS -- TENSION AND distrust are now overriding factors in Washington's relations 

with its European allies. The initial European response to last September's terrorist 

attacks on New York and Washington - a tightening of alliance links - has been 

wasted by the United States.

<P>The US press is given mild and conciliatory messages about the underlying firmness 

of trans-Atlantic cooperation in the war against terrorism and the unimportance 

of European criticisms, but these reassurances are not borne out by conversations 

with European leaders or in analyses in the mainstream European press. Criticism 

and apprehension about the consequences of US policies prevail. In private there 

is consistent criticism. In public, nothing serious is said or done by the European 

governments.</P>

<P>It might seem that Americans could therefore ignore what the Europeans think 

or say in the belief that European objections to US policies make no difference. 

The Europeans will eventually fall in line. They have no real alternative. This 

time, that might be a dangerously complacent conclusion, because the Europeans 

do have alternatives, explosive ones. They could overturn the post-Cold War alignment 

tomorrow and do so to their own probable political and economic profit.</P>

<P>They do not themselves understand their power. Few among Europe's leaders seem 

to grasp that if the European NATO governments and public indeed object to a US 

attack on Iraq, they can prevent it, or block it for many months, while accomplishing 

a transformation in the Middle Eastern situation.</P>

<P>Few understand that the European Union does not have to wait until it has built 

up its feeble military forces in order to have an independent world policy with 

independent international influence to rival that of the United States. The world 

today is not one in which military forces are the most effective means of power.</P>

<P>This is already evident in the commercial and economic relations of Brussels 

between Washington. Washington cannot dismiss European corporate strength and 

economic competition. It is compelled to deal with the European Union as a powerful 

trade rival to whom it has to make concessions.</P>

<P>The same thing could be accomplished in political relations if the European 

NATO allies, or even some of them, were to take a simple but decisive step: reaffirm 

that, as its founding treaty states, NATO is an alliance of independent and politically 

equal countries.</P>

<P>The Europeans could refuse US use of NATO's European assets in an attack on 

Iraq on the grounds that such an attack does not fall under the agreements on 

countering terrorism that produced NATO's antiterrorism resolution of last September.</P>

<P>To do this would not destroy NATO. It might even save it by recreating in it 

a political equilibrium. Sooner or later the European powers will have to deal 

with the consequences of US unilateralism, and if the European public feels strongly 

about Iraq (and indeed about the Israeli-Palestine situation), now could be the 

best occasion to act.</P>

<P>The fundamental reason that NATO will not be destroyed is that the United States 

needs NATO more than Europe does. </P>

<P>NATO no longer serves to protect Europe from any threat. The threat is gone. 

NATO provides the indispensable material and strategic infrastructure for US military 

and strategic deployments throughout Europe, Eurasia, the Middle East, and Africa.</P>

<P>NATO gives the United States a military presence, usually with extraterritorial 

privileges, in every one of the alliance member countries and in most of the former 

Warsaw Pact and Soviet countries that are members of the Partnership for Peace.</P>

<P>Washington needs NATO because without NATO the United States has no legitimate 

claim to a say in European internal matters. Richard Holbrooke once said (to some 

European indignation) that the United States is a European power. So it is, so 

long as NATO exists.</P>

<P>A polite mutiny by some or all of the European NATO countries on the question 

of war with Iraq would certainly produce what Saddam Hussein might describe as 

the mother of all trans-Atlantic rows, but in the end the United State would back 

down. </P>

<P>After such a mutiny, NATO would be a different alliance. After that, the European 

allies would certainly never again have reason to complain that Washington was 

paying no attention to them. But do the Europeans really want this? Or is it all 

talk?</P>
