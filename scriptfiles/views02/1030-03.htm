<p>Forty years ago, I sat down proudly in Trafalgar Square alongside Bertrand 

Russell and thousands of others in protest against Britain's weapons of mass destruction. 

We were all breaking the law. 

<P>There was a lot of civil disobedience at that time, organised by the Committee 

of 100. The committee's arguments were founded in the horrific nature of nuclear 

weapons and the urgency of alerting the government to widespread public disquiet 

about them. The square was cleared by police in the early morning and the committee 

eventually vanished. 

<P>Now, however, 40 years on, a monstrous war looms in the Middle East for which 

there is not the slightest justification. Every single charge against Saddam Hussein 

- that he has nuclear weapons, repeatedly breaks international law by invading 

his neighbours, and is a constant threat to peace in the region - applies tenfold 

to the client state of the United States in the region, Israel. 

<P>The war on Iraq proposed by President Bush is a classic imperialist invasion 

to safeguard oil supplies. Very few governments in the world - and absolutely 

none in the Middle East - support Mr Bush's war. Britain's New Labour government 

is an exception - no one doubts that if Mr Bush does go to war in Iraq, he can 

rely on the grovelling support of the British government. Yet in the country the 

situation is very different. Opinion polls show a majority against war. The enormous 

anti-war demonstration last month took everyone by surprise, but was ignored in 

parliament and patronised in the press. Only 70 MPs out of 650 made even a gesture 

against the Iraq war. Lots of people joining in tomorrow's anti-war day will wonder 

what it takes to get their protest noticed. Who else can stop the war but the 

people? The case for civil disobedience, strong enough in the early 1960s, seems 

even stronger now.
