FREDERICKSBURG, Va.--JUST THINK HOW bad it would be if people in wealthier, 

more developed parts of the world exported their garbage to Virginia.



<p>Oh, yeah, that already happens. (Thanks, New York.)



<p>But just think how terrible it would be if that garbage were laden with 

toxic substances such as lead, mercury, and cancer-causing cadmium--and all of it were dumped in fields, ponds, wetlands, irrigation 

ditches, and along riverbanks, where it then contaminated

local soil and water.



<p>If you were living in Guilu, China, you wouldn't have to imagine this 

scenario--it would be reality for you. And like many people in that impoverished village, you might be eking out an existence scavenging 

components from thousands of discarded electronic

machines in ways that cause lead poisoning in your children and an increased 

risk of cancer for you, your loved ones, and your

neighbors.



<p>A report released recently by the <a href="http://www.ban.org/" target="_new">Basel Action Network</a> and <a href="http://www.svtc.org/" target="_new">Silicon Valley 

Toxics Coalition</a>--with assistance from other

organizations in India, Pakistan, and China--states that the United States 

and other developed nations are exporting huge amounts

of dangerous electronic waste, or e-waste, to places like Guilu.



<p>The report, available online at www.ban.org, found that between 50 percent 

and 80 percent of the electronic equipment collected

at recycling centers in the United States isn't really recycled at all. 

Instead, it winds up on that proverbial slow boat to China and is dumped in unfortunate places like Guilu, where there is no pretense of 

protecting the environment or public health from the toxic substances contained in the high-tech refuse.



<p>The production-consumption-disposal circuit that electronic gadgets travel 

during their life cycle illustrates some of the grim fundamentals of the global economy as it exists in the real world, not in 

the minds of economists and ideologues.



<p>Consider a computer that is "recycled" and finds a final resting place in a 

puddle in a Chinese village where a local person

disassembles it with a hammer. The computer likely was made by very poor 

people--possibly Chinese--who are unable to organize independent unions because of political repression. Those who do try to 

organize get beaten up, thrown in jail--or worse.



<p>The multinational corporation for whom that computer was made knows all 

about those repressive conditions that keep wages

down and considers them, in the murky argot of contemporary capitalism, 

"competitive advantages."



<p>The computer ends up being sold to a consumer in an affluent country. When 

the consumer upgrades in a couple of years, he

turns in the computer to a recycling center, whereupon it's eventually 

shipped to some poor country and poisons a village like Guilu with its heavy-metals content and carcinogens.



<p>Oddly enough, there exists an international treaty, called the Basel 

Convention, that prohibits the export of hazardous wastes from rich countries to poor ones. But--wouldn't you know it?--the United States 

has yet to ratify it (we join Haiti and Afghanistan as the

only nations able to claim that dubious honor).



<p>Meanwhile, the United States also has exempted toxic e-waste from its own 

laws pertaining to exports.



<p>The National Safety Council estimates that Americans have discarded or will 

discard as many as 315 million computers between 1997 and

2004. So the problem of e-waste isn't going away; the question is how to 

deal with an impending crisis in a responsible and ethical manner.



<p>Environmental organizations are calling on the United States to follow 

Europe's example and immediately implement a ban on the

export of any hazardous waste to developing countries. They also are pushing 

for the United States and other developed countries

to address the e-waste problem "upstream"--that is, at the point of 

production.



<p>The Basel Action Network and Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition say the 

electronics industry should be required to establish "take-back" recycling programs, phase out the use of toxic parts, and create 

new green designs for long life, upgradeability, and

easy recycling.



<p>Some companies are already making efforts to take back what they produce. 

Xerox, through its office-equipment leasing program,

is said to reuse most of the components in its machines.



<p>But greater corporate and government accountability as regards e-waste is 

not likely to materialize unless there's grass-roots

agitation demanding it. Fortunately, groups such as the Basel Action Network 

and Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition provide some

hope on this front.



<p>Local movements for environmental justice also offer cause for optimism. 

These movements have gained considerable steam in

the past decade and in some cases have brought a halt to illegal and 

dangerous polluting practices in or around poor neighborhoods in the United States.



<p>The same principles that drive local environmental-justice struggles can be 

invoked on behalf of places like Guilu--and should be.



<p>After all, free trade shouldn't amount to a free pass for Americans to 

unload their toxic troubles on the world's poor.
