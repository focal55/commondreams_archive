<p>As far as newsworthiness goes, the revelation that President George Bush will 

not be attending the earth summit in Johannesburg this month, ranks alongside 

the Queen turning down an invitation to a Sex Pistols tribute concert. 

<P>It was never going to happen. 

<P>Yet Tony Blair seems to have believed until the last moment that he could persuade 

the president to disrupt his month-long vacation in Texas to make an appearance 

in South Africa. 

<P>We are told he made a series of appeals to him, but here the prime minister 

appears to have been a victim of his own government's spin. 

<P>The British rationale for the blank-check support offered to US foreign and 

security policy relies heavily on the "change-from-within" argument - employed 

by many an erstwhile student radical on taking up a lucrative job in the City. 

<P>By backing Washington to the hilt in Afghanistan and elsewhere, the Blair government 

maintained it would be able to influence the Bush administration on other issues 

on the prime minister's social interventionist agenda. 

<P>How wrong it has been. 

<P>For all the glib talk about a "Marshall plan" for postwar Afghanistan, the 

US is already turning off the financial tap. 

<P>It has set its face determinedly against the use of American troops for an 

expansion of the International Security Assistance Force - a peacekeeping effort 

advocated by Britain and almost everyone else as a precondition for Afghan stability. 

<P>Contrary to the predictions of British diplomats, Blair has had no tangible 

effect on this administration's Middle East policy, which has sided ever more 

decisively with the Israeli government of Ariel Sharon. 

<P>Mr Blair's hopes of putting third world development high on the international 

agenda as a positive counterweight to the "war on terror" has also been rendered 

empty rhetoric by the US farm bill - that subsidized American agro-industries 

at the expense of African farmers - and the Bush administration's complete lack 

of interest in development themes at the G8 summit in Canada in June. 

<P>We are told that Colin Powell will go to Johannesburg in the president's place, 

and in many administrations the secretary of state would be viewed as a reasonable 

substitute. 

<P>However it is clear by now that Powell has next to no influence on core policy 

objectives, and tends to be sent along - often against his will - to deal with 

international problems that the White House has no interest in, or expectation 

of, resolving. 

<P>Such as the Middle East, or global warming. 

<P>The prime minister's evident faith that he could turn Bush green if only for 

the duration of a single South African photo opportunity seems all the more naive 

because the very idea conflicts with the president's two deepest political principles:

<P> 

<ul>

<li>Do what your biggest campaign contributors tell you to do.<br>

</li>

<li>Don't do what your daddy did when he was president .</li>

</ul>

<P>These two tenets, underpin a surprising proportion of the Bush agenda. 

<P>The first principle is self-evident when it comes to the environment. While 

he was Texas governor, Bush literally allowed the big energy companies like Exxon-Mobil 

to write their own emissions laws, and the result was an entirely voluntary regime. 

<P>If power stations and oil refineries pumped out more pollution than they themselves 

said they ought to, they would try to do better the next year. 

<P>It was governance like this that helped Bush amass the biggest war chest of 

corporate campaign contributions ever seen in the history of presidential politics 

by far. 

<P>It was hardly surprising then, that he brought the same simple environmental 

policy to the White House. 

<P>And quite predictably that Congress has still not been able to view the list 

of oil company executives who filed in to the White House in spring 2001 to help 

draw up the administration's energy plan. 

<P>Eric Schaeffer, the head of enforcement at the Environmental Protection Agency 

(EPA) until he resigned in protest in February, has just published a chilling 

account of how the Bush administration undermined any attempt to hold corporations 

accountable for their effluent. 

<P>In an article in Washington Monthly, he describes how the White House and energy 

department officials collaborated with corporate lobbyists to enlarge loopholes 

in the country's environmental laws. 

<P>The Bush-appointed EPA administrator, Christine Todd Whitman, even advised 

corporate polluters not to settle with the agency out of court, while she reviewed 

its litigation and gutted the enforcement department. 

<P>"In a matter of weeks, the Bush administration was able to undo the environmental 

progress we had worked years to secure," Schaeffer wrote. 

<P>The desire to repay campaign contributors in kind is also the principal factor 

behind Bush's tax cuts, which focus their benefits overwhelmingly on the richest 

1% of the population while pulling the federal government back into deficit for 

the next decade. 

<P>Tax policy is one of several fields in which both Bush principles intersect. 

<P>Bush the elder raised taxes despite his campaign appeal to voters to read his 

lips and well-to-do Republicans never forgave him. 

<P>It was one of the reasons why Bush I lost US election 1992 to Bill Clinton 

despite winning the Gulf War. 

<P>The loss of the father's grasp on a second term is a major trauma in Bush family 

lore and one that the son is anxious to avoid at all costs. 

<P>While Bush I was seen as out of touch with ordinary voters during the nation's 

last economic downturn, Bush II has spent hours of his holiday this month at an 

economic "forum" in Waco. 

<P>He posed with a cast of invited "ordinary Americans" while simultaneously schmoozing 

with some of his top campaign contributors. 

<P>While Bush I got tough with the hardline Israeli government of his day - alienating 

Jewish and fundamentalist Christian voters - Bush the younger has stood shoulder 

to shoulder with Sharon, the "man of peace". 

<P>Furthermore, Bush I famously let President Saddam Hussein live to fight another 

day back in 1991. 

<P>Bush II has vowed not to repeat the mistake. 

<P>Unfortunately for environmentalists hoping for something meaningful to emerge 

from Johannesburg, Bush I went to the earth summit in Rio ten years ago. 

<P>There he signed the Climate Change Convention, which was supposed to provide 

a framework for the reduction of greenhouse gases. 

<P>This fact alone was probably enough to ensure Bush I would never show up. 

<P>Just in case, there is also a Fortune 500 list of companies willing to pay 

for him not to go.
