<p> <I>Heeere's Johnny!</I>

<P> <BR>

There's more good news from the White House following the election results. In 

point of fact, Britain's Guardian reported the news in February but the American 

media missed it until last week. The news was that Adm. John Poindexter has been 

a U.S. government employee since early February 2002. 

<P>Adm. Poindexter is a man of impeccable credentials and a round cherubic face 

that, at another time and place, would have made him an ideal Santa Claus. Adm. 

Poindexter graduated top of his class at the Naval Academy in 1958, got a Ph.D. 

in physics at the California Institute of Technology and in later life became 

a vice-admiral in the United States Navy. Upon leaving the ocean he became, for 

Ronald Reagan, what Condoleeza Rice is for George Bush &#151; national security 

adviser. Like Ms. Rice, he found the position heady and, like Ms. Rice, took it 

upon himself to make foreign policy. 

<P>He and another military man, Oliver North, got together and began breaking 

the law. In what was known as the Iran-Contra affair, the two men arranged for 

Iranians to buy arms from the United States and the money from the sale ended 

up in the hands of the Nicaraguan Contras instead of the coffers of the United 

States. Normally when defense parts are sold to foreign countries a review is 

required to determine if the sales will impact the readiness of the military. 

Messrs. North and Poindexter bypassed that review and neglected to mention the 

sales to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the president. When Adm. 

Poindexter was asked why he took it upon himself to make foreign policy by conducting 

clandestine sales of arms and funneling the proceeds to the Contras, he replied: 

"I made a very deliberate decision not to tell the president so that I could insulate 

him from the decision and provide some future deniability for the president if 

it ever leaked out." It would be hard to find more patriotic sentiments anywhere. 

<P>The only soft spot in the admiral's vitae is his criminal conviction for lying 

to Congress, destroying official documents and obstructing congressional inquiries 

into the Iran-Contra affair and who among us hasn't had one or two things happen 

we wish we could go back and do over? And what's more, that conviction was subsequently 

overturned, not because the admiral wasn't guilty as charged but because in exchange 

for telling Congress about the various things he and others had done that were 

criminal, he was granted immunity from prosecution. 

<P>Fortunately for the country, the fact that Mr. Poindexter had a brief criminal 

career does not mean that George W. Bush is being deprived of his services. In 

February it was reported by the Guardian (and in November by much of the rest 

of the press) that Mr. Poindexter had once again been summoned to labor in the 

vineyards of his country. This time he was appointed to head a new agency whose 

aim is to "counter attacks on the U.S." His office is called the Information Awareness 

Office and its creation was in fact proposed by the admiral. The office is funded 

by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) at about $200 million 

a year. 

<P>Mr. Poindexter has explained that the IAO, as it is called, will provide intelligence 

analysts and law-enforcement officials with instant access to information from 

Internet mail and telephone calling records and credit card and banking transactions 

and travel documents. That information will be obtainable without the need for 

search warrants, a time- consuming and sometimes futile task. 

<P>In a speech in California Adm. Poindexter said: "We must become much more efficient 

and more clever in the ways we find new sources of data, mine information from 

the new and old, generate information, make it available for analysis, convert 

it to knowledge, and create actionable options." 

<P>When this program is fully operational, analysts will be able to see what is 

being written on email by all of us and what we are talking about on the phone. 

Analysts can check for what the Washington Post described as "improbable medical 

activity, such as the treatments of anthrax sores." Since most Americans write 

innocuous emails, have innocuous (and frequently inane) phone conversations and 

almost certainly are not treated for anthrax sores, the program will not affect 

most of us and will serve to protect those of us who are innocuous from the wiles 

of those who are not. 

<P>There are those who think Adm. Poindexter's transgressions (incurred, it should 

be noted, when acting in the best interests of his country) disqualify him from 

future government service. They fail to realize that his minor transgressions, 

demonstrating as they do that he is unencumbered by constitutional inhibitions, 

make him the ideal candidate for this position. 

<P>Others go further and question the very existence of this new agency. Marc 

Rottenberg, director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center in Washington 

commenting on the new agency said: "This could be the perfect storm for civil 

liberties in America. The vehicle is the Homeland Security Act, the technology 

is DARPA and the agency is the FBI. The outcome is a system of national surveillance 

of the American public." Gary Hart said that he thought the program was "an Orwellian 

concept." 

<P>I might have used Mr. Hart's word did I not have complete confidence that Attorney 

General John Ashcroft (who after the recent court decision easing requirements 

for wiretaps said the Justice Department would use its new powers "with a serious 

respect for the Constitution") will be looking over the admiral's shoulder to 

make sure there is no overreaching. Given that, there is no reason for the rest 

of us to be nervous. </p>
