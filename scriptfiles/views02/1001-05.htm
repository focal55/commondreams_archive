<p> In one of its most shocking reports on the Israeli-Palestinian war, Amnesty 

International today condemns both sides in the conflict for their "utter disregard" 

for the lives of children &#150; 250 of them Palestinian and 72 Israeli &#150; 

who have been killed over the past year.</p>

<p>In a 29-page report containing some of the most painful evidence amassed on 

child-killing in the occupied territories and Israel, the organization blames 

Israel for "excessive and disproportionate use of lethal force" and "reckless 

shooting" in residential areas, and Palestinians for "direct and indiscriminate 

attacks", including suicide bombings.</p>

<p>The solemn list of dead children that Amnesty has collected shows just how 

ingrained child-killing has become. There is Sami Jazzar, shot in the head by 

an Israeli soldier on the eve of his 12th birthday in Gaza, 11-year-old Khalil 

Mughrabi, killed by an Israeli sniper in Gaza &#150; one of his friends survived 

after being shot in the testicles by a high-velocity round &#150; and 10-year-old 

Riham al-Ward, killed in her Jenin schoolyard by an Israeli tank shell.</p>

<p>Then there are Raaya and Hemda, aged 14 and two, killed with their parents 

by a Palestinian suicide bomber in a Jerusalem pizzeria, Shalhevet Pass &#150; 

just 10 months old &#150; shot by a Palestinian sniper in Hebron, and Avia Malka, 

killed by Palestinians who fired on and threw grenades at cars in Netanya. She 

was nine months old.</p>

<p>Amnesty's condemnation has rarely been so scathing. "The pattern of killings 

of children which has become so entrenched and widespread in the past two years 

developed against a background of impunity for the perpetrators of such crimes," 

it says.</p>

<p>Despite repeated claims to the contrary: "No judicial investigation is known 

to have been carried out into any of the killings of children by members of the 

IDF [Israel Defense Forces] in the occupied territories, even in cases where Israeli 

government officials have stated publicly that investigations would be carried 

out." None of the Israeli soldiers responsible for these crimes is known to have 

been brought to justice, Amnesty says.</p>

<p>It also attacks Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority for imprisoning militants 

for political purposes rather than submitting them to fair trials for the killing 

of children. It says the assertion by Palestinian armed groups that international 

law imposes no constraints on them is untrue. "No violations by the Israeli army, 

no matter their scale or gravity, can ever justify the targeting and killing of 

Israeli children or any other civilians by Palestinian groups."</p>

<p>In the first seven months of this year, more than 100 Palestinian children 

have been killed by Israeli gunfire, 48 per cent of them 12 years old or younger. 

Amnesty pulls no punches about who is to blame. The majority of these children, 

it says, "were killed when the IDF randomly opened fire, or shelled or bombarded 

residential neighborhoods in Palestinian towns and villages. Most of these children 

were killed when there was no exchange of fire and in circumstances in which the 

lives of the soldiers were not at risk."</p>

<p>The most terrible incident &#150; praised by the Israeli Prime Minister, Ariel 

Sharon, at the time as a "great success" &#150; was the <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views02/0725-01.htm">attack 

by Israel on Salah Shehada</a>, a Hamas activist, which also slaughtered nine 

children along with eight adults. Their names give a terrible reality to this 

bloodbath: 18-month old Ayman Matar, three-year-old Mohamed Matar, five-year-old 

Diana Matar, four-year-old Sobhi Hweiti, six-year-old Mohamed Hweiti, 10-year-old 

Ala Matar, 15-year-old Iman Shehada, 17-year-old Maryam Matar. And Dina Matar. 

She was only two months old. An Israeli air force pilot dropped a one-ton bomb 

on their homes from an American-made F-16 aircraft on 22 July.</p>

<p>Amnesty also highlights the carnage at the Dolphinarium nightclub in Tel Aviv 

on 1 June last year when a Palestinian suicide bomber killed 21 people, of whom 

12 were under 18. They included 15-year-old Raisa Namirovsky, 14-year-old Maria 

Tagilchev, 15-year-old Yevgenia Dorfman, 15-year-old Kastanada Talker, 16-year-old 

Yulia Nelimov, Anya Kazachkov and Mariana Medvedenko, both aged 16, and Marina 

Berkovski. Marina had gone to the club to celebrate her 17th birthday.</p>

<p>Amnesty says if international monitors had been deployed on the ground &#150; 

and Israel has repeatedly refused to allow this &#150; many of the children's 

lives might have been spared. What the international organization does not say, 

but which its report makes abundantly clear, is that children have become "fair 

game" for both sides in the Israeli-Palestinian war. Innocence, as usual, has 

been trampled by two brutal antagonists.</p> </p>
