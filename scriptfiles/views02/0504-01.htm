<p> <i>"In effect, the human being should be considered the priority in a political 

war. And conceived as the military target ... the human being has his most 

critical point in his mind. Once the mind has been reached, the 'political 

animal' has been defeated without necessarily receiving bullets."</i>

                          -taken from US Central Intelligence Agency 

training manual



<p>Much has been made of Le Pen's scandalous victory in France, and greater 

Europe's wartime march towards the right. This while the US Administration 

uses its convenient terror war to justify massive internal societal 

engineering to the right.



<p>What's behind both? Fear. No small wonder that Le Pen's proclaimed ideals 

were "famile, travail, patrie" (family, labor, homeland), a motto borrowed 

from war-torn 1940's France when the society turned inwards to traditional, 

authoritative, xenophobic values. No surprise either that the zero-tolerance 

crime policies of Le Pen (like those of Bush) ignore root causes, focusing 

instead on quick and dirty alternatives like the death penalty, more 

imprisonment and targeting outsiders.



<p>Fear leaves little room for logic or moral platitudes - it demands 

simplistic responses to otherwise complex problems.



<p>Granted, it's hard not to be fearful when those in power, such as US 

Secretary of State Colin Powell, say that the war on terror won't end "in 

our lifetime" and new countries are added to the "evil" list every day. It 

can be even harder though to rally behind battles that seem more like 

grotesque bullying than anything resembling justice or assisting the 

oppressed.



<p>Which explains why the masses must be mobilized "in a wide scale of 

activities and at the highest emotional level" to support the government and 

its wars - according to "Psychological Operations In Guerrilla Warfare," the 

above-mentioned (declassified) CIA manual. Presumably intended to have been 

used against foreign populations, the psyop brainwashing techniques 

capitalizing on fear seem disturbingly familiar today.



<p>According to the manual, "In places and situations wherever possible ... 

explain the operation of weapons to the youths and young men ... they are 

the potential recruits for our forces." Pretty easy task now that military 

contractors own major news networks, and propaganda pieces on the latest 

sexy fighting technology are derigueur. Accordingly, the US budget for 

military recruitment has skyrocketed in recent years, paying for 24/7 "cyber 

recruiters" on newly pumped-up army websites. And not to be overlooked, the 

schoolyard's tiny Rambos in training can get "Operation Enduring Freedom" 

bubble gum cards, or the cool new action figure "Tora Bora Ted, Swift 

Freedom Delta Force Night OPS."



<p>The overwhelming message is clear. Facing a conflict? Scared? Just grab a 

gun and aim!



<p>Yet we still act surprised when some messed-up kid, who has taken the 

weapons message a bit too seriously, goes commando and blows away classmates 

in the lunchroom.



<p>The manual also suggests: "Be prepared with simple slogans in order to 

explain to the people, whether in an intentional form or by chance, the 

reason for the weapons" - reasons such as "The weapons will be for winning 

freedom: they are for you" and "Our weapons are in truth, the weapons of the 

people, yours." Or in weapons-producer Lockheed Martin's current lingo, the 

F-22 fighter is an "anti-war" plane, and "the perception of peace means less 

jobs for Americans." Even more to the point, another weapons manufacturer 

refers to its military technology with: "Someone's father, someone's 

daughter, someone's son -- Who will bring them home? McDonnell Douglas 

will."



<p>Simple slogans hide fear and confusion by turning guilt-ridden acts of war 

into sanitized niceties. Bombing the life out of Afghanistan becomes 

"Enduring Freedom," butchery in Somalia is "Restore Hope," and the 

neverending terror war is "Noble Eagle." Lofty names to hide the carnage and 

mask our inherent complicity.



<p>But fancy names alone can't hide staggering war-machine profits. Right after 

September 11th, when most companies took a dive, Lockheed Martin's share 

value rose by a full 30%. (Purely coincidence that a top executive of 

Lockheed Martin, Bruce Jackson, wrote most of the current US 

Administration's foreign policy platform.) Purely coincidence too, that just 

weeks after 9-11, Bush's home state of Texas was granted the largest 

military order in history - a $200 billion contract for a new fighter.



<p>We feign surprise as blood flows in the Middle East, conveniently forgetting 

that the US war machine provides Israel with billions in military aid 

annually, thus compelling its Arab neighbors to buy increasingly 

sophisticated US military weaponry to compensate. (Saudi Arabia alone has 

forked over $33.5 billion to the US war machine in the last ten years.) 

Nations in conflict that we've armed to the teeth. The body count rises each 

day, as we shake our heads and wonder why those people just can't get along.



<p>Meanwhile, US Vice President Dick Cheney warns that the US is considering 

military action against "40-50" countries and Bush adviser Richard Perle 

explains "This is total war. We are fighting a variety of enemies. There are 

lots of them out there ... If we let our vision of the world go forth, and 

we embrace it entirely, and we don't try to piece together clever diplomacy 

but just wage a total war, our children will sing great songs about us years 

from now."



<p>But which version of the world should go forth is the burning question. Is 

neverending "total war" really the goal? Is the authoritative, xenophobic 

leadership demanded by war desirable? Each day we are trained to be fearful 

and to see weaponry as the solution. That makes the war on terror seem like 

a war on the hearts and minds of common citizens. And for those unlucky 

souls in Cheney's 40-50 countries, or the thousands who have already been 

slaughtered as collateral damage, the war on terror is looking more like 

terrorism everyday.
