<p>THE SUMMER has been filled with images of disgraced executives being hustled 

off to court by federal agents and stories about the improper reporting of billions 

of dollars on company financial statements.

<P>From Adelphia to WorldCom, the corporate follies of 2001 have altered the portrayal 

of corporate leaders in the traditionally uncritical business press. Questions 

of greed, integrity, and fundamental honesty have diminshed the fawning adulation 

of executives as society's saviors.</P>

<P>The enormous compensation packages of Ken Lay, Bernard Ebbers, and others have 

led to studies demonstrating that these men's standards of living are not out 

of the ordinary. In 2000, American CEOs earned 531 times more than the average 

worker compared with 42 times more in 1980. In fact, since the mid-1970s, the 

richest 1 percent of the population has captured 70 percent of all earnings growth.</P>

<P>The corporate accounting scandal has provided entertainment, prompted prosecutions, 

initiated reform legislation, and punctured the myth of the infallibility of business 

leaders, but a more fundamental insight is being ignored.</P>

<P>America's dirty little secret is not simply the excesses of the super-rich, 

but the underlying shift in economic inequality across our entire society over 

the last 30 years. Since 1973, average hourly earnings have actually dropped by 

0.4 percent despite boosts in productivity and periods of economic boom. The majority 

of the work force has seen incomes stagnate or decline, and the only reason families 

are slightly better off is that it now takes two wage-earners to stay ahead of 

the previous generation's single head of household's earnings.</P>

<P>Yet even those marginal benefits have not been shared evenly. From 1977 to 

1999, the share of all family income declined absolutely for the bottom 80 percent 

of the population. The top 20 percent's share increased by 14 percent, resulting 

in that group's income accounting for half of all earnings. The loss of decent 

jobs overseas, the shift from a manufacturing to a lower-waged service economy, 

and the political attacks on labor unions that were in part responsible for the 

post-World War II trend toward economic equality are all causes of an increasingly 

divided society.</P>

<P>While the final years of the 1990s slowed the overall dynamic, the reconfigured 

American social structure still looks like a heavily bottom-weighted hourglass 

with a hollowed-out middle.</P>

<P>Economists and journalists have been noticing these developments for a decade, 

but the debate has rarely reached national mainstream political circles. Democrats 

who discuss economic inequality risk losing contributions from corporate donors 

and being branded as proponents of class warfare. In the last presidential race, 

Al Gore promised to focus on those forgotten by the economic boom in his stump 

speeches, but those paragraphs were forgotten in the campaign's final weeks.</P>

<P>Ironically, it was Republican candidate Pat Buchanan's odd ''peasants with 

pitchforks'' campaign in 1996 that elevated the issue for a few months and forced 

Bill Clinton and Bob Dole to acknowledge the problem. Apparently Buchanan's charter 

membership in the Republican right inoculated him against charges of fomenting 

class war.</P>

<P>Too many candidates and consultants from both parties dismissively assume that 

these trends only impact the poor, politically marginal, and less likely to vote. 

But growing inequality is a serious problem for the vast majority of the population 

of the United States, working families, and middle-class voters - all but the 

top one-fifth of the nation's citizens. The stark reality is that in 1999, real 

after-tax income flowing to the middle 60 percent of households was less than 

it was in 1977.</P>

<P>As summer turns to fall, some executives may land in jail, government oversight 

will be tightened, and publicly traded company balance sheets will be more skeptically 

examined. The notion that the average citizen can get rich quick by investing 

in companies that make no products is mercifully going by the wayside.</P>

<P>American men and women will continue to work longer hours at more jobs just 

to tread water financially, like hamsters running circles in a cage. The real 

question is, when the attention inevitably shifts to the next big scandal, will 

anyone have taken stock of what has happened to four-fifths of the population 

over the last 30 years?</P>
