<p>Since the appointment of George W. Bush to the Presidency of the United States, a string of references has been made in the progressive media to a parable that describes the national lunacy we are enduring these days. I'm referring, of course, to the perennial classic, "The Emperor's New Clothes."  The reason this fable has attained such currency lately is that it describes our situation so frighteningly well: a simple-minded, self-absorbed ruler; a devious court perception-monger peddling a bald-faced deceit; cowering governmental officials; a willingly gullible public; plus, one loudmouthed, clear-eyed child.  

 

<p>The story resonates because it is impossible for so many of us to ignore the fact that the person who currently occupies 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue is a certifiable dunce, sporting the see-through mantle of "Ruler of the World" while being unflinchingly compared by various sycophants to Churchill, FDR, and even Abe Lincoln.  The adolescent swagger of his gait, the laughingly simplistic world view he espouses, the utter transparency of his greed-for-power-driven agenda, his inability to master his native tongue, and his bombastic speech patterns belie those comparisons and point to a personality that is operating entirely out of its depth.  Still, oblivious and un-self-conscious, it continues to operate, heedless and apparently clueless.  We identify completely with the kid in the parable who shouts: "Look, Mom!  That guy is buck naked!"  

 

<p>What has been most disconcerting up to now in this, our surreal yet non-fictional version of the fable, is that despite all our collective shouting, most of the (American, at least) public persists in buying into the scam.  Despite the regularity of all those "Axis of Evil" self-parodies that Bush obligingly serves up (like the Empower proudly displaying his nether regions to a purblind, admiring crowd) and despite our dutiful pointing out of same, his approval ratings have continued to float in the ether, indicating a public either unwilling or unable to grok his exposed condition (like the town-folk commenting to one another: "Is that mink or sable on his collar?").  The question of the year has become, "What the hell will it take for them to wake up?"

 

<p>Well, don't look now, friends, but I think it's finally happening.  We need to remember that the underlying theme of the Naked Emperor story is not that a little kid finally noticed an obvious fact and called everyone's attention to it.  The real gist of the piece is that when a naked truth becomes so glaring that a simple child can see it plainly, then even the hypnotized may be startled into consciousness.  It seems to me that the sheer startling power of the accumulation of naked truths all around us is doing just that.  The people are starting to blink.

 

<p>Consider this: the Presidency of the United States, since the end of WWII, 

has carried with it the designation of "Leader of the Free World." As of September 

2nd, that appellation no longer applies. That historic "mantle", with the assent 

of Canada and Russia to the Kyoto Accord, has evaporated. The World is headed 

the opposite direction of a Bush-led America. Also yesterday, Nelson Mandela (a 

living successor to Gandhi and King) stood on a planetary pulpit and preached 

foursquare against the War on Iraq. Standing behind him were virtually the rest 

of the world's leaders (excepting "Bulldozer" Sharon and "Toady" Blair) along 

with a growing majority of Americans and Britons (just last week both of Maine's 

Senate candidates expressed opposition). Add to these two huge issues, the long 

list of other treaties, commitments and international conferences that the Bush 

administration has walked away from, and America's position in the world is as 

solitary as never before in its history. It is like all the kids in a school yard 

finally separated themselves from a bully, isolating him. 

<p>Consider also this:  Global warming is now fully in our face.  It is a reality as menacing as the next flash flood, firestorm, tropical disease or dry well in our own backyards.  Bush has admitted its undeniable existence, but has told us we should "learn to live with it."  These are not just his exposed private parts we are confronting (which would be bad enough) but our own exposure to raw, elemental fury.  His counsel is to install more oil rigs in the tundra and roll more feller-bunchers into the backcountry.  While we search for solutions to save our very future, he offers us the status quo ante, the precise causes of our predicament.    The people are starting to blink. 

 

<p>And consider this:  We are about to bankrupt our children in perpetuity in order to fill the heavens with atomic weapons.   Can you hear our children starting to shout?  Can you see the people starting to blink?

 

<p>Perhaps we have reached, at long last, the limits of denial.
