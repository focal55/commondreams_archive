<p> Why? Yesterday's crime against humanity in Bali provoked an almost identical 

reaction to the atrocities of 11 September 2001. Everyone wanted to know who had 

planted the bombs &#150; almost certainly a satellite of al-Qa'ida &#150; and 

everyone wanted to know how the killers planned their massacre.</p>

<p>But no one &#150; neither the Australian Prime Minister, John Howard, nor Tony 

Blair nor Jack Straw &#150; wanted to talk about motives. "Terrorism" was the 

all-important word (an accurate one too), which was used to smother any discussion 

about what lay behind the crime.</p>

<p>Australians were the principal victims and their murderers must have known 

they would be. So why were they targeted? John Howard has been among President 

Bush's toughest supporters. Australia lined up to join the "war on terror" within 

24 hours of the attacks on New York and Washington last year. Australian special 

forces have been operating with American troops in the Afghan mountains against 

al-Qa'ida. It's a fair bet that yesterday's savagery was al-Qa'ida hitting back.</p>

<p>The French have already paid a price for their initial support for Mr Bush. 

The killing of 11 French submarine technicians in Karachi has been followed by 

the suicide attack on the French oil tanker <i>Limburg</i> off the coast of Yemen. 

Now, it seems, it is the turn of Australia.</p>

<p>If the group which set off the three bombs in Bali is one of the "Islamist" 

movements on the edge of al-Qa'ida, the choice of target was familiar: a nightclub, 

a place associated in the mind of Islamists with sex, alcohol and immorality &#150; 

the same type of target Palestinian suicide bombers have struck in Israel.</p>

<p>If millions of Muslims are revolted at the Bali massacre, few will approve 

of nightclubs. The usual moral slippage can be employed; the bombing was terrible, 

but ... Or so the murderers will hope.</p>

<p>The victims were largely young civilians, just as innocent as the thousands 

who died in the World Trade Center. Civilians get no quarter in this war, whether 

they are investment brokers in New York, Afghan families or Australian honeymooners.</p>

<p>So who is next? When is Britain's turn? Where are Britons most at risk? Alas, 

they are scattered across the globe in embassies, on holidays, on every airline 

of the world. Our support for the United States &#150; an infinitely closer alliance 

than any support from France &#150; makes Britain the most likely candidate for 

attack after the US. Then there are the small, more vulnerable nations that give 

quiet assistance to the American military; Belgium, which hosts Nato HQ; Canada, 

whose special forces have also been operating in Afghanistan; Ireland, which allows 

US military aircraft to refuel at Shannon.</p>

<p>Bali only emphasizes what the last year should have taught us: that individual 

innocence no longer protects us, that we are living &#150; whether we know it 

or not &#150; in a terrifying new age.</p>
