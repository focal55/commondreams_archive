It was at a molecular biology colloquium several months ago when "The Basic Problem" crystallized in the mind of physicist Vladi Chaloupka.

<p>

Dr. Leroy Hood gave a talk about why he left university life to establish the private Institute for Systems Biology, "where research will proceed with maximum speed and efficiency," unencumbered by limitations and regulations, Chaloupka recalled in a piece he wrote for Ethix magazine.

<p>

"It was exactly this event, combined with the brilliance of Hood's presentation, and with the <IMG align=left hspace=14 vspace=14 SRC=images/seanlogo.jpg WIDTH=94 HEIGHT=124 BORDER=0>breath-taking progress in the field of molecular biology, that made me see the basic problem suddenly and clearly," he wrote.

<p>

The basic problem, according to Chaloupka, is "the spectacular, and I am afraid fatal, gap between the cumulative, exponential progress in science and technology on the one hand, and the lack of comparable progress in ethics, civility and...the ability to use our technological tools thoughtfully and responsibly."

<p>

Chaloupka argues that to the extent that people are worried about this at all, they tend to worry about terrorism. But the situation is much more general than that, he insists. "Picture a group of children in a gasoline depot, with matches - and instructions to please use them carefully!"

<p>

Two prominent biologists - George Wald and Erwin Chargaff - sound similar alarms. Genetic engineering "faces our society with problems unprecedented not only in the history of science, but of life on Earth. It places in human hands the capacity to redesign living organisms... . It is all too big and is happening too fast," Wald warns.

<p>

Chargaff adds: "Our time is cursed with the necessity for feeble men, masquerading as experts, to make enormously far-reaching decisions. My generation, or perhaps the one preceding mine, has been the first to engage, under the leadership of exact sciences, in a destructive colonial warfare against nature. The future will curse us for it."

<p>

These gloomy forecasts are what drive the "noisy quacks," in the obfuscating words of Thomas Sowell, a conservative columnist who last week denounced environmentalism as being based on junk science and therefore a justification for why intelligent people ought to ignore " 'experts' without any expertise."

<p>

But when you have people like Bill Joy, the chief scientist at the Sun Corp. echoing Erick Drexler's warning about the possibility of artificial bacteria out-competing real bacteria, we ought to listen. And think.

<p>

"I am struck with the nonchalance with which the dramatic progress in biology is received," Chaloupka continues. "Both the ease, and the potential consequences of misuse (intentional or accidental) of nuclear materials pales in comparison with the micro-biological case.

<p>

"Today just about any physics graduate student has the basic knowledge of how to build a nuclear weapon - but to actually do it requires large infrastructure" - a truism ignored by the attack-Iraq-next cabal.

<p>

Assuming Saddam wants to re-build his weapons of mass destruction program, how can he, given that U.S. bombs destroyed Iraq's civilian infrastructure, returning Iraq to "a pre-industrial age," in the words of a 1991 U.N. report to the Secretary General?

<p>

"The reality is that most of Iraq's biological agents, along with its production facilities, have been destroyed. America claims that Iraq lied to inspectors and still has deadly stockpiles. But the Bush administration has shown little interest in sending the inspectors back," chief weapons inspector Scott Ritter wrote three weeks ago.

<p>

Like Ritter, Chaloupka is not persuaded by the Bush administration rhetoric about "rogue nations" and the need for a costly ballistic missile defense shield. "If not today, then in 50 years, every graduate student in biology will know how to manipulate genes...and the required infrastructure will probably fit in a basement."

<p>

Though less horrific, Chaloupka considers the post-Sept. 11 anthrax attack to be more menacing than the suicide plane-bombings.

<p>

"We can, and we will, defeat Osama bin Laden, Taliban, or any present or future rogue state... . But the anthrax attack was, quite possibly, committed by a single person... . And anthrax is nothing, compared to what is possible, and compared to what will be possible in just a few years."

<p>

Driven by the desire to prolong life, eliminate hunger and disease, we are running "full speed into the future, spending just a tiny fraction of the research money on risk assessment! The Genome project sets aside 3 percent of its budget for ethical, legal and social issues, and most of it funds investigations into questions like: who should own a patent for what, or whether it is 'ethical' to use embryonic stem cells."

<p>

One of the most influential economists of the 20th century, John Maynard Keynes, once quipped: "In the long run, we're all dead." Of course, as one French economist put it, Keynes is dead and we are the ones who are caught up in the long run.
