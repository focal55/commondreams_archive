<p>President Bush has reportedly authorized the CIA to use all of the means at 

its disposal--including U.S. military special operations forces and CIA paramilitary 

teams--to eliminate Iraq's Saddam Hussein. According to reports, the CIA is to 

view any such plan as "preparatory" for a larger military strike.

<p>Congressional leaders from both parties have greeted these reports with enthusiasm. 

In their rush to be seen as embracing the president's hard-line stance on Iraq, 

however, almost no one in Congress has questioned why a supposedly covert operation 

would be made public, thus undermining the very mission it was intended to accomplish.

<p>It is high time that Congress start questioning the hype and rhetoric emanating 

from the White House regarding Baghdad, because the leaked CIA plan is well timed 

to undermine the efforts underway in the United Nations to get weapons inspectors 

back to work in Iraq. In early July, the U.N. secretary-general will meet with 

Iraq's foreign minister for a third round of talks on the return of the weapons 

monitors. A major sticking point is Iraqi concern over the use--or abuse--of such 

inspections by the U.S. for intelligence collection.

<p>I recall during my time as a chief inspector in Iraq the dozens of extremely 

fit "missile experts" and "logistics specialists" who frequented my inspection 

teams and others. Drawn from U.S. units such as Delta Force or from CIA paramilitary 

teams such as the Special Activities Staff (both of which have an ongoing role 

in the conflict in Afghanistan), these specialists had a legitimate part to play 

in the difficult cat-and-mouse effort to disarm Iraq. So did the teams of British 

radio intercept operators I ran in Iraq from 1996 to 1998--which listened in on 

the conversations of Hussein's inner circle--and the various other intelligence 

specialists who were part of the inspection effort.

<p>The presence of such personnel on inspection teams was, and is, viewed by the 

Iraqi government as an unacceptable risk to its nation's security.

<p>As early as 1992, the Iraqis viewed the teams I led inside Iraq as a threat 

to the safety of their president. They were concerned that my inspections were 

nothing more than a front for a larger effort to eliminate their leader.

<p>Those concerns were largely baseless while I was in Iraq. Now that Bush has 

specifically authorized American covert-operations forces to remove Hussein, however, 

the Iraqis will never trust an inspection regime that has already shown itself 

susceptible to infiltration and manipulation by intelligence services hostile 

to Iraq, regardless of any assurances the U.N. secretary-general might give.

<p>The leaked CIA covert operations plan effectively kills any chance of inspectors 

returning to Iraq, and it closes the door on the last opportunity for shedding 

light on the true state of affairs regarding any threat in the form of Iraqi weapons 

of mass destruction.

<p>Absent any return of weapons inspectors, no one seems willing to challenge 

the Bush administration's assertions of an Iraqi threat. If Bush has a factual 

case against Iraq concerning weapons of mass destruction, he hasn't made it yet.

<p>Can the Bush administration substantiate any of its claims that Iraq continues 

to pursue efforts to reacquire its capability to produce chemical and biological 

weapons, which was dismantled and destroyed by U.N. weapons inspectors from 1991 

to 1998? The same question applies to nuclear weapons. What facts show that Iraq 

continues to pursue nuclear weapons aspirations?

<p>Bush spoke ominously of an Iraqi ballistic missile threat to Europe. What missile 

threat is the president talking about? These questions are valid, and if the case 

for war is to be made, they must be answered with more than speculative rhetoric.

<p>Congress has seemed unwilling to challenge the Bush administration's pursuit 

of war against Iraq. The one roadblock to an all-out U.S. assault would be weapons 

inspectors reporting on the facts inside Iraq. Yet without any meaningful discussion 

and debate by Congress concerning the nature of the threat posed by Baghdad, war 

seems all but inevitable.

<p>The true target of the supposed CIA plan may not be Hussein but rather the 

weapons inspection program itself. The real casualty is the last chance to avoid 

bloody conflict.
