<p>It wasn't enough for George Bush to boycott the Earth Summit. He sent negotiators 

flanked by big business to Johannesburg to destroy it. And Bush had other help 

as well. He had lots of support from ordinary folks back home. Average Americans 

are destroying the planet with their fossil fuel lifestyle. And they don't seem 

to care how it affects the world around them. 

<p>The tiny island of Tuvalu in the South Pacific has given up hope. It's evacuating 

its population of 14,000 to New Zealand. The 16-square-mile island is sinking 

into the ocean due to rising sea levels caused by global warming. The world is 

under assault by catastrophic floods, fires, and droughts. And most people are 

blaming the United States. 

<p>Oh sure, other countries also contribute to climate change. But given that 

the U.S. is responsible for 25% to the world's carbon dioxide emissions while 

representing only 4.6% of the population...we are clearly leading the way. And 

although it's common practice to place all the blame at the feet of America's 

corrupt corporations and spineless politicians, that becomes increasingly difficult 

when SUVs now account for 23% of all new car sales nationwide and 47% in California 

alone. 

<p>So what's the world to do? How can foreign peoples and their governments make 

an impression on apathetic Americans? More talks? More summits? Not now. The Earth 

Summit just showed how easily it can be sabotaged. Short of violence, which is 

commonly used for good and ill by American presidents both past and present, foreign 

governments and individuals could expand on a three-part strategy already in limited 

use - sue, boycott, and get 'personal' with Americans. 

<p>Let's start in reverse order. First...get personal...man-to-man. Let Americans 

you meet hear your outrage. Violate our comfort zone. You're not asking for less 

consumerism from Americans, just clean and green rather than coal and oil...or 

at least cars that get over 20 miles per gallon for Pete's sake. Many countries 

are forging ahead with substantial wind, solar, and fuel cell projects, while 

George Bush promotes coal, oil, and nuclear energy. And Americans let him get 

away with that. 

<p>Next...boycott American goods and services. Don't prop up our economy with 

your investments and consumer spending. Already there's a fairly successful boycott 

in many parts of the world against (mostly U.S.) genetically modified crops. And 

boycotts certainly worked to liberate South Africa from apartheid. Capitalism 

responds when business takes a hit. 

<p>And...for the final and third strategy...foreign nations and individuals can 

sue America. There's growing interest in international environmental litigation. 

And the island of Tuvalu may lead the way. It’s considering lawsuits against the 

United States and Australia for refusing to ratify the 1997 Kyoto protocol on 

cutting greenhouse gas emissions to prevent global warming. 

<p>Europeans are also up in arms after a summer of catastrophic floods, and they're 

blaming America, reports Paul Martin of the Washington Times. He writes, "Gallus 

Cadonau, the managing director of the Swiss Greina Foundation for the preservation 

of Alpine rivers and streams, has urged that a punitive tariff on imports from 

the United States be imposed to force cooperation on greenhouse gas emissions." 

That's not a lawsuit or a boycott, but it's coming close to both. 

<p>For the first time, Americans are suing our own institutions for causing global 

warming. Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace, and the city of Boulder, Colorado, 

filed the suit against the Export Import Bank (ExIm) and the Overseas Private 

Investment Corporation (OPIC), alleging that these taxpayer funded lending institutions 

illegally provided more than $32 billion in financing and insurance for oil fields, 

pipelines and coal-fired power plants without assessing their contribution to 

global warming and their impact on the U.S. environment as required under key 

provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). It's about time. 

<p>International environmental law was the focus of a meeting of more than a hundred 

judges and lawyers at the Earth Summit in Johannesburg. The "Johannesburg Principles 

on the Role of Law and Sustainable Development" were adopted at the Global Judges 

Symposium organized by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP). It states, 

"…the fragile state of the global environment requires the Judiciary, as the guardian 

of the Rule of Law, to boldly and fearlessly implement and enforce applicable 

international and national laws ..." Nice words and it's a start, but without 

U.S. support The Johannesburg Principles will certainly have rough going. 

<p>Americans live in geographic and cultural isolation. Getting their attention 

is a tough assignment. Getting them tuned-in to saving the planet may be even 

tougher. But the time for politeness is over. People and nations around the world 

are in a battle of survival largely because of American reliance on fossil fuels. 

And if foreign countries and their people have to get in our face, or boycott 

our businesses, or sue us in order to save themselves, then so be it. 

<p>If these strategies don't work, the case for violence will be made. For the 

peoples of the world, protecting the environment is a question of life and death, 

not comfort or convenience.
