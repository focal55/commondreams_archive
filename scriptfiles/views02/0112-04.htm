THE CRY that the national press is dominated by the left sounds again in ''Bias,'' the book by former CBS newsman Bernard Goldberg.

<P>





<P>That charge isn't so much wrong as simplistic. There are biases in the press, but they are as often based on class and style as on ideology. At times they affect the right and at other times the left.</P>

<P>The major bias is unabashedly centrist. It doesn't stray far from the 50-yard line, which moves as American politics shifts. Reporters for networks or major newspapers reflect the attitudes of people who make good salaries, live in affluent neighborhoods, and are well educated. They tilt slightly left on social issues, slightly right on economic ones.</P>

<P>Goldberg complains that a CBS staffer called conservative activist Gary Bauer ''the little nut from the Christian group.''</P>

<P>Style is the issue here. Nobody would mistake Bauer for a Yale graduate. The same comment would probably not be made about Ralph Reed, the ultra-slick former head of the Christian Coalition, who is handsome, well-dressed, and Beltway savvy.</P>

<P>But  Andrea Dworkin, the radical feminist known for her eccentric dress, fares little better with upscale reporters than Bauer. She would  probably be called that ''ultra-feminist nut.''</P>

<P>And do the elite media love Al Sharpton? Or Louis Farrakhan?</P>

<P>Both the right and the left can claim media bias. Ask labor unions how well they are covered. Look at coverage of George Bush and  Al Gore. In the 2000 campaign, the Project for Excellence in Journalism found that coverage of Gore  was ''decidedly more negative.''</P>

<P>But conservatives have effectively sold ''liberal bias'' while the left has been pathetic in presenting its case.  As media  critic Geneva Overholser notes, ''The press is persistently unfair to fundamentalist Christians. This tends, however, to be an equal opportunity weakness. The same  problem occurs with black radicals. Or vegan peacenik feminists.''</P>

<P>The bias cry ignores the fact that on social issues Americans are moving leftward. Formerly liberal issues are becoming centrist. Elite reporters may be sympathetic to choice, tolerant of gays, and in favor of more sports for girls (many of whom are their daughters). That makes them closer to middle America than hard-righters. Conservatives see a raging culture war, but pollsters find much consensus.</P>

<P>Sociologist Alan Wolfe finds Americans everywhere are redefining traditional morality in ways that suit their own individual situations and choices.</P>

<P>Tolerance for gays was once the property of liberals, but the Kaiser Foundation finds in a November 2001 study that 75 percent of gays and bisexuals find themselves more accepted than they were a few years ago. Catholic women have abortions at about the same rate as other women. America is becoming more tolerant on socio-cultural issues.</P>

<P>But support for the disadvantaged has declined considerably  since the '60s, when the GOP's center of gravity was much further left.</P>

<P>Richard Nixon could be called our last liberal president. He favored national health care and affirmative action, signed Title IX, which gave money to women's sports, opened up China, and  supported welfare for poor women. In those days, ending welfare would have elicited a roar from the left - which today can barely utter a squeak.</P>

<P>Goldberg says the media favor feminists. But Washington Post reporter Howard Kurtz  notes, ''Most of the officials, lawmakers,  experts and political figures who  parade their opinions on Sunday-morning television have something in common. They don't wear pantyhose.''</P>

<P>Women represent 10.7 percent of guests on the five major network shows.  Meanwhile, ultra-conservative women do very well in the media. The Independent Women's Forum opposes Title IX, affirmative action, the Violence Against Women Act, and funding for day care, positions few American women support. But the Post notes that members of the Independent Women's Forum get quoted and invited on talk shows with ''astonishing regularity'' despite the fact that the group has only some 600 members.</P>

<P>A report by the Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting found that in 1995 The New York Times published six opinion pieces by IWF leaders. The Wall Street Journal published five, The Washington Post three. During that year, those papers chose to publish no commentary on any subject by anyone from NOW (275,000 members) or the Feminist Majority Foundation (more than 60,000).</P>

<P>Despite these facts, the shrill cry of ''liberal bias'' will continue.  This issue isn't about facts, after all - it's about politics and spin. Those commodities will never be in short supply.</P>
