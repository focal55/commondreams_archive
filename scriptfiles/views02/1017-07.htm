<p>President Bush just signed the Iraqi resolution plan for a preemptive and unilateral 

attack on that country, but that probably won’t improve the souring U.S. job market. 

Progressives, take note. 

<p>Currently, the administration is bringing its full weight to bear on the U.N. 

Security Council to legitimate U.S. military action against Iraq. Meanwhile, the 

number of people out of work in September was basically the same as it was in 

August, according to the Labor Department. 

<p>As the Bush administration backs an Iraqi war ever more, how do progressives 

connect national security and the economic insecurity of the U.S. public? This 

isn’t an academic question. 

<p>We know the official vision of national security and economic security. What 

is ours? 

<p>How can we connect U.S. policies designed to conquer foreign resources such 

as Persian Gulf oil and the festering jobs crisis here? What are some ways to 

link war with Iraq to people in the U.S. facing economic insecurity? 

<p>For example, protecting the U.S. public against Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein 

doesn’t change the fact that the economic slowdown is forcing businesses to hold 

back on hiring. When the growth of profits slows, the hiring of workers slows. 

<p>This is the harsh reality of a harsh system. It’s cut from the cloth of militarism, 

racism and sexism. 

<p>On that note, standing up to Evil in Iraq doesn’t change the fiscal crises 

of local and state governments increasingly strapped for cash to meet people's 

material needs. Likewise, the White House’s resolve to bring its vision of democracy 

to Iraq doesn’t bring back Enron and WorldCom workers' pensions invested in the 

stock market. 

<p>Even those in the corporate suites are fretting about the current business 

climate. This is an admission that a U.S. attack on Iraq doesn’t automatically 

equate to a rising tide of national security that lifts all boats, or planes, 

in this case. 

<p>On Tuesday, Oct. 8, executives with American Airlines and Delta Air Lines told 

the U.S. Chamber of Commerce that the nation’s big airlines are in bad financial 

shape. Some carriers are perhaps facing extinction, they added. 

<p>Thus many thousands of workers stand to lose their livelihoods. According to 

AMR Corp. CEO Donald Carty, federal aid is urgently needed to help U.S airlines 

cover rising security and insurance expenses, which could be hype or just a PR 

ploy for taxpayer dollars. 

<p>Meanwhile, as sectors of corporate America lobby Washington for a hand and 

the Bush administration’s war lobby presses the U.N. Security Council, people 

in the U.S. go to and look for work. This keeps them, the capitalist system and 

the military force that supports it abroad moving forward. 

<p>This is a contradiction. In my view, such contradictions should be addressed 

by progressives with the aim to expand our choir of committed activists. 

<p>I mean, we want peace, but what does that mean under a system of commodity 

production that regularly intervenes militarily to make the world safe for U.S. 

corporations? We have to think about new ways to speak with the U.S. public about 

this contradiction. 

<p>What is our vision of a civilized society based on social cooperation, not 

the private competition of all against all and each against all? How should peace 

activists encourage the U.S. public to consider capitalism and its wars, national 

security and economic insecurity? 

<p>In my view, this is a question that must be asked of and answered by ordinary 

people to create a future of peace and prosperity. </p>
