<p>The Bush administration appears to be trying to prove that a war can be won 

by sabre-rattling alone. Amid an almost deafening public indifference, hardly 

a day goes by without a new report or disclosure suggesting that a US attack, 

at the end of this year or early next, is a virtual certainty. </p>

<p> The official position was set out by President George Bush at his press conference 

on Monday. He said America was committed to "regime change" in Baghdad and would 

use "all the tools at our disposal" to achieve that end. But he insisted again 

that he had not made a final decision on any plan. He dismissed the leak of detailed 

Pentagon war plans to <i>The New York Times</i> last week as "somebody down there 

at level five flexing some 'know-how' muscle". </p>

<p> This week the leaks have continued, first in a report claiming that the US 

would use Jordanian airfields to launch its assault &#173; even though the Jordanians 

have not been informed of the plan, and every indication is that they would not 

give permission if asked. Then came another and somewhat contradictory report 

in <i>USA Today</i>, to the effect that the military planners had "raised the 

bar" for an invasion. It would now require a serious provocation by Saddam Hussein, 

such as invading a neighbour or attacking the Kurds or Shia Muslims in the south, 

before the US war machine started to roll. Like the other reports, it was sourced 

to anonymous "officials". </p>

<p> The implication of the <i>New York Times</i> revelations is that the "Afghan 

model" for an invasion of Iraq, involving bombing, special forces and covert CIA 

operations, with the help of an internal insurrection (for the opposition Northern 

Alliance read the Kurds), had been dropped. Instead the blueprint, entitled <i>Cent-Com 

Course for Action</i>, puts the emphasis on an all-out assault involving 250,000 

or 300,000 US troops, and a massive air attack aimed at crucial infrastructure 

targets as well as suspected sites where weapons of mass destruction are being 

developed or stored. </p>

<p> Some analysts believe the source of the leak to be military commanders who 

believe the politicians are blithely talking up an operation whose potential cost 

in casualties for US forces they do not fully appreciate. But others take the 

report as part of a process of softening up President Saddam, forcing him into 

a rash move that would give Washington the pretext it required. Talk of US and 

British agents stirring up trouble among the Kurds might, for example, prod the 

Iraqi leader into a strike against them, thus offering the US justification to 

step in. </p>

<p> This strategy would also explain why Washington is so averse to protracted 

negotiations over the return of United Nations weapons inspectors, and was delighted 

by the failure of the latest round of talks last week in Geneva. Paul Wolfowitz, 

the Deputy Defence Secretary and a leading proponent of action to get rid of President 

Saddam, has derided the inspection process. They would be unable to inspect anything 

worth inspecting, he insists, while the talks would enable President Saddam to 

play for time, throwing open his doors to stave off an invasion. </p>

<p> Instead, Washington is starting to focus on a possible provocation that would 

clear any conceivable bar: links between Iraq and al-Qa'ida pointing to Baghdad 

having had a hand in terrorist attacks, or even 11 September itself. After the 

attacks, the CIA and the Pentagon seemed if anything to play down reports that 

Mohamed Atta, the hijackers' ringleader, met an Iraqi intelligence officer in 

Prague earlier in 2001. But officials are now looking at that episode again, while 

an Iraqi defector claimed in a television documentary this week that he had seen 

Osama bin Laden in Baghdad in July 1998, just before al-Qa'ida attacked two US 

embassies in east Africa. </p>

<p> Either story, if confirmed, would vindicate Washington's argument for toppling 

President Saddam &#173; that while he might not use chemical, nuclear or biological 

weapons, he would make them available to terrorists. If the US could prove a connection 

between Iraq and al-Qa'ida, doubts over whether an invasion was justified would 

disappear. In the meantime, the sabre-rattling continues.</p>
