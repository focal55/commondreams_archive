<p>In barely 18 months, the identity of the Democratic challenger to President 

George W. Bush's 2004 re-election will have been determined. Democratic National 

Committee Chairman Terry McAuliffe's front-loading of the nominating process all 

but assures that the fight will be over before activists within the party and 

on its fringes have a chance to consider the candidates. 

<P>Thus, Americans who believe that the Democratic Party ought to offer a choice 

rather than an echo of the Bush administration's voodoo economics ought to begin 

examining their options now. Fortunately, the recent congressional votes on granting 

the Bush administration "fast track" authority to enter into secret negotiations 

toward the development of a sweeping Free Trade Area of the Americas offer a good 

place to begin the analysis. 

<P>This summer's fast track votes in the House and Senate presented congressional 

Democrats - a staggering number of whom are pondering presidential candidacies 

- with some stark choices. They could side with the Bush administration, multinational 

business interests and the Washington "think tanks" that are willing to go to 

war to defend American democracy and values - unless, of course, that democracy 

and those values pose a hindrance to nation-hopping corporations. Or they could 

side with the trade unions, environmental groups, farm organizations, consumer 

groups, churches and international human rights campaigners that represent the 

activist base not just of the Democratic Party but of the nation as a whole. 

<P>In the House, where fast track passed by an agonizingly narrow 215-212 margin, 

Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., did not merely oppose fast track, he helped 

coordinate the opposition. Of the 212 votes against fast track, 183 came from 

the Democratic caucus. 

<P>Two other House members who are considering Democratic presidential runs, Dennis 

Kucinich and Marcy Kaptur, both of Ohio, were in the forefront of opposition to 

the legislation. 

<P>Kucinich, the Congressional Progressive Caucus chairman who is perhaps best 

known among progressives around the country for his outspoken criticism of the 

Bush administration's military policies, combined hometown concern for factory 

workers in the Cleveland area with a sophisticated analysis of international human 

rights and development issues to offer some of the most thoughtful criticism of 

the corporate free trade agenda. (Kucinich's "Action Center" on his congressional 

home page at www.house.gov/kucinich/action/trade.htm explains fast track and related 

issues and provides links to Public Citizen's Global Trade Watch, Friends of the 

Earth, the Economic Policy Institute and unions that have battled the corporate 

agenda on trade policy.) 

<P>Kaptur delivered the best speech during the House's fast track debate. An expert 

on trade policy who has battled the corporate agenda for two decades, Kaptur spoke 

with the confidence of someone who knew that what the Bush administration was 

asking for was wrong. Yes, of course, she said, passing fast track would begin 

a process that would cost Americans jobs and farms. But the damage to the developing 

world would be worse, she explained, describing a future for the poorest of the 

poor that would be defined by "corporate slums and global plantations with penny-wage 

jobs." 

<P>What of the Senate, where fast track won a 64-34 endorsement? Though that chamber 

is thick with Democratic presidential timber, few of Bush's prospective challengers 

stood tall. Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota conspired with 

corporate Democrat Max Baucus of Montana to spring a surprise vote on the eve 

of Congress' summer break. Daschle whipped Democrats to back the Bush agenda on 

trade, voted for fast track and then joined in a grotesque celebration of the 

victory with Baucus. 

<P>Connecticut's Joe Lieberman, the party's 2000 vice presidential nominee, was 

an outspoken supporter of the legislation. Joining Lieberman and Daschle in backing 

fast track was Massachusetts' John Kerry. Delaware's Joe Biden voted against fast 

track, but cast procedural votes that aided Daschle's push for the legislation. 

<P>Indeed, of Senate Democrats who have been mentioned as potential presidential 

contenders, only three stood consistently in opposition to the Bush trade agenda: 

Wisconsin's Russ Feingold, the Senate's most thoughtful foe of the corporate free-trade 

agenda; Connecticut's Chris Dodd, a friend of labor with a long interest in human 

rights issues; and, to the surprise of many who recall her role in a previous 

administration that fought for fast track, New York's Hillary Clinton. 

<P>As for the likely front-runner for the 2004 nomination, Al Gore wrote an op-ed 

in Sunday's New York Times in which he condemned the Bush administration's failings 

and called for Democrats to stand tough against corporate power. Amazingly, however, 

Gore's article made no mention of fast track or the trade debate.</p> </p>
