<p>The head of the IMF's delegation to

Argentina was recently cornered outside his

hotel room by reporters from a popular,

muck-raking television show. They handed

him a set of large, plastic Halloween

vampire teeth. "We found these lodged in

President Duhalde's neck," they told him,

"and wanted to return them to you."



         <p>Such views of the IMF are

commonly held in Argentina, and contrast

sharply with those expressed in Washington

media and policy circles. Here, the debate

has been about whether the IMF should

"help" Argentina, which is suffering from

four years of economic depression, a

collapse of its currency and banking system,

and default on its public debt. The doves say

yes, the country is desperate; the hawks say

no, not until the government demonstrates

more willingness to "reform."



         <p>Both sides are misreading the actual

situation. The IMF is not offering any help

to the Argentine economy. Even if an

agreement is reached, there will be no new

money -- only enough to pay the Fund and

other official creditors such as the World

Bank.



         <p>Furthermore, Argentina is not facing

a simple choice of whether to accept or

refuse this "help." It is much worse than

that. The IMF is using its power as head of

an international creditors' cartel to prolong

Argentina's agony. Credit from the World

Bank, from European governments, and

even the day-to-day credit that businesses

need to conduct international trade are being

held up until the IMF gives the ok.



         <p>This distinction is crucial. Imagine

that someone is drowning, and a passerby

does nothing to save him. This would be

morally reprehensible. But what if the

drowning man is trying to claw his way onto

the shore, and the passerby kicks him and

pushes him back into the river?



         <p>The latter case is much worse, not

only from a moral but a practical point of

view: the drowning man might save himself

if not for the outside intervention.



         <p>Very simply, the IMF is practicing a

form of extortion, and a fairly brutal one at

that. A couple of months ago the World

Bank was supposed to release some $700

million in funds for the unemployed -- now

numbering about a quarter of Argentina's

labor force. But they decided to wait for the

IMF's approval.



         <p>On a recent visit to Argentina, I met

with Dr. Nestor Oliveri, a physician who

runs a health clinic for the poor in the

neighborhood of Matanza, on the outskirts

of Buenos Aires. He pointed to children

jumping over an open drainage ditch. "They

touch their mouths, and they get parasites.

We have 30% malnutrition among children

in this neighborhood."



         <p>And it is getting worse, in a country

that was until recently the richest in Latin

America.



         <p>What does the IMF want from

Argentina? After more than six months of

talks and pressure, it is not even clear. The

government has already agreed to just about

everything that the Fund demanded,

including drastic spending cuts (especially

for the provincial governments) and

rewriting their bankruptcy laws to make

these more favorable to creditors. Yet the

IMF keeps moving the goal posts, and

coming up with new demands. Some

financial analysts have concluded that the

IMF is deliberately punishing Argentina for

defaulting on its international debt, so as to

discourage others from taking this path.



        <p> The Fund's policy conditions will

probably worsen the depression, by causing

layoffs of hundreds of thousands of workers

and reducing aggregate demand in the

economy. For four years, the IMF has been

arguing that the only way to get the

economy growing is to first restore the

confidence of investors, especially foreign

investors.



         <p>But the measures that they have

recommended to do this, such as cutting

government spending, have further

weakened the economy. These policies have

therefore had the opposite effect. And now,

by choking off credit from most other

sources -- i.e., its extortion -- the Fund is

accelerating the decline.



         <p>Unlike most countries that turn to the

Fund, Argentina is currently running a trade

surplus. This means that it does not really

need external financing. Nor does it need

dollars to fix its banking system, which now

runs on pesos.



         <p>In other words, the country is

capable of recovering on its own. At this

point the biggest obstacle to re-starting

growth may be the Fund itself. As the crisis

drags on, Argentina may have to find a way

to get around the IMF.
