<p>The Progressive pundits agree that we are in a confounding situation: a right-wing 

president - who lost the popular vote, who was installed by judicial fiat and 

who continues to breeze through blunder after spectacular political blunder - 

is virtually given a free pass by the leaders of the "liberal" opposition. This, 

despite not only his illegitimacy and venality, but also despite the massive, 

pervasive harm he is causing to our country and the world. 

<p>Mark Shields, in pondering this conundrum, asks, "What will the Democrats do 

with a hand of four aces?" Actually, it is more a royal flush the Dems have been 

dealt; and they are hesitating to bet more than a pocketful of nickels against 

the four-card straight (i.e. the Terror War...a hand whose weakness is demonstrated 

both in terms of its failure to decrease the threat of attacks and in terms of 

our loss of civil liberties) that the GOP is holding. This is all the more confusing 

given the Democratic heritage: it has been the party of the disenfranchised as 

well as the average taxpayer, and the voice of the voiceless. Where are the mainstream 

Democratic voices of true outrage at the cultural, political and economic disintegration 

that we are witnessing right now, in not-so-slow motion? 

<p>Why, for instance, is there no raising of the ante in the current debate over 

the re-regulation of financial markets? Isn't the Sarbanes accounting reform bill 

but a mild prescription for the catastrophic illness that Wall Street suffers 

from? And isn't it going to be watered down when it gets reconciled with the placebo 

bill from the Republican House? Why couldn't the Dems see their overwhelming advantage 

as well as our national necessity, and press for higher stakes - by requiring 

that stock-options be listed as expenses; by eliminating the audit/consulting 

conflict; and by adding restrictions on the SEC Chair's employment history that 

would preclude another industry fox like Harvey Pitt from guarding the henhouse? 

<p>Speaking of Pitt, why has Tom Daschle explicitly eschewed the appointment of 

an independent investigation into the sordid corporate dealings of Bush and Cheney? 

Surely Pitt's investigation of Halliburton will be suspect, no matter how he couches 

an inevitable finding of Cheney's innocence. (Will he fail to interview Cheney, 

as Bush Sr's SEC failed to interview his son regarding Harken?) And what about 

the California Energy Market Scam, the largest single, documented ripoff ever, 

publicly aided and abetted by both Bush and Cheney (and managed at Enron by Army 

Secretary Thomas White). Where is the hue and cry? Daschle's excuse for not pressing 

for an independent inquiry on any of these matters is that these things can get 

out of hand (as if things weren't already). Ok...so don't ask Ken Starr to do 

it. We have a nation full of competent, impartial investigators who aren't beholden 

to the powers that be. How about Eliot Spitzer? 

<p>The panoply of weaponry that the Democrats have in their barely-used arsenal 

is truly mind-boggling. From Bush's refusal to re-regulate the markets (providing 

momentum to the current Dow free-fall); to his belligerent alienation of virtually 

the entire world at a time when we need global cooperation the most; to his knee-capping 

of a host of crucial environmental and health commitments; to his cabinet's gang-rape 

of the constitution; to his callous disregard for women and minorities; to the 

petulant inanities that he utters in public on a weekly basis...the list is practically 

endless. The guns are loaded, primed and pointed, but the only shots being taken 

are into the air. And some of those bullets are landing - surprise! - on Democrats. 

<p>Take Arthur Andersen, for example. As the late accounting giant is implicated 

in one colossal corporate implosion after another, it does the Democratic leadership 

no good to harp on the help Andersen got from the GOP to operate in a regulatory 

vacuum. After all, it was their own 2000 VP candidate, Senator Lieberman, who 

was a forceful and successful advocate for keeping executive stock options off 

the balance sheets...one of the flaming timbers on today's Wall Street bonfire. 

Any well-aimed shots at the GOP via Andersen will clip the Senator and, by association, 

2004 front-runner Gore. Similarly, it is dangerous to highlight fallen behemoth 

WorldCom's lucrative connections on the hill because senior Democrat Senator Fritz 

Hollings received even more of their lucre than did the nefarious Trent Lott. 

<p>(It is true that Tom Daschle is politely prodding the administration on Cheney's 

Halliburton record, and asking for Pitt's resignation - under the covering fire 

of conservative John McCain and aided by right-wing Judicial Watch's lawsuit against 

Cheney. But if Pitt were to resign while Daschle refuses to ask for an independent 

inquiry, any real investigation will be put off indefinitely while the SEC drifts 

Chair less. Daschle's shots are not only into the air, but he is also firing blanks.) 

<p>And speaking of weird bedfellows, some of the Left's heavy lifting has just 

been performed by - are we sitting down? - Bill Buckley's National Review. In 

a balanced, well researched and concise July 16 expose (<a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/york/york071602.asp" target="_new">http://www.nationalreview.com/york/york071602.asp</a>), 

Byron York discloses yet another Terry McAuliffe business deal that smells as 

bad as anything stinking up the Potomac these days. 

<p>Just before the Global Crossing story broke - which highlighted the DNC Chair 

as a fast and loose dealer - (and during the 9/11 confusion late last year), the 

IBEW was found by the Labor Department to have mishandled millions in electricians' 

pension funds in a Florida real estate partnership with McAuliffe. Two union officials 

were fined over $100,000 and $5 million was ordered to be reimbursed to the pension 

fund. McAuliffe slickly parlayed an initial investment of $100 into $2,450,000 

working capital, courtesy of his union pals. Like W performing his Harken/Texas 

Rangers sleight-of-hand, the DNC Chair walked away unfazed, onto the next big 

deal at Global Crossing. The official DNC response? "Terry McAuliffe isn't president 

of the United States," as if corruption and hypocrisy doesn't matter when you 

run a major political party. As if it ever doesn't matter. 

<p>The policies, morals and tactics of the "New" Democrats and the conservative 

DLC have failed the party and the country as dismally as their GOP counterparts' 

have. At this critical moment, our nation needs Progressive leadership from the 

party of FDR; not the rehashed fear-mongering and regulatory soft-pedaling that 

should be the sole domain of the Republicans. 

<p>McAuliffe should resign, and Real Democrats should demand it. His presence 

at the party helm is an embarrassment and a liability. (A good candidate for his 

replacement would be the man he beat last year for the post, Atlanta's Maynard 

Jackson). Then, any Democrat with any conscience and guts left should call loud 

and hard for a National Clean Elections Law, right now. And for God's sake, let's 

demand an independent counsel, or several of them, and let the chips fall where 

they may. 

<p>Get your act together, Democrats.</p>
