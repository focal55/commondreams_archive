<p>AUSTIN, Texas &#151; The famous Texas two-step is getting a heavy workout in 

Washington. You glance away for just a moment to watch the World Series and -- 

oops &#151; we're no longer for regime change in Iraq. 

<P>We've spent the last two months having it pounded into our brains daily that 

we must have regime change in Iraq, nothing else will do. But now &#151; not so. 

Well, you say, people are allowed to change their minds, even presidents. But 

that's where we come to the awkward part, because the administration is insisting 

it hasn't changed its mind at all, it never demanded regime change and it's all 

our fault for being so stupid as to have misunderstood them. This is the Red Queen 

stage, she who could believe six impossible things before breakfast. 

<P>You won't find me griping about our new policy &#151; except of course, since 

we're so dumb we can't remember what the old policy, this is not new at all. I 

like the not-new policy. The not-new policy is that if we can get rid of Saddam 

Hussein's weapons of mass destruction through strict U.N. inspections, we don't 

have to have a war. Actually, that was my old policy, so I'm glad to see it's 

become Bush's not-new policy, and I'd just like to apologize to everyone for thinking 

that Bush ever wanted regime change in the first place. 

<P>Now that you are in practice on the Red Queen program, join us for the latest 

fiasco in corporate reform. In those dear, dead days of last summer, Bush appeared 

on Wall Street standing before a blue and white backdrop on which "Corporate Responsibility" 

and "A New Ethic" were printed over and over &#151; in case we should miss the 

point of his speech. President W. was there in his incarnation as the Scourge 

of Corporate Misbehavior to read the riot act to corporate executives who do terrible 

things &#151; like get insider loans, dump their stock when the company is tanking 

and do phony transactions to take heavy losses off the books. 

<P>For those us who had followed Bush's career at Harken Energy &#151; Enron writ 

small &#151; this was merely an average Red Queen morning. Hey, times change, 

the guy was the executive of an energy company bleeding money way back when, why 

shouldn't he get out while the getting was good? Now we have "a new ethic." 

<P>In that same speech, to show his zeal for going after corporate evil-doers, 

Bush asked for a nice round $100 million in additional funding for the Securities 

and Exchange Commission. Except the New Ethic didn't last very long. Didn't even 

survive the election, and I think Bush deserves credit on this point. Any posturing 

politician could have stuck with corporate reform until after the election was 

over; it takes <I>cojones</I> to drop the whole thing two weeks before the election. 

That, or someone who thinks the American people are deeply stupid. 

<P>So intense did the pressure for corporate reform grow last summer that the 

Congress actually passed the Sarbanes bill, including a new board to oversee the 

accounting industry and $776 million for the SEC, a 77 percent increase. Bush 

signed the bill amidst great fanfare and later took credit for solving the corporate 

corruption problems (even though he had opposed the bill almost until the moment 

he signed it). And everyone agreed, "What a good first step." 

<P>Oops. Bush and his man Harvey Pitt at the SEC have already gutted the new accounting 

oversight board, and last week he urged Congress to appropriate 27 percent less, 

$568 million, than the agreed-upon increase for the SEC. 

<P>That's an increase of about 30 percent over last year's budget of $438 million, 

and the SEC is one of the most notoriously underfunded agencies in Washington. 

Lawyers and accountants who work there make about half what lawyers and accountants 

do in other departments of government. New technology and enforcement efforts 

will have to be shelved. The SEC's workload has increased exponentially while 

its staff has shrunk. Given the corporate scandals, do we really want to call 

off the already emaciated watchdogs at the SEC? 

<P>In order to understand this move, you have to think like a Bushie. Corporate 

corruption? Hey, that was last summer's scandal -- that is so 10 minutes ago. 

As for those who think there is much more clean-up yet to be done, what are you, 

one of the 45 million Americans in a traditional pension plan? Why should you 

worry just because the New York Times reports America's 50 largest companies counted 

$54.4 billion of pension fund gains as profits last year, when in fact they lost 

$35.8 billion. 

<P>Just another cute accounting trick; doesn't hurt anybody. Just ask the ex-Enron 

and ex-Worldcom employees. And why would major corporations pad their reported 

earnings in this fashion? Could it be because that's the bottom line that determines 

the bonuses for top executives?</p>
