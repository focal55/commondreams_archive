<p>IT'S MOVING FURTHER towards decriminalization than any other country in the 

world," warned Keith Hellawell, the ex-policeman who was the British "drugs czar" 

until the Labour government belatedly realized that his job was as ridiculous 

as his title.

<P></P>

He was responding to British Home Secretary David Blunkett's announcement on July 

10 that being caught with cannabis will be treated no more seriously than illegally 

possessing other Class C controlled drugs like sleeping pills and steroids. He 

was technically wrong, but in terms of its political impact he was right. 

<P></P>

Hellawell was technically wrong because Britain is not leading the parade of European 

countries that have broken away from the prohibitionist approach in the United 

States. Even after Blunkett's changes, Britain will lag behind other European 

countries like Switzerland, the Netherlands, Belgium and Portugal in its laws 

on recreational drug use. But he was right because Britain is:<br>

<br>

<li></li>

Still more or less a great power. 

<li></li>

Speaks English. 

<P></P>

The main engine of the "war on drugs" is the U.S., which managed to enshrine its 

prohibitionist views in international law during the Cold War by a series of treaties 

that make it impossible for national legislatures to legalize the commonly used 

recreational drugs. All that other countries can do without Washington's agreement 

is to "decriminalize" the possession and use of at least some of the banned drugs. 

<P></P>

(This week, Canada announced it may follow Britain's lead by making simple possession 

of small amounts of pot a ticketing offence.) 

<P></P>

Numbers of smaller European countries have already decriminalized various drugs, 

but what the Portuguese or the Dutch do will never have an impact in the United 

States. Britain is one of the very few countries whose example will ever be seen 

as relevant in the country that is the real home of the "drug war." Britain's 

decriminalization of cannabis, and even more importantly its partial return to 

the old policy of prescribing free heroin for addicts on the National Health Service, 

could finally open the door to a real debate in the United States. 

<P></P>

The actual changes in British law are rather timid. In future, British police 

will generally confiscate cannabis and issue warnings to users, rather than arrest 

them. But "disturb public order" by blowing cannabis smoke in a police officer's 

face and you're in jail. Moreover, only a small fraction of Britain's 200,000 

heroin users will get free prescriptions. Nevertheless, this is by far the biggest 

crack that has yet appeared in the prohibitionist dam. 

<P></P>

Until the late 19th century, all kinds of recreational drugs were legal throughout 

the Western world. Florence Nightingale used opium, Queen Victoria used cannabis, 

and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle writes in a matter-of-fact way about Sherlock Holmes 

injecting drugs with a syringe. Then came the Women's Christian Temperance Union, 

most powerful in the United States. It succeeded in banning one drug after another 

until by the early 20th century only the mainstream drugs, alcohol and tobacco, 

were still legal in the U.S. 

<P></P>

For much of the 1920s and '30s the WCTU even succeeded in prohibiting alcohol 

in the U.S. Organized crime expanded tenfold to meet the opportunity created by 

this newly illegal demand for alcohol — Al Capone was just as much the result 

of alcohol prohibition as Pablo Escobar in Colombia was of America's war on drugs 

— but eventually there was a retreat to sanity in the case of alcohol. There will 

eventually be a return to sanity on drugs, too, but Britain's decriminalization 

of cannabis is only a very tentative first step. 

<P></P>

The war on drugs is one of the most spectacularly counter-productive activities 

human beings have ever engaged in. "We have turned the corner on drug addiction," 

said President Richard Nixon in 1973, and predictions of imminent victory continue 

to be issued at frequent intervals. But the quality of the drugs gets better and 

the street price continues to drop. As any free marketer should understand, making 

drugs illegal creates enormous profit margins and huge incentives to expand the 

market by pyramid selling. 

<P></P>

Drug prohibition increases the number of users, fills the jails with harmless 

people, channels vast sums into the hands of the wicked people who work to expand 

the lucrative black market and causes a huge wave of petty crimes. It is estimated 

that half to two-thirds of the muggings and property crimes in both Britain and 

the U.S. are committed by cocaine and heroin addicts desperate to find the inflated 

sums needed to satisfy their habit. 

<P></P>

Decriminalizing cannabis only nibbles at the fringes of this problem, for cannabis 

users are overwhelmingly neither addicts nor criminals. The more significant part 

of Blunkett's initiative is his willingness to revive the old policy of prescribing 

heroin to addicts (now around 200,000 in Britain, compared with around 500 when 

that policy was dropped at Washington's behest in 1963). He's only willing to 

let a small proportion of them have it on prescription for now, but since those 

will be the only heroin addicts who stay alive and for the most part stay clear 

of crime, the rest will also be back on prescription sooner or later. 

<P></P>

It will be many years yet before mainstream American politicians gain the political 

courage to take on the prohibitionist lobby directly, but the external environment 

is changing.
