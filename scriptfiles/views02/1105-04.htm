<p>To placate its powerful allies on the extreme right, the Bush administration 

is once again playing political games with the fate of our planet.

<p>The latest watershed global agreement the White House is sabotaging is a bold 

international accord the U.S. helped write that offers real hope for stabilizing 

the world's exploding population.

<p>In 200 years, the world's population has grown sixfold; it could almost double 

again by 2050. Every second, two people die and five are born. And while population 

growth has always been a controversial issue, it is now clear that we have begun 

to severely strain the Earth's finite resources.

<p> Chaos is the increasingly real result of trying to support more than 6 billion 

people on this planet, spawning desperate mass migrations, wars over rights to 

fresh water, medical epidemics, bloody riots and crime waves nurtured in teeming 

shantytowns.

<p>The war on terrorism, too, cannot logically be divorced from the struggle for 

population sanity. Refugee camps and hopeless slums steadily churn out alienated, 

landless young men and women who are perfect cannon fodder for ambitious religious 

and political zealots.

<p>At the 1994 United Nations population conference in Cairo, nations with different 

religious, social and political make-ups bravely acknowledged that the only proven 

way to slow the pace of the population explosion was to empower women by giving 

them reproductive rights, basic education and adequate health care so that they 

are capable of choosing a family size that offers them the best chance at being 

economically successful.

<p>This was a revolutionary idea because for much of human history a large brood 

of children, particularly boys, was valued as a source of farm labor; the value 

of women was based on their reproductive capacity.

<p>Modern sanitation and medical practices, however, have changed human death 

rates in the last two centuries, especially in terms of infant mortality, but 

rural cultures, fundamentalist religions and nationalist politicians have been 

slow to adapt to the reality that more is no longer always better.

<p>It was such reactionary forces, led by a trio of odd bedfellows -- the U.S. 

religious right, several repressive Muslim regimes and the Vatican -- that have 

worked to put the kibosh on the final declaration of the U.N. conference, a carefully 

crafted pact supported by 179 nations. Now they have found their knight in shining 

armor in President Bush, who apparently wanted to shore up his right flank for 

the midterm elections and whose administration is now threatening to withdraw 

crucial U.S. support for the agreement based on some of its language.

<p>One of the White House's beefs, for example, is with a line that says that 

in societies where abortion is legal, health care should be provided to make the 

procedure safe. According to the National Right to Life Committee, which heartily 

praised Bush's stance, statements like the one in the agreement are "code" advocating 

abortions.

<p>But given that abortions are legal in the United States and are required to 

be medically sound, why would an American president seek to deny that standard 

of health-care protection to the rest of the world?

<p>Here's why: Women in other countries can't vote in U.S. elections, but the 

members of the National Right to Life Committee not only vote but also donate 

to candidates and political action committees.

<p>More than any other in recent memory, this administration is marked by a foreign 

policy driven primarily by a domestic agenda.

<p>To seek the votes of the right-to-life caucus by mucking about with the excruciatingly 

complex and difficult task of reining in world population is as dangerous in its 

effect as it is tawdry in its motive.

<p>And, once again, our arrogant unilateralism will cost us strategically as well 

as morally. When overpopulated China, India and Indonesia, as well as nations 

in Europe dealing with myriad crises arising from immigration, all react bitterly 

to this latest American isolationism, can we be surprised that they are hesitant 

to support Bush's jihad against Iraq?

<p>Of course, this won't bother the aggressive claque of right-wing think-tankers 

currently running the foreign policy of the most powerful nation in the existence 

of humanity, who seem to think that power makes us God. 

<p>We are not God, and our power must not be abused. At a time when the gap between 

the rich and the poor is dangerously increasing, when vast armies of the desperately 

poor are crashing through national boundaries, it is irresponsible in the extreme 

to sacrifice world population stability on the altar of domestic political advantage.</p>
