<p>East Timor today stands on the brink of independence, less than three years 

after it seemed to be on the edge of annihilation. But while the United 

Nation's formal transfer of power to an independent East Timorese 

government on May 20 is certainly cause for celebration, it should also be 

an occasion for reflection on the reasons for East Timor's recent horrors.



<p>Well over 200,000 East Timorese--about one-third of the pre-invasion 

population--lost their lives as a result of Indonesia's Dec. 7, 1975 

invasion and subsequent occupation. Indonesia's military could not have 

carried out its crimes without the assistance of numerous countries--most 

significantly that of the United States. Such complicity, along with 

Washington's debt to the people of East Timor and its obligations to the 

American public, highlights the need for Congress to establish an 

independent commission to fully investigate and publicize the U.S. role.



<p>President Gerald Ford and his secretary of state, Henry Kissinger met with 

Indonesia's dictator, Suharto, on Dec. 6, 1975. Suharto was eager to gain 

American authorization for the planned annexation of East Timor given his 

country's heavy dependence on U.S. weaponry, which was limited by treaty to 

defensive use. According to formerly classified meeting transcripts, Ford 

and Kissinger gave the green light for the invasion. In doing so, they 

aided and abetted an international crime against peace and violated U.S. law.



<p>In early 1976, an unnamed State Department official explained why 

Washington condoned Jakarta's actions: "We regard Indonesia as a friendly, 

non-aligned nation--a nation we do a lot of business with." Similar logic 

governed the thinking of all subsequent administrations. Washington thus 

provided billions of dollars in weaponry, military training, and economic 

assistance--as well as diplomatic cover--to Jakarta during its almost 

24-year occupation.



<p>As a final act of state terrorism, the Indonesian military (TNI) and its 

"militia" proxies launched a systematic campaign of revenge in Sept. 1999 

following an overwhelming pro-independence vote in a United Nations-run 

referendum. In approximately three weeks, they destroyed 70 percent of the 

territory's buildings and infrastructure, forcibly deported about 250,000 

people to Indonesia, and raped untold numbers of women--in addition to 

massacring at least 2,000.



<p>It was not until Sept. 11, 1999--one week into the final rampage--that 

President Bill Clinton ended all U.S. support for the TNI. Washington's 

ambassador to Jakarta at the time, Stapleton Roy, explained why a president 

who had once called U.S. policy toward East Timor "unconscionable" was so 

resistant to ending American support for resource-rich Indonesia. "The 

dilemma is that Indonesia matters and East Timor doesn't," he stated.



<p>It was such thinking that allowed the slaughter in East Timor to go largely 

unreported in the United States through the early 1990s. But even as 

coverage picked up in the mid- and late 1990s, press reports and editorials 

almost never discussed U.S. complicity in the invasion and occupation. The 

same is true today.



<p>The failure to compel Washington to account for its own misdeeds is one 

reason why it often disregards international norms and mechanisms, and 

justifies such behavior in a self-righteous manner. Washington's ongoing 

refusal to provide Haiti unhindered access to files confiscated by the U.S. 

military during the 1994 invasion, its use of intimidating tactics to 

ensure the victory of its favored candidate during the November elections 

in Nicaragua, and its undermining of the International Criminal Court are 

just a few of the recent examples.



<p>"If done well a truth commission can change how a country understands and 

accepts its past, and through that, if it is lucky, helps to fundamentally 

shape its future," asserts Priscilla Hayner, author of Unspeakable Truths: 

Confronting State Terror and Atrocity. Truth-telling processes can lead to 

a more informed, vigilant, and active citizenry--an indispensable component 

of any democracy worthy of its name.



<p>In November 1999, Richard Holbrooke, at the time the Clinton 

administration's U.N. ambassador, traveled to Jakarta. "You cannot deal 

with the future unless you also come to terms with the past," he told 

Indonesian leaders in reference to the TNI's scorched-earth withdrawal from 

East Timor. "Accountability is one of the two or three keys to democracy."



<p>East Timor's independence marks an auspicious time to begin putting these 

lofty words into practice here at home. For reasons of the health of 

American democracy, the universality of international law, and the inherent 

worth of all human lives, East Timor--and the U.S. Role in the country's 

plight--must matter. Congress should ensure that Washington allows full 

disclosure of, and atones for its role in East Timor's suffering. Only in 

this manner can the United States begin redeeming itself for its complicity 

in one of recent history's most horrific chapters.
