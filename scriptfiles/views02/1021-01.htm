<p> WASHINGTON - The Democratic leadership was open about its motives in rushing 

through a congressional affirmation of President Bush&#39;s war plans in order 

to get the issue out of the way so the elections can turn on the economy. 

<P> The problem with this strategy is that it&#39;s hard to present yourself to 

the electorate as an economic champion when you&#39;ve just voted for a war that 

is so likely to inflict further damage on an extremely vulnerable economy. 

<P> The damage is already being done. Oil prices have been flirting dangerously 

around the $30-a-barrel mark, a price that has been associated with the last four 

recessions. Each time a Bush administration official makes it sound as if an attack 

is imminent, the price spikes. 

<P> When Vice President Dick Cheney delivered his first major speech on the subject 

in late August, for example, oil prices jumped 65 cents. The chief U.S. economist 

for Deutsche Bank, Peter Hooper, estimates that each dollar added to the price 

of oil costs consumers about $12 billion a year. 

<P> The airline industry is the most panicked over these developments, warning 

politicians that a war would send them into a complete financial crisis. They 

were still trying to recover from the shocks of the Persian Gulf war (which cost 

them $14 billion) when Sept. 11 hit (which cost them $20 billion). 

<P> The entire transportation sector - which greases the wheels of the economy 

- is affected when oil prices climb, and the increases get passed to consumers. 

<P> The trucking industry is already adding a fuel surcharge onto its price to 

compensate for the effects of a war-driven disruption in supplies. 

<P> In addition to these indirect costs of a war with Iraq, what will it cost 

the United States to wage the war? 

<P> Our allies paid 80 percent of the cost of the Gulf war; there is no sign that 

they will do so again. 

<P> Lawrence Lindsey, chairman of the administration&#39;s Council of Economic 

Advisers, estimated that the war could cost between $100 billion and $200 billion, 

or 1 percent or 2 percent of our gross domestic product. 

<P> He seemed serenely confident that this would be no problem. 

<P> The U.S. economy is barely moving. Growth is slowing to nearly imperceptible 

levels. Average household incomes are now contracting for the first time in a 

decade. The combination of huge tax cuts and massive military spending increases 

have turned four years of budget surpluses into a budget deficit projected to 

be $157 billion for the last fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30. 

<P> Public opinion polls show increasing misgivings among Americans about the 

need for a rush to war. Majorities want to give U.N. weapons inspections more 

time to work, and to work in concert with our allies. 

<P> Even larger majorities (70 percent in a recent New York Times/ CBS News poll) 

said they felt more threatened by our weakening economy than they did by Saddam 

Hussein. 

<P> Many respondents also said they worried about the effects of a war on our 

economy. 

<P> They know what congressional leaders appear not to: that war and the economy 

are, or need to be, parts of the same conversation. The weight of the evidence 

makes clear that if we embark on this war, we will be endangering our economic 

health.
