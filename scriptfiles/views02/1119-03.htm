<p><i>"What is being presented as an act of charity is in fact nothing more than 

an act of marketing."</i> <br>

&#151; Zimbabwean farmer at the Johannesburg Earth Summit, referring to U.S. dumping 

of genetically engineered food aid in Africa 

<p> A number of recent editorials and opinion pieces in the media regarding famine 

in southern Africa claim that genetically engineered (GE) food is necessary to 

"feed the world." 

<p> These may actually be attempts to bolster the sagging fortunes of the biotech 

industry rather than efforts to end hunger. Arguing that spoiled yuppies of the 

European Union and U.S. are blocking attempts to end famine in Africa by attacking 

genetically engineered foods, these articles generally distort the existing knowledge 

relevant to GE issues. 

<p> The principal claim they make is that there is no evidence that genetically 

engineered food poses a health risk. "No evidence of risk" is not the same as 

"evidence of no risk." Since neither the U.S. government nor industry appears 

to be funding any research into the health effects of GE food, the situation is 

really "don't look/don't find." 

<p> Thus, no one knows whether continued eating of genetically engineered food 

is safe. Perhaps chronic exposure to GE food might be associated with the 70 million 

incidents each year of "food poisoning" reported by the government, or with the 

apparent rises in autism or attention deficit disorder in kids. Or, perhaps not. 

<p> Whatever industry research there may actually be on GE food, it is not reported 

in the open, peer-reviewed literature where it would be subjected to the rigors 

of scientific scrutiny. It is secreted away as "confidential business information." 

Nonetheless, the U.S. government calls this approach to not regulating GE food 

"sound science." Claims that the United Nations has certified that such food is 

safe to eat are based on such irregular studies, not independent testing. 

<p> Indeed, the U.N. is in the process of establishing a biosafety protocol to 

regulate the international movement of transgenic organisms, including food. It 

should be operational by next spring, and will explicitly recognize the legitimacy 

of the actions taken by the southern African countries in rejecting the importation 

of GE foods. In the meantime, many countries currently have put up barriers to 

GE food, which is severely impacting U.S. agricultural exports. 

<p> The protocol has, as a key component, the "precautionary principle," a doctrine 

of risk regulation stating the old adages "look before you leap" and "better safe 

than sorry." Similar to dozens of U.S. regulatory statutes, the principle says 

that when there is scientific uncertainty about a potentially important risk, 

a government is justified in prohibiting action until more scientific research 

is done to better establish the exact risk parameters. And then, when there is 

information, a society may make an informed choice as to what level of risk it 

chooses to run. 

<p> However, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration made a political decision in 

1992, without any scientific inquiry and over the objections of some of its senior 

scientists, that genetically engineered foods were "substantially equivalent" 

to conventional varieties. 

<p> In other words, if they share a few characteristics in common, they are probably 

the same in other characteristics. So ... Since GE tomatoes are round, red and 

hang from their vines they must be as healthy as conventional tomatoes. 

<p> The biotech industry, however, has no shame in going across the street to 

another federal agency, the Patent Office, and arguing that GE foods are substantially 

different from conventional ones, and so should be awarded patents. 

<p> Hunger is a political/economic phenomenon, not essentially a technical one. 

That is why countries like the U.S. have so many hungry residents despite our 

huge food surpluses, and why Ethiopia (the former poster child of malnutrition) 

has been able to be food-self-sufficient for the past seven years, using traditional 

technologies within an overall system of careful conservation practices and planning. 

<p> All the technical "revolutions" we have proclaimed &#151; hybrids, pesticides 

and other agrichemicals, the Green Revolution, etc. &#151; have not ended world 

hunger, and it sounds like a shell game to proclaim that just one more (technical) 

fix is going to do the trick. 

<p> In fact, there are signs that the biotech industry may be in dire straits. 

A study by the British Soil Association (an organics group) titled "Seeds of Doubt" 

recently estimated that North America lost over $12 billion in the period 1994 

to 2000. It notes: 

<p> &#149; The profitability of growing GE herbicide-tolerant soya and insect-resistant 

maize is less than non-genetically modified crops; 

<p> &#149; The claims of increased yields have not been realized overall except 

for a small increase in some maize yields. 

<p> &#149; GE herbicide-tolerant crops have made farmers more reliant on herbicides 

and new weed problems have emerged; 

<p> &#149; All farmers are suffering a severe reduction in choice about how they 

farm as a result of the introduction of genetically modified crops by some; 

<p> &#149; Non-GE seeds have become almost completely contaminated by genetically 

engineered components. 

<p> The industry, its government allies and their spokespeople don't seem particularly 

concerned with their need to dump unwanted food upon unwilling, but starving, 

people. Indeed, there is evidence that they welcome this chaos as leading to a 

situation in which opposition to GE foods will be rendered futile. As Emmy Simmons, 

assistant administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development, said 

to me after the cameras stopped rolling on a vigorous debate we had on South Africa 

TV, "In four years, enough GE crops will have been planted in South Africa that 

the pollen will have contaminated the entire continent." 

<p> Let organic farmers, the producers of heirloom varieties, and even those who 

plant conventional but unique hybrids be damned. Under the specious claims of 

"free choice" for farmers, the industry will deny consumers all choice about whether 

to eat engineered genomes. 

<p> The repeated insistence that the countries of Africa are being manipulated 

by white northern activists reflects a colonialist mentality that cannot imagine 

Third World nations being able to decide what is actually in their best interests. 

At a meeting of the U.N.'s Food and Agricultural Organization in June 1998, all 

the delegates from the continent (except South Africa) published a statement that 

"strongly object(ed) that the image of the poor and hungry from our countries 

is being used by giant multinational corporations to push a technology that is 

neither safe, environmentally friendly, nor economically beneficial to us." 

<p> More Americans should be asking why propaganda is keeping us from being educated 

about subjects that Africans seem to know so well.
