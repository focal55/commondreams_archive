<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->Israel's incursion into Palestinian territory makes it more urgent 

than ever to terminate US support for Israeli domination of the West 

Bank and Gaza. Even many of Israel's long-time supporters now 

understand that, to provide justice to Palestinians -- and also to 

salvage democracy and morality within the Jewish State itself -- the 

thirty-five-year occupation must end.



<p>As we proceed, however, peace and justice activists confront three 

overlapping challenges.



<p>First, we should know what we're talking about. Interactions at 

recent rallies between demonstrators and counterdemonstrators make it 

clear that we don't always do our homework. Like those who confront 

us, too often we overgeneralize, present inadequate views of history, 

fail to acknowledge the range of perspectives and motives on both 

sides. Sometimes we pass along easily disproved or 

impossible-to-verify exaggerations. Repeatedly, we confuse slogans 

for arguments.



<p>One example is our tepid response to the Palestine Authority's 

instant assertion that Israeli forces in Jenin massacred 500 

Palestinians. The plausible evidence is horrendous enough: some 

Israeli troops beat captured Palestinians and used others as human 

shields; blocked ambulances on flimsy pretexts; vandalized homes and 

offices; shot noncombatants, or humiliated them to teach them a 

lesson; and imposed on innocent civilians massive destruction and 

collective punishment. To all this and more, we object.



<p>But disseminating dubious claims of a large-scale massacre hurts our 

credibility.



<p>Similarly harmful is comparing Israeli actions to those of Nazi 

Germany. The extermination of millions of Jews and others -- 

systematic, totalistic, bureaucratic, scientific -- may not be 

unique, but calling every atrocity Nazi-like demonstrates either a 

weak grasp of history or a calculated misuse of it.



<p>Jews opposed to Israel's war crimes -- our numbers grow, despite the 

mainstream media's determination to ignore us -- are often moved by 

the welcome we receive from appreciative Palestinians; they should 

not have had to wait so long for our presence. But many Jews won't 

march behind banners that equate the Star of David and the Nazi 

swastika. If those banners disappeared, along with the superficiality 

that inspires them, there might be more of us.



<p>A third example: We're appalled when some Israelis propose 

"transferring" all Palestinians out of Occupied Territories. We 

should be equally appalled when Hamas reiterates its intention to 

expel from Israel all who reject the Islamic rule it intends to 

impose.



<p>Our second challenge is to communicate more effectively with our 

opponents. It's easy to list facts justifying our position. It's 

harder to respond substantively to the other side's list, to struggle 

with their best arguments rather than simply shrug off their worst. 

Applying principles evenhandedly, we should be ready to respond when 

those on the other side ask, as they always do, "What's your 

solution?"



<p>Talking with those we oppose is difficult. Even when it works, it 

only takes us so far, because mutual understanding doesn't solve 

every problem.



<p>But mutual understanding can help identify differing interests and 

values. Only then can we finally grapple with how to satisfy the 

legitimate needs of ordinary people on both sides. Any solution must 

take into account historic oppression and hostility, unequal access 

to power, and factors as varied as the role of oil and corporate 

profit and the contentious distinction between legitimate resistance 

to occupation and terrorist attacks on uninvolved civilians.



<p>Under the right circumstances, communication also reveals diversity. 

When interaction humanizes both Jews and Arabs, it becomes harder to 

believe dangerous stereotypes perpetuated by those who seek supremacy 

rather than resolution.



<p>Our third challenge is to respond with more than lip service to the 

spread of anti-Semitism. We rightly expect Jews of conscience to 

oppose Israeli aggression, just as we oppose the US government's 

post-September 11th assault on Muslim civil liberties. But we should 

also expect Palestinians and their supporters to reject those who 

blame, not Israel, but "the Jews."



<p>Some Arab governments continue to use inflammatory language and 

disseminate anti-Semitic literature. Synagogue arsons, beatings, and 

other anti-Jewish incidents escalate throughout Europe. Hate groups 

in the US use the Palestinian cause to incite violence against Jews.



<p>Despite claims to the contrary by mainstream Jewish organizations, 

every criticism of Israeli policy is not generated by anti-Semitism. 

But let's not make the opposite mistake. Sometimes the perception of 

Jew-hatred is right on target.



<p>So let's drop the slogans. Let's communicate more effectively. And 

let's unite behind the understanding that justice and liberation, 

democracy and safety, can only come about if they come to all of us, 

together.
