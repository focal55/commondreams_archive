<p>Subprime lenders have been marching up to state legislators around the 

nation with a stern warning-"enact protections for borrowers and you 

will trigger a quick and certain reduction of credit for thousands of 

low, moderate and middle income borrowers."

	<p>But, the hard facts coming out of the states with the courage to stop 

predatory and other unfair lending practices are putting the lie to the 

lenders' scare campaign.

	<p>Last summer, Morgan Stanley, a major financial services firm, surveyed 

300 branch mangers and loan officers from five of the largest subprime 

home equity originators and independent mortgage brokers.  The

conclusion from these front-line subprime operators was that predatory 

lending protections had not significantly dampened loan growth.

	<p>That was the finding for Georgia, New York and North Carolina which 

provide the toughest protections as well as for Connecticut, California, 

Florida and Pennsylvania which have enacted more limited protections 

against predatory lending practices.

	<p>In fact, Morgan Stanley's survey concluded that the more consumer 

friendly lending practices required in these states had lowered loan 

costs and appear to be boosting volume, not drying up credit.

	

<p>Morgan Stanley's survey is supported by a study of the North Carolina anti-predatory 

statute conducted by the <a href="http://www.responsiblelending.org/" target="_new">Center 

for Responsible Lending</a>. 

<p>The Center said no major subprime lenders (lenders with more than one 

percent of the market) left North Carolina after enactment of the 

consumer protections. More important, the organization estimated that 

the curbs on predatory lending had saved North Carolina consumers at 

least $100 million in 2000.

	<p>Subprime borrowers with blemished credit histories are regarded as high 

risk and, as a result, predatory lenders take advantage of their

vulnerability and weak bargaining position, charging them inflated 

interest rates and loan points, attaching costly "add-ons" like credit 

insurance, luring them into repeated fee-ridden refinancings and 

unaffordable repayment plans. Some of the predatory interest rates range 

up to eight percent above the average subprime rates.  The end result is 

often bankruptcies and foreclosures.

	<p>Consumer protections adopted by North Carolina and a handful of other 

state legislatures have been bright spots in this dismal world of 

predatory lending. Congress, in contrast, has been  paralyzed by massive 

campaign funds from the entire range of financial interests, including 

predatory lenders. There have been some brave statements for the record, 

but nothing even remotely akin to remedial action in the federal 

legislature.

	<p>While Congress looks the other way, the Federal Trade Commission, at 

least, has weighed in on behalf of consumers.  Its most noteworthy 

effort was a lawsuit against giant Citigroup, charging widespread 

abusive lending practices and violations of the Truth in Lending Act, 

the Fair Credit Reporting Act, and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act.

	<p>Jodie Bernstein, director of FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection, said 

Citigroup's newly acquired affiliate-Associates First Capital-engaged in 

a wide variety of deceptive practices.

	<p>"They hid essential information from consumers, misrepresented loan 

terms, flipped loans and packed in optional fees to raise the costs of 

the loans," Bernstein charged.

	  <p>In September, Citigroup threw in the towel and entered into a $215 million 

        settlement with FTC. The fund will be distributed among the victims of 

        Citigroup's deceptive lending practices. 

      <p>Despite FTC's effort against Citigroup predatory lending practices and 

the adoption of some protections in some states, consumer across the 

nation continue to be victimized by predatory and near predatory lending 

practices.  The fast buck, deceptive operators range from the 

established international giants like Citigroup to the back alley loan 

sharks which are equally adept at separating the poor and the near poor 

from their hard-earned money.

	<p>Knowing Congress is a safe-haven against any meaningful federal

sanctions on predatory lending, the financial industry-ranging from

finance companies to multi-billion dollar banks-will be chipping away at

what state protections have been enacted and making sure that the idea

of consumer protection doesn't spread to other states.

	<p>In Georgia, lenders like Chase Manhattan Mortgage Corporation,

Ameriquest, Option On, and New Century Financial Corporation are

launching new attacks on that state's Fair Lending Law, threatening to

leave the state if the law isn't repealed.  Hopefully, the findings of

recent surveys like those conducted at Morgan Stanley will give state

legislators the courage to stand fast on consumer protections for

borrowers.

	<p>In addition to the state laws, consumers need the protection of a strong 

federal statute against all aspects of predatory lending in all

50 states. But, the nation is faced with one of the most

corporate-oriented anti-consumer Congresses in our history. The

predatory lenders and other practitioners of deceptive and unfair credit

practices fully expect that the Congress will continue to look the other

way when consumer credit protections are mentioned.

    	<p>Two and one half  years ago, I asked Federal Reserve Chairman Alan 

Greenspan about the lack of action and he agreed that "enough was 

enough" on the excesses of predatory lending. Unfortunately, the Federal 

Reserve has taken only small steps to curb the practices.  Not only the 

Federal Reserve, but the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal 

Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of Thrift Supervision need 

to place a priority on ending this outrageous gouging of innocent low 

and moderate and middle income families.</p>
