<p>There is no pleasing some people. The organizers of the Johannesburg summit 

on the environment bent over backwards to persuade George Bush to accept their 

invitation. As the most accommodating hosts, they even changed the date to suit 

him, bringing it forward to avoid a clash with the anniversary of September 11. 

But still it was not enough. 

<P>Yesterday came the clearest signal yet that the US president, leader of the 

world's sole superpower and the planet's greatest single polluter, will snub the 

UN and the 65,000 delegates to this month's world summit on sustainable development 

by failing to show up. 

<P>He received congratulations on that from a clutch of US arch-conservatives, 

praising him for having the good sense to stay away. It is not official yet, but 

it seems Colin Powell will go in his place - confirmation, if it were needed, 

of the secretary of state's status as the human figleaf of the Bush administration, 

dispatched whenever Washington needs to put on its moderate, inclusive or "listening" 

face. 

<P>It all amounts to a clearer two-fingered salute than even the first Bush administration 

managed. Ten years ago Bush Sr dithered and delayed before finally showing up 

at the earth summit for a few hours. But now Bush Jr has decided to listen to 

those rightists who believed his dad made a mistake by flying down to Rio, giving 

in to the long-haired, granola-munching whiners of the environmental lobby. "Why 

would you want to go to a party when they want to throw pies at you?" asked Fred 

L Smith Jr of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, first to praise the prez. 

"The fortunate thing is, when 40,000 goofies get together not much happens." 

<P>That may be a crude summary of US attitudes but, coupled with the presidential 

absence, it suggests Johannesburg will provide the biggest demonstration yet of 

the new American disregard for the rest of the world. The summit will give eloquent 

expression to the Bush doctrine of go-it-alone unilateralism, in which America 

pursues its own interests first - with an avowed aversion to any multilateral 

efforts to make the world a better place. 

<P>There has been other evidence, such as Washington's refusal to sign up for 

the international criminal court. But just as Bush's tear-up of the Kyoto protocol 

shocked the world into realizing the depth of the new administration's contempt 

for multilateralism, so the Johannesburg stayaway will reveal again the unilateralist 

heart of Republican thinking, confirming the coalition-building that followed 

September 11 was the exception, not the rule. 

<P>This poses a great danger for those who want to see results from South Africa. 

At a presummit meeting last month, European diplomats spoke openly of their fears 

that the US was bent on undermining the global get-together, replacing binding 

targets and timetables with mere "voluntary initiatives". Washington has also 

sought to have trade, aid and debt relief taken off the Johannesburg agenda - 

which would not leave much to talk about. 

<P>The summiteers are left wondering how they can hope to achieve anything if 

the world's sole superpower is at best barely engaged and, at worst, outright 

hostile? And this poses a wider challenge: for what can the nations of the world 

do in any sphere if the US refuses to play the international game? 

<P>They could try to battle on regardless, as they did at Bonn last year when 

they renewed the Kyoto protocol despite the US boycott. That is what influential 

US economist Jeffrey Sachs advocates. Ignore "Washington's arrogant disregard", 

he says. 

<P>But that kind of effort takes leadership. Most environmentalists can see only 

one candidate: the European Union. "This is as much a test of the EU as it is 

about America," says Kevin Watkins, senior policy adviser at Oxfam. "Is the EU 

capable of showing leadership?" 

<P>The US has left a vacuum and the EU alone has the capacity to fill it. Put 

together, EU nations have far greater voting strength on the World Bank and the 

IMF than the US (and more than Africa, Latin America and South Asia combined). 

It has the muscle if it wants to use it. 

<P>But so far Europe has not dared act as a coherent power bloc. And nor, says 

Watkins, has it set an example. With the honorable exception of Britain, the leading 

EU states have cut, not increased, their aid to poor countries and have not made 

good on their promise to help fund education in the poorest nations. 

<P>So the easy posture later this month will be to denounce the Americans for 

staying away from Johannesburg. A better move might be to ask whether the Europeans 

did enough while they were there.</p>
