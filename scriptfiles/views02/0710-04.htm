<p>WASHINGTON</b> </a> Mounting anger over civilian casualties inflicted by U.S. 

forces is not the only reason why anti-American sentiment is growing in Afghanistan. 

More than 120 Afghan villagers were inadvertently killed or wounded by a C-130 

gunship on June 30 in Oruzgan Province, a stronghold of the 10 million Pashtun 

tribesmen who are Afghanistan's largest ethnic group. But even before the Oruzgan 

tragedy, the Pashtun goodwill earned by the United States for sweeping away the 

Taliban had been replaced by resentment after U.S. pressure to block the re-emergence 

of a Pashtun-dominated regime at the recent loya jirga, or grand council, held 

in Kabul.

<P>Pashtun domination has been the historical norm in Afghanistan. A Pashtun monarchy 

ruled from the birth of the nation in 1747 until a palace coup in 1973 in which 

the popular king, Zahir Shah, was deposed by a cousin.

<P>When it hastily launched Operation Enduring Freedom last October, the United 

States cast its lot with a triumvirate of generals from the Tajik ethnic minority 

who helped to dislodge the Taliban and now dominate the government of Hamid Karzai, 

a largely powerless front man. This Tajik triumvirate controls not only the armed 

forces and police but also three hated secret police agencies. In Pashtun eyes, 

the secret police are dedicated to curbing Pashtun influence and were automatically 

suspect in last week's murder of Vice President Haji Abdul Qadir, although there 

is no evidence yet to support this suspicion. To counter Tajik control of the 

security apparatus and also Karzai's cabinet, Pashtun leaders wanted Zahir Shah 

to run for president of the new Transitional Authority at the loya jirga. He was 

to have critical but clearly limited powers, with Karzai as prime minister running 

the government. At 87, the ex-monarch is too old to wield day-to-day authority, 

but his presidential powers, it was argued, plus his commanding popularity among 

Pashtuns, would have enabled Karzai to bring the secret police under control.

<P>In the weeks before the loya jirga, Pashtun tribal delegations totaling 70,000 

streamed into Kabul to pay homage to the king. This alarmed U.S. diplomats and 

generals, who have found Karzai a compliant partner and get along well with the 

Tajik military and secret police barons.

<P>On the eve of the loya jirga, the White House special envoy in Kabul, Zalmay 

Khalilzad, openly demanded that Zahir Shah renounce his presidential candidacy 

to avoid a &quot;divisive&quot; situation. Khalilzad confronted the king in a 

well-publicized meeting that one of the royal advisers described to me as &quot;unpleasant.&quot;

<P>Khalilzad is now reviled as &quot;the viceroy&quot; by many Pashtuns, who refer 

to the once welcomed U.S. forces in Afghanistan as an &quot;army of occupation.&quot;

<P>The need to break the Tajik grip on the Afghan armed forces and intelligence 

services was one of the major conclusions of a recent conference of 38 diplomats, 

aid officials and nongovernment experts on Afghanistan from 20 countries convened 

by Francesc Vendrell of Spain, a former UN special representative for Afghanistan 

and now the European Union's special envoy for Afghan affairs.

<P>Spain had organized the closed-door &quot;brainstorming&quot; meeting at Cordoba, 

Vendrell said, &quot;in the hope that the international community will remain 

focused on Afghanistan and not repeat the mistakes of the past by disengaging 

prematurely.&quot; Participants attended as individuals, not as representatives 

of their governments, and authorized Vendrell to sum up the discussions.

<P>In diplomatic language that avoided the use of the word &quot;Tajik,&quot; 

the conference concluded that &quot;it is necessary to overhaul the Afghan security 

services in order to depoliticize them, ensure that they are not dominated by 

any single ethnic group, bring them under civilian control and make them accountable 

to the central government as a whole.&quot;

<P>&quot;Many participants expressed awareness,&quot; Vendrell reported in his 

summary, &quot;that a segment of the loya jirga had left with a feeling of disappointment 

at what they perceived as their exclusion from the decision-making process leading 

to the selection of the head of state, but it is too early to assess whether this 

will have a negative impact on the functioning of the Transitional Administration.&quot;

<P>Among its 26 recommendations, the conference urged accelerated efforts to develop 

a new national army, emphasizing that it should be multiethnic in character.

<P>At present, the United States plans to maintain a military presence until the 

projected new army is in the field. But building a new army from scratch could 

take many years. The recent debacle at Oruzgan, which is only the latest of many 

similar incidents, underlines the urgent need to redefine the mission of U.S. 

forces.

<P>There is no definitive cumulative estimate of Afghan civilian casualties, but 

a credible University of New Hampshire study suggests a figure of 3,742.

<P>A redefined U.S. mission should focus on Al Qaeda remnants and phase out operations 

against what is left of the Pashtun Taliban guerrillas, like the raid at Oruzgan, 

in which it is impossible to distinguish the enemy from innocent tribesmen and 

their families. 

<P>Zahir Shah spoke out bluntly in a private Rome meeting in March with Italian 

aid agencies operating in Afghanistan. He thought the meeting was off the record, 

but a La Stampa reporter was present. As the war drags on, he said, it is becoming 

&quot;stupid and useless - it causes me great pain, and the sooner it is ended 

the better.&quot; </p>
