<p> Citizens can influence the decision whether to attack Iraq.  This 

requires understanding our administration's likely motives, which are 

not necessarily the stated ones.  Although this task may seem 

overwhelming to busy Americans, it is nevertheless worthwhile, given 

that many soldiers and innocents will die if we attack.



<p>History helps.  Early in World War I,  Woodrow Wilson was reelected 

on a pacifist platform.  But he believed we should enter the war, and 

thus created the Creel Commission to turn public opinion.  It worked.



<p>In 1928, Edward Bernays, a commission member, recorded lessons 

learned in the important book "Propaganda."  A founder of public 

relations, Bernays promoted his ideas throughout government and 

industry for decades.



<p>His premise: "Ours must be a leadership democracy administered by the 

intelligent minority who know how to regiment and guide the masses." 

This is accomplished, his book briefly explains, through methods 

like:  the recruitment of thought leaders, the "manipulation of 

patriotic opinion," and movies, "the greatest unconscious carrier of 

propaganda in the world today."



<p>Bernays's philosophy endured.  In 1962, it surfaced with Operation 

Northwoods, in which our top military leaders proposed faking a 

"Cuban terror campaign" so the US could attack Cuba.   During 

Vietnam, in the fabricated Gulf of Tonkin incident and deceptions 

revealed in the leaked Pentagon Papers. 



<p>Examining Gulf War I brings us up-to-date. Then, as now, the official 

mission was to get Hussein, the latest Hitler -- but when the war 

ended, he was still there.  Going after Saddam personally would have 

cost American lives, we were told.  But then Iraqi rebels tried to 

depose Hussein, and our troops stood down as Saddam crushed them.



<p>PR firms were hired to promote the war -- described in detail in John 

MacArthur's book, "Second Front."   For example, the fall of the real 

Kuwait, a dictatorship which was probably stealing Iraqi oil, was not 

likely to create a great deal of sympathy here.  Hill & Knowlton, 

then the world's largest PR firm, was hired to invent and deploy the 

now infamous incubator story, in which the Kuwaiti ambassador's 

daughter falsely claimed to have witnessed Iraqi soldiers dumping 

newborn babies out of hospital incubators and leaving them to die. 



<p>Five years later, Bush senior's advisor Brent Scowcroft told the BBC 

that the war was really about oil.  Not surprising.  Weak dictators 

are preferred for maintaining stability and oil flow in the region. 

Hussein's flaw, despite the PR, was not his crimes, but that he'd 

become too strong and independent.  The strategy, apparently, was to 

weaken him, but not remove.  With rebels dead and civilians 

devastated by our sanctions, a weaker Hussein would not be overthrown.



<p>Given this background, we can make assessments and predictions about 

Gulf War II, should it occur. 



<p>The administration seems desperate for war.  With opposition 

mounting, an incubator incident seems likely, a Tonkin or Northwoods, 

possible.  Linkage to terrorism, the obvious tactic.  Timing, our 

only clue.



<p>A stated objective is regime change.  But change to what? 

Democracy, if the US stands for human rights.  Another dictatorship, 

says history -- or a puppet government as in Panama and Afghanistan.



<p>Another stated objective is dismantling weapons of mass destruction. 

But the US supplied Hussein with materials for many such weapons, and 

our leaders were unconcerned when he used them in the 1980's. 

Furthermore, weapons inspector Scott Ritter -- a Bush-voting 

ex-Marine -- says his team was very successful at destroying them.



<p>Oil, always in the background in the Gulf, may be in the foreground 

again.  Although American access to Iraqi oil is good, the Russians 

and French have the inside track.  The war's primary objective may be 

to capture Iraqi oil fields and hand them over to US corporations. 

This might explain Iraq's recently announced $40 billion economic 

cooperation deal with Russia -- Iraq's attempt to make our real 

objectives more problematic.



<p>And the war could have a Wag-the-Dog component, as plausibly as 

Clinton's attacks on Iraq and Sudan during the Lewinsky affair.  This 

administration certainly needs distractions.



<p>We live in the age of Bernays, but with effort, we can still monitor 

and influence our leaders.  As the world becomes increasingly enraged 

by US actions, it's important we do.
