<p>WASHINGTON &#151; Don't feel bad if you have the uneasy feeling that you're 

being steamrolled. You are not alone.</p>

<P> As my girlfriend Dana said: "Bush is like the guy who reserves a hotel room 

and then asks you to the prom."</p>

<P> As the Pentagon moves troops, carriers, covert agents and B-2 bombers into 

the Persian Gulf, the president, Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld continue their 

pantomime of consultation.</p>

When Senator Mark Dayton of Minnesota asked the defense chief on Thursday, "What 

is compelling us to now make a precipitous decision and take precipitous actions?" 

an exasperated Mr. Rumsfeld sputtered: "What's different? What's different is 

3,000 people were killed." 

<P> The casus belli is casuistry belli: We can't cuff Saddam to 9/11, but we'll 

clip Saddam because of 9/11.</p>

<P> Mr. Rumsfeld offered sophistry instead of a smoking gun: "I suggest that any 

who insist on perfect evidence are back in the 20th century and still thinking 

in pre-9/11 terms."</p>

<P> Ah, Rummy. Evidence, civil liberties, debating before we go to war . . . it's 

all sooo 20th century.</p>

<P> Anyway, how can we have evidence when we learned last week that our evidence-gathering 

snoozy spooks are even more aggressively awful than we thought?</p>

<P> The administration isn't targeting Iraq because of 9/11. It's exploiting 9/11 

to target Iraq. This new fight isn't logical — it's cultural. It is the latest 

chapter in the culture wars, the conservative dream of restoring America's sense 

of Manifest Destiny.</p>

<P> The Bush hawks don't simply want to go back in a time machine and make Desert 

Storm end with a turkey shoot. They want to travel back even farther to the Vietnam 

War and write a more muscular coda to that as well.</p>

<P> Extirpating Saddam is about proving how tough we are to a world that thinks 

we got soft when that last helicopter left the roof of the American embassy in 

Saigon in 1975.</p>

<P> We can't prove it with al Qaeda. That's like grabbing smoke.</p>

<P> So former Nixon officials Cheney and Rummy are playing out their own "Four 

Feathers," rescuing the lost honor of the American empire in the sands of Arabia. 

They want to stomp on Saddam to exorcise the specters of Vietnam and Watergate 

— the ethical relativism, the lack of patriotism, the postmodern angst, the loss 

of moral authority, the feeling that America is in decline or in the wrong, the 

do-whatever-feels-good Clintonesque ethos.</p>

<P> Dick Cheney fought multinationalism and Lynne Cheney fought multiculturalism, 

defending the dead white males who made the republic great. She has written a 

children's book, "America: A Patriotic Primer," and urged that 9/11 be a day to 

remember the nation's glories rather than its "faults and failings."</p>

<P> The Cheneys, who have been known to invite dinner guests at the vice presidential 

mansion to sing along to "Home on the Range," think they can restore a sunnier, 

more can-do mood to our society. Even if it takes incinerating Baghdad to do it.</p>

<P> Rummy is equally impatient with the post-Vietnam focus on imperfections and 

limitations. He wants to yank the boomers by their collars and make them, if not 

the Greatest Generation, at least a bit Greater.</p>

<P> This is fine with W., who stayed 50's through the 60's and stopped liking 

the Beatles when they got into their "weird psychedelic period." He arrived at 

Yale and Harvard Business School just as the white male WASP ascendancy was slipping. 

He was in that small coterie of bewildered guys in wide-wale corduroy trousers, 

Izod polo shirts and Sperry Topsiders, surrounded by wild and crazy hippies protesting 

the war and smoking roaches.</p>

<P> The Bushies want to bring back the imperial, imperious presidency. The pre-emption 

proclamation had the tone of Cheney Caesar and Condi Ben Her. And the resolution 

sent to Congress seeking authority to go after Iraq was the broadest request for 

executive military authority since L.B.J. got the Gulf of Tonkin resolution rubber-stamped 

in 1964. At least L.B.J. had to phony up the Tonkin Gulf provocation. Mr. Bush 

can't be bothered. "I cannot believe the gall and the arrogance of the White House," 

Sen. Robert Byrd bellowed.</p>

<P> Things are getting dangerouser and dangerouser. Karl Rove's gunning for the 

Democrats. Ariel Sharon's gunning for Arafat. W.'s gunning for Saddam. And Al 

Qaeda's still gunning for us.  </p> </p>
