<p>The future of West Coast ports and their workers is on the line. As a 

labor battle intensifies, the possibility of federal intervention looms, which 

could spell more restrictions on democratic freedoms in a "post-terrorist" era.

<P>How did we arrive at this brink? A little background:

<P>Ports along the West Coast account for nearly $300 billion in annual trade, 

or 7 percent of the nation's gross domestic product. The 11,000-strong union 

of dockworkers who move that cargo, the International Longshore and Warehouse 

Union, is in contract negotiations in San Francisco with the Pacific Maritime 

Union, a group of global shipowners and terminal operators. Negotiations have 

been in a logjam since May, over what employers claim is the introduction of 

information technology.

<P>Last week, in an effort to break that impasse, ILWU President Jim Spinosa 

in an unprecedented offer gave employers the ability to introduce technology 

that would eliminate many marine clerk positions, but asked that all remaining 

jobs be ILWU. Despite this concession, which will result in a significant loss 

of union jobs, PMA dismissed the offer as insufficient.

<P>PMA has been hard-lining negotiations, using the ruse of computer 

technology in order to eliminate union jobs and the hiring hall, the source of 

the union's power. Moreover, employers are demanding givebacks in medical 

benefits in a "high hazard" industry. The ILWU is proud of the fact that its 

longshore contract sets a decent standard in benefits, working conditions and 

wages for organized labor on the West Coast and beyond.

<P>In PMA's aggressive, anti-union propaganda, the company falsely claims that 

longshore workers' wages average over $100,000 (in truth, it's closer to half 

of that). According to the leading maritime industry trade publication, the 

Journal of Commerce (July 1-7, 2002), "longshore labor costs account for such 

a small percentage of costs that a doubling of ILWU wages would barely produce 

a blip in overall expenses." So why does PMA's intransigence persist in 

negotiations?

<P>For the past several years PMA President Joseph Miniace has been pushing 

hard for an increased role of the federal government in the maritime industry. 

The agenda: restrict trade union power on the docks by banning the right to 

strike. Since Sept. 11, their lobbying has borne a strange fruit. Under the 

rubric of "national security" the impending Maritime Security Act and the 

passage of the USA Patriot Act will deny basic civil liberties, imposing 

background checks to screen port workers, the bulk of whom are either minority 

or immigrant workers.

<P>Most ominous was the "Iron Heel" call from Homeland Security czar Tom Ridge 

to the ILWU president "suggesting" that national security interests would be 

better served if there were no strike. Continued negotiations without the 

right to strike means accepting the employers' terms. Clearly, Bush's laissez-

faire policy means a free hand for big business while shackling labor.

<P>Bush's rating in opinion polls is plummeting in tandem with the stock 

market, hammered by each new financial scandal, including his own business 

dealings. To bolster his ratings, Bush could invoke the Taft-Hartley Act to 

force longshoremen to keep working during the busiest shipping period.

<P>The California AFL-CIO and the ILWU Longshore Contract Caucus are meeting 

this week simultaneously in San Francisco. If Bush invokes the slave-labor 

Taft-Hartley, it could become a rallying cry for the labor movement to 

challenge the repression of democratic and trade-union rights.

<P>In a defining moment of the U.S. labor movement 20 years ago, leaders of 

the striking air traffic controllers' union, PATCO, under orders from 

President Reagan, were hauled off to jail in handcuffs. Isolation led to 

government union-busting. The ILWU, learning from that ignominious defeat for 

labor, has systematically forged strategic labor links. At the AFL-CIO 

convention in December, an historic transportation union pact was proclaimed 

between the Teamsters, East Coast longshore union, the ILA, and the ILWU.

<P>Any waterfront conflict could quickly spread internationally. The ILWU 

helped launch the International Dockworkers Council (which grew out of the 

struggle of militant dockers in Liverpool, England, a few years ago), while 

maintaining its affiliation with the larger 5,000,000-member International 

Transport Workers Federation.

<P>In the wake of capitalist globalization and privatization, dockworkers have 

faced intensified union-busting drives by the military and police in Mexico, Australia 

and Brazil. All eyes are set here on a powerful dockworkers' union, whose destiny 

may be determined as much in Washington as in San Francisco.
