Presumably, open markets and free trade happen when government steps out of 

the market’s way.  President Bush supports this ideology, except when there 

is political-economic hay to make.



<p>Take the Bush White House’s imposition of up to 30 percent tariffs on 

imported steel.  This recent intervention in the world market for steel 

sheds light on the myths and realities of free trade as preached and 

practiced by the president.



<p>We begin with the 2002 Congressional elections.  It’s no secret that the 

Bush administration wants Republican congressional candidates to get the 

steel industry vote in states such as Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia.



<p>Remember that free trade supporters claim small government is best.  Is this 

why the president is willing to go to such market-distorting lengths to get 

Republicans elected to Congress?



<p>Now to be sure, times have been tough for steel employees in the U.S.  They 

certainly need a hand, but so do the nation’s other workers.



<p>The lives of American workers have become less secure than those of the 

previous generation.  One big reason is the nine percent rate of 

unionization for workers now, down sharply from around 37 percent in the 

1960s.



<p>In the meantime, world economic growth, led by the U.S., is slowing.  Almost 

all national economies are struggling to grow.



<p>Accordingly, world markets for commodities are glutted.  Workers are 

increasingly unable to buy what they make.



<p>The wealth that the labor-power of workers creates is being taken more and 

more by wealthy non-workers.  Their drive to take more of this wealth is 

constant in a capitalist economy.



<p>At the same time, a major “why” of the domestic steel story is being 

underreported in big circulation newspapers.  That story is the dollar’s 

overvaluation, which is making imports of foreign steel cheaper than steel 

produced in the U.S.



<p>“The fact that the dollar is 20-30 percent above its sustainable level 

effectively subsidizes foreign imports by 20-30 percent relative to 

domestically produced steel,” noted economist Dean Baker.



<p>A Mar. 4 article in The Guardian headlined “EU threatens trade war over 

steel” looked away from the dollar’s role, as did articles in the Mar. 4 and 

Mar. 6 New York Times and Mar. 6 Los Angeles Times.  What’s at stake is that 

the high dollar cuts two ways.



<p>On one hand it hurts U.S. manufacturers in the world market.  On the other 

hand, the overvalued dollar attracts foreign investors to U.S. soil.



<p>Foreign lenders are a key part of the American economy.  The Bush 

administration well knows this, but doesn’t say much about it in public.



<p>U.S. consumers and companies rely on credit-driven consumption.  Private 

debt has driven the nation’s record economic expansion, but may (not) be 

able to spur a recovery from recession.



<p>At any rate, Japan is one of those foreign investors in the U.S. economy.  

That nation, with the world’s second-largest economy, is also a target of 

the steel tariffs approved by the president.



<p>In addition, Japan is the world’s second-leading steel producer.  The 

nation’s main trading partner is America.



<p>On his recent trip to Asia, Bush stopped first in Japan.  There, he chided 

the nation in part for its bad bank loans.



<p>The president then visited China and urged the country to practice free 

trade.  The U.S. government is pushing China, a new member of the World 

Trade Organization, to open its domestic markets to foreign firms.



<p>Are open markets and free trade for other nations, not the U.S., the world’s 

only superpower?



<p>It’s been written that history moves through the resolution of 

contradictions.  The political economy of the world steel market is a 

contradiction whose resolution remains to be seen.
