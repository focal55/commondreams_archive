<p>Last week, the Arab American Institute (AAI) and Americans for Peace Now (APN) 

<a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines02/1122-01.htm">released a joint 

public opinion poll</a> of Jewish and Arab Americans' attitudes toward Israeli-Palestinian 

peace. 

<p>Roughly 87 percent of Jewish Americans and 97 percent of Arab Americans 

surveyed agreed that Israelis and Palestinians alike have the right to live 

in secure and independent states.  When polled about the likely details of 

such a two-state solution, including the evacuation of most Israeli 

settlements from the West Bank and Gaza, implementation of a right of return 

for Palestinian refugees to the new Palestinian state, and sharing Jerusalem 

as the capital of both states, support remained high with 52 percent of 

Jewish Americans and 79 percent of Arab Americans favoring such a 

compromise.



<p>In addition to revealing that our two communities are more moderate and less 

fanatic on Middle East-related issues than people are often led to believe, 

the survey results also send a clear message to our decision-makers that 

Jewish and Arab Americans want to see the United States follow policies that 

will encourage the Israeli-Palestinian peace process rather than detract 

from it.  The results also raise some key questions that must be addressed 

both among and between the Jewish and Arab communities in this country.



<p>First, if Jewish Americans overwhelmingly support the establishment of a 

Palestinian state and a majority of them say they would support the terms of 

a just and lasting peace, then why is the Jewish American establishment 

pursuing an anti-peace agenda?  For the past two years, as Palestinians have 

fought for their right to live in an independent state free of a foreign 

military occupation, the overtly racist, anti-Palestinian rhetoric of these 

organizations has become even more shrill.



<p>Instead of supporting steps toward peace, the Jewish American establishment, 

headed by the America Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) and the 

Council of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, has actively 

sought to punish the Palestinian Authority through Congressional legislation 

designed to limit its ability to engage in diplomacy, as well as through 

attempts to suspend U.S. and U.N. humanitarian aid to the Palestinian 

people.  This fundamental disconnect between the leadership of the Jewish 

American community and its grassroots demonstrates how this establishment is 

less interested in being representative than it is in advancing actions that 

demonize and hurt Palestinians.



<p>Second, if both Arab and Jewish Americans seem to agree on the path toward a 

just and lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians, then why is there 

so little cooperation between the organizations charged with representing 

our respective communities?  Although the teamwork between AAI and APN that 

brought about this survey is commendable, unfortunately it represents an 

exception rather than the rule.  Both Jewish and Arab organizations, along 

with the grassroots of both communities, need to make a redoubled effort to 

work together and send a powerful message to both our decision-makers in the 

United States and to Israelis and Palestinians that peaceful co-existence is 

possible based on mutual respect and acknowledgment of full and equal 

rights.



<p>Third, if there is indeed so much convergence of views on Middle East peace 

between our two communities, then why are the interests of Jewish and Arab 

Americans often portrayed as being inexorably at odds?  This misconception 

often leads decision-makers into the dangerous trap of believing that U.S. 

foreign policy in the Middle East is a zero-sum game in which the positions 

they adopt will necessarily alienate one or the other community.  Most 

politicians are under the false impression that in order not to upset their 

Jewish American constituents, they have to adopt a blatantly one-sided 

position that strictly aligns U.S. foreign policy with Israel’s military 

occupation of the Palestinian people.  The AAI-APN poll shows the falsity of 

thinking in zero-sum terms and should signal to politicians that they can 

support a balanced foreign policy – which caters to the needs and 

aspirations of both Israelis and Palestinians – and still enjoy the support 

of both their Jewish and Arab constituents.



<p>Fourth, if Arab and Jewish Americans are supportive of a just and lasting 

peace between Israelis and Palestinians, then which special interests are 

responsible for preventing the United States from adopting a balanced 

foreign policy toward the conflict?  As it stands today, U.S. foreign policy 

unconditionally supports Israel’s occupation of the Palestinians 

economically, diplomatically, and militarily.  Not only is the Jewish 

American establishment advocating for the continuation of this injustice, 

but they are backed by the fundamentalist Christian Zionist lobby and the 

arms industry, each of which have ulterior motives in supporting policies 

that have nothing to do with the well-being of either Israelis or 

Palestinians.



<p>It is time for politicians in this country to cast aside the special 

interests and listen to the grassroots of their Arab and Jewish 

constituencies, along with the vast majority of all Americans who want to 

see a lasting peace finally take hold in the Middle East.  When this 

happens, we will have an example of a healthy, functioning, representative 

democracy combined with a morally sound foreign policy.
