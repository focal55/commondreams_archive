<p>I feel nothing but sympathy and concern for Noelle Bush. Her latest stumble 

on the rocky road to recovery -- being caught with crack cocaine at a drug rehab 

center -- shows that she is in desperate need of help. 

<p> As a parent, I can also easily empathize with the anguish Noelle's father, 

Florida Governor Jeb Bush, must be experiencing. And I'm in total agreement with 

his insistence that his daughter's substance abuse problem is "a private issue." 

<p> But when I think about the heartless stance the Governor has taken toward 

the drug problems of those less-fortunate and well-connected than his daughter, 

my empathy turns to outrage. 

<p> While Noelle has been given every break in the book -- and then some -- her 

father has made it harder for others in her position to get the help they need 

by cutting the budgets of drug treatment and drug court programs in his state. 

He has also actively opposed a proposed ballot initiative that would send an estimated 

10,000 non-violent drug offenders into treatment instead of jail. I guess what's 

good for the goose, gets the gander locked away. 

<p> Of course, Jeb's wildly inconsistent attitude on the issue -- treatment and 

privacy for his daughter, incarceration and public humiliation for everyone else 

-- is part and parcel of the galling hypocrisy that infects America's insane drug 

war on every level. 

<p> The latest example of this madness is last week's early morning DEA raid on 

a medical marijuana club in Santa Cruz, Calif., that caters to terminally ill 

patients. Although the hospice-style operation has been lauded by local law enforcement 

officials for its caring and ethical approach, federal agents stormed the place 

with guns drawn and chainsaws whirring -- leveling its pot garden, handcuffing 

ailing patients (including a paraplegic), and carting off its founder and director, 

Valerie Corral, a woman who has been called the Florence Nightingale of the medical 

marijuana movement. 

<p> So much for the Bush administration's compassionate conservatism. And its 

conservative consistency. Back when he was running for president, candidate Bush 

declared that medical marijuana is a states' rights issue. "I believe," he said, 

"each state can choose that decision as they so choose." Although the mangled 

syntax makes it a little hard to tell exactly what the President was getting at, 

is it consistent with allowing John Ashcroft to order a holy-roller war against 

cannabis clubs in California, even though it is one of twelve states that have 

decriminalized the use of pot for medical purposes? 

<p> Surely there has got to be a better use of our limited law enforcement resources 

than busting grievously ill cancer and AIDS patients searching for relief from 

their suffering. How about unearthing a terrorist cell or two? 

<p> And the White House continues to bombard us with those offensive -- and expensive 

-- TV spots implying that youthful drug users like Noelle Bush are the moral equivalent 

of Mohammed Atta. Maybe her Uncle George can get her an audition for the next 

round of taxpayer-funded ads. Show her pulling some crack out of her shoe while 

saying, "I helped blow up buildings." 

<p> Or does that kind of overheated and stigmatizing rhetoric only apply to those 

other, non-Bush-family youthful drug users? After all, a glaring double standard 

has been a hallmark of our nation's drug policy for decades. It's why African 

Americans make up only 13 percent of the country's drug users but 55 percent of 

those convicted of drug possession and 74 percent of those sent to jail on possession 

charges. And why the youthful indiscretions of the rich are routinely treated 

with a slap on the wrist and a ticket to rehab while poor kids are shipped off 

to prison. 

<p> If America's drug laws were applied consistently, Jeb Bush and his family 

would be evicted from their publicly-funded digs, just as people living in public 

housing can be thrown out of their homes if any household member or guest is found 

using drugs -- even if the drug use happened someplace other than in the housing 

project. And Noelle could find herself joining the tens of thousands of young 

people unable to get a college education because of a provision in the Higher 

Education Act that denies financial aid to students convicted of possessing illegal 

drugs. 

<p> But the rich and powerful are judged by a very different set of rules. That’s 

why the staff at Noelle's rehab center tore up a sworn statement incriminating 

Noelle even though the facility's standard policy is to turn all such matters 

over to the police. 

<p> If, through her pain, Noelle Bush can help open her family's minds as well 

as their hearts and force them to rethink their disastrous drug policy, the nation 

-- and millions of young Americans in particular -- will owe her a tremendous 

debt of gratitude. 

<p> I wish her much luck.</p>
