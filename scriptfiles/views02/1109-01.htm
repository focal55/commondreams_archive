<p><i> Forgive, O Lord, my little jokes on Thee<br>

And I'll forgive Thy great big one on me.<br>

</i>- Robert Frost,<i> In the Clearing </i> 

<P>When I realized that John Ashcroft was not just playing the ghoul as a Halloween 

joke, I was overcome with nostalgia for the halcyon days when Edwin Meese was 

the attorney general of the United States. 

<P>Readers will recall that Edwin Meese's selection generated a lot of controversy 

of a different sort from that accompanying Johnny Ashcroft's selection. The controversy 

was attributable to the fact that Mr. Meese led what seemed, to some, to be a 

charmed life and to others a life filled with moral turpitude. 

<P>Following his nomination it was disclosed that he missed 15 consecutive house 

payments to the California bank that had given him a mortgage, an oversight that 

for a lesser man might have meant loss of the home. Instead the bank lent him 

an additional $20,000 so he could catch up on his payments. Thereafter, the bank's 

president became an alternate delegate to the United Nations and another officer 

was made Chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. One of Mr. Meese's friends 

lent him $70,000, forgave the loan and then became an Undersecretary of the Interior 

in the Reagan administration. As a result of these and other questions, there 

were extensive hearings concerning Mr. Meese's qualifications. He was confirmed. 

<P>What evoked nostalgia for Mr. Meese was seeing Mr. Ashcroft involve himself 

in determining who would get the privilege of trying John Muhammad and Lee Malvo, 

the boy and man accused of being the snipers who terrorized the Washington, D.C. 

area for most of October. His involvement was not precipitated by his eagerness 

to make sure that they would have the best chance of receiving a fair trial, about 

which he cares little, but to make sure they would have the best chance of receiving 

the services of death penalty, about which he cares a great deal. 

<P>Although the two men accused of the murders have not yet been tried and accordingly 

have not yet been found guilty, and, accordingly, are not yet ripe for punishment, 

Mr. Ashcroft wanted to make absolutely sure that when the time comes, they would 

be in a jurisdiction where Death Penalty would be permitted to participate in 

the proceedings. (Death Penalty counts Mr. Ashcroft as one of its closest friends 

even though Mr. Ashcroft professes to be a very devout Christian. To the non-Christian, 

it is an unending puzzle as to why certain Christians have such enthusiasm for 

putting others to death.) 

<P>Montgomery County, Maryland, is where the shootings started and ended. Maryland 

was home to more victims than any other jurisdiction and Douglas Gansler, a state's 

attorney, felt that Maryland was the "most appropriate place for the healing to 

begin." Maryland, however, has imposed a moratorium on the death penalty and, 

in addition, has executed only three people in the last 25 years. Death Penalty 

and Mr. Ashcroft did not want the accused tried in a state so hostile to Death 

Penalty. To avoid that possibility, Death Penalty and Mr. Ashcroft put their heads 

together and came up with a splendid idea. 

<P>Mr. Ashcroft caused the Justice Department to file charges of extortion against 

both men. A federal statute provides that if a death occurs in connection with 

the crime of extortion, the crime is murder and Death Penalty is permitted to 

participate in the proceedings, a result Mr. Ashcroft finds highly appealing. 

Not content to wait for a trial before letting folks know what the sentence should 

be, Mr. Ashcroft told reporters that federal charges were appropriate because 

"I believe that the ultimate sanction ought to be available here." He might have 

added, "assuming the men are guilty." Indeed, it would not have been inappropriate 

for Mr. Ashcroft to have given a judge and jury the opportunity to convict the 

men before spending a lot of time telling the world what kind of punishment would 

be appropriate. 

<P>Mr. Ashcroft is not Death Penalty's only friend. Virginia is an even better 

friend and some of the murders occurred in that state. Virginia has executed 86 

people since the death penalty moratorium was lifted in 1976. Death Penalty was 

silently rooting for Virginia for another reason. The federal government does 

not permit the execution of minors even if their crimes are, as the sniper shootings 

were, particularly heinous. Virginia has no such compunction. Four minors have 

been executed in that state in the last three years. 

<P>Death Penalty was sitting at the table with Mr. Ashcroft and Virginia prosecutors 

as they decided how to proceed with the case. Not present at the table was the 

state of Maryland. One Maryland official said his understanding was that "our 

death penalties are not strong enough." As Mr. Gansler explains: "The fact that 

we're not even at the table is very disappointing, but there's not a lot we can 

do about it." He was right. Virginia got the privilege of trying the two men because, 

as Mr. Ashcroft triumphantly explained, Virginia has: "the best law, the best 

facts and the best range of available penalties." 

<P>Muhammad's federal public defender in Maryland, James Wyda, said: "It seems 

to be that the attorney general decided to allow the rate of execution to determine 

where justice will be sought in this case. The government's clumsy, macabre forum 

shuffle for the cheapest and easiest way to obtain the death penalty against my 

client diminishes the system of justice." He got that right. 

<P>It is sad for the country that Mr. Ashcroft was playing the ghoul in real life. 

It would have been better as a Halloween prank.
