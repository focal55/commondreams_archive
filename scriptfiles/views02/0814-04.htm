<p> Even from my office in Ghana, it was clear that the recent U.S. decision to 

cancel this year's contribution to the United Nations Population Fund had nothing 

to do with China's abortion policies and everything to do with politics.

<p>But that didn't stop my blood from boiling. How could one man--albeit the U.S. 

president--so easily wager human lives and human hopes for short-term political 

gain? This decision does nothing about China's population policies. It doesn't 

help the women of the world who need access to prenatal care, family planning 

or other reproductive health services. This decision doesn't help those most vulnerable 

to HIV/AIDS. The only person helped by this decision is President Bush.

<p>People say the decision was motivated by a desire to placate the Christian 

right and those who oppose family planning in the United States. How can a decision 

that will leave women and children to die be called "Christian"? This decision 

will undermine and erode established and new reproductive health-care programs 

in 140 countries, including some of the poorest in the world.

<p> The only possible results are those the Bush administration claims it wants 

to prevent: unwanted pregnancies, unsafe abortions and increased dangers for mothers 

and infants. At a time when the world has finally begun to grasp the devastating 

scale and pervasiveness of the AIDS pandemic, this decision could not be more 

irresponsible.

<p>Today, 40 million people are living with HIV/AIDS; some 14,000 more become 

infected each day. Ninety-five percent of these people live in the developing 

world, and it's precisely in these locations that the United Nations Population 

Fund seeks to expand its programs.

<p>As an African living in Ghana, not a day goes by that I can forget about this 

disease, the toll it's taking on my people or how it is ravaging my continent. 

I am sad for the children of Africa--11 million of whom have been orphaned by 

AIDS. In high-prevalence countries in sub-Saharan Africa, at least one-third of 

all boys now age 15 will die of AIDS before their 35th birthday. The future of 

this continent is dying.

<p>The population fund offers a beacon of hope in this otherwise gloomy picture. 

It has strong relationships with governments and local organizations; the agency 

is known, respected and trusted by the people it helps. Its programs are also 

cost-effective.

<p>In less developed countries, a dollar or two is enough to buy some medicine, 

pay for a medical visit or supply contraceptives for three months or more. Sometimes 

it's enough to save a life. Of course, the $34 million being withheld by the United 

States may seem insignificant to a nation that spends $100 billion a year on fast 

food. Regrettably, the decision also marks another step backward for the U.S. 

on international family planning overall.

<p>Nearly a decade ago, I chaired the main committee at the International Conference 

on Population and Development in Cairo, where leaders of the world promised to 

help make universal access to family planning and other reproductive health services 

a reality for all people.

<p>The international community is still little more than halfway toward the spending 

goals set for 2000 at that conference. Only four countries--the Netherlands, Denmark, 

Sweden and Norway--have met or achieved their "fair share" of the target funding. 

The United States trails by far.

<p>There is word that the U.S. Senate is working on language for next year's budget 

that will not only restore funding to the population fund but increase it to $50 

million. This would be the right thing to do. I hope Congress and the American 

people will indeed restore funding and make clear to the president how unacceptable 

his decision is.</p>
