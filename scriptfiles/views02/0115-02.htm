<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->QUICK. Name the public official who uttered these words of wisdom:

<p> "Nobody buys a guaranteed result, nor should they ever. They should get a respectful hearing ..."

<p> And who said this? "It happens every day. It's not uncommon for people to receive phone calls ... But I want to remind you that communication is not a wrongdoing."

<p> And this: "It is perfectly appropriate and a time-honored tradition for cabinet members to talk to supporters."

<p> Now for the answers.

<p> The first quote is from former President Bill Clinton, who was, back in 1997, trying to explain how it could possibly come to pass that big contributors to his party and his campaign might think they could get a sympathetic ear from administration officials.

<p> The second two explanations are from the spokesman for the Bush White House, Ari Fleischer. But only the first of Fleischer's comments was made as the Enron imbroglio began unfolding.

<p> His other gem, about how it's "perfectly appropriate" for members of the Bush cabinet to grant special access to big contributors, was uttered last May. Fleischer was, at the time, trying to explain why it was just fine for Vice President Dick Cheney to host a reception at his official residence for $100,000 donors to the Republican Party. And why, in connection with a spring fund-raising blitz, members of the party's "Inner Circle" of heavy-hitting donors were promised face time with members of the cabinet who just happen to oversee their businesses.

<p> The more things change, the more things don't.

<p> The political subplot to the story of Enron, the giant energy company that collapsed, burying its employees and average shareholders beneath the financial rubble, is old and worn. Megabucks donor - in this case, the biggest lifetime financial patron of President George W. Bush - tries to call in the chits with phone calls to, say, a friendly cabinet member or two.

<p> The White House insists no action was taken on the company's behalf. At the moment, none has surfaced. But years of prosecutorial and congressional investigation into Clinton-era fund-raising never turned up a clear policy quid pro quo. Even the deal that looked nastiest - the Interior Department's denial of an American Indian casino application that involved contributors paying up in their bid to block the casino - was a dud. An 18-month probe by an independent counsel turned up no cash-for-action connection.

<p> What's bought and sold in Washington isn't necessarily policy. It's access to people who shape it. There is no way to tell whether the Bush administration's energy policy is a smorgasbord of favors to the oil industry and advocates of energy de-regulation because Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay and his staff promoted the company's agenda in private meetings with Cheney. This generous buffet might well have been laid out for the industry anyway.

<p> The only certainty is that Lay was on the inside. The owner of your neighborhood filling station was not. That is the nub of it.

<p> The tinny echo we hear now is the customary defense of the indefensible. Republicans point out that Democrats as well as Republicans received contributions from Enron and its executives. This is the everybody-does-it defense. It often was heard from Harold Ickes, the former Clinton White House aide who once jauntily testified that "if you give enough money to Republican senators, you'll get access, too."

<p> True then, true now.

<p> Everything that was true then is true now. Rich donors still give millions to politicians and parties in unregulated soft-money contributions. A company boosts its influence by having individual executives donate, and by giving not just to campaigns but to related causes. Enron and Lay each ponied up $100,000 to finance Bush inaugural festivities.

<p> What was true then about campaign finance reform is true now. It's stuck in Congress, blocked by the House Republican leadership, which refuses to let the measure come to the floor for a vote.

<p> Of course, some things have changed, as Cheney aide Mary Matalin pointed out on Don Imus' show the other day: "They act like there's some billing records or some cattle scam or some fired travel aides or some blue dress."

<p> She's right, there's none of that. There is just the familiar stench of money and politics. And thousands of ordinary people who've lost everything.
