<p>Want a snapshot of working life today in the U.S.? Private-sector employers 

have cut employees’ work hours and given them more work, the New York Times of 

August 10 reported. 

<p>American workers’ productivity for the second-quarter of this year grew by 

an annual rate of 1.1 percent versus 8.6 percent for the first-quarter, according 

to the Labor Department. Productivity is the measure of a worker’s output per 

hour. 

<p>Productivity increases profitability. So why are workers laboring more intensely 

as productivity has decreased? 

<p>The Financial Times of August 9 noted that the decline in the rate of workers’ 

productivity was “another indication that the economic recovery has lost steam.” 

Employers’ profits are being squeezed by the slowdown, so they, in turn, are squeezing 

their employees more intensely. 

<p>It’s a contradictory trend. This is what I mean. 

<p>When employers try to boost productivity by cutting employees’ hours (and salaries), 

this leaves workers with less take-home pay. Yet their consumer spending accounts 

for two-thirds of the nation’s economy! 

<p>On one hand, increasing labor productivity boosts the bottom line for private 

firms. On the other hand, workers’ buying power depends on their earnings. 

<p>With reduced income, workers buy less. It’s a stressful situation for many. 

<p>Some of these workers are single-mothers rearing kids while working for wages 

in retail stores. Others are male manufacturing workers whose hours are being 

cut as their firms move factories abroad, which Hollywood dramatized in “John 

Q.” 

<p>Meanwhile, employees who remain wage-earners after employers’ cost-cutting 

have less room to demand better working conditions or more pay. Strikes are risky 

to workers, who need steady wages to pay for food, rent and transport. 

<p>Then there’s the fear of unemployment. To keep employees less militant, there 

are jobless workers, “the reserve army of the unemployed,” in an old German’s 

famous phrase. 

<p>Welfare reform has also forced many new workers into the labor market. The 

ranks of the jobless are expanding as the U.S. economy slows down. 

<p>Workers being squeezed to work faster respond in various ways. For example, 

some work through their breaks and meal times. 

<p>Also feeling the squeeze are some small business people. They self-exploit 

themselves by working long hours to keep from being driven to the wall by competitors. 

<p>Stress on the job makes for stress away from work. Family and friends suffer 

in ways big and small. 

<p>To relieve their stress, some workers abuse alcohol. It’s cheap and plentiful. 

<p>On a related note, there is a constant change in technology to boost workers’ 

productivity. This spurs economic growth (profitability), as Fed Chief Alan Greenspan 

and the business press have noted. 

<p>“Interest in the productivity numbers is more intense than it used to be because 

so much of America’s spectacular boom in the late 1990s was attributed to spectacular 

productivity gains—mainly, it was thought, reflecting the rapid pace of technological 

development in computers and telecommunications,” the London Economist of August 

9 reported. 

<p>Technical change in the production process defines a market economy. This helps 

to force employers and employees to keep pace or fall by the wayside. 

<p>Author Ellen Meiksins Woods terms this part of the ”market imperative.” One 

of its goals is to constantly increase labor productivity. 

<p>This compulsion to improve productivity rules the work world and society generally. 

In her view, the rhetoric of market opportunity voiced by politicians and pundits 

is false. 

<p>Compulsion is one thing. Opportunity is entirely different. 

<p>Think of how employers compete against each other for market share and profits. 

Meanwhile, workers compete against each other for employment. 

<p>Against this backdrop, the legitimacy of profits—given the accounting fraud 

recently flowing from corporate America—shouldn’t distract us from the nature 

of the market system. It has nothing to do with honesty, contrary to what President 

Bush recently told the nation. 

<p>He did, though, make capitalism the subject. So it should be. 

<p>Just ask millions of working Americans laboring at the point of production. 

Under capitalism, they’re living the productivity/profitability squeeze as U.S. 

economic growth lags.
