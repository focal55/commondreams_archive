<p>THE MARKET is self-regulating. It isn't perfect, it sometimes is clumsy, it sometimes takes time to correct its mistakes, it can be brutal at times. But like nature, it will always come back into balance eventually.

<P></P>

This is the mantra, the dictum, the overarching thought that has dominated our economic system for about two decades since the arrival in power of Ronald Reagan in the U.S. and Margaret Thatcher in Britain, and, simultaneously, the development and promulgation of the creed of neo-conservatism. From it flows our principal contemporary economic policies, from tax cuts to deregulation to privatization to free trade to minimal government.

<P></P>

It is also a lot of hokum. It is by no means wholly hokum. The market does have important self-regulating characteristics. Consumers can be fooled by glitzy, shoddy goods, or by hype and marketing, but not for long: The word gets around. Firms that shortchange their customers or employees may make quick, easy profits, but after a brief pause will pile up losses.

<P></P>

What is hokum is the notion believed in by neo-conservatives (with the same absolutist fervour that Marxists once espoused their nostrums) that the market is <i>inherently </i>self-regulating.

<P></P>

To paraphrase the well-known dictum about democracy: The market is self-regulating for some people all of the time and for all of the people some of the time, but not for all of the people all of the time.

<P></P>

This is the message that has been sent out loud and clear by the current outpouring of corporate scandals. By, in particular, the contrast between the stock option fortunes of Enron executives and the bankrupt pension plans of Enron employees; by the private descriptions — "crap," "junk," "piece of shit"— by Merrill Lynch analysts of stocks that they were hyping to the public without disclosing that Merrill Lynch had a corporate interest in those stocks; by the contrast between the $88 million U.S. collected by Nortel CEO John Roth at the same time as Nortel and its stock were collapsing at a severe cost to stockholders and employees.

<P></P>

And on and on and on, down to the $365 million U.S. personal loan the WorldCom CEO took out from his company — was every member of his board of directors asleep, or were they all just thinking about their own stock options? — as his company was folding into bankruptcy.

<P></P>

The message expressed by all these discoveries is that while the market is indeed self-regulating, some — essentially, the insiders — can escape its corrections by squirrelling away their money before these turn-arounds happen while ordinary people will either benefit not at all, or very little, very late, from the market's eventual correction.

<P></P>

The visible hand of government thus is needed to compensate for what the marketplace cannot achieve by itself.

<P></P>

Accept that premise, though, and the whole, now dominant ideology of tax cuts, deregulation, privatization, and minimal government becomes suspect.

<P></P>

Not entirely. All are useful tools to stimulate the economy. But the burden of proof about applying them has suddenly shifted.

<P></P>

As one example of the kind of rethinks that have become possible, if many incomes are the product of greed and the use of inside information rather than of entrepreneurship and risk-taking, why cut taxes as incentives for entrepreneurship and risk-taking? 

<P></P>

As another example, the entire ethos — pro-market, anti-government — of the Bush administration (the most pro-corporate in American political history) has been put into question by the discovery that the California power crisis to which it responded by calling for more deregulation was in fact the product of artificial shortages concocted by Enron and other energy companies.

<P></P>

The neo-cons have lost the edge of moral superiority they possessed while joyously attacking big government and big unions. They suddenly look dated.

<P></P>

They are acutely aware of this. <i>Business Week </i>magazine has just run a hand-wringing cover story about corporate excesses, as if surprised by them. <i>The Economist </i>magazine's current lead editorial describes CEOs as "Fallen Idols." Here, the National Post has been running a series of frantic articles titled "Let the Markets Prevail," essentially arguing, "CEOs of the world unite, you have nothing to lose but your stock options."

<P></P>

We aren't going to go back to the dependence on government of the '60s and '70s. But dependence on corporations to ensure both economic growth and, through the self-regulatory capabilities of the market, rough justice and equity for all, has now been exposed as a delusion.

<P></P>

It's been exposed, essentially, as regulation by crony capitalists. The alternative of regulation by politicians and by officials appointed by them isn't perfect. But at least we can periodically heave the rascals out. Or, in Canada, we can at least shout at them.
