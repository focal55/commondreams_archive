<p>WE AMERICANS find ourselves in the extraordinary position of witnessing our 

government's slow but certain movement toward a major war with Iraq. 

<P>Such open maneuvering, with clear statements of intention from the Bush administration, 

the leaking of war plans from the Pentagon, and the acquiescence of Congress, 

could not have happened when US power was balanced, and therefore checked, by 

the Soviet Union, nor when that power was mitigated by Washington's regard for 

world opinion. Now the only conceivable check on the sole superpower is the will 

of its own people, manifest through politics, which is why we must urgently take 

up the subject. 

<P>It can be agreed that Saddam Hussein is a danger to his neighbors, an enemy 

to his own people, and a threat to world peace. But on <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views02/0721-02.htm">this 

page last Saturday</a> the former chief UN weapons inspector in Iraq, Scott Ritter, 

expressed grave skepticism about the Bush contention that Hussein so threatens 

the United States with weapons of mass destruction that war is justified. </P>

<P>Ritter proposed congressional hearings to ''ask the Bush administration tough 

questions'' about its purposes. Here are some questions that occur to me:</P>

<P>Having lived with Hussein as a mortal enemy for more than a decade, is the 

urgency of replacing him now a result less of real evidence of increased threat 

than of the ''us versus them'' mind-set that drives the war on terrorism? Is the 

cause of war something Hussein is doing, or is it something we are imagining?</P>

<P>Does the bellicosity of the Bush administration eliminate the alternatives 

to war? For example, ''containment and deterrence,'' which worked against the 

Soviet Union and have so far worked against Hussein, depend on the cooperation 

of other nations. Is Bush's chest-thumping war talk, even short of actual invasion, 

destroying that cooperation?</P>

<P>When the US goal shifts from one of moderating Hussein's behavior to the openly 

expressed purpose of ''regime change,'' what does Hussein have to lose? And when 

Hussein knows an invading US force is surely coming, does he not have to ''use 

or lose'' whatever weapons he has? Isn't Washington forcing him to respond with 

his worst?</P>

<P>What effect would a major American war against Iraq have on the broader conflict 

between Islam and the West? If Al Qaeda grew out of the humiliations attached 

to the Gulf War, what would grow out of the new humiliation of a massive US imposition 

on Iraq, including the necessity of a long-term occupation by the United States?</P>

<P>What is the relationship between the urgent American project in Iraq and the 

staggering lack of American interest in the worsening Israeli-Palestinian crisis? 

Is Bush using the former problem as an excuse to avoid grappling with the latter 

one? How is it in Israel's interest to invite Hussein to unleash his Scuds again? 

And what is the hope for improved US-Arab relations so long as Palestinians are 

left in misery?</P>

<P>What does it say about the United States that we are about to become a ''first-strike'' 

nation? Abandoning multilateralism, have we abandoned diplomacy as well? Is war 

no longer a last resort, taken in self-defense, but a routine method of getting 

our way, since no one can stop us? Has the time come for us to reverse the National 

Security Act of 1947 and go back to calling the ''Defense Department'' the ''War 

Department?''</P>

<P>Would a war against Iraq, with its risk of inflaming the ''clash of civilizations'' 

and its likely weakening of ties between the United States and our allies, make 

our nation more vulnerable to terrorist attacks? If the only real way to track 

down Al Qaeda and prevent future attacks is through the very multilateralism that 

the Bush war would weaken, isn't Bush still enacting the script written by Osama 

bin Laden?</P>

<P>What does a longer view of warmaking tell us? Recalling that Hussein began 

as an American client, as bin Laden did, when we were fighting other wars, isn't 

he an argument for finally breaking with the myth that war solves more problems 

than it creates? If we came to that conclusion, wouldn't other forceful ways of 

resisting Hussein's tyranny emerge? And in the long run, who is to say they would 

not be far more effective?</P>

<P>The obvious difference between Iraq and the United States is that this nation 

is a democracy. That means that we US citizens are responsible for the behavior 

of George W. Bush in ways that the people of Iraq are not responsible for Saddam 

Hussein. There is good reason to believe that Bush, in his highly personal, irrational, 

and thoroughly Manichaean campaign against Hussein, has set the very world on 

a course toward disaster. No one can change that course but us.</P>
