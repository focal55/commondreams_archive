<p> Back in January, when the Enron

scandal threatened to ensnare the Bush

Administration, White House press secretary

Ari Fleischer bragged to NBC's Tom Brokaw

after a hard day of managing the news. "Did you

notice all the Enron stuff that everybody was

asking about? Look what made it on the air --

the business-scandal side of it."



         <p>Fleischer had succeeded in burying the political-scandal side of the story, and it was a remarkable professional achievement in the world of spin. Here was an Administration that was locked in "a carnal embrace" with Enron: President, Vice-President, top economic and political advisers, Secretary of the Army, US Trade Representative -- and more. But the political fallout was barely registering.



         <p>Now Fleischer's magic, and President

Bush's teflon coating, may finally be fading.

The discovery that there were numerous

warning signs leading up to the massacre of

September 11, that went unheeded, could mark

the beginning of a Great Unraveling.



         <p>The Bush Administration and its allies

have shamelessly exploited September 11 to get

what they want, from mountains of new pork at

the Pentagon to Fast Track authority for

negotiating new foreign commercial

agreements. The latter passed the House by one

vote last December, after a threat from House

speaker Dennis Hastert: "This Congress will

either support our president -- who's fighting a

courageous war on terrorism and redefining

American world leadership -- or it will undercut

the president at the worst possible time."



         <p>They have been quick to question the

patriotism of their opponents, and it has worked.

The Democratic leadership was cowed into

silence, which gave President Bush very high

approval ratings -- they remain at 76 percent.

Many observers attribute these results to the

"War Against Terrorism," but this is

exaggerated. A public that hears only praise and

no criticism will predictably answer "yes" to

pollsters who ask whether the President is doing

a good job.



         <p>This unfortunate dynamic has

encouraged a President who couldn't get a

majority of the popular vote to govern as though

he had won an overwhelming mandate from the

electorate.



         <p>Vice President Dick Cheney has lashed

out hard at his critics, calling their actions

"thoroughly irresponsible and totally unworthy

of national leaders in a time of war."



         <p>But it's not working any more. The

Democrats softened their rhetoric, but Senate

majority leader Tom Daschle is still demanding

that an independent commission be set up to

investigate what our government knew and did

before September 11.



        <p> The Bush Administration has been less

than forthright about what was known about

possible attacks, and when it became known.

For example, National Security Adviser

Condoleeza Rice told reporters last week that

US intelligence officials were focused on

overseas threats in the months prior to

September 11. But according to the Washington

Post, a secret briefing memo presented to

President Bush on August 6 -- headlined "Bin

Laden Determined to Strike in U.S.," -- was

focused on attacks within the United States.



         <p>Meanwhile, Senator Joseph Lieberman

is threatening to subpoena White House officials

for information on their contacts with Enron

officials. And there is yet another scandal in the

making, over the role of the Administration in

supporting the military coup last month against

the democratically elected President of

Venezuela.



         <p>This is currently under internal

investigation at the State Department and

Pentagon, and Senate hearings could follow.

Lest anyone think that foreign policy scandals

don't have legs, recall that the Iran-Contra

investigation came close to toppling the Reagan

presidency in 1987. Ironically, two of the

suspects in the Venezuelan coup are re-treads

from Iran-Contra: Assistant Secretary of State

Otto Reich, and National Security Council

official Elliot Abrams, who was convicted of

lying to Congress.



         <p>The Bush administration may survive all

of these challenges and more. But once the

teflon is gone, its whole agenda could very well

collapse. Most Americans are concerned with

bread and butter issues, such as prescription

drug costs, health insurance, and education --

issues for which this Administration offers them

nothing. Cheney's vision of a war without end, a

replacement for the Cold War that will justify

any overseas military adventure -- Iraq,

Somalia, Colombia -- appeals to the national

security establishment and some private sector

beneficiaries. But it won't attract many voters.
