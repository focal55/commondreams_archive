<p>The Enron scandal-followed by revelations about World Com and other corporate 

        shenanigans-has produced a lot of instant experts who for the first time 

        are actually finding fault with the ethics of the nation's biggest enterprises. 

      <p>For Tony Mazzocchi this must seem a strange turn of events. For decades, 

        Mazzocchi has sounded the alarms about corporate power and its damaging 

        effect on the well-being of low, moderate and middle income families. 

        For the most part, the media-and certainly the Republican and Democratic 

        parties-have taken a see no evil, hear no evil attitude about the performance 

        of the corporate giants which dominate the economy. Six years ago in Cleveland, 

        Ohio, Mazzocchi was the prime mover behind the formation of the Labor 

        Party. Under Mazzocchi, the Labor Party has been a strong voice for progressive 

        causes ranging from universal health care to worker safety and civil rights. 

      <p>Mazzocchi's creation is a growing national organization made up of international 

        unions and hundreds of local unions and AFL-CIO Councils and community 

        organizations. Mazzocchi is blunt in his criticism about the deleterious 

        effect of the unchecked power of corporations. 

      <p>"We have witnessed an industrial and social meltdown advanced by and 

        for corporate and moneyed interests," he said recently. 

      <p>Mazzocchi isn't any kinder in his evaluation of the performance of the 

        major political parties. In his view both the Democratic and Republican 

        parties "have failed working people." He sees the parties as too timid 

        in facing the nation's problems. 

      <p>The Labor Party is specific about the failure of politicians to face 

        national problems. Here are some of the Labor Party's often-stated criticisms: 

      <ul>

        <li>Our decades-old health care crisis continues. More than 44 million 

          people lack access to health care and premiums for health care continue 

          to rise. </li>

        <li>The wave of corporate mergers and acquisitions across national boundaries 

          has continued unchallenged, and as a result, the nation is facing a 

          growing concentration of global corporate power. </li>

        <li>The price for the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA): 400,000 

          jobs lost and 40 percent real wage drop for Mexican workers. </li>

        <li>Rights guaranteed to all citizens-freedom of speech, of assembly and 

          association-are not fully available to American workers under the restrictive 

          anti-labor Taft-Hartley Act. As a result, the nation has the smallest 

          proportion of private sector workers covered by union contracts of any 

          western democracy. </li>

      </ul>

      <p>The Labor Party has not run candidates for public office. Instead, it 

        has focused its efforts on generating debate on the issues that affect 

        working people. And Mazzocchi hopes that the Labor Party's constant drumbeat 

        will force the major parties to take up the causes of working families 

        despite the parties' long and profitable links to corporate movers and 

        shakers. 

      <p>While that may seem an optimistic goal to many, certainly the Enron and 

        Enron-like scandals have provided credibility to the efforts of Mazzocchi 

        and others who have sought to rein in corporate excesses and free up resources 

        to meet critical social and economic needs. While Mazzocchi has never 

        spared the tough words, he and his Labor Party often exude a positive 

        attitude about the future. A recent Labor Party publication described 

        its vision of America in this manner: 

      <blockquote>

        <p>"An America where everyone who wants to work has a job at a living 

          wage, where laws protect our rights to organize and strike, where the 

          wealthy and corporations pay their fair share of taxes, where quality 

          health care is a right and where solidarity puts an end to bigotry." 

        </p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>In six short years, Mazzocchi has positioned the Labor Party and its 

        allies to reach for these goals. And now-thanks to a greedy band executives--a 

        few more people understand what Mazzocchi is talking about when he warns 

        about the dangers of a nation and a political system which allows corporations 

        to usurp the power and rights of the people in a democracy.
