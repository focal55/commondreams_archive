<p>WITH PUBLIC support for war against Iraq flagging in the U.S. in recent weeks, 

the Bush administration was clearly hoping the 9/11 anniversary would be just 

the thing to get war fever back on track. 

<P></P>

Certainly, the media could be counted on to do its part to whip the citizenry 

into a frenzy of grief and rage, thereby rousing the American people to wage war 

on a country that apparently had nothing to do with 9/11, but at least offers 

a target that can be located. 

<P></P>

The manipulation of grief to stoke enthusiasm for battle is, of course, nothing 

new. It was used in Iran in the '70s by fundamentalist Muslim clerics to drum 

up support for their fledgling movement. Whenever dissidents were killed by the 

Shah's brutal forces, the clerics held elaborate funeral ceremonies to further 

stir emotions and enlist recruits to fight the Shah and his backers in Washington. 

The clerics' strategy was highly effective — and they didn't even have CNN at 

their disposal. 

<P></P>

This is worth remembering as we contemplate the media frenzy of the past week 

that has helped turn the bloodbath of 9/11 into a staging ground for endless war. 

<P></P>

Certainly, the U.S. media have greatly helped the White House make its case. When 

tracking down Osama bin Laden proved too difficult, the Bush administration switched 

its focus to "regime change" in Iraq. The media have followed this turn in the 

plot without question, highlighting Saddam's use of chemical weapons against his 

own Kurdish population — an atrocity that receives far more media attention now 

than when Saddam was still a U.S. ally. 

<P></P>

The U.S. media also acts as a filter, preventing incorrect ideas from slipping 

through. 

<P></P>

As Antonia Zerbisias <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views02/0912-02.htm">noted 

in The Star last week</a>, CNN and MSNBC hosts have smeared Scott Ritter, former 

head of the U.N. weapons inspection mission in Iraq, who blames Washington for 

the mission's breakdown. TV hosts have openly questioned Ritter's loyalty as an 

American, indicating the media have taken on the function once performed by the 

McCarthy Committee on Un-American Activities. 

<P></P>

Certainly, criticizing Washington these days leaves one vulnerable to the charge 

of anti-Americanism. With its demands for blind, unquestioning loyalty, and talk 

of good and evil, the world's only superpower seems to be increasingly taking 

on the characteristics of a cult. 

<P></P>

Above all, the U.S. media have filtered out anything that could lead viewers to 

question why so many people around the world feel such bitterness toward Washington. 

<P></P>

When George Bush, soon after 9/11, provocatively raised the question: "Why do 

they hate us so?" it seemed inevitable the media would start examining some possible 

reasons, such as the long history of U.S. interventions in the Middle East, Southeast 

Asia and elsewhere. 

<P></P>

Instead, the media pretty much accepted Bush's explanation that those who hate 

the U.S. are simply jealous of its freedoms — an explanation that might be satisfying 

but delusional, like a girl convincing herself other girls hate her because she's 

pretty, when it might be because they think she's a jerk. 

<P></P>

Even after a full year of media "analysis" of 9/11, Americans still have little 

knowledge of brutal U.S. foreign interventions — amply documented by Noam Chomsky 

and other scholars — or the enormous power and wealth imbalances in the world 

that Jean Chrétien usefully observed last week. 

<P></P>

How could Americans have such knowledge, when their media, following the White 

House script, consistently present U.S. actions abroad as well-meaning efforts 

to bring democracy to other parts of the world, rather than aggressive attempts 

to advance U.S. economic and political power. 

<P></P>

So nobody thinks part of the story is missing when Bush vows to finish "what our 

enemies have begun." As far as the public knows, everything started with 9/11. 

Out of the blue, people came to hate the U.S. for its freedoms. No one else ever 

experienced the kind of pain and suffering Americans did on 9/11. 

<P></P>

Back in 1991, when the beating of Rodney King by Los Angeles police officers was 

captured on video, some commentators objected that the video didn't tell the whole 

story, didn't capture King being abusive to the police beforehand, provoking their 

fury. But was that the whole story either? If King was abusive, what abuses had 

he been subjected to over the years as a black man in America? Where does the 

story begin? Where does the rage start? 

<P></P>

Crimes, of course, should be punished, no matter what their causes; the perpetrators 

of 9/11 must be hunted down and brought to justice. 

<P></P>

But if we really want to understand why such things happen — and how to protect 

ourselves in the future — it seems counterproductive to block out all information 

that might be helpful. It's unproductive, that is, unless the goal is to make 

sure nothing changes.
