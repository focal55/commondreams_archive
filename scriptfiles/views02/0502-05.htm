<p> As I watch and read the news, I rarely see an African-American point



of view on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. I hear one member of



Congress after another offering unequivocal support for the policies of



Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. But some members of the



Congressional Black Caucus have a different view. They provide balance



to the current debate on U.S. Mideast policy.



 



      <p>African Americans bring a unique perspective. Some members of the



black community feel a sense of kinship with the Jewish community. The



biblical struggle of the Jews resonates with religious African



Americans. And members of an older generation remember the cooperation



between blacks and Jews during the civil-rights movement.



 



      <p>Other segments of the black community identify with the plight of the



Palestinians under Israeli occupation. Palestinians, not unlike African



Americans, are the underdog. They are the "blacks" of the Mideast,



living under poor, segregated and oppressive conditions.



 



      <p>And it does not escape the memory of some that Israel was a close ally of South Africa under apartheid, a major supplier of arms to the white



minority regime.



 



      <p>"Many of us here in the United States have long been concerned about



reports by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch that reveal a



pattern of excessive, and often indiscriminate, use of lethal force by



Israeli security forces in situations where Palestinian demonstrators



were unarmed or posed no threat of death or serious injury to the



security forces or to others," Rep. Cynthia McKinney, D-Ga., recently



declared. "As long as the occupation continues, bloodshed will continue



and increase." Recently, McKinney attended a rally in Washington, D.C.,



calling for an end to the Israeli occupation.



 



      <p>Other members of the Congressional Black Caucus are also speaking out. "The Palestinians have a right to have a state, and the Israelis have a right to safety and security; neither of these goals can be achieved



with a military solution," says Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Calif.



 



      <p>Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., the veteran civil-rights activist and former



chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, advocates a



more active U.S. role in brokering a political solution. A colleague of



the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., Lewis says King "knew that both



peoples were subject to laws passed with the particular intent of



oppressing them simply because they were Jewish or black. He knew that



both peoples have been subjected to oppression and genocide on a level



unprecedented in history."



 



      <p>At the protest in Washington on April 20, McKinney said: "We, as the



world's most powerful nation, have a responsibility to act in defense



of the weak and to protect them from harm. We failed in Rwanda, we



failed in Srebrenica, we failed in East Timor, and now as we speak, we



failed in Jenin."



 



<p>As the world waits to see how many Palestinians were killed in the



West Bank town of Jenin, some lawmakers on the Hill are proposing a



resolution to show their solidarity with Israel. Congress should listen to the courageous voices of the Black Caucus before it rubberstamps Sharon's brutality.
