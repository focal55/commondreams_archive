<p>Sixty-five thousand people and more than 100 heads of state, including Prime 

Minister Jean Chr&#233;tien, have come together to assess the promises made 10 

years ago at the Rio Earth summit and confront the fact that our planet is on 

the brink of environmental collapse. Yet already many activists are dubbing the 

World Summit on Sustainable Development &#34;Rio minus 10,&#34; instead of the 

hoped for &#34;Rio plus 10,&#34; in anticipation of a major sellout by our governments 

and the United Nations.</P>

<P>This sellout takes several forms. First, U.S. President George W. Bush (who 

is not in attendance) has instructed his negotiators to roll back two key principles 

agreed to by his father in the Rio framework: an international commitment to both 

the Precautionary Principle, whereby governments are supposed to err on the side 

of caution where there is the danger of environmental harm, and to an understanding 

that powerful nations of the industrialized North -- who played the biggest role 

in causing a problem -- should take the lead in addressing it.</P>

<P>As well, the U.S. government remains steadfastly opposed to any ceremony that 

would bring the Kyoto Protocol on climate change into effect at the summit. And 

the United States is touting what Mr. Bush calls a new &#34;global Marshall Plan&#34; 

-- the Millennium Challenge Account. The plan would tie aid only to those nations 

that open their economies to unregulated U.S. trade and investment.</P>

<P>Secondly, the United States, Canada and Europe are working hand in glove with 

the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization 

to subsume environmental and development agendas into their larger agenda of economic 

globalization, which includes unlimited growth, free trade, liberalized investment, 

privatization and a reduced role for government. The UN is being pressured to 

adopt as its overarching framework the text that came out of the WTO's ministerial 

meeting in Doha, Qatar, last December. The text contains, among other anti-environmental 

provisions, the clarification that WTO rules trump multilateral environment agreements 

and offer up &#34;environmental services,&#34; including water, to the control 

of the market.</P>

<P>It is crucial to remember that in the 10 years since Rio, globalization has 

made powerful inroads. World output has risen by 50 per cent, with trade and investment 

driving economic growth. Only three years after Rio, the WTO was created with 

binding enforcement rules ready to quash the soft and unenforceable promises made 

there. Together with the World Bank and the IMF -- in a holy trinity overseeing 

globalization -- the WTO has now hijacked the UN and the summit agenda.</P>

<P>The final threat lies with the transnational corporations that are poised to 

take advantage of this government retreat. Through the Business Action for Sustainable 

Development -- an amalgam of business created in part by the International Chamber 

of Commerce -- transnational corporations are working to block efforts to frame 

a regulatory mechanism to govern their activities. They are poised to take advantage 

of &#34;private-public&#34; partnerships being offered by the UN at the summit, 

and especially want access to the lucrative services sectors of water, energy 

and health.</P>

<P>One looming fight at the summit will center around the world's declining freshwater 

resources. As Fortune magazine says, &#34;Water promises to be to the 21st century 

what oil was to the 20th century -- the precious commodity that determines the 

wealth of nations.&#34;</P>

<P>On one side will be the WTO, the World Bank, First World governments and the 

huge water transnationals, arguing that the only way to save water will be to 

put it in private hands and sell it like energy on the open market.</P>

<P>On the other side will be international environmentalists, public-sector workers 

and human-rights groups working with local South African activists who insist 

that water is a fundamental human right that must be maintained as part of the 

global &#34;commons.&#34; This is a life-and-death issue in this country. Since 

the African National Congress adopted World Bank privatization plans, more than 

10 million South Africans have had their water turned off because they cannot 

afford the newly privatized water.</P>

<P>The setting of the summit tells the story. Government, WTO and corporate delegates 

gather in the lavish hotels and convention facilities of Sandton, the fabulously 

wealthy Johannesburg suburb that houses huge estates, English gardens and swimming 

pools, and has become South Africa's new financial epicenter.</P>

<P>At the same time, activists will gather in places such as nearby Alexandra 

township, a poverty-stricken community where sanitation, electricity and water 

services have been cut and which is divided from Sandton only by a river so polluted 

that it has cholera warning signs on its banks.</P>

<P>The summit presents an unparalleled opportunity to stop the Earth's ecological 

decline. Alas, other interests are at play. What will Canada's delegation do?
