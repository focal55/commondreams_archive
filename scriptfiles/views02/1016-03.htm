<p>WASHINGTON -- The bitter battle between Republicans and Democrats to control 

Congress in next month's election is too close to call.</p>

<p>Political leaders are predicting victory for their own parties, but independent 

experts simply shrug their shoulders when you ask them to forecast the outcome.</p>

<p>For instance, Charlie Cook, who publishes the Cook Report on politics, says 

that if the voters decide that the election is about the economy, "then expect 

the Democrats to catch a break in the close races on Nov. 5." But he adds, "If 

voters place a premium on supporting their commander in chief, then Republicans 

will likely catch the late breaks and win a disproportionate share of the closest 

races."</p>

<p>And President Bush? War and terrorist worries have not tied him down in Washington 

in the run-up to the election. He is off to more than 20 states in the next three 

weeks, campaigning for Republicans in a marathon that will keep him on the road 

more than he will be at home.</p>

<p>He has headlined 63 Republican fund-raisers so far and racked up $141 million 

for the party coffers. Together, he and Vice President Dick Cheney have brought 

in more than $158 million, far overshadowing the Democrats' measly take of about 

$92 million.</p>

<p>Bush sees his politicking as crucial because, as pollster John Zogby says, 

the election outcome is "about as close as you can get" with some races "razor 

thin."</p>

<p>Republicans now control the House by six votes, and Democrats hold the Senate 

by one. The GOP also commands the nation's statehouses with 27 governors to the 

Democrats' 21. (There are two independents.)</p>

<p>Democratic National Chairman Terry McAuliffe says he thinks his party will 

pick up two to three Senate seats but he is not optimistic about capturing the 

House. He says only that it would be "tough but doable."</p>

<p>McAuliffe, however, is exuberant about Democratic chances in the gubernatorial 

races, saying, "We're ahead in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, Illinois, 

Michigan, Arizona, New Mexico, Tennessee and Kansas."</p>

<p>And he predicts Democratic challenger Bill McBride "is going to beat" Gov. 

Jeb Bush in Florida. But no one doubts that Jeb's brother, the president, will 

be trying to ride to the rescue with another appearance in Florida.</p>

<p>Jim Dyke, a Republican Party spokesman, says the GOP thinks it has "a real 

opportunity" to regain the Senate and "we feel good about our position in the 

House."</p>

<p>With many races so close, he adds, the Republicans are sending hundreds of 

volunteers around the country to join door-to-door, grass-roots efforts to get 

out the vote.</p>

<p>Dyke says the Republicans have a good chance to win Senate races in Missouri, 

South Dakota, Minnesota, Georgia and New Jersey. In addition, he says, "We're 

working hard in North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas and Arkansas."</p>

<p>Republican hopes soared when Bush zoomed in like a laser beam in recent weeks 

to put the country on a war footing against Iraq. He was following the script 

laid out last January when Karl Rove, his chief political adviser, sent a memo 

to GOP operatives telling them that they would ultimately be playing the "war 

card."</p>

<p>According to published reports, Bush deliberately withheld his frontal rhetorical 

assault on Iraq's Saddam Hussein until closer to the election. The New York Times 

quoted White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card as saying: "From a marketing point 

of view, you don't introduce new products in August."</p>

<p>The recent focus on Iraq has pushed all the other issues into the background, 

including the weak economy, the corporate misdeeds, the shaky stock market, the 

high cost of prescription drugs and the Republicans' hope of privatizing the Social 

Security system.</p>

<p>But now that Congress has given Bush nearly all he wanted on his war-with-Iraq 

resolution, the Democrats are trying once more to make the economic slowdown the 

No. 1 issue.</p>

<p>McAuliffe says that on his trips around the country, he has found people are 

worried about joblessness and a possible recession. He notes that since Bush took 

office, 2 million people have lost their jobs and that even before the 9/11 terrorist 

catastrophe, the president had wiped out the budget surplus and dipped into the 

Social Security trust fund. "This is the worst economic slump since Herbert Hoover," 

McAuliffe charges.</p>

<p>Zogby reports that two-thirds of likely voters say they are worried about dwindling 

retirement funds in their 401(k) and IRA accounts.</p>

<p>That's why Republican and Democratic candidates find themselves coping with 

the "politics of disappointment," he says. According to Zogby, people are not 

only disappointed in the economic malaise but also in the disgrace of many priests 

and corporate CEOs, the frustrating war on terrorism, and the FBI and CIA dropping 

the ball in their intelligence departments.</p>

<p>"It all has come home to roost," he concludes.</p>

<p>I hope the Democrats at least retain control of the Senate. Congress' Iraq 

resolution gives Bush too much power and the country needs a Senate that can provide 

some checks on his headlong drive into war, his favor-the-rich economic policy 

and his campaign to put right-wing ideologues on the Supreme Court. Otherwise, 

we will have an imperial presidency with nothing but a genuflecting Congress and 

a me-too Supreme Court.</p>
