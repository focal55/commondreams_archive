<p>Would you die for your job? 

<P></P>

Unless you're a soldier, firefighter, police officer or rescue worker, chances 

are your answer is no. 

<P></P>

On Sept. 11, 2001, we learned a lot about those who put their lives on the line 

every day. For once we saw that heroism wasn't about some pretty boy play-acting 

on the big screen for millions of dollars, while lesser-paid stuntmen took the 

risks. We also saw that heroes are not steroid-pumped goons with big fat endorsement 

contracts for over-priced athletic gear made for pennies by those less fortunate. 

<P></P>

But, for all the media tributes to those who sacrificed themselves on 9/11, there 

was far less attention paid to their salaries, health issues &#8212; or how former 

mayor Rudy Giuliani, who himself has achieved God-like status, short-changed their 

departments so much that their communications systems failed them on that fateful 

day. 

<P></P>

Typical. It doesn't fit with the media celebrity myth-making program. 

<P></P>

But last year was not a particularly good for journalists, either. 

<P></P>

According to the international pressure group Reporters Without Borders, 31 journalists 

died on the job last year, eight of them while covering the war in Afghanistan. 

<P></P>

Another 110 were thrown in jail, an increase of almost 50 per cent over 2000 &#8212; 

mostly thanks to how many countries used the threat of terrorism to abrogate civil 

liberties, including press freedoms. 

<P></P>

Sitting here in my ergonomically correct chair, the target of nothing worse than 

nasty emails, I have enormous admiration for colleagues who risk their lives for 

the truth. And you needn't look very far to find examples. 

<P></P>

Just a few years ago, ace crime reporter Michel Auger was shot up in a Montreal 

parking lot, apparently by the thugs he covers. 

<P></P>

Still, we have it so good here. 

<P></P>

Last month, Reporters Without Borders published a list of 139 countries, ranked 

according to how much press freedom they have. Canada placed fifth, just behind 

Finland, Iceland, Norway and the Netherlands. We would have ranked higher if journalists 

didn't have to grapple with police at demonstrations &#8212; or face proprietors 

who slap them with gag orders, as CanWest Global did at The Montreal Gazette. 

<P></P>

Interestingly, the U.S. ranked 17th. 

<P></P>

It doesn't help the American press freedom cause when the White House tries to 

keep networks from airing video from Al-Jazeera, the so-called "Arab CNN," or 

when the Pentagon refuses access to prisoners being held in Cuba or to troops 

in Afghanistan. But the U.S. also ranked so low because its journalists are being 

jailed for refusing to reveal their sources on stories. 

<P></P>

Which is something we ought to watch for here. The National Post is being pressured 

by the RCMP to give up documents that could implicate Prime Minister Jean Chrétien 

in a loan scandal. Last week, police seized videotapes of an interview conducted 

by CTV's <i>W-Five </i>&#8212; even before the report was aired. 

<P></P>

Tomorrow night in Toronto, journalists will gather at a downtown hotel for the 

International Press Freedom Awards, sponsored by the Canadian Journalists For 

Free Expression. 

<P></P>

The honourees include: 

<ul>

<li>Lira Bayseitova, who exposed government corruption in her native Kazakhstan. 

She paid a horrific price: the life of her 25-year-old daughter Leila who died 

in police custody last June. They said she was a heroin addict who hung herself. 

But a subsequent investigation, including a blood test, revealed no drugs &#8212; 

but a lot of bruising consistent with a vicious beating.</li>

<li>Ahmed Abdisalam Adan, Mohamed Elmi and Ali Shamarke, three Somali-Canadians 

who returned to their war-torn native country to establish HornAfrik, a modern 

and independent radio and TV network that airs the only reliable information there.</li>

<li>The Star's Kathleen Kenna, who was critically injured in Afghanistan. Kenna, 

who is still on leave, has won the Tara Singh Hayer Award, which goes to a Canadian 

journalist. </li>

</ul>

<P></P>

HornAfrik's Elmi, 46, says he is no hero. He's just a businessman who brought 

"state of the art broadcasting" and impartial journalism to the country of his 

birth. 

<P></P>

"What was happening was warlords were bombarding hate-mongering into society," 

he told me on the phone from Ottawa, where he owns two restaurants. "So we changed 

that, and hopefully contributed to the society." 

<P></P>

Elmi maintains Canadians need to appreciate how great we have it here: "A lot 

of people don't know how lucky they are in expressing themselves, in writing or 

in demonstrating," he remarked. "Somebody can disagree with you, or say it is 

wrong or maybe even illegal. But nobody harasses you, nobody intimidates you, 

nobody shoots at you, nobody imprisons you and nobody beats you up." 

<P></P>

Yet another thing for which we must stand on guard.
