<p>CARACAS --  "Where are they

getting their money?" asks historian Samuel

Moncada, as the television displays one opposition

commercial after another. Moncada is chair of the

history department at Central University of

Venezuela in Caracas. We are sitting in one of the

few restaurants that is open in the eastern, wealthier

part of Caracas.



<p>For two weeks during this country's

business-led strike, the privately owned stations that

dominate Venezuelan television have been running

opposition "info-mercials" instead of

advertisements, in addition to what is often non-stop

coverage of opposition protests.



<p>"I am sure there is money from abroad,"

asserts Moncada. It's a good guess: prior to the coup

on April 11, the U.S. National Endowment for

Democracy stepped up its funding to opposition

groups, including money funneled through the

International Republican Institute. The latter's

funding multiplied more than sixfold, to $340,000

in 2001.



<p>But if history is any guide, overt funding

from Washington will turn out to be the tip of the

iceberg. This was the case in Haiti, Nicaragua,

Chile, and other countries where Washington has

sought "regime change" because our leaders didn't

agree with the voters' choice at the polls. (In fact, Washington is currently aiding efforts to oust President Aristide in Haiti -- for the second time). In these episodes, which extended into the 1990s, our government concealed amounts up to the hundreds of millions of dollars that paid for such things as death squads, strikes, economic destabilization, electoral campaigns and media.



<p>All this remains to be investigated in this

case. But the intentions of the U.S. government are

clear. Last week the State Department ordered non-

essential embassy personnel to leave the country,

and warned American citizens not to travel here.

But there have not been attacks on American

citizens or companies here, from either side of the

political divide, and this is not a particularly

dangerous place for Americans to be.



<p>In this situation, the State Department's

extreme measures and warning can only be

interpreted as a threat. The Bush Administration has

also openly sided with the opposition, demanding

early elections here. Then this week Washington

changed its position to demanding a referendum on

Chavez's presidency, most likely figuring that a

divided opposition could easily lose to Chavez in an

election, despite its overwhelming advantage in

controlling the major means of communication.



<p>The discussion in the U.S. press, dominated

by Washington's views, has also taken on an

Orwellian tone. Chavez is accused of using

"dictatorial powers" for sending the military to

recover oil tankers seized by striking captains. Bush Administration spokesman Ari Fleischer urged the Venezuelan government "to respect individual rights and fundamental freedoms."



<p>But what would happen to people who

hijacked an oil tanker from Exxon-Mobil in the

United States? They would be facing a trial and a

long prison sentence. Military officers who stood

outside the White House and called for the

overthrow of the government (and this just six

months after a military coup supported by a foreign

power) would end up in Guantanamo facing a secret

military tribunal for terrorism.



<p>In fact, the U.S. press would be much more

fair if it held the Venezuelan government to the

standards of the United States. In the U.S.,

government workers do not have the right to strike

at all, as Ronald Reagan demonstrated when he

summarily fired 12,000 air traffic controllers in

1981. But even this analogy is incomplete: the air

traffic controllers were striking for better working conditions. Here, the employees of the state-owned oil company -- mostly managers and executives -- are trying to cripple the economy, which is heavily dependent on oil exports, in order to overthrow the government. In the United States, even private sector workers do not have the legal right to strike for political demands, and certainly not for the president's resignation.



<p>In the United States, courts would issue

injunctions against the strike, the treasuries of

participating unions would be seized, and leaders

would be arrested.



<p>Meanwhile, outside of the wealthier areas of

eastern Caracas, businesses are open and streets are

crowded with shoppers. Life appears normal. This

is clearly a national strike of the privileged, and

most of the country has not joined it.



<p>More than anything right now, this country

needs dialogue and a ratcheting down of the

tensions and hostilities between the two opposing

camps, so as to avoid a civil war. But this dialogue

will never happen if the United States continues to

pursue a course of increasing confrontation.
