I'm fluent in two tongues -- English and Ebonics. But my mother took the English-only approach in her classroom, which was any room that me and her ... I mean, any room that <i>she </i>and <i>I</i> happened to be in at the same time.

<p>Whenever she heard me say, "I ain't got no ...," my mother would counter with, "No, Sean. It's 'I don't have any.'"</p>

<p>So all credit goes to Mom for instilling in me a sense of the importance of words and the power of clear expression. Can't claim to be an English master, but I do pay careful attention to language, especially political language -- not for the sake of linguistics, but for the purpose of truth-seeking.</p>

<p>Another thing my mother alerted me to is the power of perception.</p>

<p>"Sometimes perception is everything," she is fond of saying. Mother's wit.</p>

<p>Why do you think they changed the name of the War Department to the Department of Defense? The popular perception, right or wrong, is war is hell and therefore bad. But defense (as in self-defense) is good and is rooted in our biology to boot. Of course, they also say the best defense is a good offense.</p>

<p>So let's face it: It's becoming more and more difficult to discern truth in politics. Remember what our government's top lawyer, Solicitor General Theodore Olson, told the Supreme Court in March?</p>

<p>He said U.S. officials have a right to lie. "It's easy to imagine an infinite number of situations where the government might legitimately give out false information," he said.</p>

<p>Couple that with the prevailing view of Attorney General John Ashcroft that any critical assessment of the Bush administration is tantamount to aiding and abetting the terrorists, whoever they are, and we've got one helluva predicament.</p>

<p>What's a fella to do? Read George Orwell's essay, "Politics and the English Language" over and over again? "One ought to recognize that the present political chaos is connected with the decay of language, and that one can probably bring about some improvement by starting at the verbal end," he wrote.</p>

<p>"If you simplify your English, you are freed from the worst follies of orthodoxy. You cannot speak any of the necessary dialects, and when you make a stupid remark its stupidity will be obvious, even to yourself."</p>

<p>"Political language -- and with variations this is true of all political parties, from conservatives to anarchists -- is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind," he warned.</p>

<p>Maybe it is tilting at windmills, but when Olson declared the government's right to lie, I declared the citizens' duty to be skeptical of official statements.</p>

<p>But for the faint-hearted who subscribe to the philosophy, "If you can't beat 'em, join 'em," this column is for you too. I point you in the direction of Stuff magazine, whose May issue features an article called "169 Lies You Can Tell."</p>

<p>The front cover has a picture of a woman in a bikini and, as if that isn't inducement enough to buy the magazine, the reader is enticed with an in-this-issue teaser -- "The Liar's Bible: 400 fibs you can get away with." That's a lie itself because the article only contains 133 suggested fibs.</p>

<p>"Whether you're at a party, in court or just giving directions to an elderly woman, it pays to lie every chance you get. Why? Because liars live six years longer than non-liars," the article says.</p>

<p>Here's a few of my favorite Stuff lies:</p>

<p>

<li>"My parents participated in that famous Masters and Johnson sex survey. Dad still won't talk about it."

<p>

<li>"My father was at that bank the day Patty Hearst robbed it."

<p>

<li>"Twice a year, when the tides are just right, you can walk from Alaska to Russia."

<p>Can you discern a lie from reality? As a fellow soldier in the battle to know the truth, I offer you this weapon of intellectual self-defense. It is an African proverb: "To ask well is to know much."</p>

<p>Instead of focusing on ready-made answers, pay attention to the important questions. It forces the inquirer to consider perspectives other than what is being spoon-fed by the ministers of propaganda.</p>

<p>Perhaps it's my "naiveté" or "youthful idealism" but, for the time being, I agree with Orwell: "One cannot change this all in a moment, but one can at least change one's own habits, and from time to time one can even, if one jeers loudly enough, send some worn-out and useless phrase ... into the dustbin where it belongs." Any nominations for Orwell's dustbin?</p>
