<p>Don't blame the poll workers in Florida. The facts, supported by voting machine 

experts and numerous newspaper articles, have made it clear. Computerized voting 

machines that were certified by the state of Florida, caused most of the problems 

in Florida's primary election. In the absence of paper ballots, the damage is 

now irreversible. 

<p>This was no accident. It's not new. And Florida is not alone. 

<p>"The concept is clear, simple, and it works. Computerized voting gives the 

power of selection, without fear of discovery, to whomever controls the computer," 

wrote the authors of VoteScam (1992), James & Kenneth Collier (both now deceased). 

It's a 'must read' book about how elections have been electronically and mechanically 

rigged in the United States for decades, and with the knowing and sometimes unknowing 

support of media giants and government officials, including... ironically... Janet 

Reno. 

<p>Only a few companies dominate the market for computer voting machines. Alarmingly, 

under U.S. federal law, no background checks are required on these companies or 

their employees. Felons and foreigners can, and do, own computer voting machine 

companies. Voting machine companies demand that clients sign 'proprietary' contracts 

to protect their trade secrets, which prohibits a thorough inspection of voting 

machines by outsiders. And, unbelievably, it appears that most election officials 

don't require paper ballots to back up or audit electronic election results. So 

far, lawsuits to allow complete access to inspect voting machines, or to require 

paper ballots so that recounts are possible...have failed. 

<p>As far as we know, some guy from Russia could be controlling the outcome of 

computerized elections in the United States. 

<p>In fact, Vikant Corp., a Chicago-area company owned by Alex Kantarovick, formerly 

of Minsk, Belorussia (also known as White Russia, formerly U.S.S.R.), supplies 

the all-important 'control cards' to Election Systems & Software (ES&S), the world's 

largest election management company, writes reporter Christopher Bollyn. According 

to ES&S, they have "handled more than 40,000 of the world's most important events 

and elections. ES&S systems have counted approximately 60% of the U.S. national 

vote for the past four presidential elections. In the U.S. 2000 general election, 

ES&S systems counted over 100 million ballots." 

<p>Getting back to Kantarovich, he would not disclose where the control cards 

are made, except they aren't made in America, writes Bollyn. Nor would he discuss 

his previous employment. Bollyn says he got some not-too-thinly-veiled threats 

from Kantarovich. 

<p>Kantarovich sounds more like the Russian mafia, than a legitimate businessman. 

<p>But the really big deal is this....all of ES&S's touch screen machines contain 

modems, "allowing them to communicate—and be communicated with—while they are 

in operation," reports Bollyn. That communication capability includes satellites. 

"Even computers not connected to modems or an electronic network can still be 

manipulated offsite, not during the election, but certainly before or after," 

says voting systems expert Dr. Rebecca Mercuri. 

<p>ES&S supplied the touch screens for Miami-Dade and Broward counties where the 

worst machine failures occurred. But the debacle was nothing new for ES&S. Associated 

Press (AP) reporter Jessica Fargen wrote in June 2000, "Venezuela's president 

and the head of the nation's election board accused ES&S of trying to destabilize 

the country's electoral process. In the United States, four states have reported 

problems with equipment supplied by the company. Faulty ES&S machines used in 

Hawaii's 1998 elections forced that state's first-ever recount." 

<p>Sequoia is another voting systems company that sends a cold chill down my spine. 

"Mob ties, bribery, felony convictions, and threats of coercion are visible in 

the public record of the election services company," according to investigative 

journalist and filmmaker Daniel Hopsicker, and reported in Spotlight.com. Hopsicker 

says that Pasquale "Rocco" Ricci, a 65-year-old senior executive with Sequoia, 

and the firm's Louisiana representative, recently pled guilty to passing out as 

much as $10 million dollars in bribes over the course of almost an entire decade." 

According to American Law Education Rights & Taxation (ALERT), Ricci is the president 

of Sequoia International, which also manufactures casino slot machines. 

<p>That's just great. Now, we could possibly have both the Russian mafia and the 

U.S. mafia involved in our elections. 

<p>In May 2002 Sequoia was bought by De La Rue, based in England. By their own 

estimate, De La Rue is "the world's largest commercial security printer and papermaker, 

involved in the production of over 150 national currencies and a wide range of 

security documents such as travelers checks and vouchers. Employing almost 7,000 

people across 31 countries, (De La Rue) is also a leading provider of cash handling 

equipment and software solutions to banks and retailers worldwide." And they develop 

technology for secure passports, identity cards, and driver's licenses. 

<p>Okay, add Dr. Evil to the mix and be on the look-out for international money 

launderers, drug kingpins, and Nazis. 

<p>The Shoup Voting Solutions of Quakertown, Pennsylvania, has a reputation for 

rigging elections, wrote the late co-author of VoteScam, Jim Collier. According 

to Collier, in 1979, Ransom Shoup II, the president of the firm, was convicted 

of conspiracy and obstruction of justice stemming from an FBI investigation of 

a vote-fixing scam involving the old-fashioned lever machines in Philadelphia." 

<p>These reports are just the tip of the iceberg. The numerous instances of U.S. 

voting systems error and fraud are documented in a 1988 report for the U.S. Commerce 

Department entitled, "Accuracy, Integrity, and Security in Computerized Vote-Tallying" 

by Roy G. Saltman, a computer consultant for the National Institute of Standards 

and Technology’s Computer Systems Laboratory. Many other experts and observers 

have been warning and complaining about these problems for decades. 

<p>But complaints, warnings, reports, and books like "VoteScam," haven't deterred 

government officials like Pinellas County (Florida) Commissioners Calvin Harris 

and County Judge Patrick Caddell. They told the St. Petersburg Times in October 

2001 that they were aware that all of the voting machine companies had "problems 

in their pasts." But, Harris said, "We have to look at this objectively and not 

get tied up into the emotions of, 'Some guy might be a crook." 

<p>Dear Commissioner Harris...when it comes to elections in America...assume crooks 

are in control...and then act accordingly.
