IT&#39;S A sad day for American democracy when the leaders of countries whose 

human rights records and democratic practices are as deeply flawed as those of 

Paraguay and Peru show more respect for democratic institutions and the rule of 

law than the U.S. government demonstrates. But that&#39;s what happened last weekend, 

after elements of Venezuela&#39;s military led a coup that briefly ousted the 

country&#39;s elected president, Hugo Chavez. 

<P> Mr. Chavez&#39;s return to office is a triumph for his country&#39;s embattled 

democratic institutions and for the popularly elected leaders who stood behind 

his government. But the affair was a black eye for the Bush administration, which 

strained U.S. ties to allies in the region by backing the coup and will now have 

little credibility as an advocate for democracy in the Americas. 

<P> After strikes and unrest forced Mr. Chavez out of office April 11, a so-called 

interim government headed by businessman Pedro Carmona imprisoned the elected 

president, arrested other top government officials, dismissed the National Constituent 

Assembly and supreme court and suspended the constitution that the nation&#39;s 

voters had endorsed just two years ago. The unrest apparently was organized by 

factions of the country&#39;s military and financial elites determined to oust 

Mr. Chavez. 

<P> Countries throughout the hemisphere quickly condemned the coup, with the sharpest 

denunciations from nations such as Paraguay, Argentina and Peru, which have endured 

great brutality under military dictatorships. The Organization of American States 

denounced &quot;the alteration of the constitutional order in Venezuela&quot; 

and refused to recognize the regime. 

<P> But the tone was very different in Washington. 

<P> The Bush administration refused to call a coup a coup. White House spokesman 

Ari Fleischer referred instead to &quot;a combustible situation in which Chavez 

resigned.&quot; The administration expressed support for Mr. Carmona as it unsuccessfully 

lobbied the OAS to tone down its criticism of his regime. 

<P> Indeed, a report by The New York Times that leaders of the coup recently met 

with senior Bush administration officials, who backed the Venezuelans&#39; belief 

that Mr. Chavez should be removed, will fuel rampant suspicions in Latin America 

that the Colossus of the North was behind the overthrow. 

<P> With its class-conscious rhetoric of social revolution and friendly relationships 

with Cuba and OPEC colleagues such as Iran and Iraq, the Chavez government long 

has been a thorn in President Bush&#39;s side. 

<P> Mr. Chavez&#39;s sometimes strident rhetoric and egotistical style have sharpened 

some of his nation&#39;s divisions. And as Venezuela&#39;s economy weakened over 

the last year under the weight of falling oil prices and questionable economic 

policies, Mr. Chavez&#39;s once-overwhelming popularity has waned, and unrest 

increased, in a country that is the third-largest exporter of oil to the United 

States. 

<P> While all of this is cause for concern, the intensity of the Bush administration&#39;s 

hostility to Mr. Chavez is unwarranted. 

<P> Although he&#39;s chummy with Fidel Castro, Mr. Chavez is no socialist. He&#39;s 

an economic nationalist whose economic policies are much more reminiscent of Juan 

Peron&#39;s Argentina than Mr. Castro&#39;s Cuba. 

<P> And Mr. Chavez didn&#39;t introduce class divisions to Venezuela. In fact, 

he was elected to address them. Despite the country&#39;s tremendous oil resources, 

more than 80 percent of Venezuelans are considered poor and many eke out marginal 

lives in the sprawling slums that surround the nation&#39;s cities. 

<P> Large majorities twice elected Mr. Chavez president, giving him a strong mandate 

to help the nation&#39;s poor and break the stranglehold of the two corrupt political 

parties that have dominated Venezuelan politics for decades. Despite his mistakes, 

Mr. Chavez remains a powerful symbol of hope for many of his nation&#39;s poor. 

And the democratic institutions the coup threatened are deeply valued, even by 

many in Venezuela and throughout Latin America who oppose Mr. Chavez&#39;s policies. 

<P> Peru&#39;s President Alejandro Toledo, who is no friend of Mr. Chavez&#39;s, 

explained his country&#39;s opposition to the coup like this: &quot;We are not 

defending the democratic characteristics of a particular government, we are defending 

the principle of the rule of law.&quot; 

<P> Most Americans might have thought the leaders of a country proud of its more 

than 200-year tradition of constitutional rule and eager to see itself as a beacon 

for democracy would respect such basic democratic principles. 

<P> But in the case of the Bush administration&#39;s policy on Venezuela, as in 

so many other cases in the blood-dimmed history of U.S.-Latin American relations, 

they would be sadly mistaken.
