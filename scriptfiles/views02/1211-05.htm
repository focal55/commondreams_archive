<p>The topic of Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz's speech Friday 

to the World Affairs Council and Commonwealth Club was "Building the Bridge to 

a More Peaceful Future." The peace envisioned by Wolfowitz is a "Pax Americana,

" where the United States pre-emptively annihilates any would-be regional or 

global challengers. It is a peace that can only be the product of endless war 

against the people of the world and brings to mind previous wars "to end all 

war" and "to make the world safe for democracy."

<P>As the main ideologue behind war on Iraq and the aggressive new doctrine of 

pre-emption and unbridled U.S. military supremacy, Wolfowitz is a key part of 

the inner circle of war planners in the Bush administration. For his extreme 

hawkishness, he has been dubbed "the velociraptor" by the conservative London 

Economist.

<P>Following Sept. 11, Wolfowitz wanted to go after Iraq first. But he was 

initially rebuffed, as there was no credible link between Iraq and al Qaeda. 

Bombing Afghanistan, however, could be positioned as a "just response" to the 

terrorist attacks. The velociraptor's too-candid gaffe about "ending states 

who sponsor terrorism" was a bit over the top. But following the rout of the 

Taliban and the "axis of evil" speech in January, "regime change" was to 

become openly embraced and espoused by President Bush himself, though it has 

been cosmeticized of late to "disarming Iraq" and making Saddam Hussein comply 

with U.N. resolutions.

<P>In fact, the war on Iraq and the new National Security Strategy of pre-

emption and global domination were not created in response to Sept. 11. The 

deaths of thousands of Americans on that day have been used as an opportunity 

to pursue plans that had been in the works since the early 1990s.

<P>The earliest incarnation of the doctrine of pre-emption was the draft 

Defense Planning Guidance written under the supervision of Wolfowitz for then-

Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney and President Bush "the father." It argued 

that with the collapse of the Soviet Union, U.S. policy should be to "prevent 

the emergence of a new rival" and use American military dominance to 

"establish and protect a new order."

<P>"We will retain the pre-eminent responsibility for addressing selectively 

those wrongs which threaten not only our interests, but those of our allies or 

friends, or which could seriously unsettle international relations," the draft 

states. U.S. intervention overseas would be "a constant fixture" of this 

policy. This came to be known as the Wolfowitz Doctrine.

<P>The leak of the draft DPG to the New York Times and the subsequent 

publication of excerpts from the document created a firestorm of criticism. 

The revised Defense Planning Guidance was sanitized and softened substantially.

<P>The doctrine was resurrected and further developed in 2000 in a document 

called "Rebuilding America's Defenses," published by the right-wing Project 

for the New American Century. It called for the United States to bolster its 

direct military role in the oil-rich and strategic Middle East rather than 

relying on surrogates. "The U.S. has for decades sought to play a more 

permanent role in gulf regional security. While the unresolved conflict with 

Iraq provides the immediate justification, the need for a substantial American 

force presence in the gulf transcends the issue of the regime of Saddam 

Hussein." Finally this year, the doctrine was enshrined as official U.S. 

policy in the National Security Strategy. But the potential human toll of 

thousands of Iraqi lives seems never to make it into the cost/benefit 

calculations of Wolfowitz. (See the Sept. 22 New York Times Magazine article 

"Sunshine Warrior," where only potential American deaths make it into the 

equation, and even then as something of an afterthought.)

<P>There are growing numbers of people who "believe that as people living in 

the United States it is our responsibility to resist the injustices done by 

our government, in our names." (from the peace group Not in Our Name's pledge 

of resistance). During the Vietnam War, President Lyndon Johnson and his top 

advisers could not appear in public without being confronted by those opposed 

to the war. Now, days or weeks before the outbreak on war on Iraq, phase II of 

the post-Sept. 11 war on terrorism, nothing less is required.

International Studies, where Paul Wolfowitz served as dean between the Bush administrations.</I>
