<p>Fresh out of college I worked at a facility for developmentally disabled adults. There was one endearing woman, Adele, who was sixty and brain 

damaged. Adele had some things together and many others not - her gait, 

her speech, her ability to comprehend why she was at this facility 

instead of with her family were all significantly compromised. I asked 

the keeper of records what had happened to her because in some ways she 

seemed to be close to regular functioning but still far enough away to 

make her life confused and troubled. I was told that Adele's brain 

damage happened at birth. A nurse, insisting that a doctor be present 

for the delivery, pushed the head of the baby back up the birth canal 

until the doctor arrived. This nurse, either intimidated or brainwashed 

or both, defied the powerful pressure of inevitable birth and corrupted 

the event and the creation. I believe we are living a version of Adele's birth.



<p>The steady evolution of our country and technology is under arrest. The 

evolution of both belongs to us and is our birthright and yet we are 

suffering a terrible and invisible blockade. What deranged hands are 

holding back the birth process? They must be identified and relieved of 

their custody before they're allowed do anymore damage.



<p>I remember a college professor in the seventies telling us that World 

War III will erupt over a substance that ruins our environment and 

destroys our health. His prediction is taking shape. Our evolution has 

been commandeered and the birth process of new technologies is being 

postponed to damaging effects. Our hope for not only survival but for 

some kind of transcendent living is to surf the wave of natural givens. 

The sun, the wind, the tide, the heat of the earth's core, the flow of 

water can't be metered and sold. They, like our evolution, are 

birthrights. Technology that harnesses and interprets those forces can 

be made and sold and that will forge a new kind of economy that will be 

less neurotic and volatile. But like the nurse with her hand on the head of an emerging newborn, the people holding the reins of power want to 

preserve the neurotic and volatile. They are content to spend our money 

to make more weapons to kill more people to protect the flow of the 

thing that will pollute our lungs, skin and shores, which in turn 

increases the rage that targets us which supposedly then makes it 

necessary to allocate more money to make more weapons. That's the logic 

- that's the thinking of Adele's nurse and the illegitimate president.



<p>The actual, provable or suspected interference with the dissemination of

 new alternative energy needs to be addressed. National security and the 

common good are interwoven with wind, solar, geothermal, tides, biomass 

and whatever yet undiscovered forms of energy that "surf the waves of 

natural givens." The rebuilt Ground Zero should be powered by everything

but the fossil fuel that created it. It should literally be the point of

embarkation for the energy that will move us away from the black hole 

that is pulling us to its center.



<p>The explosive fuel that has secured criminal profits out of criminal 

agendas needs to be retired. Let it and the people on the land under 

which it bubbles, rest. They have a right to their political evolution 

without interference from the world's unhealthy and now pathological 

appetite for a substance they happen to have been born on top of.



<p>The pursuit and demand for alternative non-combustible energy is sane, 

moral, healthy, exciting, fun and essential. What is the national budget

for research into the development of alternative energy? What is the 

cost of a B1 bomber? What are B1 bombers protecting? Not us. They 

protect the profits of transnational corporations who put the people in 

office who will continue to funnel funds to the same irrational and 

deadly cycle of bombing to protect "national interests" or "national 

security" or "the American people" or "our freedom" or...and the numbing

litany goes on. We have to create a government that knows our security, 

interest and freedom rests in our claiming our evolution and either our 

representatives are part of that evolution or they must be asked to 

leave the birthing room.



<p>Representatives should be nominated and elected based on their vision 

for renewable, progressive and sustainable energy. Companies domestic 

and foreign that develop this new world order should earn our 

investment. Incentives and government subsidization should be insisted 

upon. The government should collaborate with our houses and cars to help

them become part of the new millennium rather than fossils of a toxic 

past. Our greatest natural resource is our genius for invention - our 

passion for initiative and ingenuity. The technological evolution is 

ours and if we allow the mad midwives that have occupied the process to 

push back the birth of a new era, the damage will be real and lasting.
