<p>On April 8, Alfredo Zapata Herrera was on his way to

work at a cement factory when right wing

paramilitaries dragged him off a bus and killed him.

Zapata was a leader in the local construction workers'

union. The military and the police knew that he was

targeted for assassination, but did nothing to protect

him. He was the 45th union organizer killed in

Colombia this year. Six more have been killed since.

Three out of every four union organizers killed around

the world are killed in Colombia.



<p>Last year, 4,000 civilians were murdered for political

reasons in Colombia -- up from 1,187 in 2000. The vast

majority were killed by right wing paramilitaries

closely aligned with the Colombian military:

assassinated for speaking out for political and

economic justice, or massacred to scare their

neighbors into abandoning land coveted by oil

companies, cattle ranchers, or cocaine traffickers.

The U.S. and Colombian government circumvent human

rights restrictions that are supposed to prevent U.S.

military aid from going to military units linked to

the paramilitaries. According to Human Rights Watch:



<p>"The U.S. violated the spirit of its own laws [ . . .

] in order to continue funding abusive units.

Compelling evidence emerged, in particular, of ties

between paramilitaries and Colombian military units

deployed in the U.S. antinarcotics campaign in

southern Colombia, showing that U.S.-vetted, funded,

and -trained troops were mixing freely with units that maintained close ties with paramilitaries. This occurred in the case of the First and Second Counternarcotics Battalions. On their first joint deployment in December 2000, these battalions depended heavily on the army's Twenty-Fourth Brigade for support and logistical assistance, particularly with regard to intelligence, civic-military outreach, and psychological operations. Yet there was abundant and credible evidence to show that the Twenty-fourth Brigade regularly worked with and supported paramilitary groups in the department of Putumayo. Indeed, the Twenty-fourth Brigade hosted counternarcotics battalion troops at its facilities in La Hormigá a town where, according to witnesses, paramilitaries and Colombian Army troops were indistinguishable."



<p>The war has grown even bloodier in recent months since

the government broke off peace talks with

Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC,) the

larger of the country's two Marxist guerilla groups.

President Pastrana has declared 19 municipalities

"theaters of operation" under the country's new

security law - essentially imposing martial law in

these areas, giving the military broad impunity.

Escalation of the war against the guerillas serves to

cloak and legitimize the "dirty war" against

dissenters. Colombian human rights activist Hector

Mondragon writes:



<p>"Both the right and the guerilla are trying to impose

war. The strengthening of the movements of the left

for  peace could possibly resolve the conflict. This

is the possibility that the dirty war and

assassinations have tried to prevent."



<p>Guerilla violence provides a justification for the

further escalation of military/paramilitary violence.

And so the cycle continues.

 

<p>Things are about to get worse. On Sunday, Colombians

elected a new president, Alvaro Uribe, who has

promised to take a harder line against the FARC. Among

his proposals: doubling the size of the Colombian

military, and creating a network of one million

civilian intelligence operatives. The latter proposal

is especially frightening to human rights activists:

it has disturbing similarities to the "CONVIVIR"

program of the late 1990's that created armed civilian

patrols throughout the country. In the department of

Antioquia, where Uribe was governor at the time, the

CONVIVIR groups operated as thinly veiled fronts for

the paramilitaries. Uribe ignored repeated pleas from

Mayor Gloria Cuartas of Apatardo to intervene to stop

the groups from terrorizing her people.  By the end of

his term as governor, Uribe was boasting that the

labor unions in the banana growing region of Uraba

had been "pacified."  This "pacification" involved

3500 assassinations. Today, Uribe publicly condemns the paramilitaries, but he owes his overwhelming victory in part to "armed campaigning" by paramilitary groups that threatened to carry out massacres in villages that voted for another candidate.



<p>Uribe's victory was welcomed by the Bush

administration. The BBC reports that "Mr. Uribe was

without a doubt the favored candidate of the U.S."

And that "The U.S. Ambassador to Colombia, Anne

Patterson, went to Mr. Uribe's campaign headquarters

to congratulate him even before the final vote was

announced."



<p>To make matters worse, as part of the Emergency

Supplemental budget bill, the House voted last week to

allow the Colombian military to use U.S. funds designated for use in counternarcotics operations to

finance its war against the guerillas.



<p>Why the U.S. support? Another provision of the bill

hints at the real reason why the U.S. is involved in

Colombia: a $6 million down payment on a $98 million program to create a new Colombian army battalion to

protect an oil pipeline used by California based

Occidental Petroleum. Instability in the Middle East

is making Latin American oil more important to the

U.S. Earlier this year Ambassador Anne Patterson told

the Bogota daily newspaper El Tiempo that:



<p>"After Mexico and Venezuela, Colombia is the most important oil country in the region. After what

happened on September 11th, the traditional oil

sources for the United States (the Middle East) are

less secure . . . Latin America could not cover a

shortage, it could not supply (us) in a crisis, but it

allows a small margin to work with and avoid price

speculation . . . Colombia has great potential for

exporting more oil to the United States, and now more

than ever it is important for us to diversify our oil

sources."



<p>Increasing oil production in Colombia to meet U.S.

needs will inevitably require forcing more farmers and indigenous people off their land. Escalating the war achieves this end - as do crop fumigations, massacres and assassinations.



<p>The U.S. already has several hundred soldiers on the

ground in Colombia acting as "military advisors."

These soldiers are currently prohibited from engaging

in combat, but how long will that policy last if the

FARC kills one of them? The U.S. Is getting more

deeply involved in Colombia's war with no clear goals

and no  exit strategy.



<p>The Senate will have a chance to stop the U.S. from

wading deeper into the Colombian war when it votes on

the Emergency Supplemental bill next week. Senators

must take action to prevent us from getting more

deeply implicated in the atrocities of Colombia's

brutal war.
