<p>One recent piece of international maneuvering that has been 

overshadowed by issues of far more immediate and widespread import -- 

potential nuclear war in the Indian subcontinent, continued violence 

in the Holy Land, and the Bush administration's apparently successful 

campaign to redefine public inquiry into its gross pre-September 11 

oversight -- was the annual meeting of the International Whaling 

Commission, held from May 19 to 24 in Shimonseki, Japan.



<p>After World War II, the consumption of whale helped Japan avert 

famine, and nearly half of the meat eaten there came from whales.  As 

late as the early 1960's, whale accounted for nearly one-third of 

Japan's meat consumption.



<p>Since then, whale meat has occupied a progressively less prominent 

role in the national diet.  According to an April poll by the Asahi 

Shimbun newspaper, more than half of Japanese people aged 20 to 24 do 

not eat whale at all, and only four percent of all those polled eat 

whale even "sometimes." Today, whale accounts for a mere fraction of 

one percent of national meat consumption, and reached unprecedentedly 

low levels last year, when thirty percent of Japan's 725-ton harvest 

went unsold. 



<p>The shrinking of Japan's whaling industry, which despite its small 

size possesses considerable political clout and is a symbol of 

intense national pride, is mostly the result of strict international 

regulations on commercial whaling.  Japan's current whaling industry 

is a nominally scientific project, overseen by the Institute for 

Cetacean Research, in which the meat of whales killed for study is 

sold on the open market.  Unsurprisingly, their "research" reveals 

that restrictions on whaling are not needed. Since 1986, Japan has 

unsuccessfully sought to end the worldwide moratorium on commercial 

whaling, and have increasingly framed the issue in nationalist terms.



<p>"Some antiwhaling countries say eating whale is barbaric, but I 

consider such a stance 'cultural imperialism,'" said Shunichi Suzuki, 

a Liberal Democratic Party member and leader of pro-whaling 

Parliament group.  Outside the IWC meetings in Shimonseki, thousands 

of right-wing nationalists wearing paramilitary uniforms and waving 

flags arrived in buses with PA systems broadcasting World War II 

fight songs, demanding that Japan be allowed to hunt whales without 

foreign intervention.



<p>Inside the meetings, after their requests to lift the moratorium were 

again denied, Japan's delegates embarked on a course of shocking 

meanness.  With the aid of pro-whaling Caribbean nations whose 

support Japan is purported to have purchased, Japan successfully 

engineered a last-minute vote to forbid the aboriginal subsistence 

whaling of  Alaska's Inuit and Siberia's Chukchi peoples.



<p>The move was stunning, given the natives' near-total dependence on 

the miniscule number of whales taken in their hunts.  According to 

Inupiat mayor George Ahmaogak, "More than 10,000 people depend on 

those whales.  It's 80 percent of our diet.  We need the blubber to 

keep our blood thick in the winter.  Without it, we're in trouble."



<p>"It was the most unjust, unkind and unfair vote ever taken in the 56 

years of I.W.C. history," said Rolland A. Schmitten, the U.S. 

commissioner.



<p>Japan's response was as cold as an arctic wind. "America should feel 

the same pain that Japan has felt for fifteen years," said Masayuki 

Komatsu, spokesman for the Japanese delegation.  "They talk about 

Inuit needs.  What about the needs of our whaling communities?"



<p>Fortunately, recourse exists for the Inuit and Chukchi.  They will 

likely continue their harvests with or without international 

blessings, and pro-whaling nations could seek another vote through a 

special meeting or mail ballot prior to next year's conference. 

Japan's bizarre and vicious stance will have been reduced to posture; 

the Inuit and Chukchi will not starve, nor be reduced to dependence 

on government charity.  All will end reasonably well, and be only a 

footnote to the more pressing issues of the day.  But it is still 

worthwhile to pay attention to this particular example of 

international politics.



<p>While the debacle in Shimonseki does not cast much light into the 

arcane mechanisms of global governance, of which both supporters and 

opponents often possess little practical understanding, it 

illustrates the spirit that often prevails beneath globalism's gilded 

rhetoric.  We see disadvantaged peoples used as pawns by the world's 

great economies, compromised for the sake of political expediency, 

clawing each other down like drowning rats.  And at the I.W.C. 

meeting it was all the more poignant because the victims were a 

handful of the remnants of those societies doomed by imperialism both 

Eastern and Western, physical and cultural.



<p>In Shimonseki, America took the side of common decency.  They placed 

human well-being before short-term profits.  It is surely optimistic 

to believe this will serve as an example to other corporate and 

government leaders -- but we can hope. </p>
