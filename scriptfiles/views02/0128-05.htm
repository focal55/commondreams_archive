IN THE INTEREST of full disclosure, I must confess that I once met Ken 

Lay, but all he gave me was a big headache.

<P>At the height of the energy crisis, he addressed The Chronicle editorial 

board where he explained, with a smug smile, why California deserved its 

precipitous decline.

<P>Much of what he said about the sale of energy went over my head. Now I know 

why. I only launder clothes, not money. So I quietly passed the time 

fantasizing about what kind of comeuppance he deserved.

<P>That said, I'd like to point out that the ultimate scandal is that no one 

will ever fully grasp the extent of Enron's corrupting influence over 

government officials and policies.

<P>First, employees at Arthur Andersen destroyed crucial accounting records. 

Then, although congressional investigations had begun, Enron employees 

shredded even more documents.

<P>The Bush administration, moreover, clearly intends to distance itself from 

the Enron scandal. Vice President Dick Cheney, for example, still won't reveal 

who attended his secret energy policy task force meetings.

<P>The corruption is widespread. While building its financial empire, Enron 

showered campaign contributions on hundreds of elected officials, Democrat and 

Republican alike. Critics who now regard our government as a wholly owned 

subsidiary of Enron aren't completely daft. Nor are they wrong to doubt 

Congress' political will to do little more than grandstand and march Enron and 

Andersen executives in and out of committee hearings.

<P>So is the Rise and Fall of the Enron Empire likely to remain a secret? 

Quite probably. In the name of national security, the Bush administration has 

stripped us of our right to scrutinize the public records that could unravel 

this sordid story.

<P>First, the administration scuttled the Freedom of Information Act. On Oct. 

12, Attorney General John Ashcroft issued a memo to all federal agencies 

urging them to resist new FOIA requests. When investigative journalists and 

watchdog groups request public records that might implicate government 

officials, they may discover that their applications are indefinitely 

stonewalled.

<P>Then the administration tried to overturn the Presidential Records Act, 

which allows public access to all presidential papers. On Nov. 1, 2001, 

President Bush issued an executive order that gave himself the power to seal 

all presidential records since 1980. Although historians and journalists are 

fighting Bush's order in federal court, it may take years before the judiciary 

strikes down this executive violation of congressional legislation.

<P>Ever since the Watergate scandal, the Freedom of Information and 

Presidential Records acts have allowed us to hold our government accountable. 

Even though classified documents are never released to the public, the Bush 

administration is now using the war on terrorism as a pretext for preventing 

disclosure of all public records.

<P>Fast forward to the year 2025, when historians and journalists will still 

be struggling to document and analyze the Enron scandal. Even now, we know 

that they will have to rely on whatever documents have survived shredding or 

will have escaped the clutches of the Bush administration.

<P>Enron's secrets are safe. Future researchers will never gain access to the 

whole truth. And neither will we.
