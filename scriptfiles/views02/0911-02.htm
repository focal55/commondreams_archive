<p>America is still, a year later, shaking a little on its foundations, but its 

sense of itself and its pride in the traditions it upholds seem more strongly 

defined (and sometimes more narrowly so) than ever before in my lifetime. Nothing, 

alas, so concentrates the mind as a head-on assault.

<p>Yet even as this sense of "us" seems to intensify--all those flags murmuring, 

"You can't destroy us. We stand tall and firm"--so too, inevitably, does a sense 

of "them." As a grateful immigrant who has long found this nation to be the most 

accommodating of places (and ideas), I worry that the John Wayne stance it's projecting 

outside its borders is taking it further away from a world that it needs desperately 

to get closer to.

<p>In recent months I have traveled across Bolivia, Vietnam, Tibet, Peru, India 

and many other places, and everywhere I go I come away with the same impression: 

It's not Islam that's on trial worldwide, but the USA.

<p> The United States is the cynosure of every eye, the country that every other 

looks to with a mix of admiration, resentment and envy. Radical Islam is in most 

places just a muttering in the corner.

<p>A year ago, of course, we saw a great outpouring of sympathy around the world 

for what Americans were going through (and, among more hardened types, a sense 

that the world's great protected superpower was at last experiencing what is a 

daily fact of life for most humans). But with every passing month it feels as 

if the U.S. is growing more isolated, to the point where now it seems in many 

places just as it seemed to me in Yemen, six weeks before Sept. 11: another planet.

<p>It's in the nature of an empire, of course, to be unpopular--the Russians were 

nobody's favorite in the 1980s (least of all, I found, among their supposed comrades 

in Cuba and Vietnam); the Raj, burnished in such golden hues on PBS, seldom seemed 

so benign when it was a center of world power.

<p>In the case of the U.S., inevitably, the image is complicated because the youngest 

kid on the global block happens to be the strongest. This is hardly a consoling 

state of affairs for those older hands who believe that power comes only with 

experience and the truth lies in a distant past that the young can't even remember.

<p>Many people abroad seem to feel that U.S. leaders are much less sophisticated 

and worldly than the leaders of much smaller places, while the American people 

(whom everyone seems to like) are less interested, at times, in learning about 

the world than in changing it. Certainly the world knows more about us than we 

know about it.

<p>And when, in Hong Kong this spring, I saw a sign scrawled near the Star Ferry 

terminal, in Tagalog and English, saying "U.S., Go Home!" and in La Paz saw a 

similar message scribbled across an elegant colonial building ("U.S., Out of Afghanistan!"), 

what I really felt I was seeing was the same message I've been seeing for as long 

as I've been traveling: "America, leave us alone!" A sentiment complicated by 

the fact that it is often accompanied by a cry, just as urgent, of "America, take 

us in!"

<p>In the year since the attacks on the U.S., people here have learned to live 

with a much keener sense of frailty and fallibility and a much sharper understanding 

that we need to learn more about a world that is larger than our notions of it. 

With American dreams come responsibilities.

<p>Yet in the rest of the world, the U.S., everyone's favorite scapegoat, remains 

more a target of skepticism than ever before; when everything goes wrong, after 

all, people blame the person on top. For many around the world, I suspect, the 

shock of the attacks is gradually being eroded by the image of Washington's response, 

which allows them to say: "They're doing what they always do. Taking their frustrations 

out on the poor."

<p>Today is the first day when Sept. 11 no longer has to signify a particular 

traumatic incident; it can refer now to a new day, Sept. 11, 2002. The United 

States will always be, to some extent, imprisoned by its power. But if it can 

show the world that it can be humble and ready to change, some good may yet come 

of all it has suffered. Perhaps the best thing we can learn from older nations--Vietnam, 

say, or Japan--is that the most useful response to loss is to start looking beyond 

our wounds and toward how we can avoid hurting others, and getting hurt, again.</p>
