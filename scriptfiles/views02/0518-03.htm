<p> Now that the Democratic beauty pageant is in full swing, I have an unfashionable idea.</p>

<p>Before we go gaga over John Edwards and drown in speculation over how much cash John Kerry's wife is allowed to sink into his campaign, can we talk about what policies and political approach a Democrat might take that would be worth getting excited about in 2004?</p>

<p>I don't mean this as an eat-your-spinach antidote to gossip about who's got the stuff to go the distance. The ability to win is indispensable. But if it's not wed to some serious idea about what the point of winning would be, it's not enough.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Democrats haven't begun to think about what a compelling agenda and political style would sound like, beyond the notion of a "real" prescription drug program to trump George Bush's "fake" one.</p>

<p>Which is why it's worth lending an ear to Bill Bradley, the "loser" in the last Democratic bake-off. Bradley says he hasn't ruled anything out for the future, though he seems busy at an investment firm in New York. But that doesn't mean his heart doesn't ache for his party. (Bradley and I both advise the same management consulting firm on certain nonprofit endeavors.)</p>

<p>"Somebody's got to break out of this straitjacket," Bradley told me the other day, "and put the Democrats' values into an agenda, and put the price on it, and confront the country with the fundamental choice between short-term ledger and long-term well-being."</p>

<p>Bradley tried that in 2000, especially on health care, offering tax subsidies to America's 40 million uninsured to help them buy private coverage. His reward? Bradley's plan was assailed by Al Gore as "too liberal" and "expensive," at a time when giant surpluses loomed. Gore sliced Bradley up with shrewd professionalism and corrosive demagoguery, thereby assuring that the official view of the Democratic Party at a time of unprecedented prosperity was that health coverage for all is a utopian dream.</p>

<p>Would another candidate have carried Bradley's goals more effectively? Several of his Senate friends grumble that their man was unsuited to the brand of fierce political combat his bolder agenda required.</p>

<p>Bradley says his party's timidity grew out of the Clinton health fiasco in 1994. His onetime aide, Margy Heldring, has a vision of what's needed to move the party past it, he says.</p>

<p>Hillary Clinton needs to give a speech saying, "I release all of you! You're free from the grip of the Clinton health plan!" She doesn't have to say she was wrong - just free everyone to start over again.</p>

<p>In survival mode after 1994, Clinton resorted to what Bradley calls "the big rhetoric and the little mouse" (of actual reform). "We're for anything the Republicans would say but a little less," Bradley continues. "And so the Republicans were not dumb. They kept going further and further to the right in the Clinton years because they knew that ultimately they'd get a little bit less.</p>

<p>"You can't ride into the 21st century with the Clinton political strategy and expect to be viewed as the fresh and new Democratic Party," he says. Meanwhile, he adds, Bush has copied Clinton's "big rhetoric and little mouse" in ways that are dangerously effective.</p>

<p>"We're all process," Bradley says. "Just get us through the next thing. We'll compromise here, and we'll compromise there."</p>

<p>And then Bradley gives away the secret of why.</p>

<p>"The reason," he says, of Democrats still in the arena, "is that they're convinced people wouldn't buy what we believe the country really needs. So we have to say what we want them to hear - that we're with them," but without offering policies equal to their problems. "Then we'll try in the margins to help people who really need the help.</p>

<p>"That's cynicism," Bradley concludes. "And that's infected the political process. So at the beginning what you need is someone to stand up and take a position."</p>

<p>Bradley's worked up now. Maybe his party should be, too. And maybe Democrats should be starting with the question of "what" before getting too infatuated with the question of "who."</p>
