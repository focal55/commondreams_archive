Private borrowing was the engine for the U.S. economy during the 1990s, as 

the decade ended with the federal budget in surplus.  And the current 

recession will be a year old this March.  What to do?  We turn our attention 

to President Bush.



<p>“We need a plan to lengthen unemployment benefits, we need a plan to shorten 

the recession,” the president said in his recent radio broadcast.



<p>Some 1.2 million Americans have been fired during the past 10 months, with 

another million driven into part-time work, the Wall Street Journal recently 

reported, citing data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  The official 

Dec. jobless rate was 5.8 percent, up from a revised Nov. rate of 5.6 

percent.



<p>The president faults Senate Democrats for blocking his economic recovery 

plan.



<p>Democrat Tom Daschle, Senate majority leader, took a different view of 

Bush’s plan, while supporting his war in Afghanistan.  For example, Daschle 

criticized the president’s $1.35 trillion income-tax cut for removing the 

federal government’s “flexibility.”  His tax cut has worsened the recession 

and is leading to a projected federal deficit that will hinder an economic 

revival, Daschle added.



<p>On one hand, federal deficit spending is supposed to be the wrong policy to 

help the economy grow. Presumably, public borrowing is a bad thing.  Case in 

point is the Clinton administration’s success in sustaining growth and 

creating a federal budget surplus that emerged in 1997.  Some claim that 

this improved the prospects for long-term interest rates.



<p>On the other hand, the engine of the American economy last decade was 

private debt.  Consumers and corporations doubled their debt in the 1990s.  

How?  Lots of foreign money flowed into America, attracted partly by the 

high value of the dollar.  Overseas financing enabled the U.S. economy to be 

the “consumer of the last resort,” thus keeping the global market system 

afloat.



<p>Then America went into recession last March.  National economies that relied 

on U.S. corporations and consumers buying their exports with borrowed money 

began to sink.  As global economic activity led by  America contracted, 

business investment began to decline.  Consequently, payrolls shrank.  U.S. 

workers had less income.  Their ability to repay and take on more debt (the 

linchpin of expansion in the 1990s) also fell.



<p>In the meantime, hope was high that monetary policy would maintain U.S. 

economic growth.  But cutting the cost to borrow money has proven to be an 

inefficient form of economic stimulus, at best.  In 2001, the Federal 

Reserve cut interest rates roughly once a month.  Growth has not been 

forthcoming.



<p>What of federal deficit spending to stimulate the U.S. economy?  If not now, 

one wonders when absent monetary policy to stimulate a recovery in 2002?



<p>Meanwhile, for millions of Americans seeing unemployment rise as part-time 

work grows and full-time jobs shrink, such questions take on a special 

urgency.  Those out of a job before the recession began are increasingly off 

the political radar screen.  What will it take for Democrats and Republicans 

to wake up and legislate as if the American people mattered?
