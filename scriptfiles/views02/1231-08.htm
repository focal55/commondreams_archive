<p>In a little-noticed decision made just before

the holidays, Judge Melinda F. Harmon gave the

country a Christmas present that we really needed

but couldn't seem to go out and get for ourselves.

The 307-page opinion reinterpreted securities law

so that financial firms that help companies make

fraudulent transactions -- of the kind that brought

down Enron -- can themselves be held liable for

fraud.

<p>It remains to be seen whether this decision

from the Federal District Court in Houston will

accomplish something that our Congress and the

executive branch have failed to do in the year since

Enron's house of cards collapsed. But the decision is

striking in that it shows how we are becoming

increasingly reliant on the courts to make essential

changes, sometimes in the face of staggering

political corruption, that our society needs in order

to get on with its day-to-day business.

<p>More than a year after Enron's implosion,

the three most basic reforms that were put forth

when the fraud was exposed have not been adopted.

They are: first, a system to assign auditors to

companies so that the auditors' independence can be

assured; second, requiring firms to list stock options

(given to executives as part of their compensation)

as a business expense at the time they are granted;

and third, a limit on the percentage of employees'

individual retirement benefits that can take the form

of company stock.

<p>When the wave of corporate accounting and

governance scandals first broke, these reforms were

widely seen as a reasonable first step toward

restoring investors' trust and protecting employees.

Yet Congress did not address these issues in its

"corporate accountability" bill, which was largely

an empty public relations gesture. The SEC

obstructed even the weak provisions in this act, with

its Chairman Harvey Pitt eventually being forced to

resign after appointing a person tied to an

accounting scandal to head the newly created

accounting oversight board.

<p>Judge Harmon's decision is particularly

noteworthy because it is trying to save big business

itself from the fraudulent excesses of one sector.

This is a basic regulatory function that would not

ordinarily have to become the responsibility of the

judiciary. But our Congress and the executive

branch have become so corrupted by our system of

legalized bribery -- political campaign contributions

-- that they cannot even enact positive reforms that

are desired by most of the business class.

<p>The courts have thus become the last branch

of our government where there remains enough

integrity to confront powerful special interests, at

least in certain circumstances. In the two months

since our last national election, the corruption of the

rest of our government has been breathtakingly

highlighted by paybacks to corporate and wealthy

interests. Financial contributions to the coffers of

campaign 2002 have bought rights for logging

companies to further damage national forests,

electric utilities to increase their pollution, and pharmaceutical companies to ensure that any Medicare prescription drug benefit -- if they can't block it altogether -- will keep U.S. drug prices the highest in the world.

<p>In recent years, the courts have sometimes

been a venue for change through class action

lawsuits such as those that forced Big Tobacco to

stop marketing their cigarettes to children, and held

them liable for some of their damage to public

health.  Hence the corporate-funded campaign for

"tort reform," which seeks to curtail the ability of

citizens to seek legal redress for the victims of

unsafe products and dangerous corporate practices.

People for whom greed is a guiding ethos ironically

blame "greedy trial lawyers" for raising the cost of everything from medical care to car insurance through litigation. But this litigation is often the only means to protect society from medical malpractice or corporate malfeasance.

<p>The corruption of most of our government

by moneyed interests carries great social and

economic costs. Millions of people have lost the

bulk of their retirement savings due to corporate

fraud over the last few years. And as the economy

heads toward a likely recession, the Bush

Administration offers yet another tax cut for the

country's wealthiest households, rather than trying

to counteract the economic downturn.

<p>As much as the courts may occasionally

intervene to regulate commerce or protect the rights

of citizens, they cannot substitute for the

functioning democracy that this country sorely

needs.
