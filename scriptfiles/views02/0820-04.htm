<a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a> </p>

<p>The United States appears to be barging ahead with plans to engage in a large-scale 

military operation against Iraq to overthrow the regime of Saddam Hussein. In 

the international community, however, serious questions are being raised regarding 

its legality, its justification, its political implications, and the costs of 

the war itself. Such an invasion would constitute an important precedent, being 

the first test of the new doctrine articulated by President George W. Bush of 

&#147;preemption,&#148; which declares that the United States has the right to 

invade sovereign countries and overthrow their governments if they are seen as 

hostile to U.S. interests. All previous large-scale interventions by American 

forces abroad have been rationalized&#151;albeit not always convincingly to many 

observers&#151;on the principle of collective self-defense, such as through regional 

organizations like the South East Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) or the Organization 

of American States (OAS). To invade Iraq would constitute an unprecedented repudiation 

of the international legal conventions that such American presidents as Woodrow 

Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, and Dwight Eisenhower helped create 

in order to build a safer world.</p>

<p>Although there have been some questions raised recently about the scale and 

logistics of such a military operation, there has been surprisingly little dissent 

from leading policymakers, including congressional Democrats. This raises serious 

concerns, given that an invasion of Iraq constitutes such a dramatic shift in 

U.S. foreign policy and involves enormous political and military risks. It appears 

that war is inevitable unless there is a groundswell of popular opposition. This 

policy report attempts to encourage popular debate by raising a number of concerns 

that challenge some of the key rationales and assumptions behind such a military 

action.</p>

<p><b><a name="1"></a>1. A War Against Iraq Would Be Illegal</b> </p>

<p>There is no legal justification for U.S. military action against Iraq.</p>

<p>Iraq is currently in violation of part of one section of UN Security Council 

Resolution 687 (and a series of subsequent resolutions reiterating that segment) 

requiring full cooperation with United Nations inspectors ensuring that Iraq&#146;s 

weapons of mass destruction, delivery systems, and facilities for manufacturing 

such weapons are destroyed. The conflict regarding access for UN inspectors and 

possible Iraqi procurement of weapons of mass destruction has always been an issue 

involving the Iraqi government and the United Nations, not an impasse between 

Iraq and the United States. Although UN Security Council Resolution 687 was the 

most detailed in the world body&#146;s history, no military enforcement mechanisms 

were specified. Nor did the Security Council specify any military enforcement 

mechanisms in subsequent resolutions. As is normally the case when it is determined 

that governments violate all or part of UN resolutions, any decision about the 

enforcement of its resolutions is a matter for the UN Security Council as a whole&#151;not 

for any one member of the council.</p>

<p>The most explicit warning to Iraq regarding its noncompliance came in UN Security 

Council Resolution 1154. Although this resolution warned Iraq of the &#147;severest 

consequences&#148; if it continued its refusal to comply, the Security Council 

declared that it alone had the authority to &#147;ensure implementation of this 

resolution and peace and security in the area.&#148;</p>

<p>According to articles 41 and 42 of the United Nations Charter, no member state 

has the right to enforce any resolution militarily unless the UN Security Council 

determines that there has been a material breach of its resolution, decides that 

all nonmilitary means of enforcement have been exhausted, and then specifically 

authorizes the use of military force. This is what the Security Council did in 

November 1990 with Resolution 678 in response to Iraq&#146;s ongoing occupation 

of Kuwait in violation of a series of resolutions passed that August. The UN has 

not done so for any subsequent violations involving Iraq or any other government.</p>

<p>If the United States can unilaterally claim the right to invade Iraq due to 

that country&#146;s violation of UN Security Council resolutions, other Security 

Council members could logically also claim the right to invade other member states 

that are in violation of UN Security Council resolutions. For example, Russia 

could claim the right to invade Israel, France could claim the right to invade 

Turkey, and Great Britain could claim the right to invade Morocco, simply because 

those targeted governments are also violating UN Security Council resolutions. 

The U.S. insistence on the right to attack unilaterally could seriously undermine 

the principle of collective security and the authority of the United Nations and 

in doing so would open the door to international anarchy.</p>

<p>International law is quite clear about when military force is allowed. In addition 

to the aforementioned case of UN Security Council authorization, the only other 

time that any member state is allowed to use armed force is described in Article 

51, which states that it is permissible for &#147;individual or collective self-defense&#148; 

against &#147;armed attack ... until the Security Council has taken the measures 

necessary to maintain international peace and security.&#148; If Iraq&#146;s neighbors 

were attacked or feared an imminent attack from Iraq, any of these countries could 

call on the United States to help, pending a Security Council decision authorizing 

the use of force. But they have not appealed to the Security Council, because 

they have not felt threatened by Iraq.</p>

<p>Based on evidence that the Bush administration has made public, there does 

not appear to be anything close to sufficient legal grounds for the United States 

to convince the Security Council to approve the use of military force against 

Iraq in U.S. self-defense. This may explain why the Bush administration has thus 

far refused to go before the United Nations on this matter. Unless the United 

States gets such authorization, any such attack on Iraq would be illegal and would 

be viewed by most members of the international community as an act of aggression. 

In contrast to the Persian Gulf War of 1990-91, it is likely that the world community 

would view the United States&#151;not Iraq&#151;as the international outlaw.</p>

<p>There is little debate regarding the nefarious nature of the Iraqi regime, 

but this has never been a legal ground for invasion. When Vietnam invaded Cambodia 

in 1978 to overthrow the Khmer Rouge&#151;a radical communist movement even more 

brutal than the regime of Saddam Hussein&#151;the United States condemned the 

action before the United Nations as an act of aggression and a violation of international 

law. The United States successfully led an international effort to impose sanctions 

against Vietnam and insisted that the UN recognize the Khmer Rouge as the legitimate 

government of Cambodia for more than a decade after their leaders were forced 

out of the capital into remote jungle areas. Similarly, the United States challenged 

three of its closest allies&#151;Great Britain, France, and Israel&#151;before 

the United Nations in 1956 when they invaded Egypt in an attempt to overthrow 

the radical anti-Western regime of Gamal Abdul-Nasser. The Eisenhower administration 

insisted that international law and the UN Charter must be upheld by all nations 

regardless of their relations with the United States. It now appears that the 

leadership of both political parties is ready to reverse what was once a bipartisan 

consensus.</p>

<p><b><a name="2"></a>2. Regional Allies Widely Oppose a U.S. Attack</b> </p>

<p>Although there was some serious opposition to the Gulf War in many parts of 

the Middle East and elsewhere, it did have the support of major segments of the 

international community, including several important Arab states. The Gulf War 

was widely viewed as an act of collective security in response to aggression by 

Iraq against its small neighbor. This would not be the case, however, in the event 

of a new war against Iraq. Instead, Washington&#146;s proposed action would be 

seen as an unprovoked invasion. Unlike in 1991, when most of the region supported&#151;and 

even contributed to&#151;the U.S.-led war effort (or was at least neutral), Arab 

opposition is strong today. Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah has warned that the U.S. 

&#147;should not strike Iraq, because such an attack would only raise animosity 

in the region against the United States.&#148; When Vice President Dick Cheney 

visited the Middle East in March, every Arab leader made clear his opposition. 

At the Beirut summit of the Arab League at the end of March, the Arab nations 

unanimously endorsed a resolution opposing an attack against Iraq.</p>

<p>Even Kuwait has reconciled with Iraq. This past March, Iraq and Kuwait signed 

a document written by Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Sheik Sabah al Ahmed al Jabbar 

al Sabah in which Iraq, for the first time, formally consented to respect the 

sovereignty of Kuwait. Sabah declared that his country was 100% satisfied with 

the agreement, and Kuwait reiterated its opposition to a U.S. invasion of Iraq. 

Saudi Arabia&#146;s Crown Prince Abdullah called the pact a &#147;very positive 

achievement&#148; and expressed confidence that Iraq would uphold the agreement.</p>

<p>U.S. officials claim that, public statements to the contrary, there may be 

some regional allies willing to support a U.S. war effort. Given President Bush&#146;s 

ultimatum that &#147;you are either with us or the terrorists,&#148; it is quite 

possible that some governments might be successfully pressured to go along. However, 

almost any Middle Eastern government willing to provide such support and cooperation 

would be doing so over the opposition of the vast majority of its citizens. Given 

the real political risks for such a ruler in supporting the U.S. war effort, such 

acquiescence would take place only reluctantly as a result of American pressure 

or inducements, not from a sincere belief in the validity of the U.S. military 

operation.</p>

<p>In the event of a U.S. invasion of Iraq, there would likely be an outbreak 

of widespread anti-American protests, perhaps even attacks against American interests. 

Some pro-Western regimes could become vulnerable to internal radical forces as 

part of such a reaction. Passions are particularly high in light of strong U.S. 

support for the policies of Israel&#146;s rightist government and its ongoing 

occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The anger over U.S. double standards 

regarding Israeli and Iraqi violations of UN Security Council resolutions could 

reach a boiling point.</p>

<p><b><a name="3"></a>3. There Is No Evidence of Iraqi Links to Al Qaeda or Other 

Anti-American Terrorists</b> </p>

<p>In the months following the September 11 terrorist attacks, there were leaks 

to the media about alleged evidence of a meeting in Prague between an Iraqi intelligence 

officer and one of the hijackers of the doomed airplanes that crashed into the 

World Trade Center. Subsequent thorough investigations by the FBI, CIA, and Czech 

intelligence have found no evidence that any such meeting took place. None of 

the hijackers were Iraqi, no major figure in Al Qaeda is Iraqi, and no funds to 

Al Qaeda have been traced to Iraq. It is unlikely that the decidedly secular Baathist 

regime&#151;which has savagely suppressed Islamists within Iraq&#151;would be 

able to maintain close links with Osama bin Laden and his followers. In fact, 

Saudi Prince Turki bin Faisal, his country&#146;s former intelligence chief, noted 

that bin Laden views Saddam Hussein &#147;as an apostate, an infidel, or someone 

who is not worthy of being a fellow Muslim&#148; and that bin Laden had offered 

in 1990 to raise an army of thousands of mujaheddin fighters to liberate Kuwait 

from Iraqi occupation.</p>

<p>Iraq&#146;s past terrorist links have primarily been limited to such secular 

groups as Abu Nidal, a now-largely defunct Palestinian faction opposed to Yasir 

Arafat&#146;s Palestine Liberation Organization. At the height of Iraq&#146;s 

support of Abu Nidal in the early 1980s, Washington dropped Iraq from its list 

of countries that sponsored terrorism so the U.S. could bolster Iraq&#146;s war 

effort against Iran. Baghdad was reinstated to the list only after the Iraqi invasion 

of Kuwait in 1990, even though U.S. officials were unable to cite any increased 

Iraqi ties to terrorist groups. A recent CIA report indicates that the Iraqis 

have actually been consciously avoiding any actions against the United States 

or its facilities abroad, presumably to deny Washington any excuse to engage in 

further military strikes against their country. The last clear example that American 

officials can cite of such Iraqi-backed terrorism was an alleged plot by Iraqi 

agents to assassinate former President George Bush when he visited Kuwait in 1993. 

In response, President Bill Clinton ordered the bombing of Baghdad, hitting an 

Iraqi intelligence headquarters as well as a nearby civilian neighborhood.</p>

<p>Although Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld insists that Iraq is backing 

international terrorism, he has been unable to present any evidence that they 

currently do so. In fact, the State Department&#146;s own annual study <i>Patterns 

of Global Terrorism</i> did not list any serious act of international terrorism 

by the government of Iraq.</p>

<p>Besides, an American invasion of Iraq would probably weaken the battle against 

terrorism. It would not only distract from the more immediate threat posed by 

Osama bin Laden&#146;s Al Qaeda network, but it would also likely result in an 

anti-American backlash that would lessen the level of cooperation from Islamic 

countries in tracking down and neutralizing the remaining Al Qaeda cells.</p>

<p><b><a name="4"></a>4. There Is No Proof that Iraq Is Developing Weapons of 

Mass Destruction</b> </p>

<p>Despite speculation&#151;particularly by those who seek an excuse to invade 

Iraq&#151;of possible ongoing Iraqi efforts to procure weapons of mass destruction, 

no one has been able to put forward evidence that the Iraqis are actually doing 

so, though they have certainly done so in the past. The dilemma facing the international 

community is that no one knows what, if anything, the Iraqis are currently doing.</p>

<p>In the aftermath of the 1991 Gulf War and the subsequent inspections regimen, 

virtually all Iraq&#146;s stockpile of weapons of mass destruction, delivery systems, 

and capability of producing such weapons were destroyed. Inspectors with the United 

Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) were withdrawn from Iraq in late 1998 before 

their job was complete, however, under orders by President Clinton prior to a 

heavy four-day U.S. bombing campaign. The Iraqi government has not yet allowed 

them to return. Prior to that time, UNSCOM reportedly oversaw the destruction 

of 38,000 chemical weapons, 480,000 liters of live chemical weapons agents, 48 

missiles, six missile launchers, 30 missile warheads modified to carry chemical 

or biological agents, and hundreds of pieces of related equipment with the capability 

to produce chemical weapons.</p>

<p>In its most recent report, the International Atomic Energy Agency categorically 

declared that Iraq no longer has a nuclear program.</p>

<p>In late 1997, UNSCOM Director Richard Butler reported that UNSCOM had made 

&#147;significant progress&#148; in tracking Iraq&#146;s chemical weapons program 

and that 817 of the 819 Soviet-supplied long-range missiles had been accounted 

for. A couple dozen Iraqi-made ballistic missiles remained unaccounted for, but 

these were of questionable caliber. Though Iraqi officials would periodically 

interfere with inspections, in its last three years of operation, UNSCOM was unable 

to detect any evidence that Iraq had been further concealing prohibited weapons.</p>

<p>The development of biological weapons, by contrast, is much easier to conceal, 

due to the small amount of space needed for their manufacture. Early UNSCOM inspections 

revealed evidence of the production of large amounts of biological agents, including 

anthrax, and charged that Iraq had vastly understated the amount of biological 

warfare agents it had manufactured. In response, UNSCOM set up sophisticated monitoring 

devices to detect chemical or biological weapons, though these devices were dismantled 

in reaction to the U.S. bombing campaign of December 1998.</p>

<p>Frightening scenarios regarding mass fatalities from a small amount of anthrax 

assume that the Iraqis have developed the highly sophisticated means of distributing 

these bioweapons by missile or aircraft. However, there are serious questions 

as to whether the alleged biological agents could be dispersed successfully in 

a manner that could harm troops or a civilian population, given the rather complicated 

technology required. For example, a vial of biological weapons on the tip of a 

missile would almost certainly either be destroyed on impact or dispersed harmlessly. 

To become lethal, highly concentrated amounts of anthrax spores must be inhaled 

and then left untreated by antibiotics until the infection is too far advanced. 

Similarly, the prevailing winds would have to be calculated, no rain could fall, 

the spray nozzles could not clog, the population would need to be unvaccinated, 

and everyone would need to stay around the area targeted for attack.</p>

<p>Although Iraq&#146;s potential for developing weapons of mass destruction should 

not be totally discounted, Saddam Hussein&#146;s refusal to allow UN inspectors 

to return and his lack of full cooperation prior to their departure do not necessarily 

mean he is hiding something, as President Bush alleges. More likely, the Iraqi 

opposition to the inspections program is based on Washington&#146;s abuse of UNSCOM 

for intelligence gathering operations and represents a desperate effort by Saddam 

Hussein to increase his standing with Arab nationalists by defying Western efforts 

to intrude on Iraqi sovereignty. Indeed, the Iraqi defiance of the inspections 

regime may be designed to provoke a reaction by the United States in order to 

capitalize on widespread Arab resentment over Washington&#146;s double standard 

of objecting to an Arab country procuring weapons of mass destruction while tolerating 

Israel&#146;s nuclear arsenal.</p>

<p>A far more likely scenario for an Iraqi distribution of biological agents would 

be through Iraqi agents smuggling them clandestinely into targeted countries. 

This is what led to some initial speculation, now considered very doubtful, that 

the Iraqis were behind the anthrax mail attacks during the fall of 2001. To prevent 

such a scenario requires aggressive counterintelligence efforts by the United 

States and other potentially targeted nations, but this type of terrorism is not 

likely to be prevented by an invasion. Indeed, a U.S. invasion could conceivably 

encourage rogue elements of Iraqi intelligence or an allied terrorist group to 

engage in an anthrax attack as an act of revenge for the heavy Arab casualties 

resulting from U.S. bombing. One of the frightening things about biological weapons 

production is the mobility of operations. A &#147;regime change&#148; engineered 

by the U.S. would not necessarily ensure the closure of labs producing such weapons, 

since they could easily be relocated elsewhere or even continue to operate clandestinely 

in Iraq.</p>

<p>U.S. officials have admitted that there is no evidence that Iraq has resumed 

its nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons programs. Scott Ritter, a former 

U.S. Marine officer who served as chief weapons inspector for UNSCOM, responded 

to a query on a television talk show in 2001 about Iraq&#146;s potential threat 

to the U.S. by saying:</p>

<blockquote> 

<p><i>In terms of military threat, absolutely nothing. His military was devastated 

in 1991 in Operation Desert Storm and hasn&#146;t had the ability to reconstitute 

itself &#133; In terms of weapons of mass destruction, &#133; we just don&#146;t 

know. We know that we achieved a 90 to 95% level of disarmament. There&#146;s 

stuff that&#146;s unresolved, and until we get weapons inspectors back into Iraq, 

that will remain a problematic issue &#133;. We should be trying to get weapons 

inspectors back into Iraq, so that we can ascertain exactly what&#146;s transpiring 

in Iraq today instead of guessing about it.</i></p>

</blockquote>

<p>Finally, Saddam Hussein has demonstrated that he cares first and foremost about 

his own survival. He presumably recognizes that any effort to use weapons of mass 

destruction would inevitably lead to his own destruction. This is why he did not 

use them during the Gulf War. In the event of a U.S. invasion, seeing his overthrow 

as imminent, and with nothing to lose, this logic of self-preservation would no 

longer be operative. Instead, such an invasion would dramatically increase the 

likelihood of his ordering the use of any weapons of mass destruction he may have 

retained.</p>

<p>Saddam Hussein&#146;s leadership style has always been that of direct control; 

his distrust of subordinates (bordering on paranoia) is one of the things that 

has helped him survive. It is extremely unlikely that he would go to the risk 

and expense of developing weapons of mass destruction only to pass them on to 

some group of terrorists. If he does have such weapons at his disposal, they would 

be for him and nobody else. In the chaos of a U.S. invasion and its aftermath, 

however, the chances of such weapons being smuggled out of the country into the 

hands of terrorists would increase. Currently these weapons, if they do exist, 

are under the control of a highly centralized government unlikely to provoke an 

attack by passing on the weapons to terrorist groups.</p>

<p><b><a name="5"></a>5. Iraq Is No Longer a Significant Military Threat to Its 

Neighbors</b> </p>

<p>It is also hard to imagine that an Iraqi aircraft carrying biological weapons, 

presumably some kind of drone, could somehow penetrate the air space of neighboring 

countries, much less far-off Israel, without being shot down. Most of Iraq&#146;s 

neighbors have sophisticated antiaircraft capability, and Israel has the best 

regional missile defense system in the world. Similarly, as mentioned above, there 

is no evidence that Iraq&#146;s Scud missiles and launchers even survived the 

Gulf War in operable condition. Indeed, UNSCOM reported in 1992 that Iraq had 

neither launchers for their missiles nor engines to power them.</p>

<p>Israeli military analyst Meir Stieglitz, writing in the Israeli newspaper <i>Yediot 

Ahronot</i>, noted that &#147;there is no such thing as a long-range Iraqi missile 

with an effective biological warhead. No one has found an Iraqi biological warhead. 

The chances of Iraq having succeeded in developing operative warheads without 

tests are zero.&#148;</p>

<p>The recent American obsession with Iraq&#146;s potential military threat is 

discredited by the fact that Iraq&#146;s military, including its real and potential 

weapons of mass destruction, was significantly stronger in the late 1980s than 

it is today. Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein was once a real threat to Iraq&#146;s 

neighbors when he had his full complement of medium-range missiles, a functioning 

air force, and a massive stockpile of chemical and biological weaponry and material. 

Yet, from the Carter administration through the Reagan administration and continuing 

through the first half of the senior Bush administration, the U.S. dismissed any 

potential strategic Iraqi threat to the point of coddling Saddam&#146;s regime 

with overt economic subsidies and covert military support. This support continued 

even as Iraq invaded Iran and used chemical weapons against Iranian soldiers and 

Kurdish civilians.</p>

<p>Iraq&#146;s current armed forces are barely one-third their pre-war strength. 

Even though Iraq has not been required to reduce its conventional forces, the 

destruction of its weapons and the country&#146;s economic difficulties have led 

to a substantial reduction in men under arms. Iraq&#146;s Navy is virtually nonexistent 

and its Air Force is just a fraction of what it was before the war. Military spending 

by Iraq has been estimated at barely one-tenth of its levels in the 1980s. The 

Bush administration has been unable to explain why today, when Saddam has only 

a tiny percentage of his once-formidable military capability, Iraq is considered 

such a threat that it is necessary to invade the country and replace its leader&#151;the 

same leader Washington quietly supported during the peak of Iraq&#146;s military 

capability.</p>

<p><b><a name="6"></a>6. There Are Still Nonmilitary Options Available</b> </p>

<p>The best way to stop the potential of Iraq developing weapons of mass destruction 

would be through resuming United Nations inspections, which&#151;despite episodes 

of Iraqi noncooperation and harassment&#151;were largely successful. It was Washington&#146;s 

ill-considered decision to misuse the inspection teams for unrelated spying operations 

and the decision to engage in an intense four-day bombing campaign against Iraq 

that led Saddam Hussein to cease his cooperation completely in December 1998.</p>

<p>Since then, the United States has not offered any incentives for Iraq to allow 

inspections to resume. From the outset, Washington made it clear that even total 

cooperation with UNSCOM would not lead to an end to the devastating international 

sanctions against Iraq. As a result, Saddam Hussein may be refusing to allow UN 

inspectors to return not because he has something to hide but because he has nothing 

to gain by cooperating. Offering an end to or a substantial liberalization of 

nonmilitary sanctions in return for unfettered access by UN inspection teams would 

probably be the best way to regain access for the inspectors.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Bush administration officials are apparently no longer even 

interested in renewing UN inspections, dismissing out of hand Iraq&#146;s recently 

announced willingness to consider their return. This raises questions as to whether 

the potential Iraqi possession of weapons of mass destruction is really a genuine 

concern of American officials or merely an excuse to go to war.</p>

<p>A number of observers, including Scott Ritter&#151;who had criticized the Clinton 

administration for not pushing the Iraqi regime harder on its initial refusals 

to allow inspections into some of the government&#146;s inner sanctums&#151;believe 

that the Bush administration is sabotaging United Nations efforts to reopen inspections. 

For example, Ritter told the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> that the recent decision 

to engage in covert operations to assassinate Saddam Hussein and other Iraqi leaders 

&#147;effectively kills any chance of inspectors returning to Iraq&#148; because 

&#147;the Iraqis will never trust an inspection regime that has already shown 

itself susceptible to infiltration and manipulation by intelligence services hostile 

to Iraq.&#148;</p>

<p>There is also no reason why the current emphasis on deterrence will not continue 

to work. Iraq was able to build up its initial raw components, equipment, and 

technologies for the development of biological, chemical, and nuclear weapons 

through imports, much of which came from the United States. The vast majority 

of these items and infrastructure has since been destroyed. Although the economic 

sanctions have been quite controversial as a result of their devastating effects 

on Iraqi civilians (and are therefore frequently violated), international support 

for and enforcement of the military sanctions have remained quite solid.</p>

<p>Furthermore, even without a resumption of inspections, relying on existing 

satellite surveillance&#151;which ensures that Iraq cannot build any large weapons 

plants without detection and presumably destruction, immediately afterwards&#151;seems 

far less risky than an all-out war.</p>

<p>Finally, given that UN Security Council Resolution 687 also calls for disarmament 

initiatives throughout the region, the United States could help curb Iraq&#146;s 

appetite for weapons procurement by reversing its opposition to arms control initiatives 

for the entire Persian Gulf region.</p>

<p><b><a name="7"></a>7. Defeating Iraq Would Be Militarily Difficult</b> </p>

<p>Most likely, the United States would eventually be victorious in a war against 

Iraq, but it would come at an enormous cost. It would be a mistake, for example, 

to think that defeating Iraq would result in as few Americans casualties as occurred 

in driving the Taliban militia from Kabul. Though Iraq&#146;s offensive capabilities 

have been severely weakened by the bombings, sanctions, and UNSCOM-sponsored decommissioning, 

its defensive military capabilities are still strong.</p>

<p>Nor would a military victory today be as easy as during the Gulf War. Prior 

to the launching of Operation Desert Storm, when the Iraqis figured out the extent 

of the forces being deployed against them, they decided not to put up a fight 

for Kuwait and relied mostly on young conscripts from minority communities. Only 

two of the eight divisions of the elite Republican Guard were ever in Kuwait, 

and they pulled back before the war began in mid-January. The vast majority of 

Iraq&#146;s strongest forces were withdrawn to areas around Baghdad to fight for 

the survival of the regime itself, and they remain there to this day. In the event 

of war, defections from these units are not likely.</p>

<p>There are close to one million members of the Iraqi elite who have a vested 

interest in the regime&#146;s survival. These include the Baath Party leadership 

and its supporters, security and intelligence personnel, and core elements of 

the armed forces and their extended families. Furthermore, Iraq&#151;a largely 

urban society&#151;has a far more sophisticated infrastructure than does the largely 

rural and tribal Afghanistan that could be mobilized in the event of a foreign 

invasion.</p>

<p>Nor is there an equivalent to Afghanistan&#146;s Northern Alliance, which did 

the bulk of the ground fighting against the Taliban. The Kurds, after being abandoned 

twice in recent history by the United States, are unlikely to fight beyond securing 

autonomy for Kurdish areas. The armed Shiite opposition has largely been eliminated, 

and it too would be unlikely to fight beyond liberating the majority Shiite sections 

of southern Iraq. The U.S. would be reluctant to support either, given that their 

successes could potentially fragment the country and would encourage both rebellious 

Kurds in southeastern Turkey and restive Shiites in northeastern Saudi Arabia. 

U.S. forces would have to march on Baghdad, a city of over five million people, 

virtually alone. Unlike the Gulf War, which involved conventional and open combat 

where U.S. forces could excel and take full advantage of their firepower and technological 

superiority, U.S. soldiers would have to fight their way through heavily populated 

agricultural and urban lands. Invading forces would be faced with bitter, house-to-house 

fighting in a country larger than South Vietnam. Iraqis, who may have had little 

stomach to fight to maintain their country&#146;s conquest of Kuwait, would be 

far more willing to sacrifice themselves to resist a foreign, Western invader. 

To minimize American casualties in the face of such stiff resistance, which would 

largely come from within crowded urban areas, the United States would likely engage 

in heavy bombing of Iraqi residential neighborhoods, resulting in very high civilian 

casualties.</p>

<p>The lack of support from regional allies could result in an absence of a land 

base from which to launch U.S. aerial attacks, initially requiring the United 

States to rely on Navy jets launched from aircraft carriers. Without permission 

to launch aerial refueling craft, even long-range bombers from U.S. air bases 

might not be able to be deployed. It is hard to imagine being able to provide 

the necessary reconnaissance and surveillance aircraft under such circumstances, 

and the deployment of tens of thousands of troops from distant staging areas could 

be problematic as well. U.S. forces could conceivably capture an air base inside 

Iraq in the course of the fighting, but without the pre-positioning of supplies, 

its usefulness as a major center of operations would be marginal.</p>

<p>Finally, there is the question of what happens if the United States is successful 

in overthrowing Saddam Hussein&#146;s regime. As is becoming apparent in Afghanistan, 

throwing a government out is easier than putting a new one together. Although 

most Iraqis presumably fear and despise Saddam Hussein&#146;s rule and would likely 

be relieved in the event of his ouster, this does not mean that a regime installed 

by an invading Western army would be welcomed. For example, most of the leading 

candidates that U.S. officials are apparently considering installing to govern 

Iraq are former Iraqi military officers who have been linked to war crimes.</p>

<p>In addition to possible ongoing guerrilla action by Saddam Hussein&#146;s supporters, 

U.S. occupation forces would likely be faced with competing armed factions among 

the Sunni Arab population, not to mention Kurd and Shiite rebel groups seeking 

to break away from any ruler in Baghdad. This could lead the United States into 

a bloody counterinsurgency war. Without the support of other countries or the 

United Nations, a U.S. invasion could leave American forces effectively alone 

enforcing a peace amidst the chaos of a post-Saddam Iraq.</p>

<p><b><a name="conclusion"></a>Conclusion</b> </p>

<p>The serious moral, legal, political, and strategic problems with a possible 

U.S. invasion of Iraq require that the American public become engaged in the debate 

over the wisdom of such a dramatic course of action. What is at stake is not just 

the lives of thousands of Iraqi and American soldiers and thousands more Iraqi 

civilians but also the international legal framework established in the aftermath 

of World War II. Despite its failings, this multilateral framework of collective 

security has resulted in far greater international stability and far less intergovernmental 

conflict than would otherwise have been the case.</p>

<p>During the 2000 election campaign, George W. Bush scored well among voters 

by calling for greater &#147;humility&#148; in U.S. foreign policy, decrying the 

overextension of U.S. military force, and criticizing the idea that the U.S. armed 

forces should be engaged in such practices as &#147;nation-building&#148; in unstable 

areas. As president, Bush has made a remarkable reversal of this popular position 

and appears eager to embark on perhaps the most reckless foreign military campaign 

in U.S. history. Taking advantage of the fear, anger, and sense of nationalism 

felt by so many Americans in the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks, the 

Bush administration and its allies in Congress and the media are now seeking to 

justify an unrelated military campaign that would have otherwise been unimaginable.</p>

<p>The most effective antidote to such arrogance of power is democracy. Unfortunately, 

in times of international crisis, many Americans are wary of exercising their 

democratic rights and are reluctant to oppose a president&#146;s foreign policy. 

Yet, seldom in U.S. history has it been so important for Americans to raise their 

concerns publicly and challenge their elected representatives to honor their legal 

and moral obligations.</p>
