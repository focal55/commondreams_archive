<p>The Republicans got it all on Tuesday night. They got the House. They got the 

Senate. They got at least 20 of the 36 governorships at stake. And they got a 

massive boost of political momentum -- just as those increasingly unreliable polls 

were hinting at a leak in the president's high-flying popularity balloon. 

<p> The Democrats, on the other hand, got very little -- other than a kick in 

the butt, some good experience at giving concession speeches, and, one hopes, 

a wake-up call. 

<p> Heading into Election Day, the party leadership had been positively giddy. 

Democratic National Committee Chair Terry McAuliffe even went so far as to guarantee 

a win in the Florida governor's race, crowing, ``Jeb Bush is gone.'' He also gladly 

accepted Tim Russert's skeptical challenge to put his money where his mouth was 

by agreeing to donate $2,000 to charity if his prediction of surefire Senate wins 

for Walter Mondale and Jean Carnahan didn't pan out. Get out the checkbook, Terry. 

And while you've got that pen in your hand, why not go ahead and start jotting 

down your letter of resignation? 

<p> Even as the disastrous results rolled in, McAuliffe refused to admit the obvious. 

``I think it's going to be a very good night for the Democrats,'' he told Larry 

King, moments after CNN had called yet another Senate win for the GOP. A good 

night perhaps for those Democrats with no television. But no matter. ``I think 

it's going to show that we can win north, south, east and west,'' McAuliffe Mcspun. 

<p> By Wednesday morning, the parade of ashen-faced Democrats appearing on the 

morning shows resembled the cast of ``Night of the Living Dead.'' As they tried 

to piece together the causes of the previous night's train wreck, they looked 

everywhere for clues except the one place that held all the answers -- the mirror. 

<p> McAuliffe attributed the shellacking to ``the president out there actively 

campaigning,'' as if no president had ever thought of hitting the campaign trail 

before. House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt pointed his shaky finger at an enduring 

post-9/11 bounce: ``9/11 was the big factor in this election,'' he said. Tom ``Tweedle-Dum'' 

Daschle, the South Dakota Spitfire, agreed: ``You had a president who talked a 

lot about 9/11.'' I hate to break it to you, boys, but there's going to be a Sept. 

11 before the first Tuesday in November for a long time to come. That excuse has 

a shelf life. 

<p> Memo to Tom, Dick and Terry: The problem wasn't that the president was out 

there delivering his message. The problem was that you failed to have anyone out 

there delivering any kind of galvanizing, opposing message. 

<p> And it's not as if there aren't plenty of urgent issues to choose from: the 

limping economy, the soaring deficit, corporate corruption, an energy plan crafted 

by the oil industry, the undermining of virtually every regulatory agency, the 

insanity of Bush's tax cuts. Well, I guess that last one would have been a bit 

tricky since 12 Democratic Senators sided with Bush on it, including those two 

about-to-be-former Senators Jean Carnahan and Max Cleland, both of whom voted 

yes on the Iraq resolution. Pandering to the President didn't seem to help them 

much. 

<p> To update Clauswitz, politics is war by other means. Civil war. The Republicans 

understand that. And they understand the value of denying weapons of mass distraction 

to your enemy. A case in point is the administration's masterful handling of the 

250 or so pounds of political baggage known as Harvey Pitt. Dark wizard Karl Rove 

staved off the embattled Securities and Exchange Commission chairman's inevitable 

stroll to the guillotine until the embarrassing drop of the blade could no longer 

be used against Republicans -- right about cocktail hour on Election Day. It was 

crude, cold-blooded, and brilliant. Once Pitt became a threat to their security, 

they simply exchanged him. 

<p> The Democrats' historic defeat demands a bloodletting as ruthless as Pitt's 

meticulously timed ouster. That they laid down on all the key issues is now a 

threat to all our security. The General Custer who led his party into this rout 

should be busted down to buck private for his dismal leadership -- or, more accurately, 

the lack thereof. 

<p> McAuliffe should have resigned the instant the last vote of Jeb's landslide 

victory was counted in Florida. On Black Wednesday, Gephardt announced that he 

would not be seeking reelection to his so-called leadership post. If he and Daschle 

have even an ounce of self-awareness, they will spare us the sorry spectacle of 

their expected runs for the White House. As Rep. Harold Ford of Tennessee said: 

``It's obvious that we need some fresh faces and, in some cases, fresh ideas.'' 

<p> Twelve-step programs teach us that recovery can only begin after you've bottomed 

out. If the Democrats are going to bounce back in 2004, they need to stop living 

in denial and start accepting responsibility for their spectacular crash-and-burn. 

Replacing Terry McAuliffe is a good first step. Especially now that the pool of 

available Democrats with time on their hands just got so much bigger. </p>
