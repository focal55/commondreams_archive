<p>Realistic solutions to increasing our security involve radical ideas. 

These ideas will be denounced as impossible, utopian, or unnecessary. 

But such proposals, which all have positive value apart from their 

importance to security, would actually work.



<p>We are either in dire danger, or we are not.  If the threat is as 

serious as the administration would like us to believe, than the 

response must be equally serious.  Opposition to the following 

proposals can therefore be taken as either a lack of seriousness or 

as evidence of conflicts of interest between personal profit and real 

national security.



<p>A preamble to a radical security program should eliminate the 

fascistic term "Homeland Security", to be replaced, perhaps, with 

"Domestic Security".  The following proposals could be realistically 

implemented over the next few years.  Most of them are already in 

place in some form, either at the local level in the United States or 

elsewhere.



<p>1. Eliminate nuclear power, the single most scary terrorist target.



<p>2. Build a world-class passenger rail system to provide redundency in 

our transportation networks.  An attack on our aviation system would 

never again shut the country down.



<p>3. Increase fuel economy standards for all vehicles, especially 

S.U.V.'s and passenger vans.  Let's stop sending our money to the 

terrorists via our gasoline purchases.  In addition, we should fund 

non-profit car-sharing schemes like City Car Share in San Francisco, 

which allows members to drastically reduce car usage, at least in 

urban areas.



<p>4. Adopt a national energy policy that provides for alternatives to 

nuclear power and fossil fuel production, both domestic and foreign. 

We should increase funding for clean, renewable sources of energy, 

including solar and wind power.  This can be done by subsidizing 

local efforts to provide alternative power such as the $100 million 

solar bond measure recently passed in San Francisco.  We should also 

fund programs to increase energy efficiency in all aspects of the 

economy, and to improve energy conservation efforts.  Finally, we 

should move away from private energy companies and towards the sort 

of democratic, local public power generation represented by the 

Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD).



<p>5. Enact universal, single-payer health insurance.  This would 

improve public health and our ability to respond to an attack with 

biological weapons.  The significant number of Americans who are 

uninsured or under-insured are particularly vulnerable, but a large 

outbreak would threaten even those suburbanites who vote Republican 

and think that they are safe in their gated enclaves.



<p>6. Encourage Israel to withdraw immediately from the territories 

occupied in 1967, and support the establishment of a Palestinian 

state within these borders.  We should work with both sides to assure 

the security of each state and validity of the borders.



<p>7. End the client-state system of American empire.  We must cease all 

funding and arming of non-democratic governments, with Saudi Arabia, 

Pakistan, and Egypt at the top of the list.  After all, it should be 

assumed that whoever funds and arms dictatorships will be the object 

of resentment and reprisal from those who suffer under such regimes. 

We should then immediately announce a plan to provide economic 

development aid (not loans) for those nations and political 

organizations willing to democratize and observe international human 

rights standards.



<p>8. Start to observe democracy and human rights standards in our own 

domestic and foreign policy (see the Amnesty International report on 

human rights in the United States).  This will improve the sort of 

good will necessary for international cooperation in police work. 

International good will toward the U.S. was prominent in the 

immediate aftermath of September 11th.  It has been completely 

squandered by the Bush administration, who have succeeded in the 

dubious achievement of uniting most of the world against us.



<p>You won't hear the Bush administration or the Democrats talk about 

these types of solutions, because they are not serious about reducing 

terrorism.  Their primary goals are political and economic power for 

themselves and their clients in corporate America, who fund their 

campaigns.  First in importance among these corporate donors are the 

energy companies, who help so much to put the "conflict" in "conflic 

of interest."  Terrorism is the natural outcome of such arrangements, 

and is seen as worth the price.



<p>These proposals would cost money, but probably not as much money as 

will be spent on useless weapons systems like "Star Wars" (not very 

helpful in fighting fanatics armed with box cutters) and perpetual 

wars involving the bombing of brown-skinned people.  Needless to say, 

in addition to increasing our security dramatically, radical policies 

would have tremendous environmental and economic benefits.  In the 

end, they would likely generate revenue and help to democratize our 

economy.



<p>We know that anyone driving an S.U.V. while waving a flag is either 

ignorant or in serious denial concerning world politics.  But how 

many Americans would consider the above solutions?  How scared are 

we?  How serious are we?  What are we willing to give up?



<p>When we see the opposition to the above proposals in congress, we can 

conclude at the very least that our problems are not technical, but 

political.  A necessary first step to the realization of the above 

program would therefore be to implement real democracy in America. 

This would involve, among other reforms, public financing of 

political campaigns, as the citizens of Maine have done, and Instant 

Runoff Voting (IRV), which recently passed in San Francisco.



<p>If terrorism is a long-term threat to the innocent citizens of the 

United States, and it will be as long as we continue with our 

imperial policies, than we should be looking at long-term solutions, 

not short-term bombing campaigns.  Let's demonstrate a seriousness 

about a subject that the Bush/Cheney/Rumsfeld cabal refuse to take 

seriously.  Let's admit that the only serious solutions are utopian.
