<p>IS GEORGE BUSH about to get lucky again?

<P>White House political adviser Karl Rove has positioned Bush as the champion 

of corporate reform, even though Bush's own history epitomized the kind of corruption 

that Enron and Global Crossing raised to new heights. Last week Congressional 

Republicans, long obstructionist on this issue, quickly reversed course, too. 

By the endgame the House Republican leadership - after proposing much weaker legislation 

- has embraced the reform bill proposed by Democratic Senator Paul Sarbanes of 

Maryland and then some. And the financial markets helped with the biggest one-week 

rally since 1933. </P>

<P>So President Bush - Mr. Education, Mr. Drug Benefit - is now Mr. Corporate 

Reform. Is the latter any more believable than the former? This will depend on 

two factors - the economy and the Democrats.</P>

<P>At this writing, despite the market comeback, a lot of real damage has been 

done to the real economy by the same abuses that caused the market slide. And 

it is unlikely that the economy is headed back into a boom any time soon - certainly 

not before the November midterm elections. </P>

<P>However, despite their exemplary leadership on corporate reform, it is difficult 

for the Democrats to define the corporate scandals in purely partisan terms. Just 

enough Democrats were complicit in the financial and corporate deregulation of 

the 1980s and 1990s that caused the scandals. Nor can the shackling of the Securities 

and Exchange Commission be laid squarely at the feet of the Republicans. However, 

it is possible to pin the blame squarely on conservative ideology. So any partisan 

gains by the Democrats would need to be ideological gains - faulting the ideology 

of market worship whose main vehicle is the Republican Party.</P>

<P>The Sarbanes bill on corporate and accounting reform was only a modest first 

step. There are other kinds of abuses still at work. Yet as soon as Democratic 

progressives try to press for broader reform, they run into allies of corporate 

abuse right in their own party. Michigan Senator Carl Levin's efforts to compel 

stock options to be treated as ordinary expenses is Exhibit A. Democrats, as well 

as Republicans, have grown dependent on fat campaign contributions from the technology 

industry. The very week that both parties were outdoing each other to champion 

accounting reform, corporate lobbyists managed to isolate Levin and options reform.</P>

<P>The fact is, it's possible to reward corporate executives for performance in 

a variety of ways that neither compromise balance sheets nor invite manipulation 

the way options do. It is possible to base executive pay on performance so that 

bonuses vary with bona fide earnings or market share. It's also possible to compensate 

executives with ordinary grants of stock rather than options to purchase stock 

that have value only at a certain price. The fact that many Democrats have flinched 

from embracing even the Levin reforms suggests how compromised the party still 

is.</P>

<P>The other day Senator Joe Lieberman, looking for a way to wriggle out of his 

promise not to run for president against Al Gore, scolded Gore for abandoning 

the New Democrat faith by actually promising in the 2000 campaign to fight for 

those left behind by the late economic boom. That was about the only thing Gore 

did right. </P>

<P>Even at a time when the corporate sacking of the economy is demonstrating why 

ordinary people need both government and a progressive party that believes in 

government's necessary role, this New Democrat undertow will compromise Democrats' 

ability to seize the moment. Gore will contest Lieberman and the others based 

on a money primary in which fund-raising pays for polling and media and the actual 

voters are spectators. Democrats could well be whipsawed, as in previous elections, 

between wealthy donors and their apologists warning that ''growth'' (being soft 

on business abuse) rather than ''class warfare'' (championing the pocketbook interests 

of the nonrich) is the winning recipe for the party.</P>

<P>Despite this split, the corporate abuses and the peculiarly Republican odor 

emanating from them improve the Democrats' prospects both in this November's midterm 

elections and in 2004. But this is an opportunity that Democrats themselves can 

squander if they let their own corporate wing call the tune.</P>

<P>There also remains the issue of George W. Bush's own personal vulnerability 

(not to mention Vice President Cheney's). The Harken Energy abuses, like Cheney's 

reign at Halliburton, cry out for further investigation. They are certainly a 

far bigger deal, on the merits, than Whitewater. Whether they turn into serious 

political liabilities for the White House depends on whether the opposition party 

has the stomach to demand a full investigation. </P>
