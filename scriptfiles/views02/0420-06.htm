<i>"Caracas, Venezuela &#151; This country's swaggering leftist leader was ousted 

by the military last night amid chaos that has shaken the world's fourth-largest 

oil exporter, ridding the U.S. of a government it considered a political pariah."</i><BR>

<li type=square>The Wall Street Journal, April 12, 2002, referring to the coup 

that ousted Venezuelan president Hugo Chvez for 48 hours 

<P> 

<P> It is hardly worth mentioning. That explains why as of this writing nothing 

was written about in The New York Times or the Washington Post. The L.A. Times 

and the Houston Chronicle as well as the Voice of America thought it newsworthy. 

They are right. Some day the rest of the country may find it newsworthy. It will 

just take time. It's not just about Venezuela. That's already history (to the 

dismay of the administration). It's about Colombia. 

<P> The whole world knows all that the United States has done to help Colombia 

eliminate coca. It has not been easy. It has been especially hard for the people 

who live in Colombia but it is a sacrifice they have gladly made. Less than a 

month ago this space was devoted to describing the effects of our helping Colombia 

eliminate coca by spraying farm land with glyphosphate products. One of the effects 

was to wipe out most of the crops in the town of La Hormiga. Describing the effects, 

Carlos Alberto Palacios, Secretary of Human Development in that town said: "We 

believe people will go hungry. They've fumigated everything, fields and plantain 

rows and yucca and everything that people need to live on." He neglected to point 

out that the upside is that it will make it more difficult for the affluent in 

other parts of the world to enjoy the fruits of the coca plant which is the sort 

of selfish oversight we've come to expect from those we seek to help. 

<P> In that same space it was observed that given the enormous success enjoyed 

by the Bush and prior administrations in destroying Colombian coca crops, administration 

officials were hoping to expand their aid to Colombia by helping its armed forces 

protect an oil pipeline from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia known 

as FARC. The pipeline brings oil from the northeastern part of Colombia to the 

coast where it can be put on ships and taken to SUVs in the United States. We 

have now been told by the news sources named above that we may begin doing more 

than that. 

<P> Republican lawmakers and Bush administration officials have concluded that 

guerrilla war in Colombia threatens the security of the United States. Although 

it has not yet formally proclaimed FARC a terrorist organization, it is only a 

matter of time until that conclusion is reached. In a hearing held by the Western 

Hemisphere subcommittee, a panel of the House International Relations Committee, 

Henry Hyde, chairman of the committee, called Colombia "a potential breeding ground 

for international terror equaled perhaps only by Afghanistan." Disagreeing with 

the chair, Ron Paul, a member of the House from Texas, observed that the Colombian 

war has been going on since the 1940s and is not the same as fighting terrorists 

in Afghanistan. Relating it to the attack of 9/11, he said: "I think this is really, 

really a stretch." It may be, but that isn't stopping the administration. 

<P> On April 11, Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Marc Grossman urged 

members of the House committee to lift legal barriers that prevent Colombia from 

using more than $1 billion in U.S. aid to fight leftist rebels. He wants it to 

be permitted to use U.S.-funded combat helicopters to battle rebels, thus enabling 

it to regain control over territory now controlled by FARC. This request comes 

on top of President Bush's request a few weeks earlier for a $98-million aid package 

to train and equip Colombian troops to protect the 770-kilometer Cano Limon pipeline 

that carries Occidental Oil company's oil to the coast. The pipeline has, to Occidental's 

understandable distress, been bombed repeatedly by the rebels which greatly decreases 

Occidental's profits from the operations. Mr. Bush understands that kind of distress 

since he, too, was once in the oil business. 

<P> Bob Menendez, a member of the House from New Jersey, said: "We cannot fight 

the Colombians' battles for them." He asked Otto Reich, assistant secretary of 

state for Western Hemisphere affairs, what the Bush administration hoped to accomplish 

by its expanded role in Colombia. The answer was: "[A] free democratic state in 

Colombia that continues to be a good friend of the United States and a good, friendly 

neighbor that doesn't pose a threat." The second goal, said he, is: "to eliminate 

the threat to our own people from terrorists and narcotics traffickers that are 

poisoning our population with their product and that could pose a threat from 

Colombia. . . . to the region and to the United States." 

<P> Messrs. Grossman and Reich probably forgot what Secretary of State Colin Powell 

had said when testifying in favor of permitting the Colombians to use U.S. aid 

to protect Occidental's pipeline and profits. Mr. Powell was asked whether permitting 

that use of aid would result in direct U.S. involvement in government-supported 

counterinsurgency activities. Mr. Powell said we had not crossed the line. He 

said: "I think it's a close line. I don't think it's quite into counterinsurgency 

to the extent that they're not using this investment and this new capability to 

go running into the jungles looking for the insurgents, but essentially protect 

a unique facility." 

<P> (For "unique" it is appropriate to substitute "Occidental"). 

<P> While Mr. Powell was off in the Middle East trying to use the United States' 

influence to bring an end to violence, Mr. Reich and Mr. Grossman were in Washington 

trying to expand it in Colombia. It's too bad Mr. Powell wasn't here to straighten 

them out. By the time he gets back it may be too late.
