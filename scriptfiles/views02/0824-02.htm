<p>PARIS</b> </a> The death in Baghdad of the Abu Nidal, the Palestinian terrorist, 

conveys a lesson generally neglected in today's American war against terrorism.

<p>The lesson is that Middle Eastern terrorism has been around for a long time 

and has been worse in the past than it is today. It has never been “defeated,” 

nor have its motivations ever been simple. Americans did not notice, because they 

were rarely the victims. Americans noticed Al Qaeda because Osama bin Laden made 

them notice last Sept. 11, and because he declares the United States his enemy.

<p>For Abu Nidal, there were two avowed enemies: Israel and the Palestinian leaders 

who were prepared to consider a peaceful settlement with Israel. Whether these 

were really his enemies, or whether he was a hired gun, of Israel among others, 

is questioned, as Patrick Seale has written (<i>IHT, Aug. 22</i>). The current 

violence in Israel and the Palestinian territories has been an appalling form 

of war between two defined national entities, the Palestinians and the Israelis, 

with the two sides using the weapons available to them, high-tech on the Israeli 

side, the suicidal act of terrorism on the Palestinian. Abu Nidal's organization, 

in contrast, practiced terror for personal power and profit. His followers killed 

or wounded nearly a thousand people in 20 countries between 1973 and 1994. Had 

he thought of crashing airplanes into office towers, and found the people to do 

it, and had it been useful to him, he undoubtedly would have killed many more 

than Al Qaeda has done. His seeming obsession was the destruction of Israel. But 

his actions, overall, tended to suit Israel's tactical interests. Some in the 

Arab world accused him of cynical secret collaboration with Israel, contributing 

to the subversion of the Palestine Liberation Organization, and providing a pretext 

for Israel's invasion of Lebanon in 1982 - in an effort to destroy that organization, 

which then had its headquarters there.

<p>Israel's creation had ruined his father and family, before 1948 one of the 

richest and most successful in the old British Mandated Palestine. His father 

was said to have controlled l0 percent of pre-1948 Palestine's produce exports 

to Europe. The family's agricultural properties were expropriated by Israel. He 

joined Yasser Arafat's Fatah.

<p>After the 1973 Yom Kippur War, when Israel had been shocked by its initial 

defeats in simultaneous Egyptian and Syrian invasions, Yasser Arafat gave his 

first indication of possible compromise with the Israelis. Abu Nidal broke with 

him. He began killing those PLO officials who approached the Israelis about peace. 

He was responsible for the murders of PLO representatives in London, Brussels, 

and Rome. His people attacked Arafat deputies and associates in the organization's 

exile headquarters in Tunis. Some credit Abu Nidal's attacks on PLO moderates 

as having seriously if not fatally delayed Palestinian implementation of the peace 

program launched in Oslo in 1993.

<p>He also believed in the utility of indiscriminate terror. His organization 

attacked passengers on a Greek tourist ship, worshippers at Sabbath services in 

a Turkish synagogue and several airliners. In 1982, his militants bombed a well-known 

Jewish restaurant in Paris. In 1985, on the same day and at the same hour, they 

machine-gunned crowds at El Al counters in Rome and Vienna.

<p>He was sentenced in absentia to death in Italy, and was wanted by courts or 

investigators in the United States, Britain and France. The PLO condemned him 

to death. His presence in Iraq has been one reason given by the United States 

for calling that nation a &quot;rogue state.&quot; The State Department once described 

his group as &quot;the most dangerous terrorist organization in existence.&quot; 

<p>Some in the Middle East concluded that he was a psychopath, a victim of paranoia 

that caused him to murder some 150 of his own followers, suspected of dissidence. 

Others, as Seale has written, thought him a mercenary traitor to his ostensible 

cause. He has been quiet for the last 10 years, and now he is dead - according 

to the Iraqis a traitor to their interests. Possibly he had been recruited, via 

intermediaries in the Gulf, to the American cause, so as to spare the United States 

a war to dispose of Saddam Hussein. Possibly even Mossad got back to him. Possibly 

Saddam simply decided that he was an inconvenience. Only his enemies still remembered 

him, until his death sent the newspaper obituary writers to their files this week. 

But in his day he did a lot of harm, and was a big man - just as Osama bin Laden 

is a big man today.
