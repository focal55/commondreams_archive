<p>The memorial at Kent State University was the perfect place to walk and talk 

with Paul Wellstone. He was hurting from an old college wrestling injury, and 

perhaps, though we didn't know it then, from the onset of MS. So he could barely 

move around. But what walking he could do, he did with grace. An athlete in pain. 

<p>Paul was also, as always, sharp and committed. We were awaiting our turns to 

speak to an energetic band of young citizen activists, fresh out of college. They 

were bright, progressive environmentalists, full of vim and promise, a welcome 

island in the 1990s sea of Clintonian materialism. 

<p>As we circled the memorial we found ourselves close to tears. When this official 

butchery happened, we were both active in the movement against the war in Vietnam. 

The 1970 shooting, engineered by Richard Nixon and Ohio Gov. James A. Rhodes, 

sent a message: you could be killed. 

<p>We took it personally. The dead were our slightly younger compatriots. They 

were white, middle class innocents exercising their sacred American rights on 

the sanctuary of a college campus. The use of live ammunition by National Guardsmen 

not much older than the students they were killing was a horrifying breach of 

faith. The war had come home. 

<p>But in the mid 1990s, as we walked through the memorial and saw where the Guardsmen 

were when they fired, and where the students were when they fell, Paul and I had 

a different perspective. Now we felt it as parents, ingesting the heartsickness 

of what it must have meant to scrape together enough to send children to a state 

university only to see them gunned down with bullets paid for by our own tax dollars. 

An utterly terrifying hurt. 

<p>And now, soulsick again, we ask: how can we possibly replace Paul Wellstone? 

<p>Paul's speech at Kent was, as always, full of fire. The son of immigrant Jews, 

he was an unabashed prairie populist. He preached the old-time grass roots religion. 

His unswerving belief in democracy and the basic wisdom of average people was 

a faith he alone carried into the US Senate until he was joined by Wisconsin's 

Russ Feingold, who was inspired by Paul to run. 

<p>Indeed, the idea that such a man could be in the US Senate seems an inherent 

impossibility. Today it is a body almost totally defined by money and the hollow 

rhetoric it buys. By contrast, Paul was grounded in the best realities of the 

American democratic tradition. His primary commitment was to the basics of social 

justice and human rights. 

<p>Paul's election campaigns also illustrated a lesson the Democratic Party seems 

incapable of learning. In 1996, in the midst of a tough re-election campaign, 

Wellstone voted against Bill Clinton's harsh, cynical welfare "reform" bill. Conventional 

wisdom said this would doom his re-election bid. But Paul's poll numbers immediately 

jumped, and he walked back into office. 

<p>This year, alone among Democrats in competitive races, Wellstone cast a principled 

vote against granting George Bush blanket war powers. Again, conventional wisdom 

said this would doom his campaign. Again his poll numbers leapt up, and his campaign 

took on the aspect of a winner. 

<p>The personal tragedy of Paul's fiery death, with his wife, his daughter, campaign 

aides and two pilots, is staggering. And so is the loss of Paul as a political 

player. 

<p>Aside from Feingold, whose style is far less emotional, Paul's commitments 

in the Senate were completely unique. He was willing to go to Colombia and shout 

against the injustice and brutality of the US "drug war" there. The issues of 

poverty, social injustice and racism stayed at the core of his being in a time 

when the smug essence of being a US Senator is about using the rhetoric of those 

issues as occasional window dressing. Paul genuinely believed in the need to save 

the environment, stop nuclear power and bring on an era of renewable energy, and 

he acted on those beliefs. 

<p>Wellstone's demise has further destabilized an already deeply troubled election. 

When Missouri's Mel Carnahan died in a plane crash in 2000, his name successfully 

remained on the ballot, and the Democratic governor filled the seat with Carnahan's 

wife, who is now fighting desperately to retain it. 

<p>In Minnesota, the governor is Jesse Ventura, and the situation is chaotic. 

The Democrats are hoping to replace Wellstone with the much more conservative 

Walter Mondale. Very importantly, Mondale might hold the seat, and thus help retain 

a Democratic edge in the Senate, preserving a crucial, tiny brake on the authoritarian 

power of the Bush regime. 

<p>But Walter Mondale is no Paul Wellstone. Someone tangible, on a day-to-day 

basis, has to pick up the physical work he did and do it just as well. 

<p>I know of one such instance. In 1995 the great George M. Barley died in a mysterious 

plane crash. George was a successful, much-loved businessman whose passion was 

to save the Florida Everglades. His ceaseless energy and effective brilliance 

seemed to make him the indispensable man in a brutal campaign against the entrenched 

power of Big Sugar. When he died, common wisdom said all that would end, and that 

the Everglades were hopelessly doomed. 

<p>But his wife Mary picked up the charge and has made George's legacy into a 

viable political reality. Helping to found a wide range of Save-the Everglades 

organizations, Mary led the campaign to win the nation's first "make the polluter 

pay" amendment to a state constitution. She was greatly responsible for federal 

legislation earmarking up to $8 billion to save the Everglades. She has become 

known far and wide as the essential guardian of that irreplaceable natural treasure. 

<p>Tragically, the wonderful Sheila Wellstone died with Paul, along with their 

daughter. His sons may yet have their day. But ultimately, Paul showed that with 

virtually no money, and a whole lot of spunk and commitment, individuals can change 

the world. 

<p>Paul chose to do that, against all odds, by somehow getting into the US Senate, 

and then keeping the faith once there. Paul inspired Russ Feingold to do much 

the same in winning a Senate seat in neighboring Wisconsin. Feingold then joined 

John McCain to win the first battle in the long war for election finance reform. 

Hopefully that, in turn, could jar the door for others like Paul who might keep 

their commitment to actually serve the people who elect them. 

<p>Paul Wellstone now stands as a role model for those wanting to reclaim a political 

system thoroughly corrupted and debased by big money. 

<p>No one can personally replace this dear brother. But we are obliged to try. 

The work he set out to do, the commitments he made, and the vacuum he left us 

to fill are as clear as the light in Paul's eyes when he shouted his passion to 

all who would listen.
