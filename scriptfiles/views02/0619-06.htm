<p>While most of the officials attending the U.S. Conference of Mayors gathering 

were only too willing to be feted by tobacco giant Philip Morris on Sunday night 

at the University of Wisconsin Memorial Union, one of the conferees was on the 

outside with those protesting the closing of the campus building for the corporate 

luau. 

<P>Among several hundred protesters peacefully chanting "Who's union? Our union" 

was Santa Monica Mayor Mike Feinstein. Feinstein, still wearing his official Conference 

of Mayors name tag, said the marchers were right that corporate sponsors had far 

too much influence over the agenda of this year's gathering of mayors. 

<P>"The corporate presence is far greater than is healthy," said Feinstein, who 

has served as mayor of the California city of 84,000 since 2000, and who has been 

extremely active in a number of national organizations dealing with municipal 

issues. 

<P>"I know people say that the Conference of Mayors needs corporate sponsorships 

to pay for events like this," Feinstein said. "But that calculation misses the 

point that many of these corporations are responsible for blocking the agenda 

that's best for America's cities." 

<P>Corporations that help pay for Conference of Mayors events also lobby at the 

federal, state and local levels for budget priorities that make it harder for 

cities to serve the vast majority of their citizens, Feinstein noted. In addition, 

he says, these same corporations, through their political action committees and 

the special interest organizations they fund, are often some of the biggest campaign 

contributors to political candidates who oppose urban America's agenda. 

<P>"It is not hard to connect the dots," says Feinstein. "It's just ironic that 

so many mayors don't understand that when they open the doors to corporate sponsors 

they are also opening the doors to corporate influence over the discussion." 

<P>As an example, Feinstein pointed to the debate over affordable housing at this 

year's Conference of Mayors gathering. 

<P>"When you have a session where one of the main speakers is a representative 

of the banking industry, like we did this weekend, the discussion is steered toward 

charges that public processes and regulations are the problem," Feinstein said. 

"What is not discussed is the role that public processes and regulations play 

in making cities livable. What is not discussed is the whole issue of whether 

it is necessarily good for a community when property values rise and a few developers 

and real estate interests make enormous profits." 

<P>A Green Party activist, Feinstein has worked with Santa Monica labor unions 

to promote union organizing and living wage campaigns. Like those protesting outside 

conference events, he says city officials need to focus a great deal more attention 

on issues of income equity. And, like the protesters, he is certain that the access 

corporate lobbyists buy at events like the U.S. Conference of Mayors gathering 

limits the attention to those issues. 

<P>"The access to public officials that corporations have leads directly to the 

maldistribution of wealth that we see in this country. The maldistribution of 

wealth at a national level means that municipalities don't have the resources 

that are needed," explains Feinstein, who has attended issue-oriented sessions 

at this year's Conference of Mayors gathering while skipping many of the corporate-sponsored 

parties. 

<P>The Santa Monica mayor says the U.S. Conference of Mayors should reject corporate 

money and hold more "bare-bones" conferences where corporate glitz is traded for 

substance and frank discussions about the economic concerns that ail American 

cities. 

<P>"The problem is that we get together at meetings like this and complain about 

the lack of resources," says Feinstein of his fellow mayors. "And we do that complaining 

while surrounded by the very people (corporate lobbyists) who create the problem. 

If we want to make a better future for cities, we should start by changing how 

the Conference of Mayors does business."
