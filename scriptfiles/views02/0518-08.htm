<p> President Bush would like to invade Iraq and topple its odious leader, 

Saddam Hussein. In seeking this outcome, Bush has the support of many 

officials, members of Congress, and others who deplore Hussein's 

dictatorial regime and pursuit of nuclear, chemical, and biological 

weapons. But while there are many good reasons for wishing for the removal 

of Hussein, there are equally good reasons for questioning the 

desirability of a U.S. invasion. 



<p>The logic for such an invasion was first spelled out in Bush's State of 

the Union address of Jan. 29. "By seeking weapons of mass destruction," he 

asserted, states such as Iraq "pose a grave and a growing danger." Under 

these circumstances, "I cannot stand by, as the peril grows closer and 

closer. . . . The United States of America will not permit the world's 

most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world's most destructive 

weapons." 



<p>Of course, Bush did not state openly that the surest way to accomplish 

this is through a full-scale invasion of Iraq. That would alarm America's 

allies, and possibly upset those Americans who believe that the top 

priority right now is to fight al Qaeda and capture those responsible for 

the Sept. 11 attacks on New York and Washington. But there is no doubt 

than an invasion is what Bush has in mind: According to recent press 

accounts, the Pentagon is actively planning for a Desert Storm-like 

operation involving hundreds of thousands of American military personnel. 



<p>Such an operation, if backed by the full weight of U.S. combat power, 

would assuredly weaken Iraqi defenses and result in the occupation of 

Baghdad. Presumably, Hussein would be captured or killed and his 

nuclear-chemical- biological laboratories destroyed. A new government 

would be set up under U.S. tutelage, allowing for the lifting of the 

onerous U.N. trade sanctions on Iraq. 



<p>All this sounds ideal -- so why question the desirability of an American 

invasion? The answer lies in the unavoidable implications of the two key 

words, "American" and "invasion." 



<p>First, the problem with "American." Undoubtedly, Bush would prefer that 

any invasion of Iraq be supported by a coalition of like-minded powers (as 

was the 1991 invasion of Kuwait) and be preceded by an internal "uprising" 

by anti- Hussein forces (similar to the attacks mounted by the Northern 

Alliance against the Taliban in Afghanistan). But neither of these 

scenarios is likely to occur. None of our allies (save, perhaps, for 

Britain) is likely to support such a move, while most of the Arab states 

-- including those who participated in Desert Storm -- will oppose it. 



<p>Furthermore, the anti-government forces within Iraq are too weak to stand 

up to Hussein's armies, while the opposition forces outside the country 

(such as the Iraqi National Congress in London) have too little domestic 

support to lead an authentic uprising. So the invasion, when it occurs, 

will be an almost entirely American affair. This is not good news. 

Operation Desert Storm succeeded to the degree that it did because the 

United States was acting with the support of the international community 

and received critical assistance from Arab states in the region. 



<p>In addition, the highly visible use of American military power against an 

Arab Muslim country -- coming on top of the highly visible use of Israeli 

military power against an Arab Muslim population -- is certain to provoke 

anti-American demonstrations throughout the Islamic world and invite 

numerous acts of terrorism. These demonstrations might prove so forceful 

as to threaten the stability of pro-American governments in the area, 

including those in Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia. 



<p>When the war is over, moreover, the United States will be faced with the 

unenviable task of creating a stable, pro-Western government in Baghdad. 

This could mean deploying a sizable American force there for a long time 

to come as various internal factions fight over the spoils -- a situation 

all too evident in Afghanistan today. And no one will want to assist us in 

controlling the chaos. 



<p>Next, the problem with "invasion." In almost all of the previous uses of 

military force by the United States abroad, the exercise of American power 

was triggered by a direct attack on this country (as in Pearl Harbor and 

Sept. 11) or by unambiguous aggression against an ally (as in North 

Korea's 1950 invasion of South Korea and Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait). 



<p>But there has been neither type of provocation in this case. Hussein may

fantasize about an attack on the United States or Kuwait, but he has no 

capacity to execute such scenarios and will not for some time to come. So 

we are speaking here of an unprovoked American invasion in anticipation of 

a hypothetical Iraqi attack. 



<p>There are many in Washington who seem to be untroubled by such a move. 

Pre- emptive action is justified, they claim, by past Iraqi aggression and 

the assertion -- unsupported by any evidence -- that Baghdad is 

contemplating some new atrocity. But the American public has always 

demanded more than this. We have been reluctant to risk the blood of our 

soldiers unless we have come under attack or have become convinced, after 

sustained national debate, that all other forms of redress have been 

exhausted. In a democracy, this is the only sure way to ensure public 

support for a costly and dangerous military engagement. 



<p>We have not yet had this debate. The proponents of invasion have not 

produced any evidence that Iraq is manufacturing weapons of mass 

destruction, or that a direct attack is the only way to secure America's 

safety. What is wrong with the existing system of air patrols and space 

surveillance, which ensure that Iraq cannot build any large weapons plants 

without inviting detection and destruction? Unless and until Bush can 

address these concerns, a direct U.S. invasion of Iraq would represent a 

violation of basic American values and jeopardize the vigor of our 

democracy.
