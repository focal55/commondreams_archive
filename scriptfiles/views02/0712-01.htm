<p>The current crisis in American capitalism isn't just about the specific details 

— about tricky accounting, stock options, loans to executives, and so on. It's 

about the way the game has been rigged on behalf of insiders. </p>

<P> And the Bush administration is full of such insiders. That's why President 

Bush cannot get away with merely rhetorical opposition to executive wrongdoers. 

To give the most extreme example (so far), how can we take his moralizing seriously 

when Thomas White — whose division of <org idsrc="NYSE" value="ENRNQ;ENE-J">Enron</org> 

generated $500 million in phony profits, and who sold $12 million in stock just 

before the company collapsed — is still secretary of the Army? </p>

<P> Yet everything Mr. Bush has said and done lately shows that he doesn't get 

it. Asked about the Aloha Petroleum deal at his former company <org idsrc="AMEX" value="HEC">Harken 

Energy</org> — in which big profits were recorded on a sale that was paid for 

by the company itself, a transaction that obviously had no meaning except as a 

way to inflate reported earnings — he responded, "There was an honest difference 

of opinion. . . . sometimes things aren't exactly black-and-white when it comes 

to accounting procedures." </p>

<P> And he still opposes both reforms that would reduce the incentives for corporate 

scams, such as requiring companies to count executive stock options against profits, 

and reforms that would make it harder to carry out such scams, such as not allowing 

accountants to take consulting fees from the same firms they audit.</p>

<P> The closest thing to a substantive proposal in Mr. Bush's tough-talking, nearly 

content-free speech on Tuesday was his call for extra punishment for executives 

convicted of fraud. But that's an empty threat. In reality, top executives rarely 

get charged with crimes; not a single indictment has yet been brought in the Enron 

affair, and even "Chainsaw Al" Dunlap, a serial book-cooker, faces only a civil 

suit. And they almost never get convicted. Accounting issues are technical enough 

to confuse many juries; expensive lawyers make the most of that confusion; and 

if all else fails, big-name executives have friends in high places who protect 

them.</p>

<P> In this as in so much of the corporate governance issue, the current wave 

of scandal is prefigured by President Bush's own history.</p>

<P> An aside: Some pundits have tried to dismiss questions about Mr. Bush's business 

career as unfair — it was long ago, and hence irrelevant. Yet many of these same 

pundits thought it was perfectly appropriate to spend seven years and $70 million 

investigating a failed land deal that was even further in Bill Clinton's past. 

And if they want something more recent, how about reporting on the story of Mr. 

Bush's extraordinarily lucrative investment in the Texas Rangers, which became 

so profitable because of a highly incestuous web of public policy and private 

deals? As in the case of Harken, no hard work is necessary; Joe Conason laid it 

all out in Harper's almost two years ago. </p>

<P> But the Harken story still has more to teach us, because the S.E.C. investigation 

into Mr. Bush's stock sale is a perfect illustration of why his tough talk won't 

scare well-connected malefactors.</p>

<P> Mr. Bush claims that he was "vetted" by the S.E.C. In fact, the agency's investigation 

was peculiarly perfunctory. It somehow decided that Mr. Bush's perfectly timed 

stock sale did not reflect inside information without interviewing him, or any 

other members of Harken's board. Maybe top officials at the S.E.C. felt they already 

knew enough about Mr. Bush: his father, the president, had appointed a good friend 

as S.E.C. chairman. And the general counsel, who would normally make decisions 

about legal action, had previously been George W. Bush's personal lawyer — he 

negotiated the purchase of the Texas Rangers. I am not making this up.</p>

<P> Most corporate wrongdoers won't be quite as well connected as the young Mr. 

Bush; but like him, they will expect, and probably receive, kid-glove treatment. 

In an interesting parallel, today's S.E.C., which claims to be investigating the 

highly questionable accounting at <org idsrc="NYSE" value="HAL">Halliburton</org> 

that turned a loss into a reported profit, has yet to interview the C.E.O. at 

the time — Dick Cheney. </p>

<P> The bottom line is that in the last week any hopes you might have had that 

Mr. Bush would make a break from his past and champion desperately needed corporate 

reform have been dashed. Mr. Bush is not a real reformer; he just plays one on 

TV. </p>
