What is the difference between State terrorism and individual terrorist acts? If we understand this difference we'll understand also

the evilness of the   US policies in the Middle East and the 

forthcoming disasters. When Yassir Arafat was put under siege in his 

offices and kept hostage by the Israeli occupation forces, he was constantly pressed into condemning terror and combatting terrorism. Israel's Stateterrorism is defined by US officials as "self-defense", while individual suicide bombers are called terrorists.



<p>The only 'small' difference is that Israeli aggression is the direct responsibility of Ariel Sharon, Benjamin Ben Eliezer, Shimon Peres and Shaul Mofaz, while the individual terrorist acts are done by individuals in despair, usually against Arafat's will. One hour after Arafat declared his support of a cease fire and wished the Jews a Happy Passover feast, a suicide bomber exploded himself in an hotel in Netanya, killing 22 innocent Jews celebrating Passover. Arafat was blamed as responsible for this act, and the present IDF offensive has been justified through this accusation.



<p>At the same time, Sharon's responsibility for Israeli war crimes is being completely ignored. Who should be arrested for the targeted killing of almost 100 Palestinians? Who will be sent to jail for the killing of more than 120 Palestinian paramedics? Who will be sentenced for the killing of more than 1,200 Palestinians and for the collective punishment of more than 3,000,000 civilians during the last 18 months? And who will face the International Tribunal for the illegal settlement of occupied Palestinian Lands, and the disobedience of UN decisions for more than 35 years?



<p>Suicide bombs killing innocent citizens must be unequivocally condemned; they are immoral acts, and their perpetrators should be 

sent to jail. But they cannot be compared to State terrorism carried out by the Israeli Government. The former are individual acts of 

despair of a people that sees no future, vastly ignored by an unfair and distorted international public opinion. The latter are cold and 

"rational" decisions of a State and a military apparatus of 

occupation, well equipped, financed and backed by the only superpower in the world.



<p>Yet in the public debate, State terrorism and individual suicide bombs are not even considered as comparable cases of terrorism. The State terror and war crimes perpetrated by the Israeli Government are legitimized as "self-defense", while Arafat, even under siege, is demanded to arrest "terrorists."



<p>I want to ask: Who will arrest Sharon, the person directly responsible for the orders to kill Palestinians? When is he going to 

be defined a terrorist too? How long will the world ignore the 

Palestinian cry that all they want is freedom and independence? When will it stop neglecting the fact that the goal of the Israeli 

Government is not security, but the continued occupation and subjugation of the Palestinian people?

   

<p>As Israelis in the opposition, we are fighting against our government, but the international support that Sharon receives is constantly jeopardizing our struggle. The whole international public opinion must be reverted, and the UN must deploy intervention forces 

in order to stop the bloodshed and the imminent deterioration. Israelis and Palestinians desperately need the awakening of the 

international community's public opinion and a reversal in the global attitude. These are needed both in order to save our lives (literally), and preserve our hope in a better future.
