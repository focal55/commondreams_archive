<p>Stephen Zunes's "<a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views02/0825-01.htm">Don't 

Blame the Jews for Cynthia McKinney's Defeat</a>" (Aug. 26) is seriously misleading 

on the facts and perverse in its policy conclusions. Zunes says it was not just 

Jewish money that did McKinney in, there were "cross-over votes" and even larger 

sums from business and other establishment parties hostile to her. But Zunes fails 

to mention that just a few weeks earlier Ike Hilliard, another black representative 

who had been critical of Israeli policy, was similarly crushed, and there were 

no "crossover votes" or business hostility in that case, just massive sums of 

Jewish money. The unique factor in both elections was the anger at these blacks 

for daring to oppose Israeli policy, which suddenly made their elections of national 

interest and led to strong support for their opponents. 

<p>But Zunes's analysis is equally deficient in its failure to provide context. 

He has long challenged the notion that the pro- Israel lobby is a major force 

in influencing U.S. policy, and in his frequent (and often insightful) articles 

as Middle East Editor of Foreign Policy in Focus, he regularly discusses U.S. 

policy toward Israel without mentioning the lobby's existence. This is truly head-in-sand 

analysis. Numerous U.S. legislators of high quality have been driven out of office 

for opposing a carte blanche to Israel, and some who have survived have openly 

acknowledged that they follow a pro-Israel line for political safety and survival. 

William Quandt stated recently that "Seventy to 80 percent of all members of congress 

will go along with whatever they think AIPAC wants," and the recent Senate vote 

of 94-2 supporting Sharon suggests that this may be an understatement. James Petras 

asked recently, "Can the petroleum lobby get a 94-2 vote in favor of the Saudi 

plan?" A related question: are the almost unanimous votes for Sharon and his policies 

based on a rational consideration of the needs of U.S. foreign policy? 

<p>Zunes also ignores the extremely aggressive bullying tactics that the Jewish 

lobby has been employing throughout the United States during the past several 

years, boycotting the New York Times, Washington Post and other papers and carrying 

out pressure campaigns against CNN, NPR and other TV stations and programs in 

an attempt to enforce a totally one-sided reporting of the Israel- Palestine conflict. 

They have also steadily attacked faculty and academic and public panels with the 

same objective, and have been very effective in reinforcing the already biased 

treatment of these issues. Their intrusions into the Alabama and Georgia elections 

and successful removal of Hilliard and McKinney is arguably a form of disenfranchisement 

of black voters, by money power rather than legal tricks or coercion, and should 

be strenuously opposed by progressives. 

<p>Zunes shows not the slightest concern about the consequences of these bullying 

practices on freedom of speech or for policy-making on the Middle East. He mentions 

that the Jews, like the blacks, are a "historically oppressed" minority, and he 

alleges that power is held by wealthy white Gentiles. This is a specious argument. 

Jews are not oppressed in the United States today, and in fact their power to 

influence U.S. policy in the Middle East is vastly out of proportion to their 

numbers in the population. Furthermore, they are exercising that power by means 

that coerce and violate the spirit of the First Amendment and that also threaten 

the ability of the leadership to form a rational foreign policy. 

<p>Zunes is worried that criticism of the Jewish lobby and its operations will 

reenforce ugly stereotypes. Perhaps he ought to be directing this point to the 

Defamation League (self-designated an "Anti-Defamation League") and other lobby 

members, rather than to progressives who seek a decent policy on the Middle East, 

and who are very often victims of lobby attacks. Writing in Canadian Dimension 

(July-August 2002), Mordecai Briemberg says that "Concerns about fuelling anti-semitism 

should be addressed to the Israeli government, not directed against progressives 

who wish to analyse the structures and practices of Israeli state lobby forces 

within our own political system." 

<p>In short, Zunes's call for constraint in criticising aggressors who are using 

nasty methods for nasty ends, because people might become hostile to them, is 

misdirected. Beyond that, it is even immoral, because it deflects attention from 

the urgent need to protect the lobby's victims at home and abroad, which calls 

for actively contesting the lobby's power and tactics.
