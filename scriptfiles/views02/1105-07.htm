<p>Mark Twain was no fan of war, which he described as "a wanton waste of projectiles," 

and he nurtured a healthy disdain for anyone who suggested that patriotism was 

best displayed through enthusiastic support for military adventures abroad. The 

phrase "our country, right or wrong" was, he argued, "an insult to the nation." 

</p>

<p> But Twain's deepest disgust was reserved for politicians who played on fear 

and uncertainty to promote the interests of what would come to be known as the 

military-industrial complex. Describing how Americans were frequently goaded into 

war by their leaders, Twain recalled: "Statesmen will invent cheap lies, putting 

blame upon the nation that is attacked, and every man will be glad of those conscience-soothing 

falsities, and will diligently study them, and refuse to examine any refutations 

of them; and thus he will by and by convince himself that the war is just, and 

will thank God for the better sleep he enjoys after this process of grotesque 

self-deception." </p>

<p> Twain, a longtime leader of the old Anti-Imperialist League, uttered those 

words a century ago. But for opponents of George W. Bush's election year efforts 

to justify war with Iraq, they ring truer than most of what has been said by Republican 

or Democratic candidates in Tuesday's congressional contests. </p>

<p> So much truer, in fact, that some anti-war activists have decided to vote 

for Twain. </p>

<p> Never mind that the author of "The Innocents Abroad," "Tom Sawyer," "Huckleberry 

Finn" and "A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court" has been dead since 1910, 

nor even that "Mark Twain" is merely the pen name for the prolific Samuel Clemens. 

Voters in western Wisconsin will be casting ballots Tuesday for Mark Twain for 

Congress. </p>

<p> The Twain campaign was started in the old Mississippi River town of LaCrosse, 

where activists with the La Crosse Coalition for Peace and Justice were upset 

with U.S. Representative Ron Kind, a Democrat who voted in October for the House 

resolution authorizing George W. Bush to wage a unilateral war against Iraq. Kind, 

a co-chair of the New Democrat Network, the congressional arm of the conservative 

Democratic Leadership Council, was the only one of five Democrats in Wisconsin's 

House delegation to vote in favor of the resolution. In fact, a pair of Wisconsin 

Democrats, Senator Russ Feingold and Representative Tammy Baldwin, were among 

the most outspoken congressional foes of the resolution. Baldwin was one of the 

chief organizers of opposition forces before the House vote on the Iraq resolution, 

which saw a majority of House Democrats oppose the president's position. </p>

<p> But Kind voted with a minority of House Democrats and a majority of House 

Republicans last month to give the president what Constitutional scholars have 

described as "unprecedented" war-making powers. Kind has said that, while he shares 

many of the reservations expressed by his constituents in regard to launching 

a war against Iraq, he thinks Congressional support for the president's position 

could cause Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to be more cooperative – thus making 

it possible to avoid war. </p>

<p> Kind's explanation of his stance have not gone down well with all of his constituents 

in a sprawling district where anti-war demonstrations and meetings have been held 

in a number of communities. But Kind's foes in this fall's contest did not exactly 

wow peace activists. Republican Bill Arndt is a pro-Bush, pro-war conservative, 

while Libertarian Jeff Zastrow offers little in the way of a progressive alternative 

to Kind. "We didn't see any competition for Kind, and we wanted to let him know 

we are disappointed in him," explained Daniel Poler, a Coalition for Peace and 

Justice member. </p>

<p> So the peace activists decided to launch a write-in campaign for Mark Twain. 

"It's a protest against the government and candidates, Kind in particular, for 

not listening to those of us against a war in Iraq," declared Poler. In the local 

newspaper, he explained the simple logic of the campaign: "A write-in vote for 

‘Mark Twain' will send a message to our representatives that we are very disappointed 

that our voices were not heard." </p>

<p> In a sense, Twain was a natural choice. The author visited towns on the Wisconsin 

side of the Mississippi, and wrote of them in his classic book, Life on the Mississippi. 

He even praised LaCrosse's "stately red brick buildings," a fact frequently mentioned 

in a city where the downtown is still made up of stately red brick buildings. 

Besides, Poler explained, in a city that prides itself on its river heritage, 

"(Twain's) name is easy to remember." </p>

<p> Kind is not exactly sweating the challenge. The congressman is confident that 

he will best the author and all other comers. And for good reason. LaCrosse is 

a reliably Democratic city, and Kind, a three-term incumbent, is popular the surrounding 

rural counties that make up Wisconsin's Third Congressional District. Yet, the 

region has a long history of anti-war activism, going back to the days when it 

was a hotbed of support for former U.S. Senator Robert M. La Follette and the 

Wisconsin Progressives who opposed World War I. </p>

<p> After the House vote on Iraq, a local activist paid $1,800 for space on a 

prominently placed billboard, which now reads, "No War with Iraq. Ron Kind Should 

Resign." And the LaCrosse Peace and Justice Coalition has organized a number of 

anti-war demonstrations, including one at a downtown park on November 2, where 

the Twain candidacy was promoted. Write-in campaigns rarely yield big tallies 

on election day. But the Twain campaign seems to be connecting with some voters; 

a pre-election letter to the editor from LaCrosse resident John Schaldach criticized 

Kind's vote on the Iraq resolution and noted that, "A friend e-mailed me today 

about a grassroots campaign to write in Mark Twain for the 3rd congressional district 

in protest of Ron Kind's vote on the resolution. In that (Kind) is facing extremely 

weak opposition, this seems like a safe year to register a protest vote." </p>

<p> Thus, Schaldach concluded, "On Nov. 5, I will vote Mark Twain." </p>

<p> Despite Schaldach's commitment, the Twain campaign remains an uphill effort. 

That's probably for the best, as the author never showed much interest in winning 

a place in the U.S. Capitol. It was Twain who observed that: "It could probably 

be shown by facts and figures that there is no distinctly native American criminal 

class except Congress." </p>
