<P>As we approach the first anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, it might 

be useful to see how far an ordinary citizen's knowledge has progressed one 

year on. So here, in the way of a summing-up, based on journalistic 

documentation, is a list of things we Americans have learned since last 

September -- some of which might prove useful in the run-up to the November 

elections.



<p>1. We've learned that Bush&Co.'s "war on terrorism" has morphed from finding 

and destroying those responsible for the 9/11 mass-murders to a worldwide 

campaign to install a Pax Americana, by force if necessary. In other words, 

neo-imperialism, reminiscent in many ways of the old Roman Empire or, closer 

to our own time, the British Empire. 



<p>2. We've learned that Bush&Co. has no desire to rethink any of its policies 

abroad, the same policies that isolate it and that generate hatred, suspicion 

and terrorism in so many regions of the globe. Rather than reconsider its policies, 

or try to accomplish its ends through diplomacy and alliances and cultural/economic 

initiatives, in its arrogance it continues to bully and threaten others, insult 

its European and other allies, disregard international treaties and courts, engage 

in unilateral actions without regard to the national interests of others, and, 

in general, simply throw its massive weight around. The prevailing attitude seems 

to be: We are the one Superpower, get used to bending to our will. 

<p>3. We've learned that Bush's national-security leadership was alerted months 

ahead of 9/11 (and, it has admitted, no later than August 6) that a major air 

attack from al-Qaida was in the works, along with the likely targets, but did 

nothing to try to prevent those attacks or warn anyone about them. Caught in 

their own lies, they blame "the system," especially elements in the FBI, for 

"not connecting the dots." More than 3000 Americans died as a result of this 

malfeasance. 



<p>4. We've learned that plans already were in the works prior to 9/11 for the 

evisceration of Constitutional guarantees of due process of law. The White 

House hustled the so-called USA PATRIOT Act through a frightened Congress in 

a patriotic blur, just a few days after the attacks, with few, if any, of the 

legislators having had time to read the final version.



<p>5. We've learned that prior to September 11, the Bush Administration was 

negotiating with the Taliban about a pipeline desired by a U.S.-led energy 

consortium that would cross through Afghanistan. When the Taliban balked, the 

U.S. negotiators told them they either could accept a "carpet of gold" or 

face a "carpet of bombs." The Taliban backed away from the deal and refused 

to hand over Osama bin Laden; shortly after the terror attacks of 9/11, the 

U.S. began bombing in Afghanistan. 



<p>6. We've learned that now with the Taliban having been overthrown, and a 

U.S.-friendly regime installed in Kabul, the pipeline project is back on 

track, designed to carry energy supplies across Afghanistan from the Caspian 

Sea area to near India. Hamid Karzai, the new leader of Afghanistan, formerly 

was a consultant on the payroll of the pipeline folks; likewise, the new U.S. 

special envoy to Afghanistan. 



<p>7. We've learned that Bush&Co.'s Homeland Security Act includes programs that 

bear an amazing resemblance to totalitarian programs from the fascist/communist 

end of the spectrum: getting the military (restricted heretofore to activity outside 

the U.S.) involved in domestic policing, signing up neighborhood and block snoops 

to work for the central government, investigating what books citizens are checking 

out and buying, denouncing those deemed insufficiently patriotic or suspicious 

because of their views, etc. Remind you of Stalin's Russia, Castro's Cuba, Hitler's 

Third Reich, the Stasi of East Germany? (There also are prototypes of patriotic 

youth leagues being tried out in cities, which could become a national program.) 

A kind of martial-law coming to a neighborhood near you. 

<p>8. We've learned that Ashcroft/Bush are shredding Constitutional due-process 

guarantees in their move toward total control: already they have compromised attorney-client 

privilege, removed habeas corpus protections, locked up folks with no charges, 

secreted citizens at military installations which puts them out of reach of the 

judicial system, violated privacy in rifling through personal telephone and email 

communications, etc. etc. When the ambiguously-worded PATRIOT Act was first brought 

up, Ashcroft and Bush told us not to worry, promising that these rules would affect 

only non-citizens. Since that time, American citizens have been handled in similar 

fashion. Coming to a neighborhood near you. 

<p>9. We've learned much about the dangers of religious fundamentalism in Islam, 

but we've also learned about dangers posed by our own religious 

fundamentalists -- eager for a Christian theocratic society, symbolized most 

recently by a Secret Service agent scrawling on a Muslim suspect's 

refrigerator "Islam Is Evil, Christ Is King" -- and the extraordinary power 

they wield within the Bush Administration, represented most openly by John 

Ashcroft, who in frame-of-mind resembles a Taliban mullah.

 

<p>10. We've learned that the FBI, focusing now on foreign terrorists, doesn't 

seem energized with the same zeal to catch domestic terrorists, such as 

abortion-clinic arsonists -- and especially the anthrax-dispenser. Though the 

FBI seems to know that the anthrax villain probably worked at a government 

bio-lab, nobody has been arrested, or even targeted as a prime suspect. It 

may not be likely, but the unsaid is finally being asked: Could this 

dangerous terrorist actually be working for the government?



<p>11. We've learned that the HardRight of the Republican Party has taken control 

-- of the House leadership, of the Supreme Court, of the White House, of much 

of the conglomerate-owned media -- and has demonstrated its willingness to do 

nearly anything to maintain that power. (Only the courageous defection of Sen. 

Jim Jeffords from GOP ranks is standing in the way of HardRight total control 

of all three branches of government.) More and more truly objectionable HardRight 

judges are being nominated by Bush in an effort to stack the judiciary for decades 

to come. This by a man who lost the election by more than half-a-million votes, 

coming into his White House residency, with no popular mandate, only because his 

supporters on the Supreme Court installed him there. 

<p>12. We've learned that to break the momentum of the HardRight, all energy for 

the upcoming November elections (less than 90 days away, let us not forget) 

must be expended in electing Democrat candidates and defeating Republican 

ones. The objective conditions are just not ripe yet for anything more than 

trying to move the country back toward the middle of the political spectrum. 

We progressives more in tune with the Greens (Green candidates are being 

supported secretly in many states by the Republicans, to try to defeat 

Democrats) will have to wait. The difference between Democrats and 

Republicans may seem small to Greens and others, but, as we've learned in a 

painful way under Bush&Co., that difference is immense when it comes to 

foreign and domestic policy and its actual effects on real people, here and 

abroad.



<p>13. We've learned that Cheney is up to his ears in Halliburton 

irregularities, and may well be liable for indictment for participating in 

financial fraud. In addition, we've learned that Cheney, who was the head of 

the task force that came up with a corporate-friendly rather than a 

consumer-friendly energy policy, has refused to turn over to Congress the 

requested documents that will reveal how that policy was arrived at and which 

industry leaders (other than Enron's Kenny Boy) helped shape it. 



<p>14. We've learned that Bush knew in advance, as a member of the Harken Audit 

Committee, that Harken Oil was going to release negative financial news, and sold 

his shares before that, reaping a fortune. He may be liable for indictment for 

insider-trading and other Harken irregularities. (Even if Bush and Cheney are 

not indicted, they are the last people on earth who should be speaking about corruption 

in the corporate financial world, as these hypocrites benefited from that very 

corrupt system. As did most of Bush's corporate-derived cabinet.) 

<p>15. We've learned that Bush&Co. were mightily opposed to any reform of 

corporate financial reporting, but when more and more companies were caught 

in such corrupt practices and the mood of the country shifted -- mainly 

because so many folks, especially seniors, lost huge chunks of their pensions 

and portfolio holdings when the Stock Market tanked as a result of investors' 

losing confidence in the numbers provided by corporations  -- they jumped on 

the bandwagon and pretended they were reformers all along. In the background, 

they are trying to help their corporate supporters water down, and otherwise 

get around, the new rules. To that end, Bush&Co. have appointed Harvey Pitt 

and Larry Thompson, two tainted corporate types, to head up the 

"investigations" of corporate wrongdoing. Break out the whitewash.



<p>16. We've learned that Bush&Co., having placed its chips on Ariel Sharon, 

continues to have no real desire for a just peace in the Middle East. All it 

wants is for the area to be quiet and controlled (thus giving carte blanche 

to the Israeli Army's police-state occupation and oppression), so that it can 

continue its plans for overthrowing Saddam Hussein in Iraq. And, of course, 

there has been no declaration of a State of War by the Congress, neither 

against Afghanistan nor against Iraq, and no real debate about the wisdom of 

a war against Saddam  -- even when the top brass at the Pentagon and in Great 

Britain have expressed their opposition to such military adventurism.



<p>17. We've learned that there will be no peace now in the Middle East because 

the U.S. is not fully engaged in the peace process, also because neither 

extreme in the area wants peace: Sharon thrives on war and brutality, Hamas 

needs Sharon's bloody policies to justify its campaign of terror. There are 

signs that moderate Palestinians finally are starting to speak out in favor 

of a peaceful solution, and there are plenty of land-for-peace Israelis 

(supported by many liberal Jews in the U.S.), so the outlines of a peace are 

out there. But until the U.S. and U.N. make the commitment to separate the 

warring extremists and arrange an equitable treaty both Israel and the 

Palestinians can live with -- secure borders for Israel (and an end to 

suicide bombing), a viable state for the Palestinians, abandoning of the 

settlements by Israel, reparations for Palestinians who lost their homes and 

property -- there will be only more bloodshed. And more fertile ground for 

new generations of terrorists, in the Middle East and elsewhere in the 

Islamic world.



<p>18. We've learned that Bush&Co. has been a total disaster for the 

environment, in every way: from reneging on its campaign promise to cut 

carbon-dioxide and other greenhouse emissions, to backing away from higher 

fuel-efficiency in cars (we could cut our dependence on foreign oil 20% just 

by increasing fuel efficiency by 5%), to giving breaks to corporate polluters 

all across the country, to permitting increased arsenic levels in the water, 

etc. etc.  



<p>19. We've learned that Secretary of State Colin Powell -- who sees the world 

in something other than simplistic black-and-white, us-versus-them 

dichotomies -- is a man imprisoned in the Bush Cabinet, forced to alter his 

principled opinions in the service of Bush&Co.'s stupidly aggressive and 

ultimately self-defeating foreign policies. Powell, a moderate conservative, 

looks like a raving progressive when measured against his masters. He should 

resign but probably won't.



<p>20. We've learned that the tax-cuts provided to the most wealthy are not only 

payoffs to the corporate sector that provides support for Bush&Co. By locking 

in those tax cuts for ten years (and with humongous chunks of the budget spent 

on the "war on terrorism"), Bush&Co. have ensured that innumerable social programs 

that aid the less well-off will be cut or eliminated. In short, a rollback of 

New Deal/Great Society programs, so hated by the HardRight. (The HardRight movement 

to detach prescription drugs for seniors from the Medicare program, and, especially, 

to privatize Social Security -- even in the face of recent stock-market disasters 

-- is part of this same desire.) 

<p>Even after all the above shorthand summaries, no doubt I'm leaving out lots 

of Bush&Co. dirt, but this list can provide a starting point, and a handy 

compilation of enough low and high crimes and misdemeanors to warrant their 

removal from power, either through the ballot box or by resignation or 

impeachment.



<p>Finally, as we enter August, we know that one of two things will happen in 

the summer-doldrums, with the Congress on vacation: Either Bush&Co. will start 

its Iraq war and carry out more under-the-radar attacks on important American 

programs, or the media, bereft of their usual Beltway stories, will use the down 

time to engage in hard-hitting investigative reporting that will reveal in even 

more stark relief the machinations of Bush&Co. illegalities and other scandalous 

behavior. But, given the corporate nature of our corporate-owned media, don't 

count on it. Instead, we'll probably be flooded with this summer's Condit-like 

sex scandal.
