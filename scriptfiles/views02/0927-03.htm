<p>One of the delights of being in London this past Fourth of July was the opportunity 

to read the commentary in the British press about the United States on the occasion 

of our national independence holiday. The comments, by the way, were not those 

of America-bashers (in spite of what is still considered our impertinence in revolting 

against His Majesty's government several centuries ago!) so they can hardly be 

dismissed as the ranting of our enemies. Instead, they were reflections of people 

who looked with admiration at 200-plus years of the American democratic experiment, 

with sympathy at our present travails and with genuine concern about our future.</p>

<p>One observer of the American scene was especially insightful. He describes, 

after a number of recent visits to the states, our nation as "split so deeply 

and irreconcilably over almost every key issue of politics, lifestyle and culture 

that it is sometimes better to think of (the United States) as two, distinct nations, 

rather than one."</p>

<p>One half of America -- the one "that is feared, distrusted and increasingly 

disliked in the rest of the world, and especially in Europe," this commentator 

writes, "is the conservative country that constitutes George W. Bush's political 

heartland in Texas and the South -- the America of self-righteous Christian fundamentalists, 

of military machismo, of gun shops, lethal injections, anti-abortion zealots and 

gas-guzzling pickup trucks spewing out greenhouse gases." It's the America of 

the pastor who delivered a fiery invocation (just before Bush spoke at a West 

Virginia Fourth of July celebration) in which he decried multiculturalism, along 

with the nation's being "forced to honor sexual deviance in the name of freedom 

of expression" and killing "our unborn children in the name of choice."</p>

<p>Bracketing this smug, self-satisfied, insular America is the other half of 

the nation -- on both coasts -- the one "that Europeans find fascinating and beguiling, 

albeit a bit frightening because of its shifting moral compass." It's the America 

of Hollywood, Manhattan and Silicon Valley -- the America of grandeur, glitz and 

glamour but also the America that is forced to look outward toward the rest of 

the world and recognize that, superpower though we may be, we cannot behave like 

a global bully without courting disaster for ourselves and the rest of the planet.</p>

<p>Our friends in Europe find it incredible, for example, that we cannot muster 

an apology for massacring 40 people -- including one entire family -- at a wedding 

party in Afghanistan. They find our reasons for wishing to withdraw U.S. soldiers 

from the police-keeping mission in Bosnia to be arrogant and deceitful. And they 

are very worried, as another commentator writes, that "the meltdown in U.S. corporate 

ethics is not just a blip on Wall Street's radar screen but one of the deepest 

threats to the orderly function of America's capital markets since the 1930s." 

Or as yet another observer, viewing the shambles of the U.S. economy, asked, "Will 

America drag Britain down?"</p>

<p>Friends are such because occasionally they have to tell us what we need to 

hear about ourselves, rather than what we might like to hear. </p>

<p>The U.S. Supreme Court, however, has installed a government in Washington that 

has announced to the rest of the world our national intent -- since we consider 

ourselves the only nation of might left in the international arena -- to do whatever 

we please to advance our national interests and to compel those who might have 

other ideas to accept our way of thinking.</p>

<p>The signs are abundant everywhere that this national arrogance simply will 

not wash with nations that have been our closest and strongest allies over much 

of the past century. We are being warned almost daily that the course on which 

the White House seems fanatically set will bring immeasurable chaos to the Middle 

East, more damage to our already shattered economy and put us and the nation at 

the mercy of terrorists to an even greater degree than we already are.</p>

<p>Such prospects are as chilling as they are unnecessary. They hang over us because 

we are saddled -- thanks to the Supreme Court -- with a government that does not 

seem to grasp the fact that imperialism is as loathsome an idea in the 21st century 

as it was in the 19th and 20th, and especially so when it is brandished by the 

only alleged superpower left on the planet. </p>

<p>The ancient admonition that "pride goes before a fall" can be as true of nations 

as it is of individuals. We have to hope it does not become the epitaph for a 

once proud, free and responsible people. (More on this next month.)</p>
