<p>"Do as we say, not as we do," is the

advice from the United States to the low- and

middle-income countries of the world when it

comes to trade. Lately the press has taken aim at

this aspect of modern colonialism. They have

pointed out the hypocrisy of the US and other

rich countries subsidizing their agriculture or

protecting their steel or textile industries, while

demanding that countries as poor as Ghana open

their markets to goods and services from the

North.



         <p>This allows the punditry to fancy itself

the champion of the world's poor, joining hands

in righteous indignation with the leaders of the

world's most powerful economic institutions:

the International Monetary Fund, World Bank,

and the World Trade Organization. The same

rules should apply equally to all, they proclaim.



         <p>Or as Anatole France once said, "The

law, in its majestic equality, forbids the rich as

well as the poor to sleep under bridges, to beg in

the streets, and to steal bread."



         <p>But how much will the world's poor

really benefit from increased access to the

markets of the rich countries? And is this really

the best way to level the playing field -- "free

trade" for everyone?



         <p>As often happens with debates about

economic policy, few of the people writing and

chattering about the subject bother to look at the

numbers. For example: imagine that the rich

countries of the world open all of their markets

for merchandise trade-- agriculture, textiles,

steel, everything. This would be phased in by

2015. How much more annual income would

the low- and middle-income countries have in

2015 as a result of this increased access to the

markets of rich countries?



         <p>According to the World Bank, the

answer is about 0.6 percent. The poorer

countries would not get their fair share, but

imagine that they did: a country in Sub-Saharan

Africa whose income per person would

otherwise be $500 a year would, as a result of

this trade liberalization, have $503. Not much to

write home about.



         <p>In fact, according to other widely-used

economic models, many developing countries

will actually wind up with a net loss from the

liberalization of agriculture and textile trade that

was agreed upon at the WTO's creation in 1994.



         <p>But it gets worse. The WTO doesn't just

make and enforce trade rules. It has a seamier

underside -- the highly protectionist agreement

known as "TRIPS" (Trade-Related Aspects of

Intellectual Property Rights). The goal of these

rules is to get the low and middle-income

countries to obey patent and copyright laws that

are made in the USA and Europe.



         <p>Economists haven't spent too much time

looking at what this will cost developing

countries. But preliminary estimates (again from

the World Bank) indicate that this one form of

protectionism could easily exceed the gains

from trade liberalization.



         <p>And there are other serious concerns that

people in developing countries have about

implementing the rules of "free trade," as it is

commonly and inaccurately labeled. In many

countries a large part of the labor force,

sometimes the majority, is still employed in

agriculture. In the United States we went from

53 percent of our labor force in agriculture in

1870 to 4.6 percent in 1970, and yet the

displacement of people from the countryside

still generated much pain and serious social

unrest. Imagine what would happen if this

century-long process were collapsed into a

couple of decades, as advocated by the WTO

(along with the IMF and World Bank) for much

of the world. This is a recipe for social

explosion.



         <p>The truth is that equalizing the

enforcement of bad rules will not make the

world better off, any more than spreading street

crime from poor to middle-class neighborhoods

would. If we look at the few countries that have

made it out of poverty in the last half-century --

for example South Korea or Taiwan -- they

didn't get there by adhering to the "Washington

Consensus" of free trade and unrestricted

foreign investment flows. Quite the contrary:

their governments protected, subsidized, and

even created key industries, and intervened

heavily to move their economies into higher

technology, higher value-added production.



         <p>Of course we did similar things when the

United States was a developing country, with an

average tariff of 44 percent on manufactured

goods as late as 1913. Not to mention

"borrowing" technology from wherever it

existed in more advanced form, ignoring foreign

intellectual property rights. "Do as we say, not

as we did."
