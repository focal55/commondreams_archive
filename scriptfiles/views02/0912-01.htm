<p>As the names of the World Trade Center dead were being read at Ground Zero 

yesterday, Terry Rockefeller and David Potorti stayed away.

<p> Rockefeller lost her sister, Laura, 40, who was working at Windows on the 

World restaurant last Sept. 11. Potorti lost his brother, Jim, 52, who worked 

in the North Tower.

<p> "I've made my peace with that place," Rockefeller told me, explaining that 

a visit she made to Ground Zero shortly after the attack was enough.

<p> While the city held a grand memorial service in a windswept pit, and the president 

swept into town to lay a wreath, Terry Rockefeller planned to attend a church 

service in the morning and spend the afternoon with her elderly parents in White 

Plains.

<p> "I feel like my mission is what I'm doing here," she said Tuesday night, standing 

among the thousands who came to a peace vigil in Washington Square Park to say 

that the murder of 2,801 people a year ago shouldn't be used as a pretext for 

a war.

<p> Each day new threats come from Washington about a pending war against Saddam 

Hussein. George W. Bush and his cabinet say Hussein is amassing terrible weapons 

that he could use against the United States, so we must destroy him before he 

strikes. These claims are made despite the skepticism of most of the world's leaders, 

and despite the conclusion of the UN's top weapons inspector just this week that 

Hussein, dreadful as he is, possesses no such weapons.

<p> "It's personally upsetting right now to have it discussed so heatedly at the 

occasion of this anniversary," Rockefeller complained.

<p> The war talk upsets Potorti, too.

<p> "I'm always hearing the same thing, that we have to use this anniversary to 

continue more violence," he said.

<p> The two drove here from Boston the other day, where Rockefeller lives and 

where Potorti had spoken on a panel on alternatives to war. Britain's Tony Blair 

came on the radio, trying to link the Iraqi leader to the crime that killed their 

siblings.

<p> "He was taking advantage of our emotions to justify an invasion of Iraq," 

Potorti said. "I haven't been angry very often, but that made me angry. Like most 

of the world, I do not understand why we have to get Saddam Hussein."

<p> A slender man with a narrow, sensitive face, Potorti last fall organized people 

from around the country who lost relatives a year ago. Called "<a href="http://www.peacefultomorrows.org/" target="_new">September 

11 Families for Peaceful Tomorrows</a>," the group is trying to put a human face 

on war, to resist the impulse to retaliate for their loved ones' deaths by inflicting 

violence on innocent people elsewhere.

<p> "We remind people that when we talk about Iraq, there are 23 million Iraqis, 

and only one Saddam Hussein," Potorti said.

<p> Feeling no need "to walk into the pit and be handed a rose" yesterday, he 

instead scheduled a series of interviews with foreign journalists, who've told 

him that the only voice they seem to hear from the United States these days is 

George W. Bush's.

<p> On the eve of yesterday's activities, Washington Square Park filled with parents 

and their children, high school and college students, the middle-aged and the 

elderly, who believe that a time of national mourning shouldn't be hijacked by 

warmongers.

<p> Sitting on a park bench, Rockefeller told me about her sister, Laura. She 

was an actress, Rockefeller said, who had performed in a number of Off-Broadway 

shows, while doing freelance jobs during the day. She'd graduated from Syracuse 

University's theater school and had lived on Manhattan's West Side for 19 years. 

She was single, walked her dog in Riverside Park, had a beautiful singing voice 

and a large community of friends.

<p> "She was my only sibling, and I find it amazing that, at 52, I'm now an only 

child," she told me.

<p> Of his brother Jim, Potorti said, "He was my big brother. We all shared a 

room when we were kids, and he would make up these imaginary stories that would 

make us laugh. After he died, I remembered him teaching me to ride my bicycle, 

pushing me in my go-cart on the street where we used to live. A couple of times 

people wanted to beat me up in school, and he saved me."

<p> "The really sad thing is that I have a 2-year -old son who my brother was 

just getting to know. My son has one less person to love him now. I have one less 

person to love me."
