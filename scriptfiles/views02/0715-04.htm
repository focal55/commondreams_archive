<p>Scores of scientists and the federal government's own national fire plan have 

concluded that the removal of mature trees from forests increases the severity 

of forest fires. Why then would the Bush administration use the threat of fires 

to try to increase logging of mature and old-growth trees in our national forests?

<p>That is clearly the administration's intention, as outlined in two recent memos 

on revising the Northwest Forest Plan and the "Sierra Nevada Framework" plan to 

allow logging companies increased access to ancient forests on public lands. The 

move is being led by Mark Rey, a former timber industry lobbyist and a President 

Bush appointee who oversees the Forest Service.

<p>In the Sierra Nevada, the administration intends to "modify" the current Sierra 

framework plan to increase the size of trees that could be removed, which would 

allow widespread logging of old-growth trees in national forests. The administration 

also has indicated its intentions to eliminate the current requirement to maintain 

small stands of remnant ancient forest and to reduce the existing standards for 

maintaining forest canopy cover. This would greatly undercut the Sierra framework, 

which limits logging of mature trees in national forests in the Sierra Nevada. 

The framework was the result of several years of planning and public participation 

during the Clinton administration. Bush administration officials imply that this 

logging is needed to protect homes from forest fires. Yet the Forest Service's 

own scientific reports show that the best way to protect rural homes from fire 

is to reduce the flammability of the home itself and its surroundings within 100 

feet. Wood shingles should be replaced with fire-resistant roofing, and brush 

around the home should be cleared. These steps protect homes even from severe 

fires.

<p>As scientists point out, commercial logging actually increases fire severity 

by removing large, fire- resistant trees and leaving behind very small trees and 

flammable "slash debris"--branches, twigs and needles from felled trees. The removal 

of mature trees also decreases the forest canopy, creating hotter, drier conditions 

on the ground. The additional sun exposure encourages the growth of flammable 

brush and weeds.

<p>Reduction of flammable underbrush can reduce fire severity, and environmental 

groups have encouraged such projects. However, the Bush administration has grossly 

misused the funds that Congress appropriated for brush reduction near homes. In 

Sierra Nevada national forests last year, more than 90% of these funds were instead 

earmarked for preparation of large timber sales focused on the removal of mature 

and old-growth trees miles from the nearest town.

<p>The Bush administration's potentially dangerous fire management policies demonstrate 

the need for Congress to pass legislation to abolish commercial logging in national 

forests and to redirect logging expenditures into brush reduction and home protection.

<p>Until that happens, many politicians will continue to place the economic interests 

of their timber industry campaign contributors ahead of public safety and ecology.
