<p>As war clouds cast their shadows on Iraq, the U.S. peace movement is 

growing.  Part of that growth is coming from young, nonwhite people.  This 

is a big change.  It was clear to those who participated in the Oct. 26 

rally in San Francisco against the Bush administration’s campaign to 

mentally prepare the U.S. public for an attack on Iraq.



<p>Whatever one thinks of International ANSWER (Act Now To Stop War and End 

Racism), the group is doing an outstanding job of organizing young black, 

brown and yellow people.  They typically don’t attend U.S. anti-war rallies, 

due mainly to the role of the nation’s color line. The white peace movement 

gains nothing by burying its head in the sand on this sore subject.  Honesty 

is the only policy here.



<p>Arguably, widespread involvement of young people of color who previously 

have been absent from anti-war protests is essential to building a movement 

for equality that reflects the complexity and diversity of the U.S.  Folks 

are waking up to this understanding.  Some perhaps quicker than others.  

Better late than never.  We have a world to save.



<p>U.S. elites see it differently.  They have a world to steal, and have waged 

wars abroad for decades against black, brown and yellow people to this 

thieving end.  These wars have dovetailed with U.S. racism in complex ways.  

Thus it’s no coincidence that the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s 

energized opposition to U.S. military intervention in Southeast Asia.  Then, 

the political power of the U.S. majority was rising.  Meanwhile, the 

post-World War II economic boom was ending.



<p>As U.S. economic growth slowed during the 1960s and 1970s, the political 

power of the majority weakened. The subsequent restructuring of the world 

economy followed.  A racist reaction against those least to blame for it 

spread in the U.S.  In the 1980s, the Reagan administration waged Central 

American wars against the supposed communist menace of brown people.  This 

dovetailed with the phony "War on Drugs" against people of color in the U.S.



<p>A kind of class war ensued between and within nations, facilitated by white 

racism.  In the U.S., the Drug War removed surplus workers of color to the 

prison system.  They were politically neutered.  This process continues 

today in a nation that has an incarcerated population of two million human 

beings.  Currently, an endless terror war promises no end to such racialized 

policies that expand inequality in the U.S.



<p>Moreover, the young people of color not incarcerated will be more likely 

than most to be sent to fight in the endless terror war.  They will arrive 

home in body bags, or alive but poisoned in body and spirit by their brutal 

and brutalizing experiences.  These same youth are now being targeted by 

military recruiters in public high schools.  Military recruitment is 

currently connected with federal education aid 

http://www.wagingpeace.org/new/getinvolved/index.htm.



<p>Is it any wonder that nonwhite youth in the U.S. being militarily profiled 

for the terror war and racially profiled for jails and prisons are voicing 

an advanced political consciousness?  Steeled by a harsh social reality, 

their activism is linking Washington’s aggression in the Persian Gulf to a 

militarization of life in the U.S.



<p>These youth are publicly connecting the dots between capitalism, racism and 

militarism in U.S. domestic and foreign policy.  Globalization of inequality 

begins at home.  That thought crossed my mind as I watched a young white man 

walk with a sign decrying racism.  He was part of the call for U.S. peace 

with the people of Iraq.  He was refusing to go along with the white-skin 

privilege that serves to blind many to the common humanity they share with 

others from Iraq to Indianapolis who have a slightly different pigmentation.



<p>The mostly white Third World solidarity movements focusing on the 

Israeli-Palestinian conflict, forgiving World Bank debt and opposing 

corporate-led globalization partly remind Max Elbaum, author of "Revolution 

in the Air: Third World Marxism of the 1960s," of the young people he 

mobilized with during the anti-Vietnam War struggle. He also sees the mostly 

non-white people’s anti-prison system and pro-African American reparations 

movements as heirs to the tradition of U.S. people protesting racism and 

social injustice that sparked people to sit-in and march during the Civil 

Rights era.



<p>History, of course, never repeats itself exactly.  But one thing appears 

clear.  Peace with equality begins at home in the U.S.  Let’s keep 

supporting the emerging color of the young people’s peace movement here.
