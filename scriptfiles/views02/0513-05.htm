<p>MORE knowledge makes more manifest the many gaps in your knowledge, for the more you know the more you know you don’t know. That is why constant certitude is the mindset of fools. 

<p>

I learned this in my early teens when I went on Friday evenings to the Workers’ Open Forum in Glasgow, where debates on philosophy, economics, politics and the social sciences were held. I think the average attendance would be about 250, which by today’s standards would be deemed a mass meeting. 

<p>

The participants looked elderly, but then at that time I considered anyone over 25 to be elderly. They were all well-read, and to call them working-class intellectuals would have been no exaggeration. Their contributions were spattered with profuse quotations from Hume, Marx, Mills, Nietzsche, Adam Smith and others too numerous to mention. 

<p>

They taught me about dialectics from Greek philosophers through to Hegel and Marx. They argued about the inherent contradictions in everything and how the resolution of contradictions was the dynamic force of change, and not just in abstract thought but in life. Thesis - antithesis - synthesis. 

<p>

The general approach was based on scientific methodology. A hypothesis would be debated. Was it true? Did it work? Did it need modification? Or was it rejected because it was fundamentally flawed? 

<p>

They were against dogma, and rightly so. Religious dogmas are bad, particularly when they intrude into secular life, even though religions per se are more about life after death. A secular dogma is worse, for its adherents seek to impose their dogma on the living and do so with the intolerance that dogmatisms breed. 

<p>

You can’t reason with dogmatists, for they believe they are the custodians of an absolute truth, even though there is no such thing. The theories of Isaac Newton were near enough the truth, in their time, as to help man understand to a greater extent than before the physical world in which he lived. 

<p>

Newtonian physics was supplanted by the physics of Einstein because his was a more accurate hypothesis. Einstein’s physics will be supplanted by a new theory that will be an even closer approximation to the truth. That’s the essence of rational progression. It cannot end, for with every expansion of knowledge the way is opened for a new advance that couldn’t have been envisaged without all previous expansions. 

<p>

It’s the dialectics of the human mind. The more you know, the more you will know there is more to know. 

<p>

Marx was a social scientist, but so-called Marxists turned his theories into a dogma. They pored over his writings to find detailed answers to all the rich phenomena of life . In Soviet Russia, Leninism masquerading as Marxism was made into a secular religion. Their political theoreticians became de facto theologians. 

<p>

Right-wing intellectuals similarly made a dogma of Adam Smith’s writings. Margaret Thatcher’s mind was closed to the possibility of ever being wrong. She embraced the concept of untrammeled market forces as if it was handed down from Heaven by a Tory god. 

<p>

But in this New (post-Cold War) World, dogmatism and its blood brother, religious fundamentalism, are thriving as never before. Islamic and Jewish fundamentalisms are tearing the Middle East apart. In America, Christian Fundamentalists are turning the clock back to the Middle Ages by teaching in state schools that the origin of the Earth is as described in the book of Genesis . 

<p>

George Bush’s response to September 11, when analyzed, is absolutist and dogmatic. Those that disagree with him are wimps or spineless liberals. He has repudiated the treaty that founded the world’s first permanent war crimes tribunal because it might lead to the prosecution of US servicemen and officials . 

<p>

He is blocking an international campaign to provide teenage sex education because he believes in chastity before marriage. Medical scientists warn that his action will further undermine the global battle against the spread of AIDS . 

<p>

He already has reneged on the Kyoto Agreement which sought to limit further damage to the Earth’s environment . He has all the arrogance of ignorance and unfettered power. 

<p>

Start praying, folks. Or start fighting back.</p>
