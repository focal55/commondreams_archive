<p>It's Easter Sunday in Guatemala City and a row of brightly colored pick-up 

trucks rides in slow procession down the crowded Reforma Avenue. Campesinos in 

cowboy hats and white jeans chant religious messages to the background beat of 

salsa music. Brightly-dressed children skip on the sidewalk and throw flowers 

at the passing trucks. At the end of the parade a preacher gives a sermon in Spanish 

and three Mayan languages to a crowd that erupts in applause. Meanwhile, in the 

nearby colonial town of Antigua somber Catholic processionals languidly make their 

way down the cobblestone streets. Black incense fills the air as devout followers 

struggle to carry makeshift floats on their shoulders, heavy like the weight of 

repentance. 

<p>If religion is the opiate of the people, then Latin Americans have found a 

new drug. The overwhelming conversion to evangelical Protestantism across the 

traditionally Roman Catholic region marks a revolution more far-reaching than 

Fidel Castro or Che Guevarra accomplished. The U.S. media has largely overlooked 

the spread of Protestantism in Latin America as one of the great social movements 

of the 20th century. Unlike other liberation movements in Latin America, this 

one marks a shift towards a capitalist and Western future rather than a Marxist 

or traditional one. No where are the political implications of this rapidly growing 

popular movement more apparent than in Guatemala, where Protestantism claims over 

35% of the country's 12.5 million souls. 

<p>Unlike the rigidity of Catholicism, Pentecostalism (a fundamentalist sect of 

evangelical Protestantism) is, as British sociologist David Martin says, 'its 

very own fiesta.' This fiesta, much to the displeasure of the Roman Catholic Church 

and the Latin American Left, is growing by about 10% per year in Guatemala. There 

are currently 300 Protestant sects and 10,000 churches. If the movement continues 

at this rate, in less than twenty years over half of all Guatemalans will be evangelical 

Protestants. 

<p>North American Right wing groups who believe that fundamentalist Christians 

will instill a capitalist, Western work ethic in a politically and economically 

tumultuous region have largely funded the organization of this movement. The missionaries, 

on the other hand, consider themselves messengers of Jesus Christ rather than 

Pat Buchanan. Still, grounded within the spirituality that they spread lie the 

secular and cultural norms of U.S. society. This serves as reason enough for the 

Moral Majority to sponsor the missionaries' work. 

<p>Initially, Protestant spirituality appealed to slum-dwelling, poverty-stricken 

Guatemalans who suffered from North American attempts to 'modernize,' 'globalize' 

and in short, improve the Central Americans' earthly lot. Like the Western capitalist 

model, evangelical Protestantism preaches self-betterment coupled with an undeniably 

bourgeois sentiment. 

<p>Virginia Garrard-Burnett, author of Living in the New Jerusalem: Protestantism 

in Guatemala (UT Austin Press), says that the conversion to Protestantism represents 

"Guatemala's enduring and often unsuccessful effort to re-create itself in the 

image of what nations to the north consider 'modern' and 'developed.'" 

<p>But the reasons behind this mass conversion reach deeper than U.S. imperialism. 

David Stoll, author of The Politics of Evangelical Growth, sees Latin American 

Protestantism as a generator of social change. "Blaming evangelical growth on 

the United States," Stoll says, "suggests a deep distrust of the poor, an unwillingness 

to accept the possibility that they could turn an important religion to their 

own purposes." 

<p>Politics aside, religion is after all a matter of faith. The Protestant message 

of personal salvation and the alleviation of injustice, poverty and misery in 

the afterlife greatly appeals to a country in which 5% of the population controls 

80% of the land, life expectancy stands at 61 years and 95% of all rural women 

can't read or write. 

<p>'There is so much emphasis on heaven,' Edmundo Madrid, president of the Evangelical 

Alliance of Guatemalans said in a recent interview, 'The poor get the message 

that while they're poor here on earth, they'll be better off in heaven.' 

<p>The encouragement of workers to do a good job so that they will reap reward 

in the afterlife provides a spiritual safe haven from reality. But it also threatens 

to further stigmatize Guatemala's peasant class by convincing them that they must 

remain just that. Evangelical Protestantism is 'like a tranquilizer,' says Dennis 

Smith, a scholar on the movement. 'Just give your 10% tithe and you will be saved.' 

<p>The effects of a ravaging 1976 earthquake that killed 20,000 people and left 

over one million homeless reinforced the power of the promise of salvation. A 

few months after the quake, evangelical church membership jumped by 14 percent. 

The Protestants, not the Catholic Church, provided food, temporary housing and 

helped re-establish community ties. In addition to physical aid, Protestantism 

provided spiritual aid to a desperate people. But savior doesn't come cheap. 

<p>'Material tasks such as education, health care and food distribution," Smith 

says, "gain validity as a form of Christian ministry only when they are used as 

vehicles for leading people to Christ.' 

<p>The participatory nature of evangelical Protestantism (a far stretch from the 

top-down oligarchy of Catholic priests and bishops) further politicizes the movement. 

Today, "born-agains" are no longer rural peasants; both urban middle- and upper-middle 

class Guatemalans have adopted the Protestant faith. Equal access to prayer makes 

Protestantism a type of spiritual trade union. The religion grants Mayan women 

the same access to worship as a middle-class ladino (a person of half-indigenous 

and half European decent), and thus temporarily blinds its members from the social 

cleavage of the outside world--a feat that the political Left has tried for centuries 

to accomplish. 

<p>Guatemala has had three evangelical presidents including Efrain Ríos Montt 

who took over the office in a 1982 military coup and proceeded to "exterminate" 

entire rural villages under the guise of God and anti-Communism. The current president, 

Alfonso Portillo, also an evangelical Protestant and a former advisor to Ríos 

Montt, declared himself a murderer during the presidential campaign to emphasize 

that he would crack down on crime. Despite these political players, Protestant 

churches deny that they have a political agenda. In contrast to the Catholics 

Church's Marxist doctrine of "Liberation Theology," Protestantism has spread largely 

because of the image of political neutrality that it sells to its followers; in 

a country swept by political violence, a shelter from politics becomes a sanctuary 

in and of itself. 

<p>"Neo-Pentecostal churches insulate members from the violence and social decay 

that surrounds them," Garrard-Burnett says,"[these] churches offer a spiritual 

rationale for the gaping social inequalities of Guatemala and bring order to what 

is otherwise a capricious world." 

<p>But "spiritual rationale" doesn't equal the alleviation of poverty. Despite 

its newfound faith, Guatemala still finds itself trapped in the shackles of modernization 

and a widening gap between rich and poor. Parades, free bibles, sermons set to 

salsa music, a high-pitched promise of salvation, and good-old Western values 

won't change that, at least not in this life.</p>
