<p><I>Democracies cannot dispense with hypocrisy any more than dictatorships can 

with cynicism.</I> <BR>

- Georges Bernanos, <I>We French</I> 

<P>The entire country waits with bated breath to see what will happen next. In 

one case it is only a matter of time. In the other, we will have to patiently 

wait to find out what sanctions will be imposed by civilized countries on the 

uncivilized conduct of George W. Bush. 

<P>The case requiring patience is the case in which Mr. Bush mimicked the Egyptian 

president, Hosni Mubarak. The Egyptian case involves Saad Eddin Ibrahim, a sociologist 

and government critic, who holds Egyptian and U.S. citizenship. Last month Mr. 

Ibrahim was sentenced by an Egyptian court to seven years in prison for activities 

that included registering people to vote and supporting the rights of Egyptian 

minorities. Mr. Bush was upset with the imposition of that sentence and promptly 

notified Mr. Mubarak of his displeasure. He let it be known that the U.S. was 

withholding additional aid Egypt was seeking. According to Sean McCormack, a White 

House spokesman, "The United States will meet its Camp David aid commitments" 

but, "at this time we are not contemplating any additional funds beyond that commitment." 

Egypt was seeking an additional $130 million this year following Congressional 

approval of an increase of $200 million for Israel in aid to fight terrorism. 

<P>The sentence imposed on Mr. Ibrahim, as Mr. Bush made clear, is deeply distressing 

to all people concerned with human rights. What the United States has done to 

Yaser Esam Hamdi is deeply distressing to all people concerned with human rights 

except Messrs. Bush and Ashcroft. 

<P>Mr. Hamdi was born in Louisiana and raised in Saudi Arabia. The administration 

has labeled him an "unlawful enemy combatant" and is denying him the right to 

legal representation and other rights accorded American citizens when arrested. 

His treatment has angered, among others, Judge Robert G. Doumar of the Federal 

District Court where Mr. Hamdi's case is pending.. In a ruling in which he ordered 

U.S. attorneys to turn over documents supporting their argument that an American 

citizen should be jailed without charges and access to a lawyer, he wrote: "This 

case appears to be the first in American jurisprudence where an American citizen 

has been held incommunicado and subjected to an indefinite detention in the continental 

United States without any findings by a military tribunal, and without access 

to a lawyer." 

<P>In the hearing that resulted in that ruling, the judge repeatedly accused the 

U.S. attorney of dodging his direct questions and questioned the fairness and 

legality of the government's argument, asking at one point whether the treatment 

accorded Mr. Hamdi was "what we are fighting for." Mr. Hamdi's attorney has not 

been permitted to meet with or speak with his client. 

<P>We can only wait nervously to see what form retaliation from other countries 

will take in protest of our treatment of Mr. Hamdi since none, of which I know, 

is giving us foreign aid that can be withheld. Hence, civilized countries will 

have to devise other ways of expressing their displeasure. 

<P>Mr. Hamdi's treatment is not the only example of the administration's disregard 

of accepted legal principles. The execution of Javier Surez in Texas is another. 

His treatment, prior to his execution is, in some respects, worse than Mr. Hamdi's 

jailing since it is harder to make amends for an execution that might not have 

taken place under different circumstances, than a wrongful jailing. 

<P>Mr. Surez was a Mexican national who killed an undercover policeman during 

a drug deal in 1988. He was carrying a green card at the time of his arrest. According 

to an international treaty that has been signed and ratified by the United States 

(one of the ones that Mr. Bush has not yet decided to abrogate, perhaps because 

he is unaware of its existence), everyone who is arrested by a foreign government 

is guaranteed the right to seek help from the consular post of his own country. 

<P>Mr. Surez was never told of this right and U.S. officials repeatedly told Mexico's 

consular office that Mr. Surez was not a Mexican citizen, something the officials 

knew to be a lie. Although undeniably guilty, the Mexican government believes 

that with representation provided by the consular office Mr. Surez might have 

received a life imprisonment instead of a death sentence. 

<P>Mr. Surez is not the first to be deprived of his rights under this treaty. 

Two Mexicans, a Paraguayan, a Canadian and two Germans, have been executed during 

the last few years, none of whom was given timely access to consular services. 

<P>Those of us who wonder what form retaliation for denying consular access to 

foreign nationals by the U.S. will take may get their answers as soon as a foreign 

country arrests an American citizen and denies him or her access to consular assistance. 

Mr. Bush's disapproval at such treatment of one of his own will surely be heard 

around the world even though it will be difficult for him to suggest that such 

treatment of an American citizen is any more egregious than the treatment received 

by Mr. Surez. 

<P>It is easy to see why Mr. Bush is upset with Mr. Mubarak and the Egyptian government 

for their treatment of Mr. Ibrahim. It is easy to see why people concerned with 

human rights in this country are upset with the treatment received by Messrs. 

Hamdi and Surez at the hands of Messrs. Bush and Ashcroft. Perhaps Mr. Bush and 

Mr. Mubarak can get together and each explain to the other why what they have 

done should not offend those who are concerned with human rights. Then they could 

explain it to the rest of us. It would almost certainly be enlightening. </p>
