SALT LAKE CITY -- When the Winter Olympics opens tonight, both of us will be standing on the sidelines and cheering -- one as mayor of the host city, the other as merely a rabid fan of Nordic skiing. But for all the hoopla and speed and elegance, we also are both aware that the future of the Winter Games is in danger, because winter itself is in danger.

<p>The world's scientists have issued strong warnings about climate change in the past few years, and their computer models show clearly that, of all seasons, winter may change the most. Across the West, snow levels are expected to climb hundreds of feet up the mountains. In the East, according to a recent assessment by scientific researchers, the cross-country skiing and snowmobile industries "may become nonexistent by 2100."</p>

<p>The majority of sub-Arctic glacial systems are now in rapid retreat. Sea ice in the Arctic is thinning quickly, and winter, measured by dates of first and last freeze, is now almost three weeks shorter across North American latitudes than it was in 1970.</p>

<p>Such changes have practical implications. The weakening of winter will, for instance, mean less water stored in mountain snowpacks for summer irrigation. The ski industry is already fearful of the economic losses from shortened seasons.</p>

<p>As you watch the world's finest athletes glide across your TV screen for the next two weeks, consider, too, how sad it will be to lose much of that part of the year when you can glide across ice or race down a slope.</p>

<p>This doesn't have to happen. We've already locked in some global warming from our profligate use of fossil fuels in the past, but it's not too late to take serious action to slow climate change. Indeed, though Washington is still in the grip of the fossil fuel lobbyists, state and local governments  are beginning to lead the way to clean energy now.</p>

<p>Here in Salt Lake City people are committed to cutting emissions of carbon dioxide 7 percent or more, meeting the targets of the Kyoto Protocol, to which all industrialized nations except the United States (under the Bush administration) have voiced commitment.</p>

<p>How will it be done? By reducing energy consumption, preserving large tracts of open space and creating new guidelines for "high performance buildings." Salt Lake City is changing development patterns, expanding its mass transportation system -- in short, it's growing smart.</p>

<p>Salt Lake City is not alone. The Seattle City Council last fall pledged that the city would meet or beat the targets of the Kyoto treaty on global warming, and promised that its municipal utility would soon be "carbon-neutral," generating power without contributing to the greenhouse effect. Voters in San Francisco last fall passed, by a wide margin, an initiative that commits the city to buying large amounts of solar power. And the governors of the New England states, prodded by new computer models showing that Boston's climate could resemble present-day Atlanta's by century's end, have also committed to reductions in CO<SUB>2</SUB> output.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, local governments are experimenting with electric cars and windmills, with gas-guzzler taxes and prime parking spaces for high-mileage cars, with new rapid transit incentives and old utility phase-outs.</p>

<p>All of this would be easier and more effective with committed leadership and backing from the federal government. In the meantime, others have to take the lead.</p>

<p>Municipalities are good competitors. Every four years, mayors around the world vie with each other to land the next Olympics. If we spent the same effort and creativity on redesigning our cities for energy efficiency, we might do more than determine who wins the next Winter Games.</p>

<p>We might actually save winter.</p>

        <i>Ross C. "Rocky" Anderson, a Democrat, is the mayor of Salt Lake City. Bill McKibben is the author, most recently, of "Long Distance: Testing Limits in a Year of Living Strenuously," about endurance sports.</i>
