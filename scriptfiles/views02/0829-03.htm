<p> PARIS</b> </a>-- It is hard to judge whether the generational split on the 

Iraq issue, between Republicans who governed under the first President George 

Bush and those in Washington today, is more likely to block a war or speed its 

coming.

<p>The young George Bush and his neoconservative advisers and cheerleaders want 

the war, but opposition is widening and solidifying, in public opinion as well 

as within the Republican Party. It is possible that the administration will feel 

compelled to go to war while it can. Gallup Poll findings released on Friday say 

that only 20 percent of Americans support a U.S. attack made without allies.

<p>By now the public has also taken note that members of the war party and their 

main backers in the press seem, without exception, to have arranged to be elsewhere 

while the last serious fighting was done, in Vietnam.

<p>The &quot;chicken-hawk&quot; issue is not simple demagogy. It justifies asking 

if those planning this war are serious, and if they know what they are doing. 

&quot;Sweet is war,&quot; wrote Erasmus, &quot;to those who know it not.&quot; 

James Baker, formerly the senior President Bush's secretary of state, is the latest 

from the father's administration to tell the son that while fighting against &quot;rogues 

like Saddam ... is an important foreign policy priority for America,&quot; there 

are some conditions to be met. The United States must have allies. To have allies, 

it must respect international law. UN Security Council backing is needed for an 

attack. This means a new UN demand that Saddam Hussein admit inspectors, with 

time for him to react (or even accept).

<p>Next, the Palestine problem has to be out of the way before attacking Saddam. 

That requires an end to Palestinian suicide bombings, Israeli withdrawal to last 

September's positions and an immediate end to Israeli settlement activity. Therefore, 

Baker's actual message to the younger Bush is that the United States can't go 

to war, either now or in the near future. These conditions have not been met, 

and the last of them possibly cannot be met. A Palestine-Israel truce or settlement 

is impossible without the United States abandoning the policy of unqualified support 

for Israel that the younger Bush has followed since he came into office. Until 

now the hawks have simply insisted that war is necessary because Saddam is a murderous 

and dangerous despot. Few disagree with the description, but many disagree with 

the proposition, since there are many such figures in the world and the Bush administration 

coexists comfortably with most of them.

<p>The only occasion I can recall when Washington found the sordid character of 

a foreign leader sufficient to justify a war was in 1989, when George Bush senior 

invaded Panama to seize Manuel Noriega. That operation, not the Gulf War, seems 

to be what the younger Bush wants to repeat. However, Iraq is bigger and presumably 

better defended than Panama, and the political context is explosively different.

<p>In any case, the justification for a war has nothing to do with a war's feasibility. 

Overturning Saddam could simultaneously be a good cause and a bad idea. It is 

reasonable to argue that the foreseen casualties, and the foreseeable international 

political backlash to a unilateral U.S. attack on Iraq, could outweigh the advantages 

of getting rid of the Iraqi leader.

<p>This administration and its supporters argue as if the feasibility issue could 

be resolved by willpower or &quot;resolve.&quot; If you question the feasibility 

of the project, you must somehow be on Saddam's side.

<p>If you think it is desirable to overturn Saddam, you are required to think 

that most of his army will run away when Americans arrive, and that the people 

will cheer the United States in the streets of Baghdad. It is not allowed to imagine 

that the Iraqi army might fight simply because it is the nation's army.

<p>The public is listening when James Baker, Brent Scowcroft, Lawrence Eagleburger 

and other senior Republicans say that realism requires that plans to invade Iraq 

accommodate the possibility of a big and expensive war, significant casualties 

and major negative political backlash.

<p>They are making it necessary for the younger Bush's administration and its 

backers to give up the irresponsible arguments they have been using. But they 

almost certainly have not convinced them, and by complicating their situation 

they could be forcing them toward what George W. Bush has already threatened, 

a preemptive war - which in this case would be a war of domestic political preemption.</p>
