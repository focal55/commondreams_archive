<p>As the Bush administration prepares to make war on the Iraqi people -- and 

make no mistake, it is the civilian population of that country and not Saddam 

Hussein who will bear the brunt of the hostilities -- it is important that we 

recall the medical consequences of the last Gulf War. That conflict was, in effect, 

a nuclear war. 

<P>During the 1991 Gulf War, the United States deployed hundreds of tons of weapons, 

many of them anti-tank shells made of depleted uranium 238. This material is 1.7 

times more dense than lead, and hence when incorporated into an anti-tank shell 

and fired, it achieves great momentum, cutting through tank armor like a hot knife 

through butter. 

<P>What other properties does uranium 238 possess? First, it is pyrophoric: When 

it hits a tank at high speed it bursts into flames, producing tiny aerosolized 

particles less than 5 microns in diameter that are easily inhalable into the terminal 

air passages of the lung. Second, it is a potent radioactive carcinogen, emitting 

a relatively heavy alpha particle composed of 2 protons and 2 neutrons. Once inside 

the body -- either in the lung if it has been inhaled, or in a wound if it penetrates 

flesh, or ingested since it concentrates in the food chain and contaminates water 

-- it can produce cancer in the lungs, bones, blood, or kidneys. Third, it has 

a half-life of 4.5 billion years, meaning the areas in which this ammunition was 

used in Iraq and Kuwait during Gulf War will remain effectively radioactive for 

the rest of time. 

<P>Children are 10 to 20 times more sensitive to the effects of radiation than 

adults. My fellow pediatricians in the Iraqi town of Basra, for example, are reporting 

an increase of 6 to 12 times in the incidence of childhood leukemia and cancer. 

Yet because of the sanctions imposed upon Iraq by the United States and United 

Nations, they have no access to drugs or effective radiation machines to treat 

their patients. 

<P>The incidence of congenital malformations has doubled in the exposed populations 

in Iraq where these weapons were used. Among them are babies born with only one 

eye or missing all or part of their brain. 

<P>The medical consequences of the use of uranium 238 almost certainly did not 

affect only Iraqis. Some U.S. veterans exposed to it are reported, by at least 

one medical researcher, to be excreting uranium in their urine a decade later. 

Other reports indicate it is being excreted in their semen. (The fact that almost 

one-third of the American tanks used in Desert Storm were themselves made of uranium 

238 is another story, for their crews were thereby exposed to whole-body gamma 

radiation.) 

<P>Would these effects have surprised the U.S. authorities? No, for incredible 

as it may seem, the American military's own studies prior to Desert Storm warned 

that aerosol uranium exposure under battlefield conditions could lead to cancers 

of the lung and bone, kidney damage, non-malignant lung disease, neurocognitive 

disorders, chromosomal damage and birth defects. 

<P>Do George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, Paul Wolfowitz, Condoleezza Rice, and Donald 

Rumsfeld understand the medical consequences of the 1991 war and the likely health 

effects of the next one they are now planning? If they do not, their ignorance 

is breathtaking; even more incredible though -- and alas, much more likely -- 

is that they do understand, but do not care. 

<P><I>Helen Caldicott has devoted the last 25 years to an international campaign 

to educate the public about the medical hazards of the nuclear age. She spoke 

in San Francisco recently in a benefit for the Nuclear Policy Research Institute, 

which she founded.</I></p>
