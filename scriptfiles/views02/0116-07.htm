Can the Federal Reserve spur an economic recovery in the U.S.?  This is no 

academic question.  Officially, 8.3 million Americans are out of a job.



<p>On Jan. 11 in San Francisco, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan made a 

speech implying that cutting the short-term interest rate again may be a 

necessary move to get the nation’s economy back on track.



<p>"I would emphasize that we continue to face significant risks in the near 

term," he said.  Greenspan also noted frail corporate profitability and 

business investment, rising joblessness and weak consumer spending power.



<p>On the day he spoke, the Ford Motor Co. announced that it would sharply cut 

production of cars and fire 35,000 workers worldwide.  Zero-percent rate 

financing in late 2001 didn’t help the car maker maintain profitability.  

Could there be a lesson here about easy credit?



<p>Perhaps the nation’s newspaper of record can shed some light on this.  

According to a Jan. 12 New York Times article, “Since last January, the Fed 

has lowered its benchmark federal funds target rate – which directly affects 

many small-business, credit card and automobile loans -by 4.75 percentage 

points, to 1.75 percent.”



<p>Robert Manning, author of Credit Card Nation, <www.creditcardnation.com>, 

has a different view of what the Fed is (not) doing.  “The Fed's traditional 

policy of reducing the discount rate to stimulate business borrowing and 

investment is incapable of addressing the new realities of the 

post-industrial, consumer driven economy,” he said.



<p>The high value of the dollar has harmed U.S. industry by making its exports 

expensive on the world market.  On a related note, the high dollar attracts 

funds from foreign lenders.  This allows Americans to buy more than they 

sell, thanks to borrowed money from abroad.



<p>Manning continued: “With the end of community banking and rise of financial 

services conglomerates, the banking industry is simply profiting from the 

lower cost of credit.  They refuse to pass on the savings to consumers or 

small businesses in the form of lower interest rates.  More strikingly, they 

have tightened their lending criteria and are in effect starving highly 

indebted households (simply forcing payment of double-digit interest rates) 

and not offering additional loans during a difficult period (like the crisis 

in Argentina).”



<p>The credit system in America and Argentina is cut from similar cloth.  

During economic downturns, debtors in both countries who need money get 

milked like cows or denied needed loans.



<p>What if Fed interest rate cuts don’t spur a U.S. economic recovery?  Fiscal 

policy, anyone?
