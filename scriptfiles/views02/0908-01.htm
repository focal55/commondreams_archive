<p>IN THE DAYS immediately after terrorists transformed four commercial passenger 

jets into guided missiles last year and forever altered our world, people talked. 

We talked of our immediate past, and where we had been on Sept. 11.

<P>Two weeks later I happened to be on a book tour in Boston, and I must have had no fewer than 15 conversations about the attacks that late September day with people I was meeting for the first time. Everyone needed to share where they were, what they had experienced, and their personal interpretation of how things had changed.</P>







<P>All the conversations that day seemed to share one thing: the desire to portray oneself as having a connection, however tenuous or vague, to the victims of the attack. One woman told me that she had gone that weekend to a memorial service for a friend of a friend. Another person said that she'd flown twice on the same Boston-based flight that would augur into the World Trade Center's north tower. A man shared with me his fears for his nephew who was living in Brooklyn Heights and who was at the moment enduring the fumes from the fires in lower Manhattan.</P>







<P>There were more, and I certainly wasn't shy with my own anecdotes: The fact that I had been sitting in a plane on the tarmac at Denver International Airport when the attacks occurred and was stranded in Denver for a week, or the footnote that my wife once worked on the 104th floor of one of the World Trade Center towers.</P>







<P>Throughout that day in Boston I was with a woman who was conspicuously quiet: my media escort, the individual my publisher had retained to take me to area bookstores and radio stations.</P>







<P>Around lunchtime I wondered why she was so silent when people shared their tales of 9/11. My sense was that suddenly we were a nation of talkers - except for this woman. And so I asked her where she had been on the morning of 9/11.</P>







<P>She rolled her eyes and told me - not a trace of self-pity in her voice - that she had begun the day watching as her brother perished because he worked on an upper floor of one of the towers, and then she helped novelist Jane Hamilton find a way back to her home in the Midwest.</P>







<P>After a moment she added: ''If I entered the conversations you've been having today, I would have stopped them dead in their tracks. There's a lot of one-upmanship going on right now, and I just don't feel like playing.''</P>







<P>Ever since then, I've been leery of talking about where I was on 9/11, or what I was experiencing. It's not that I no longer believe it's healthy or helpful to reflect on my specific place in the cosmos on 9/11.</P>







<P>But my grief is different from that experienced by the families of the nearly 3,000 people who died, the people who live still in lower Manhattan, or the people who rose to the daunting task of cleaning the mess up: Carting away a literal mountain of rubble, trying to identify the tens of thousands of body parts, or even replacing the windows that were shattered at the nearby apartment buildings.</P>







<P>My grief - the grief of most Americans - is for the loss of that feeling of invulnerability we've savored since the Cold War ended. In that regard it's very real. Likewise, our sorrow for what the victims endured before they died and for their families who are left mourning is with us every single day.</P>







<P>Nevertheless, when we talk this week of the anniversary, let us not simply recall where we were a year ago Wednesday. Let us not merely sit before the mindnumbing parade of images - the towers, the Pentagon, the living, the dead, the missing who will never be found - that are monopolizing our TV screens and being used to sell a small library of new books.</P>







<P>Let us honor the victims instead by discussing as well energy policies that do not demand foreign oil, and behavior that is less dependent upon fossil fuel. Let us talk of peace in the Middle East. Let us celebrate our incomprehensible bounties, while imagining how we can share that largess with the rest of the world. And, yes, let us envision ways to spread democracy - ways that do not involve the carnage that comes with all war.</P>







<P>In short, let us talk this week not only of where we were, but also of where we can be.</P>
