<p>WASHINGTON -- Throughout its campaign to immunize U.S. military peacekeepers 

from the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court, the Bush administration 

has defended its commitment to identify and prosecute perpetrators of mass murder 

and other war criminals.

<p>As evidence, administration officials cite their support for the ad hoc tribunals 

for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia, their placement of a career lawyer from 

the Defense Department as lead prosecutor for the new Sierra Leone tribunal and 

their diplomatic efforts to establish an effective tribunal in Cambodia.

<p>And yet in Afghanistan, where the United States has had the greatest power 

to ensure investigation of possible mass atrocities and see that the guilty are 

brought to justice, until now they have done nothing.

<p>For months evidence has accumulated that many of the Taliban fighters who surrendered 

after the fall of Mazar-e Sharif and Kunduz last November were killed by Northern 

Alliance forces under the control of Abdul Rashid Dostum. Eyewitnesses report 

that the prisoners died of asphyxiation after being transported in sealed containers 

to the Shebergan prison.

<p>The number of dead is not known. The current issue of Newsweek, citing the 

accounts of survivors and drivers of the container trucks, estimates hundreds 

or even thousands of deaths.

<p>The clues to finding the truth lie in mass graves near the prison. A comprehensive 

forensic investigation could reveal the number of dead, who they are and how they 

died - and lead to a determination of who was responsible. In January, two investigators 

from Physicians for Human Rights discovered a mass grave site, and in February 

our forensic scientists found fresh remains. In early March we shared the information 

about our discoveries with the State and Defense Departments, as well as with 

the United Nations and the Afghan government. We urgently sought American military 

protection of the sites from the high risk of tampering, and we asked for an immediate 

and thorough investigation of the graves.

<p>Only the United States is in a position to ensure the security essential to 

allowing an investigation to go forward. On moral grounds, an especially compelling 

reason exists for U.S. action: The perpetrator of the alleged war crime is America's 

military ally.

<p>The administration's response has been inadequate. The Pentagon has refused 

to provide security for an investigation, much less conduct one. It has even refused 

to acknowledge that anything untoward may have taken place.

<p>The United States has often warned those who commit war crimes that somewhere, 

somehow, they will be discovered and pursued.

<p>The lesson of postwar Bosnia, Rwanda and East Timor has been that stability 

cannot occur without accountability for missing persons and human rights violations. 

Here the evidence of war crimes is sitting in those graves, waiting to reveal 

its truth. Action is essential before the evidence is destroyed.

<p>The Bush administration this week promised to move forward. To be most effective, 

it should initiate a Security Council resolution to form a United Nations commission 

of inquiry that would conduct a credible and independent investigation of the 

prisoners' fate. Otherwise the United States risks the very political manipulation 

of war crimes investigations that it claims (erroneously, I believe) is a flaw 

in the International Criminal Court.

<p>Multinational forces should provide the security and the Bush administration 

should provide the resources needed to enable such an investigation to succeed. 

U.S. allies may be innocent, but they may be guilty of mass murder. It is time 

to find out.
