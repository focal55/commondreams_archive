<p>Happy Anniversary, everyone.

<p> The little-rebate- that-could came into our lives a year ago, a special introductory 

offer of prosperity from the CEO who promised to run the country just like a business.

<p> The $300-per-person checks were mailed last summer, when we fretted less about 

terrorism than about a transition from boom to what's turning to bust. The checks 

were a down payment on the first, and apparently only, economic policy in the 

briefing binder of the first MBA president: A $1.4-trillion tax cut, most of which 

is to be doled out in the future to those of the class who need the money now 

to pay their lawyers.

<p> "I believe when you cut taxes it spurs economic growth," President George 

W. Bush said during an appearance in Alabama yesterday that his aides hoped would 

pump up sagging economic confidence.

<p> This was a do-over of the shot the president missed on Wall Street last week. 

Yesterday the made-to-order White House backdrop changed from blue to red. Its 

made-for-TV slogan switched from "Corporate Responsibility" to "Strengthening 

Our Economy." That's where viewers' eyes were supposed to focus, anyway. Who could 

blame them for staring instead at the plunging Dow?

<p> "The economy is coming back, that's the fact," the president declared.

<p> Anniversaries are a time for taking stock. So looking back on the year since 

Bush's only economic policy was put in place, here are some snapshots from the 

country's economic album:

<p> A year ago, the federal budget was running toward a year-end surplus of $127 

billion - so much money that Washington contemplated spending some on changing 

Social Security from a system of guaranteed benefits to a collection of private 

accounts to be invested in the stock market. This was so ordinary workers could 

become rich retirees.

<p> Now, the White House says the current budget is heading for a deficit of $165 

billion, a dazzling turnaround the president's team blames on everything but the 

revenue drain from the tax cut. The real villains are the dropping stock market 

and congressional spenders, the White House said. The non-partisan Congressional 

Budget Office differs, citing the tax cut for a drop in income-tax revenues.

<p> Maybe you took your $300 check and went straight to Wal-Mart. But maybe you 

saved and invested in America - trying, perhaps, to become a rich retiree. The 

Standard and Poor's 500 closed on July 16, 2001, at 1,202. It's down about 25 

percent since then. So a $300 check socked away in an index fund now would be 

worth about $225.

<p> If your check is long since spent, perhaps you take comfort, as the president 

does, in the way consumers like you manage to maintain robust buying habits despite 

slow wage growth and the corporate crime spree that robs them of their savings.

<p> It's good to spend your money on a "good and service," the president told 

us. This is supposed to translate into jobs for Americans who make goods or at 

least find work stocking shelves with imports.

<p> In fact, unemployment rose slightly last month to 5.9 percent - up from 4.6 

percent a year ago. The number of people out of work for month after month grows. 

Last June, 728,000 laid-off workers had been without jobs for 27 weeks or longer, 

according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That number now has more than doubled, 

to 1.7 million.

<p> The median length of time an unemployed worker is looking for a job has stretched 

from about six weeks a year ago to 12 now. Except for one month during the long 

and deep recession of the early 1980s, the search for new work has not been this 

long since 1948, said Jared Bernstein of the Economic Policy Institute.

<p> Of course, the president said interest rates and inflation are low. Thank 

you, Alan Greenspan. And economic growth in the first quarter zoomed up more than 

6 percent. That will tumble as quick as a dot-com stock later this year, most 

economists predict.

<p> But do not fear, the president said. Help is on the way. 

<p> Now that his tax cuts have failed to create jobs, cheer investors, boost wages, 

prop up profits or keep the government's fiscal house in order, he has a plan 

for the future. More tax cuts.</p>
