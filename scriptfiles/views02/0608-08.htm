<p> So it has come to this for a leading figure in U.S. progressive politics.  

Ralph Nader, consumer advocate and Green Party presidential candidate, wants 

an inquiry into the officiating during the recent Kings-Lakers playoff 

series.  NBA Commissioner David Stern disagrees.



<p>I take issue with both of their positions.  Why?  They are misdirecting the 

public’s attention away from the economics of pro basketball.



<p>Well, in my view, the NBA is a publicly-subsidized playground for the rich 

and super rich.  For example, this year’s playoff games have been televised 

on NBC, a Pentagon corporation.  It wouldn’t exist without regular taxpayer 

dollars from the U.S. population’s pockets to weapons contractors.



<p>The U.S. public pays for the “privilege” of pro sports in other ways.  

Here’s an example from my hometown of Sacramento.  It is not an exception to 

the rule nationwide.



<p>“The city of Sacramento finally has the cash it needs to keep the Kings in 

town,” reported The Sacramento Bee of July 19, 1997.  How much?  Well, the 

city (the taxpayers) sold about $73 million in bonds to help keep 

Sacramento’s basketball team financially solvent.



<p>Kings officials at the time had informed the city that the team might leave 

for financially greener pastures without the public subsidy.  Let them go, I 

said at the time.  Others agreed, but their voices were hard for the public 

to hear.



<p>Imagine the response a boss would give a worker if s/he voiced a similar 

demand to that of Kings officials.  Would a boss wait a minute of less 

before showing the worker to the door?  I doubt it.



<p>On a related note, the presence of a pro sports franchise in Sacramento 

hasn’t reduced the number of poor and “working poor.”  In 1998, my eyes 

watered at the number of these people being served at a local meals program 

for which I volunteered.  But then, great wealth generates widespread 

poverty, as the economic boom of the 1990s that increased the U.S. wealth 

gap to record levels has shown.



<p>Nader, arguably the nation’s best-know progressive, is off the mark 

demanding an inquiry into the calls of basketball officials during a playoff 

series.  His stance sidesteps who benefits from pro sports by accepting a 

false community of interests between those who control pro basketball and 

the public.  This is a hoop dream, a sad sight to see.



<p>Government is the lifeline for the rich, according to author Ellen Meiksins 

Wood. In pro basketball and big business generally, the public supports a 

wealthy minority.  Progressive politics should be partly about focusing on 

who lives large and who squeaks by, and why.</P>
