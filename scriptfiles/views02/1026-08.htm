<p>For grassroots economic and social justice activists, there was never any doubt 

about the identity of their representative in Washington. No matter what state 

they lived in, the senator they counted on was the same man: Paul Wellstone. </p>

<p> But for the family-farm activists with whom Wellstone marched and rallied 

across the 1980s and 1990s and into the twenty-first century, the Minnesota Democrat 

was more than a representative. He was their champion. And the news of his death 

Friday in a Minnesota plane crash struck with all the force of a death in the 

family. </p>

<p> I know, because I had to deliver that news. Family farm activists from across 

the upper Midwest had gathered Friday morning for the annual rural life conference 

of the Churches' Center for Land and People, in Sinsinawa, Wisconsin. I had just 

finished delivering the keynote speech--ironically, about the need for activists 

to go into politics--when a colleague called with the "you'd better be sitting 

down..." news. Sister Miriam Brown, OP, the organizer of the conference and one 

of the most tireless crusaders for economic justice in rural America, and I talked 

for a few minutes about how to tell the crowd. </p>

<p> We knew the 150 people in the room well enough to understand that this news 

would change the tenor of the day. But we did not know just how much until I announced 

from the podium that Wellstone, his wife of thirty-nine years, Sheila, their daughter 

Marcia, and several campaign aides had been killed two hours earlier. </p>

<p> Cries of "No!" and "My God! My God!" filled the room, as grown men felt for 

tables to keep their balance, husbands and wives hugged one another and everyone 

began an unsuccessful struggle to choke back tears. The group gathered in a large 

circle. People wept in silence until, finally, a woman began to recite the Lord's 

Prayer for the son of Russian Jewish immigrants who had touched the lives and 

the hearts of solid Midwestern Catholic and Lutheran farmers who do not think 

of themselves as having many friends in Congress. </p>

<p> "He was our flagbearer," said Cathy Statz, education director for the Wisconsin 

Farmers Union. "There are plenty of people in Congress who vote right, but Paul 

did everything right. We didn't have to ask him, we didn't have to lobby him, 

he understood. It was like having one of us in Congress." </p>

<p> That was how Wellstone wanted it. "People have to believe you are on their 

side, that someone in the Senate is listening," the senator once told me. "If 

there is someone in Congress, maybe just one person, it gives them a sense that 

change is possible." </p>

<p> Wellstone's deep connection with progressive activists across the country 

was something that his colleagues noted again and again as they recalled the rare 

senator who was, himself, as much an activist as a politician. "He was the pied 

piper of modern politics--so many people heard him and wanted to follow him in 

his fight," recalled Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, who is considering a 

bid for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2004, just as Wellstone considered 

a similar run in 2000. </p>

<p> Mourning in St. Paul, where he had come to campaign for Wellstone's re-election, 

Senator Edward Kennedy hailed his fellow liberal. "Today, the nation lost its 

most passionate advocate for fairness and justice for all," Kennedy said of Wellstone, 

who was the No. 1 political target of the Bush Administration this year but had 

secured a lead in the polls after voting against authorizing the President to 

attack Iraq. "He had an intense passion and enormous ability to reach out, touch 

and improve the lives of the people he served so brilliantly." </p>

<p> For Wisconsin's Russ Feingold, the loss was doubly difficult. Wellstone and 

he were the truest mavericks in the current Senate, lonely dissenters not just 

from George W. Bush's conservative Republicanism but from the centrist compromises 

of their own Democratic Party. Yet, Wellstone was something more: an inspiration. 

Recalling that the Minnesotan won his seat in 1990 with a grassroots campaign 

that relied more on humor than money, Feingold, who was elected with a similar 

campaign two years later, said, "He showed me that it was possible for someone 

with very little money to get elected to the Senate." </p>

<p> Before his election to the Senate, Wellstone was a professor at Carlton College, 

in Northfield, Minnesota. Officially, he taught political science. Unofficially, 

he was referred to as "the professor of political activism." He created a course 

titled "Social Movements and Grassroots Organizing," and he taught by example. 

In the 1980s, Wellstone organized Minnesota campaign events for the Rev. Jesse 

Jackson's presidential campaigns, marched with striking Hormel workers in Austin, 

Minnesota, and was arrested while protesting at a bank that was foreclosing on 

farms. </p>

<p> That was when Denise O'Brien, an Atlantic, Iowa, farm activist, first heard 

of Wellstone. "I remember hearing about this professor in Minnesota who cared 

so much about what was happening to farmers that he was willing to get arrested 

with us," O'Brien said Friday. "That had a big impact on me. I always remembered 

that he had stood with us." O'Brien, who went on to become president of the National 

Family Farm Coalition, recalled how amazed she was when Wellstone was elected 

to the Senate. </p>

<p> "But, you know what, he never changed. He was always that guy I first heard 

about, the one who was willing to stand up for the farmers," she remembered. "When 

the black farmers from down South were marching to protest their treatment by 

the Department of Agriculture, he would march with them. When no one was paying 

attention to this current farm crisis, he organized the Rally for Rural America." 

</p>

<p> At that March 2000, rally, Wellstone delivered one of his trademark speeches, 

a fiery outburst of anger at agribusiness conglomerates mixed with faith that 

organizing and political activism could yet save family farmers. "When Wellstone 

got going, he was so passionate. He was like the old populists, the way he would 

tear into the corporations," recalled John Kinsman, the president of the Family 

Farm Defenders. </p>

<p> At the children's camp run by the National Farmers Union, Cathy Statz says, 

"We use the video of his speech to the Rally for Rural America to teach the boys 

and girls that there are people in politics you can really look up to, that there 

are people who speak for us." </p>

<p> Then Statz stopped herself. Tears formed in her eyes. "I can't believe he's 

dead," she said. "I can't imagine the Senate without him." </p>

<p> The emotions ran deep after the announcement of the senator's death. But the 

people gathered at Sinsinawa were activists in the Wellstone tradition. So after 

they had wiped away their tears, they gathered to hear a panel of farm activists 

discuss running for local office. Greg David, of rural Jefferson County, Wisconsin, 

got up to tell the story of how, after two losses, he was finally elected to the 

county board of supervisors. His voice catching as he spoke, David concluded, 

"I think if Senator Wellstone was here today, if he could speak to us, he would 

say: Don't be afraid. Go out and run for public office. Put yourself in the contest. 

Running for office, serving in office, that's a part of building our movement. 

Maybe we didn't know before that it could be a form of activism, but we know that 

now. Senator Wellstone showed us that."</p> </p>
