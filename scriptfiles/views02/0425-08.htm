<i>“I know not what course

others may take; but as for me, give me liberty or give me death!”

</i>—Patrick Henry, 1775

<p>

Does it make sense to terrorize Afghanistan and to Talibanize the US in

order to fight terrorism and the Taliban? Does the US have to act as

viciously and violently as Osama bin Laden in an effort to vanquish him?

<p>

Bush launched a <i>crusade</i> against a <i>jihad</i>, making war abroad

to bring peace, abrogating freedoms at home to bolster democracy. Which

part of this makes sense? 

<p>

In Bush’s war against Afghanistan, the US bombed the UN (four UN

minesweepers, in a country of some ten million mines, became the first

fatalities), the Red Cross (which was hit twice), mosques (one was hit as

Ramadan began), villages, old-age homes, houses, and many other civilian

sites of everyday life for ordinary people, destroying their lives,

families, and communities.

<p>

In the US, there is a different sort of threat. Bush’s belief that “there

ought to be limits to freedom” and his simplistic, polarizing warning of

September 20<sup>th</sup> that “either you are with us, or you are with

the terrorists” sets the harsh tone for the administration. Bush’s Press

Secretary Ari Fleischer followed up on September 26<sup>th</sup> with his

threat “to all Americans that they need to watch what they say, watch

what they do”. Attorney General John Ashcroft, not to be left out of the

fascistic fun, admonished people concerned about rights and liberties on

December 6<sup>th</sup>. Speaking to a Senate committee, he said: “to

those who scare peaceloving people with phantoms of lost liberty, my

message is this: Your tactics aid terrorists, for they erode our national

unity and diminish our resolve. They give ammunition to America’s

enemies, and pause to America’s friends.” What a baseless, horrible, and

anti-democratic charge to level against citizens exercising their

fundamental rights. This is precisely why we have, and should highly

value, our First Amendment. How authoritarian and cruel to say to people

who disagree, or are fearful, that what they are doing is comparable to

terrorism and treason!

<p>

Scores of people deemed “other”—Arabs and South Asians, Israelis and

Central Asians, Muslims and Jews—have been xenophobically harassed and

attacked by the government, corporations, and vigilantes in the US. There

have been approximately 2,000 people held in secret detention, mostly

held in solitary confinement and incommunicado, most likely with no

connection to terrorism, all of whose names and charges are unknown to

us. Additionally, there are possibly 5,000 or more people—primarily

Middle Eastern men, though anyone may be considered “fair” game—to be

“questioned” by Ashcroft’s deputies.

<p>

So secretive and duplicitous the Bush Administration has been that it

won’t divulge the evidence against bin Laden it claims to have and has

promised to publicize. Even if we already reasonably <i>assume</i> his

guilt, direct evidence is still of course necessary. The administration

also does not release any information about those it detains, while the

government increases its (formerly unconstitutional) powers of

surveillance, search, and seizure. The levels of secrecy and deception

practiced by this administration—notoriously including the revelation

that Bush instituted a bunkerized “shadow government”, secret from even

the Congress—are alarming to say the least. At worst, it is another step

in Bush’s quiet coup against democracy.

<p>

Further erosion of civil rights comes via military tribunals, a form of

judicial martial law. Speaking of Bush’s executive order establishing

secret military tribunals, Yale Professor Rogers M. Smith says that<br>



<dl>

<dd>The order allows military officials within the United States to

arrest aliens on mere suspicion of terrorism, without having to show

probable cause; to try them entirely in secret; to use any evidence

against them that military officials judge to have ‘probative value,’

even if it is mere hearsay or illegally obtained; to convict them on

simple preponderance of such evidence, rather than proof beyond a

reasonable doubt; to convict them by a vote of two-thirds of the military

judges, without a requirement of unanimity, much less trial by jury; and

to sentence them to death, without appeal to the civilian courts.

<p>



</dl>

Additionally, it is Bush <i>himself</i> who personally decides who

gets charged in these kangaroo courts and it is Secretary of Defense

(sic) Rumsfeld himself who <i>personally</i> has to OK the defense

lawyer—keeping in mind that Rumsfeld and Bush are also the commanders of

the judge and the prosecutor. And, according to Ashcroft’s Congressional

testimony, Bush and Rumsfeld <i>are</i> the appellate process.&nbsp; The

Bush Administration sounds more like a monarchy every day.

<p>

William Safire, the conservative <i>New York Times</i> essayist, argues

that each military tribunal would be empowered to “conceal evidence by

citing national security, make up its own rules, find a defendant guilty

even if a third of the officers disagree, and execute the alien with no

review by any civilian court”. Excising the judicial branch, it would be

the executive branch alone that is the “investigator, prosecutor, judge,

jury and jailer or executioner”. How convenient! This is what Bush calls

a “full and fair trial”. This type of Orwellian authoritarianism is not

entirely surprising, however, given that Bush has three times publicly

said, as recently as December 18<sup>th</sup> and July 27<sup>th</sup>

2001, that things would be much easier if he were the dictator—for him,

that is.

<p>

Many legal experts have criticized the use of military tribunals. A

letter signed by more than 300 law professors, for example, describes the

military tribunals as “legally deficient, unnecessary and unwise”. The

<i>Wall Street Journal</i> simply calls Bush’s military tribunals

“indefensible”, arguing that we shouldn’t be “shredding the

Constitution—which applies to all ‘persons,’ not just citizens”. In 1866,

other legal experts also took issue with military tribunals. In <i>Ex

Parte Milligan</i>, the Supreme Court ruled that “martial law,

established on such a basis, destroys every guarantee of the Constitution

and effectively renders the military independent of and superior to the

civil powers...Civil liberty and this kind of martial law cannot endure

together; one or the other must perish...Martial rule can never exist

where the Courts are open...”

<p>

It is <i>never</i> an inopportune time to assert one’s rights and to

speak up on behalf of justice. Indeed, as Hillel asks, “if not now,

when?” The attacks of September 11<sup>th</sup> were clearly “crimes

against humanity”, especially based on their scope and scale, their

horror and human toll, the number of people killed and that they were

from so many countries, and the number of survivors still terrified.

Bush, however, is treating these heinous crimes as “acts of war”, even

though he earlier and correctly compared Al Qaeda to the mafia. It is an

instructive comparison. 

<p>

When trying to stop and punish the mafia (not to mention mass murderers

such as Kaczinski, Pinochet, McVeigh, and Milosovic), we appropriately

attempt to locate, capture, arrest, arraign, impartially try, convict,

and imprison the guilty people, giving them access to their accusers, the

evidence, and independent defense counsel, following the rules of law and

the norms of justice. We do not, it should be needless to say, carpet

bomb and destroy entire blocks, neighborhoods, towns, cities, and

countries for the purposes of tracking down individuals or even groups of

suspected criminals. 

<p>

The rule of law simply means that the rules need to follow the law—not

the fear, not the fad, not the anger, and not the president—without

exception.
