<p>NEW YORK -- The FBI's bumbling before Sept. 11 is water under the bridge. But 

the bureau's lackadaisical ineptitude in pursuing the anthrax killer continues 

to threaten America's national security by permitting him to strike again or, 

more likely, to flee to Iran or North Korea.

<p>Almost everyone who has encountered the FBI anthrax investigation is aghast 

at the bureau's lethargy. Some in the biodefense community think they know a likely 

culprit, whom I'll call Mr. Z. Although the bureau has carried out lie-detector 

tests on Mr. Z, searched his home twice and interviewed him four times, it has 

not placed him under surveillance or asked its outside handwriting expert to compare 

his writing with that on the anthrax letters.

<p>This is part of a larger pattern. Astonishingly, the FBI allowed the destruction 

of anthrax stocks at Iowa State University, losing what might have been valuable 

genetic clues. Then it waited until December to open the intact anthrax envelope 

it found. The FBI didn't obtain anthrax strains from various labs for comparison 

until March, and the testing is still not complete. The bureau did not systematically 

polygraph scientists at two suspect labs, Fort Detrick, Maryland, and Dugway Proving 

Ground in Utah, until a month ago.

<p>Perhaps it's a cheap shot for an armchair detective to whine about the caution 

of dedicated and exceptionally hard-working investigators. Yet months pass and 

the bureau continues to act like, well, a bureaucracy, plodding along in slow 

motion. People in the biodefense field first gave Mr. Z's name to the bureau as 

a suspect in October.

<p>He denies any wrongdoing, and his friends are heartsick at suspicions directed 

against a man they regard as a patriot. Some of his lie-detector tests show evasion, 

I hear, although that may be because of his temperament.

<p>If Mr. Z were an Arab national, he would have been jailed long ago. But he 

is a true-blue American with close ties to the Defense Department, the CIA and 

the U.S. biodefense program. On the other hand, he was once caught with a girlfriend 

in a biohazard &quot;hot suite&quot; at Fort Detrick, surrounded only by blushing 

germs.

<p>With many experts buzzing about Mr. Z behind his back, it's time for the FBI 

to make a move: Either it should go after him more aggressively, sifting thoroughly 

through his past and picking up loose threads, or it should seek to exculpate 

him and remove this cloud of suspicion.

<p>Whoever sent the anthrax probably had no intention of killing people; the letters 

warned recipients to take antibiotics. My guess is that the goal was to raise 

preparedness against future biological attacks.

<p>So it seems fair to ask the FBI a few questions:

<p>Do you know how many identities and passports Mr. Z has and are you monitoring 

his international travel? I have found at least one alias for him, and he has 

continued to travel abroad on government assignments, even to Central Asia.

<p>Why was his top security clearance suspended in August, less than a month before 

the anthrax attacks began? This move left him infuriated. Are the CIA and military 

intelligence agencies cooperating fully with the investigation?

<p>Have you searched the isolated residence that he had access to last autumn? 

The FBI has known about this building, and knows that Mr. Z gave Cipro, an antibiotic 

used to treat anthrax, to people who visited it. This property and many others 

are legally registered in the name of a friend of Mr. Z, but may be safe houses 

operated by U.S. intelligence.

<p>Have you examined whether Mr. Z has connections to the biggest anthrax outbreak 

among humans ever recorded, which sickened more than 10,000 black farmers in Zimbabwe 

from 1978 to 1980? There is evidence that the anthrax was released by the white 

Rhodesian army fighting against black guerrillas. Mr. Z has said that he participated 

in the white army's much-feared Selous Scouts. Could rogue elements of the American 

military have backed the Rhodesian army in anthrax and cholera attacks against 

blacks?

<p>Mr. Z's résumé also claims involvement in the former South African Defense 

Force; all else aside, who knew that the Defense Department would pick an American 

who had served in the armed forces of two white racist regimes to work in the 

U.S. biodefense program with some of the world's deadliest germs?

<p>What now? When do you shift into high gear?
