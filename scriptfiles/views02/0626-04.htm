<p>NORMAN MINETA, the transportation secretary whose plan for Amtrak is to starve 

it into a cadaver, sang the glories of privatization last week before the US Chamber 

of Commerce. ''We firmly believe that marketplace discipline could deliver higher-quality 

service at competitive prices,'' Mineta said. ''We believe that clear-eyed, comprehensive, 

financially responsible transportation planning'' is ''crucial to the future of 

new forms of passenger rail.''

<P>Most people know that since the Bush administration has given no thought to 

rail as it bails out the bungling airlines, Mineta's proclamations are peaking 

on the same snicker meter as Christine Todd Whitman's over at the Environmental 

Prostration Agency. It does not matter, for instance, that ridership for the Acela 

Express has shot up from 96,000 prior to the terrorist attacks to 205,000 riders 

in February, 220,000 in March, and 243,000 in April.</P>

<P>Rather than expand upon what Acela is doing right - like, duh, it moves faster, 

because, duh, the government invested in equipment - Bush and Mineta have declared 

Amtrak an unmitigated disaster. Bush is offering Amtrak only $512 million in federal 

funds in 2003, less than half of what Amtrak asked for and less than a quarter 

of what the General Accounting Office says is needed for American passenger rail 

to join the 21st century. This week, Amtrak is feverishly asking for $200 million 

in emergency loan guarantees to avoid a shutdown.</P>

<P>In his 1,600-word speech to the chamber, Mineta did not once mention the Acela, 

let alone praise it. He came to bury Amtrak altogether under the mantra of ''The 

country can ill afford to throw billions of federal dollars at Amtrak and just 

hope its problems disappear.... Merely hoping for better performance is a doomed 

approach.''</P>

<P>Mineta looks ridiculous in his trust of the marketplace when there is a dubious 

example that privatization can be a doomed approach. In Britain, privatizating 

the rails was the express to yet another train wreck.</P>

<P>In the mid-1990s, the much-maligned British Rail was broken up into many pieces. 

After years of complaining about bloated bureaucracies, British passengers hailed 

the new system, overseen by Railtrack, with increased ridership. What quickly 

unfolded was the flipside of waste, the tragedy of being cheap.</P>

<P>In the drive for profit, the rail lines were fragmented to the point where 

Railtrack had 2,000 subcontractors. Engineers who understood systems and track 

inspectors who intimately knew specific portions of rail down to their bolts were 

dispersed into separate companies or given pink slips. Institutional memory, by 

many accounts in the British press, resembled a bowl dropped from so high a cabinet 

shelf that the fragments were beyond the hope of any glue. Christian Wolmar, author 

of ''Broken Rails: How Privatization Wrecked Britain's Railways,'' recently wrote 

that privatization of the industry ''resulted in the loss of its culture.... Everything 

is contracted out to casual labor.''</P>

<P>How fragmented and casual the system had become was betrayed in several fatal 

train crashes since 1997 that have claimed a total of 59 lives. In the five years 

before privatization, Wolmar wrote, there had been only eight train fatalities. 

The crashes caused massive enforced slowdowns of trains because rail operators 

had little or no clue where other sections of broken rail lay. The disgraced CEO 

of Railtrack, Gerald Corbett, was forced to say that the breakup of British Rail 

was not designed ''to optimize safety, optimize investment, or cope with the huge 

increase in passengers.'' By December 2000, Prime Minister Tony Blair called a 

ride on public rail as ''absolute hell.''</P>

<P>For practical purposes, the British government is for now overseeing the rails 

again with a not-for-profit company called Network Rail. The government is holding 

out hope for continued private investment and has left many of the operating and 

maintenance contractors in place. But the fires fanned in the Hades of privatization 

remain hot. If you think Amtrak's need of $200 million in emergency loans sounds 

like a lot, the British rails may face between $15 billion to $20 billion in shortfalls 

to maintain its 10-year transportation plan.</P>

<P>Last month, Tim James, one of the researchers in an independent review by the 

University of Sheffield and Oxford Economic Research Associates, said, ''The train 

companies are basically bust.''</P>

<P>The bust of Britain has been so spectacular that Germany has slowed the brakes 

on its own plans for privatization. On the other side of the globe, Bush and Mineta 

have yet to see the broken rail that lies in their path.</P>
