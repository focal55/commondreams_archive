<p>Sometimes I'm certain that the Apocalypse is upon us. My chicken hawk president 

and his compliant Congress want to send other folks' kids (but certainly not their 

own) to Iraq to kill for peace. Somebody murdered people near D.C., and the capital 

of the most heavily armed nation in the world was panic-stricken. The airwaves 

are afloat with politicians declaring that they care about you and me, but few 

of them seem authentic. Financial pundits are referring to the Enrons of the world 

as just a few bad apples when it's obvious that the entire apple cart is rotten. 

To protect our freedom from those who would destroy it, our government seems intent 

on stripping us of personal liberty. 

<p>What then can we do to keep a level head and a loving heart in the midst of 

all this disarray? What can we do to bring about a more compassionate, just and 

safe world? 

<p>Sometimes the temptation is great to turn away, to proclaim there is nothing 

that one person can do, to become cynical, to go into denial about the need to 

do anything, to go back to sleep. But once we have awakened, is unconsciousness 

ever really an option again? 

<p>Cynicism, denial and hopelessness are merely forms of victimhood, placing the 

blame somewhere else for that which ails us. Let me suggest another way: radical 

responsibility. Rather than blaming others, this path requires us to ask ourselves 

at every challenge, "How did I help create this situation and what can I do to 

resolve it?" Sometimes this is not easy, especially when we are certain that someone 

else is fault. But doing so puts us, not others, in charge of our lives. 

<p>You, all of us, are here for a purpose. You have a mission to fulfill - to 

discover your unique gifts and share them with those around you. You likely have 

a vision for a better world, and when you fully live your purpose you help to 

create that world. Some may call you an idealist or a dreamer; wear that title 

with pride. 

<p>This is a time to surround yourself with those who nurture you, who understand 

and respect your hopes and dreams. This is a time to be with those who support 

you to walk your talk, to live your true values, not those advanced by our would-be 

leaders and the media. 

<p>Remember that everything happens for a reason. Yet even so, you are not relieved 

of your duty to do what can be done to alleviate the pain and agony of others. 

And you have a responsibility to deal with your own distress. For while you cannot 

control what life sends your way, you have complete control over how you will 

respond to it. You can create suffering for yourself by sitting around wishing 

things were other than they are; or you can do all that you can do and feel the 

satisfaction of the results that you produce. 

<p>Imagine now that you have no concept of childbirth. Then imagine that you have 

walked into a room in which a mother is in the midst of labor - with all the attendant 

wailing, straining and gnashing of teeth. What would you think? What would your 

first reaction be? Today we are participating in the birth of a new cultural paradigm. 

Our world is in labor. And being a part of this chaotic and confusing process 

can sometimes be scary, sometimes awe-inspiring. But have no doubt that an irreversible 

trend is at hand - a movement toward greater love and respect for one another, 

for all living things, for the entire earth. And, as always, we have a choice: 

We can go kicking and screaming; or we can acknowledge ourselves for our role 

in this creation and enjoy the ride. </p>
