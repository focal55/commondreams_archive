<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Senator Trent Lott is under fire for suggesting, 

  at a birthday bash for his mentor Strom Thurmond, that America would have been 

  better off had Thurmond's 1948 Dixiecrat campaign for the presidency been victorious. 

  Lott's comments have been met with the typical round of sanctimonious and self-righteous 

  posturing from establishment pundits and hypocritical politicians--Democrat 

  and Republican--expressing dismay at the Senator's insensitivity and shock at 

  how anyone today could find anything appealing about Thurmond's segregationist 

  campaign of 1948.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The sanctimonious posturing got me to thinking: 

  what if Thurmond <i><b>had </b></i>won in 1948? What kinds of policies might 

  have been followed by the federal government since that time? <b>Maybe the following?:</b></font></p>

<ul>

  

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>During the late 1940s and into the mid 1950s</b>, the Federal Government 

    would have ruined scores of lives and reputations in the name of fighting 

    communist infiltration of America's sacred institutions. An &quot;Un-American 

    Activities Committee&quot; would have been formed to try suspected traitors 

    in public. </font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>The FBI's J. Edgar Hoover would have been allowed to ride roughshod over 

    the Constitution</b>, also in the name of fighting communism. In the 1970s 

    it would have been revealed that Hoover's &quot;Counterintelligence Program&quot; 

    (COINTELPRO), designed &quot;to expose, disrupt, misdirect, discredit, or 

    otherwise neutralize&quot; those the Bureau considered &quot;enemies of the 

    State,&quot; frequently targeted innocent citizens whose only crime was to 

    demand the right to vote or to have a seat at a lunch counter.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, Jr., and Robert Kennedy</b> all would 

    have been assassinated at the high point of the Civil Rights Movement. </font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>By 2001 Human Rights Groups would report</b> that 111 nations have abolished 

    the death penalty completely in law or in practice. Yet in that same same 

    year Amnesty International would report that 90 per cent of all known executions 

    took place in China, Iran, Saudi Arabia <b>and the USA</b>. </font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>In 1968 the Kerner Commission</b>, put in place by President Johnson 

    after the violent 1967 summer of race riots, would conclude that America had 

    become two nations, one White and one Black, separate and unequal. In 1998 

    the Kerner Commission would reconvene and conclude that the problems found 

    in 1968 had in many ways become worse. </font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>The Vietnam War</b> would be fought disproportionately by children of 

    the lower middle class and poor. </font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>The Tuskegee Syphilis Experiments</b>, started in 1932 and involving 

    the federal government's intentional use of black men as guinea pigs, would 

    continue on until 1972. The government would not apologize for the experiments 

    until 1997. In 1993 it would be revealed that during the Cold War government 

    sanctioned experimenters had fed &quot;radioactive oatmeal&quot; to mentally 

    retarded children in Massachusetts and commited a host of other atrocities. 

  </font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>The government would have spent trillions of dollars</b> building the 

    National Security State from 1948-1990, at the same time lamenting the growth 

    of &quot;entitlement&quot; spending for the population at large.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>As a result of federal laws</b>, union organizing would have been made 

    more difficult. By 2003 only about 15% of the private sector workforce would 

    be unionized.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Aid to Familes With Dependent Children</b> (AFDC), the New Deal commitment 

    to the poor, would have been repealed. </font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>In the name of smaller government</b>, a &quot;deregulation&quot; era 

    would have begun and culminate in taxpayers bailing out the Savings and Loan 

    Industry. Gradual weakening of supposed corporate watchdogs like the Securities 

    and Exchange Commission would have led to a situation in which Enron, WorldComm, 

    and others could cavalierly cook their books for years while the Congress 

    in a bipartisan way took their cash and looked the other way as pensions were 

    squandered and CEOs gave themselves golden parachutes. </font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>By the late 1990s it would be revealed</b> that the U.S. incarcerated 

    a greater proportion of its population than any countries except Russia and 

    Rwanda. By the year 2002 we'd have almost 2 million people in prison or jail, 

    reflecting an incareration rate of about 650 per 100,000 residents, double 

    the rate of 10 years before. Human rights organizations would show that approximately 

    one in every 117 males in the United States was in prison. </font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>The federal government's suggestion</b> as to what to do about contuing 

    racism in America would be to have a &quot;dialogue&quot; on it.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>By the year 2000</b>, the percentage of black elected officials among 

    all elected officials would be only 1.7 percent.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>College campuses like the University of Wisconsin at Oshkosh</b> would 

    have had more African American students in 1968 (114 enrolled) than they do 

    in 2002 (99 enrolled). </font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Much of America by 2003 would remain stubbornly resistant to racial integration</b>. 

    In 2001 the Lewis Mumford Center for Comparative Urban and Regional Research 

    at the State University of New York in Albany would analyze the 2000 census 

    and conclude that &quot;the average white person in metropolitan America lives 

    in a neighborhood that is 80% white and only 7% black.&quot; A &quot;typical 

    black individual,&quot; they would find, &quot;lives in a neighborhood that 

    is only 33% white and as much as 51% black. Residential segregation remains 

    high in cities and suburbs around the country.&quot; </font></li>

</ul>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So to Trent Lott, sanctimonious pundits, and hypocritical politicians: what 

  exactly is it that Strom Thurmond would have done in 1948 that did not actually 

  happen in America since then? The evidence presented above suggests to me that 

  we have surely had a Thurmondification of politics since 1948. Yes, we have 

  had a <i><b>Lott </b></i>of that, aided and abetted every step of the way by 

  some of the Senator's most vocal critics.</font></p>
