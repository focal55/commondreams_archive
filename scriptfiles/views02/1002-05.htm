<p><a href="http://www.seiu.org/building/janitors/" target="_new">JUSTICE FOR 

JANITORS</a> marches, with their striking purple colors and diverse languages, 

have become a familiar sight in Chicago, Denver, New York, Los Angeles, and other 

cities. This week it's Boston's turn.

<P>As leaders of Local 254 of the Service Employees International Union point out, Boston has some of the country's priciest downtown office rents. But the people who clean the buildings, paid about $10 an hour, lag far behind their union counterparts in New York, San Francisco, and other cities with high costs of living.</P>







<P>Management has offered a raise, to $12.50 an hour, a nice hike but still low for a metro area with astronomical housing costs. But the union is more concerned that only about 1,900 of Boston's 10,000 unionized janitors have full-time jobs and health benefits. What the union wants most is a joint labor-management strategy to convert bad part-time jobs to good full-time ones over time.</P>







<P>Under the present contract, full-time union janitors get health benefits but not their families. Part-time workers - more than 80 percent - get no health benefits. Many get only four hours' work a night, yielding a weekly paycheck of less than $200. A gap in labor costs between full-timers and part-timers gives management a big incentive to keep shifting to a part-time work force.</P>







<P>The Boston strike is part of a much bigger story. More Americans are becoming temps and part-timers. Against that background, the SEIU's national Justice for Janitors movement is one of the most dynamic union drives since the industrial sit-down strikes of the 1930s.</P>







<P>Like their union ancestors in the needle trades or the auto plants, janitors are not easy to unionize. They speak many different languages, often come from groups desperate for work, and are easy for management to play off against each other. Historically, cheaper nonunion janitors threatened to swamp islands of unionization.</P>







<P>John Sweeney, national president of the AFL-CIO, comes out of the SEIU. In fact, he was head of a building service local in New York.  Sweeney won the presidency of the AFL-CIO in 1995, pledging to emphasize organizing, and Justice for Janitors is his creation. Sweeney's successor at the SEIU, Andrew Stern, has put more than a third of his union's resources into organizing.</P>







<P>The national Justice for Janitors campaign was a dramatic break with the ''business unionism'' of the dwindling labor movement in the 1970s and 1980s. Created in 1985, the campaign made common cause with community organizations and restored marches, songs, and solidarity. Sweeney and Stern also realized that the consolidation of real estate holdings and janitorial service companies invited union jujitsu: If union solidarity held, the new concentration of ownership allowed the union to create major inconvenience for a lot of downtown all at once. And if other unions respected the picket lines, you could apply more pressure. The SEIU quickly settled one janitors' strike in New York during the dead of winter when the union that maintained heating systems agreed to honor SEIU picket lines.</P>







<P>In the same way that the new industrial unions of the 1930s got all the workers at a given factory into one powerful union, the SEIU has sought to organize the entire janitorial force of whole downtowns. This strategy has produced union victory after victory. In Los Angeles in 2000, the janitors' local, 98 percent immigrant, won an unprecedented 26 percent wage increase.</P>







<P>In Boston, the union began by targeting one of the biggest cleaning contractors, Unicco Service Co., based in Newton. Unicco serves many of Boston's landmark office towers. Late Monday night, pickets appeared around 17 major buildings.</P>







<P>It also just happens that the Menino administration is in the final stages of pitching Boston as the site of the Democratic National Convention. Democrats like union towns, but they also like well-behaved ones. It's hardly lost on the union that the mayor needs a settlement, and soon.</P>







<P>The larger issue here is the vulnerability of working Americans. Many Americans think of the labor movement as a relic of the 1930s. But the more industry shifts to part-time and temp workers, management cuts health benefits, and immigrants are played off against each other and against citizens, the more the conditions that spawned the labor movement of the 1930s are repeated in this new century.</P>







<P>For now, management isn't budging on the good jobs issue. So as you clean up your own office this week, appreciate why janitors need a living wage and why America needs unions.</P>
