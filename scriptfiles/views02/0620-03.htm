<p>All indications suggest that President Bush's anticipated peace plan for Palestinians 

and Israelis will only deepen the confusion regarding U.S. policy. Conflicting 

and contradictory statements from senior officials have left people throughout 

the region, and many in the United States, at a loss in trying to make out what 

the administration plans to do. 

<p>Now Bush is expected to recommend the creation of an "interim" Palestinian 

state as the key element in ending 20 months of carnage. 

<p>Apparently he will propose taking the status quo of nominal Palestinian rule 

in 40% of the West Bank and renaming it a state, although it would not have the 

rights and responsibilities of an actual state. This idea is not simply a nonstarter, 

it is nonsense. 

<p>Interim independence and partial sovereignty make as much sense politically 

as a woman being somewhat pregnant. Independence and sovereignty are either fully 

realized or meaningless. 

<p>Much the same may be said about the president's repeated calls for the Palestinian 

Authority to become democratic. While Palestinian reforms are clearly needed, 

it is absurd to speak of creating a democracy among noncitizens of a nonstate 

under a foreign military occupation and without meaningful sovereignty. 

<p>What is available under such conditions is, at best, the democracy of a high 

school student council, not that of a free people in a sovereign republic. Americans 

are heirs to a grand tradition of insight about the basic requirements of liberty 

and independent self-government--concepts that are casually betrayed by the facile 

blather about democracy without citizenship. 

<p>Meanwhile, Israeli and Palestinian extremists are busy ensuring that the conflict 

deteriorates to the point where no plan will stop the killing. 

<p>The intensity, viciousness and frequency of Palestinian suicide attacks against 

Israeli civilians have only increased as a result of Israel's recent rampages 

and the sacking of many West Bank cities. Israel's plan, announced Wednesday, 

to reoccupy Palestinian-ruled areas is not a change of policy; it's a continuation 

of Israeli behavior over the last five months. More of the same will meet with 

just as little success. 

<p>And Israel's new "security fence" is another chimera offered up by Israeli 

Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, who continues to feed his people the illusion that 

the Palestinian uprising can be crushed and the occupation then continued in peace 

and security. 

<p>According to numerous reports, Sharon told a closed meeting of the U.S. Senate 

Foreign Relations Committee last week that there would be no peace deal for at 

least 10 years; that Israel was prepared for a 100-year struggle; that a Palestinian 

state was out of the question any time soon; and that the key to Israel's security 

was 1 million new Jewish immigrants. 

<p>The irony is that, in spite of the ascendancy of radicals on both sides, there 

is much for a genuinely committed White House to work with. 

<p>The Palestinians still have a secular leadership that is committed to establishing 

an independent state alongside Israel and that is not, as many falsely claim, 

dedicated to its destruction. A recent working paper presented to the Bush administration 

by senior Palestinian officials reiterates several far-reaching concessions made 

in the 2001 Taba talks regarding borders, Jerusalem, demilitarization and refugees. 

<p>The majority of Israelis are still in favor of a two-state solution, and serious 

progress would surely revive the dormant Israeli peace movement. 

<p>The plan forwarded by Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah and adopted by the Arab League 

provides an excellent basis for multi-party talks designed to create a permanent 

peace based on total Arab recognition of Israel, provided the occupation ends. 

<p>Most important, the Bush administration can proceed on the basis of its own 

stated positions--including support for an independent Palestinian state--which, 

if translated into proactive policies, would constitute a decisive intervention 

on behalf of peace. 

<p>What Bush needs to do is embrace his own vision, base U.S. policy on this vision 

and create a practical plan to bring it quickly into effect. 

<p>Despite the extremists, such a policy would enjoy powerful support from a majority 

of Americans, Israelis and Palestinians, as well as other Arabs. 

<p>It would offer the only real chance in the foreseeable future to end the Palestinian-Israeli 

conflict. </p>
