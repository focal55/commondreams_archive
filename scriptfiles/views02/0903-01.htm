<p> In the dreams of Dick Cheney, to which I am not privy, I imagine there are 

boldly contrasting scenes of victory and despair.

<p>In one fantasy, he leads a victorious U.S. Army to a hero's welcome through 

the crowded streets of Baghdad, cheered wildly for having been the most outspoken 

proponent of war against Saddam Hussein.

<p>In his nightmares, meanwhile, he is led off in handcuffs, accused of crimes 

committed while CEO of Halliburton, securing that company's place in the ever-growing 

pantheon of post-boom corporate fraudsters.

<p> Peace, particularly the functioning of the economic order, has turned out 

to be far riskier than the waging of war for this administration. A typical American 

POW these days is a captain of industry who played loose with his company's books, 

and both Cheney and his alleged boss ran with that crowd.

<p>Of course, we should probably leave the novelization of a hawkish vice president's 

innermost thoughts to the likes of Tom Clancy. Regardless of Cheney's best-and 

worst-case scenarios, there are myriad other destinations still possible on the 

strange, grim trip we've all taken since that bizarre election night not yet two 

years ago.

<p>For example, the go-it-alone invasion of Old Mesopotamia that Cheney is pushing 

could dangerously backfire in the ways a bunch of Republican elders are predicting: 

Eroding allied support for the campaign against Al Qaeda, further destabilizing 

the Middle East and raising the likelihood that Hussein might launch whatever 

nasty weapons he does have.

<p>Cheney, though, is unmoved by voices of moderation. He even argues that the 

return of U.N. weapons inspectors to Iraq, something the U.S. and our allies have 

been demanding for years, would only strengthen Hussein.

<p>Perhaps the veep is worried that the inspectors might not find the weapons 

of mass destruction that he, almost alone, is convinced are already operational.

<p>As for the CEO-in-handcuffs nightmare, it would be wrong to deny Cheney the 

presumption of innocence in any of the possible violations by Halliburton being 

pursued by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

<p>Still, one can imagine Cheney bolting awake in a cold sweat and moaning, "How 

could I have been so stupid as to make a video effusively thanking Arthur Andersen 

for giving me 'good advice over and above the normal by-the-books audit arrangements'?"

<p>There's just no way that sounds good when the SEC is looking into whether Halliburton 

cooked the books like those of other companies that the disgraced accounting firm 

helped to defraud stockholders. Somehow, we Joe Blows thought corporate accountants 

should keep to "normal by-the-books audit arrangements" when assessing the companies 

we pour our retirement savings into.

<p>Color us naive.

<p>But, as with the Republican war skeptics, here too Cheney is being bitten from 

behind. A conservative organization that successfully hounded Bill Clinton for 

years, Judicial Watch, charged in a lawsuit that "Vice President Cheney broke 

the law" with accounting tricks as Halliburton's CEO.

<p>Cheney also might be wondering whether he wasn't a bit too greedy in grabbing 

an $18-million profit on the sale of his Halliburton shares shortly before the 

stock tanked. Whether it was insider trading or just luck, the timing looks bad; 

no wonder, then, that a CNN poll showed only 11% of Americans believed that the 

vice president was telling the truth about his Halliburton history.

<p>Cheney is not dumb. He assuredly recognizes his future reputation and domicile 

might be riding on a Republican sweep of the November election.

<p>Imagine what a field day a Democrat-controlled Congress would have looking 

into how Cheney was able to cash out with $30 million after sending Halliburton 

down the road to possible bankruptcy, thanks to his lack of "due diligence" on 

a merger deal?

<p>It might also take a close look at a decade of lucrative government contracts 

Halliburton secured while Cheney was in and then out and then back in the White 

House.

<p>Or, how about that whole Enron thing, so many corporate scandals ago?

<p>A Democrat-controlled Congress might be able to finally get answers to what 

exactly Enron's role was in the Cheney-led drafting of the administration's energy 

policy. The VP has managed to keep secret the minutes of meetings between himself 

and Enron officials--including top Bush campaign contributor and then-Enron CEO 

Kenneth Lay. 

<p>Maybe the elusive Cheney has a bunch of good explanations for all of this bad-smelling 

stuff. Until he decides to publicly share them, however, his passion on Iraq will 

remind many of us of the old saying that patriotism is the last refuge of scoundrels. 

For Cheney and his embattled cohorts in the White House, facing a potential second 

recession in their first term, peace is just too risky. Better to go back to sleep 

and dream of war.
