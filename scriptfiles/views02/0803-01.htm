<p>Thomas Hobbes, the 17th-century English political philosopher, felt that the 

lives of human beings were naturally "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short." 

He maintains that, in order to survive this grim reality, humanity engages in 

continual warfare, "every one against every one."</P>

<P>Three hundrred years later, in 1949, George Orwell published his chilling, 

anti-utopian novel, "Nineteen Eighty-Four," in which the brutish ruling party 

of Oceania rules society on the basis of slogans such as "War is Peace." In both 

Hobbes&#39; "Leviathan" and Orwell&#39;s "Nineteen Eighty-Four" the frightening 

image of a never-ending war is evoked.</P>

<P>Enter America&#39;s unelected president, George W. Bush, and his "War on Terrorism." 

This war that Bush presents to the American people is a war that will not be over 

until he says it is. "The prospect of a war without end," writes historian Howard 

Zinn, in a March 2002 issue of The Progressive, is unlike the wars of any previous 

administration. "Indeed," writes Zinn, "presidents have been anxious to assurre 

the nation that the sacrifices demanded would be finite" with an eventual "light 

at the end of the tunnel."</P>

<P>With the macho bluster of an Old West lawman -- telling America that Osama 

bin Laden is "Wanted Dead or Alive" -- Bush says his administration will show 

no mercy toward anybody who harbors terrorists or plans to develop weapons of 

mass destruction. </P>

<P>Never mind that presidential brother Jeb Bush is governor of Florida, which 

has long harbored anti-Castro terrorists who&#39;ve hijacked aircraft and boats 

without being charged with any crime. Or perhaps the president might explain why 

one of Pol Pot&#39;s chief terrorists now lives confortably in Mount Vernon, N.Y.</P>

<P>Indeed, George Bush&#39;s "War on Terrorism" is in many ways a reincarnation 

of America&#39;s "red scare" of the 1950s. It too was used to justify the growth 

of a war economy, suspension of democratic rights and the silencing of dissent. 

</P>

<P>The U.S.A. Patriot Act defines a "domestic terrorist" as anyone who "violates 

the law and is engaged in actions that appear to be intended to influence the 

government by intimidation or coercion." Such a broad definition might have been 

used against the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., who in fact used civil disobedience 

to fight segregation and racism.</P>

<P>By keeping the specific elements of his "War on Terrorism" as vague as possible, 

Bush hopes to make use of it whenever it might be expedient for maintaining his 

power.</P>

<P>Also, by continuously waving the flag of Sept. 11, Bush hopes that Americans 

will forget the shadowy means by which he become president in the first place. 

Under the facade of being a hero in times of peril, Bush can take a light hand 

with polluters and corporate wrongdoers like Enron while taking a heavy hand to 

all dissenters and anti-globalization radicals.</P>

<P>As Zinn says at the end of his Progressive article, "Our most deadly enemies 

are not in caves and compounds abroad, but in the corporate boardrooms and governmental 

offices where decisions are made that consign millions to death and misery -- 

not deliberately but as the collateral damage of the lust for profits and power."</P>

<P>It is the responsibility of all of us to move out of the Orwellian shadow that 

Bush has cast upon the country with his talk of "War on Terror" and "Axis of Evil," 

and begin to question the political legitimacy of the president and stand up for 

our First Amendment rights to dissent and question. The painful memory of Sept. 

11 must leave us not quivering with fear and manipulated by jingoistic jargon, 

but motivated by a renewed commitment to democratic rights. </P>
