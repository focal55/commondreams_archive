<p>"On Rosh Hashana all is written and revealed, and on Yom Kippur the course 

of every life is sealed.....How many pass on and how many thrive, who shall live 

and who shall die.....Repentence, prayer and acts of justice can avert an 'evil 

decree'." The question is "How can acts of justice avert this 'evil decree'?" 

</p>

<p>I have been pondering this question in light of our post 911 world and mindset. 

A mindset that demoralizes me, offends me and quite frankly terrifies me more 

than any single act of terrorism. I see a world that appears to be spinning out 

of control at an alarming rate of acceleration. A world, that from my vantage 

point, is headed on a collision course with its own irrational fears and resulting 

hatreds and violence. I do not believe in "evil decrees", nor do I believe that 

the future is ever written in stone. However I do know that when certain patterns 

of behavior continue, unexamined and unchanged, they do indeed lead to some very 

predictable consequences. The handwriting is quite clearly, "on the wall". This 

year the High Holy Days hold a particularly profound and auspicious significance 

for all of us both personally and globally. There really is no difference. We 

are all in this together. And I am wondering how "acts of justice" can change 

the sweeping tide of current events and change the course of our collective future...</p>

<p>When I think of the word "justice" a mental image appears. I see an ancient 

Greek goddess holding high the scales of balance in her hand. And I am reminded 

that balance is the essential nature of peace. Therefore, it seems to me that 

any act of justice should inevitably lead to peace. So, in light of this time 

of new beginnings; this time of creating the world anew, I would ask us all to 

seriously consider the following questions... Will acts of destructive retaliation 

lead to peace? Will negation of the humanity of those whom we fear lead to peace? 

Will the destruction of homes and villages lead to peace? Will demonizing "the 

other" lead to peace? Will denying people their dignity and civil liberties lead 

to peace? Will constant threats of violence lead to peace? Will the constant repetition 

of hollow platitudes lead to peace? Will oppression lead to peace? Does the dictum 

"an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth" express the sort of justice that leads 

to peace in the twenty first century? Do two wrongs ever make a right?</p>

<p>I believe that on this Rosh Hashana the sound of the shofar blast must be heard 

as an urgent wake up call. A call for us to challenge ourselves to become spiritual 

grown ups. To behave as though there really is a Creative Source of our Being 

and our world. And as reflections of this Source we really do have the capacity 

to act responsibly. We can use our minds and hearts creatively to reconsider and 

reenvision what justice truly means; in far greater and much deeper ways than 

we have ever done before. The conclusion I have come to is this... If it does 

not reflect our highest values and our deepest compassion, if it does not renew 

our spirit and bring hope to our hearts, if it does not make us proud of our own 

humanity, if it does not create peace, than it is not justice... If this sounds 

naive or overly idealistic in today's world, I invite you to consider the concluding 

words of an official statement that was drafted last year by several of our Nobel 

laureates. "We have reached a time in our history when idealism is the only realism". 

Shalom.</p>
