Trust corporate America?  The crash of the Enron Corp. has called this into 

question.



<p>Consider one example in corporate journalism.  An article in the Jan. 28 

Business Week online was headlined: “Can You Trust Anybody Anymore? The 

scope of the Enron debacle undermines the credibility of modern business 

culture.”



<p>This thought worries the ruling elites.  But it conceals more than it 

reveals.  Crucially, such thinking assumes what requires explanation.



<p>I mean the public’s supposed faith in corporations before the “Enron 

debacle.”  When did working Americans believe in corporate rule, with its 

so-called free trade and deregulation driving down their living and working 

conditions?



<p>Recall that the tendency for corporations to make the lives of the American 

public less secure has proceeded legally, well before the Enron meltdown.  

Here’s one example.  U.S.-based corporations have increased their profits 

and expanded market share by using the NAFTA to shift factories from America 

to Mexico.



<p>In Mexico, workers are paid very low wages and union organizers are maimed 

and murdered.  This corporate strategy to boost the bottom line was proposed 

by President Clinton and narrowly approved by Congress.



<p>Circles of power have made political hay by trying to misdirect people’s 

attention away from corporations and Congress to Mexican peasants, some of 

whom have come to California.  They are people who can no longer live off 

their land, having been crushed by NAFTA-friendly agribusiness, which is 

subsidized by American taxpayers.



<p>Such peasants who travel north seek a job.  Not the jobs of American 

workers, but a job.  Under corporate rule of the economy, workers don’t own 

jobs.  Their bosses do.  Keeping this basic fact hard to see is a tremendous 

victory for the corporate class.



<p>On a related note, electricity deregulation in California ruined various 

small firms and brought suffering to many households.  The promise of better 

consumer choice partly from Enron proved to be a cruel hoax.  In California 

and around the world, deregulation of energy has been a disaster for the 

majority and a cash cow for the corporate few and the elected officials they 

buy to do their bidding.



<p>Now as before, the American corporate state needs public opinion on its 

side.  Corporate credibility maintains the status quo in the nation, still a 

free society by many measures.



<p>Such freedom comes at a price, in more ways than one.  Billions of corporate 

dollars are spent annually on U.S. election and public relations campaigns.  

Corporate propaganda is a way to protect corporate power, scholar Alex Carey 

noted in his book “Taking the Risk Out of Democracy: Corporate Propaganda 

Versus Freedom and Liberty.”



<p>People aren’t stupid, though some may be stupefied by corporate PR.  Those 

who aren’t recently protested global capitalism in Manhattan at the World 

Economic Forum.  Likewise, so did the people at the World Social Forum, held 

in Porto Alegre, Brazil.



<p>Elite opinion in America is turning away from the view put forward Jan. 14 

by U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul O’Neill on Enron’s rise and demise.  

Concerning its  collapse, he said on Fox News Sunday: “Companies come and 

go… . That’s the genius of capitalism.”



<p>Well, we can agree or not with O’Neill’s statement.  But what can we do 

about  corporations’ ownership of the political system, and what this means 

for how people live and work here and abroad?



<p>These questions are now on the margins of the debate, where American 

politicians and pundits hope to keep them.  Crucially, their agenda is 

shaped by corporate competition.  Its counterpart flows from social 

cooperation.  Two visions.  One is dominating and breeds dependence.  The 

other is emerging and encourages independence.  Could the stakes be more 

important for the future?
