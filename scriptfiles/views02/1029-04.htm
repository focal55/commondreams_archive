<p>Ghoulish but true: as Minnesota mourns the death of Senator Paul Wellstone, 

many of the state's residents have been receiving fliers bearing a picture of 

a tombstone. The fliers, sent out by a conservative business group, denounce the 

late senator's support for maintaining the estate tax. Under the tombstone, the 

text reads in part: "Paul Wellstone not only wants to tax you and your business 

to death . . . he wants to tax you in the hereafter." </p>

<P> To be fair, the people who mailed out those fliers — which are carefully worded 

so that the cost of the mailing doesn't officially count as a campaign contribution 

— didn't know how tasteless they would now appear. Yet in a sense the mass mailing 

is a fitting epitaph; it reminds us what Paul Wellstone stood for, and how brave 

he was to take that stand.</p>

<P> Sometimes it seems as if Americans have forgotten what courage means. Here's 

a hint: talking tough doesn't make you a hero; you have to take personal risks. 

And I'm not just talking about physical risks — though it's striking how few of 

our biggest flag wavers have ever put themselves in harm's way. What we should 

demand of our representatives in Washington is the willingness to take political 

risks — to make a stand on principle, even if it means taking on powerful interest 

groups. </p>

<P> Paul Wellstone took risks. He was, everyone acknowledges, a politician who 

truly voted his convictions, who supported what he thought was right, not what 

he thought would help him get re-elected. He took risky stands on many issues: 

agree or disagree, you have to admit that his vote against authorization for an 

Iraq war was a singularly brave act. Yet the most consistent theme in his record 

was economic — his courageous support for the interests of ordinary Americans 

against the growing power of our emerging plutocracy.</p>

<P> In our money-dominated politics, that's a dangerous position to take. When 

Mr. Wellstone first ran for the Senate, his opponent outspent him seven to one. 

According to one of his advisers, the success of that ramshackle campaign, run 

from a rickety green school bus, "made politics safe for populists again." </p>

<P> If only. Almost every politician in modern America pretends to be a populist; 

indeed, it's a general rule that the more slavishly a politician supports the 

interests of wealthy individuals and big corporations, the folksier his manner. 

But being a genuine populist, someone who really tries to stand up against what 

Mr. Wellstone called "Robin Hood in reverse" policies, isn't easy: you must face 

the power not just of money, but of sustained and shameless hypocrisy.</p>

<P> And that's why those fliers are a perfect illustration of what Paul Wellstone 

was fighting.</p>

<P> On one side, the inclusion of estate tax repeal in last year's federal tax 

cut is the most striking example to date of how our political system serves the 

interests of the wealthy. After all, the estate tax affects only a small minority 

of families; the bulk of the tax is paid by a tiny elite. In fact, estate tax 

repeal favors the wealthy to such an extent that defenders of last year's tax 

cut — like Senator Charles Grassley, who published a misleading letter in last 

Friday's Times — always carefully omit it from calculations of who benefits. (The 

letter talked only about the income tax; had he included the effects of estate 

tax repeal, he would have been forced to admit that more than 40 percent of the 

benefits of that tax cut go to the wealthiest 1 percent of the population.) To 

eliminate the estate tax in the face of budget deficits means making the rich 

richer even as we slash essential services for the middle class and the poor.</p>

<P> On the other side, the estate tax debate illustrates the pervasive hypocrisy 

of our politics. For repeal of the "death tax" has been cast, incredibly, as a 

populist issue. Thanks to sustained, lavishly financed propaganda — of which that 

anti-Wellstone flier was a classic example — millions of Americans imagine, wrongly, 

that the estate tax mainly affects small businesses and farms, and that its repeal 

will help ordinary people. And who pays for the propaganda? Guess. It's amazing 

what money can buy.</p>

<P> In an age of fake populists, Paul Wellstone was the real thing. Now he's gone. 

Will others have the courage to carry on?</p>
