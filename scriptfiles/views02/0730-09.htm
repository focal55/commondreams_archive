<p> While visiting friends in Aspen last week, I had a close encounter of the 

disgraced CEO kind: I spotted Kenny Lay, garbed in a spiffy jogging suit, getting 

in a little morning cardio not far from one of the two multimillion dollar vacation 

homes he keeps there. I guess that second-hand shop his wife opened to sell off 

some of their booty has been doing brisk business. 

<p>Truth be told, such scoundrel sightings are not as unusual as they should be. 

Despite the well-deserved roasting they're currently getting over the media spit, 

many of the most notorious boardroom bad guys are continuing to live the high-life 

to which they became accustomed while plundering their companies' coffers. 

<p>Even Adelphia's John Rigas, who was forced to do the newly-trendy EPW (Executive 

Perp Walk) following his arrest, had enough spare change on hand to cover his 

$10 million bail -- and was back home in plenty of time for a nice family dinner 

with his indicted sons. You know what they say: the family that eats together, 

cheats together. 

<p>The victims of corporate pillage, meanwhile, are not having it so easy. Faced 

with scrambled nest eggs, sinking pension plans, shaky health coverage and a gloomy 

job market, record numbers of average Americans are taking it on the chin -- and 

in the wallet. 

<p>A key indicator of just how bad things have gotten for the little guy is the 

record number of Americans -- 1.5 million -- who filed for personal bankruptcy 

in the year ending March 31st. That's one out of every 69 U.S. households. 

<p>And since bankruptcies invariably lag behind current economic conditions -- 

they are the fiscal equivalent of those guys in the circus who follow after the 

elephants with a shovel, trying to deal with the mess the parade has left behind 

-- the odds are high that 2002 will be an even better year for bankruptcy attorneys. 

The first quarter of this year has already seen a record 369,237 filings. 

<p>And it's important to note that only 3% of these filings are by people who 

abuse the system by living extravagant lifestyles and then leaving their creditors 

holding the bag. The majority are actually low to middle class people who can't 

pay their bills because they've lost their jobs or been hit with crippling medical 

bills or been enticed into running up unmanageable credit card balances by easy-credit 

come-ons and here-today-gone-tomorrow "teaser" interest rates. 

<p>Nevertheless, Congress is on the verge of passing legislation that will make 

it harder for people to start afresh after they declare bankruptcy while, not 

coincidentally, adding billions of dollars to the bottom line of banks and credit 

card companies. 

<p>And why are our elected representatives so eager to add to the burden of consumers 

struggling to rebuild their lives amidst tough economic times? Perhaps it has 

something to do with the $27.5 million the finance and credit industries have 

contributed to political campaigns since 1990 -- including $3,518,966 so far in 

the 2002 election cycle. 

<p>In addition, credit card giants MBNA, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley were among 

the top-10 donors to President Bush's 2000 campaign. Is it any surprise that the 

president has indicated he will sign the bankruptcy bill as soon as it hits his 

desk? It's the first law of politico-dynamics: You sign a President's checks, 

he'll sign your bill. Anyone can buy public policy, but it's not cheap. If you 

have to ask, you probably can't afford it. 

<p>For an especially sleazy example of how this Beltway quid pro quo works, look 

no further than the case of Rep. Jim Moran, the chief Democratic sponsor of the 

bankruptcy bill. It seems that back in 1998, Moran was about to be buried under 

an avalanche of hefty credit card balances he couldn't pay off. Things looked 

grim for the Congressman -- until he was bailed out by a sweetheart loan orchestrated 

by the generous folks at MBNA. 

<p>In a move as shameless as it is despicable, Moran then turned around and helped 

craft a bill that will make it harder for average consumers who find themselves 

in the same jam he was in. Will MBNA ride to their rescue as well -- or will it 

do everything in its newly fortified power to exact its pound of flesh? 

<p>It is particularly ironic that Congress was wrapping up its billion-dollar 

gift to the banking industry during the same week executives of Citigroup and 

J.P. Morgan Chase were lambasted on Capitol Hill for helping Enron defraud shareholders 

to the tune of $8 billion dollars. Only in Washington could a pair of companies 

be publicly raked over the coals -- exposed as bald-faced liars and criminal accessories 

-- on a Tuesday, and then be blown an all-is-forgiven make-up smooch on Thursday. 

<p>So once again big donors get a kiss on the lips and little guys get a kick 

in the rear, or someplace even more painful. And those trying to dig themselves 

out of a mountain of debt are not likely to be given a boost by a contracting 

job market with 8.4 million people out of work and more people seeking unemployment 

benefits than at any time in nearly 20 years. 

<p>No wonder there is a growing anger among the dispossessed. "Never before have 

I seen the fury and hatred that I'm now seeing on a daily basis," says David Bowman, 

an employment consultant who tries to find work for people who have been downsized. 

"You've got thousands and thousands of hard-working people who, through no fault 

of their own, find themselves broke, out of a job, and with nearly worthless retirement 

plans." 

<p>I realize that life isn't fair. But wouldn't it be nice if it were a little 

more just? If Kenny Lay, instead of jogging around the streets of Aspen in sweats, 

were jogging around a jail yard track in stripes?
