<p>THESE ARE scary times. Al Qaeda terrorists prepare to attack American 

civilians. A desperate and paranoid North Korea builds an arsenal of nuclear 

weapons.

<P>And how does our government respond? The Bush administration declares an 

urgent need to invade Iraq.

<P>Why Iraq? Because Saddam Hussein may have weapons of destruction, which he 

might use against some unspecified enemy some time in the future. Since we 

aren't all that sure, we must wage a pre-emptive war against a nation that, 

just by coincidence, happens to sit on the world's second-largest reserve of 

oil.

<P>Follow that? If not, you're not alone.

<P>The domestic scene is just as surreal. Rank opportunism rules. In the name 

of preventing terrorism, the Bush administration has employed a politics of 

fear to create the most extensive national security apparatus in our nation's 

history.

<P>Military tribunals. Mandatory registration. Mass detentions. Electronic 

surveillance. Government secrecy. Executive privilege. Office of Total 

Awareness. Perpetual war.

<P>Folks, this is the stuff of such dystopian novels as Aldous Huxley's "Brave 

New World" or George Orwell's "1984." As a historian, I hear echoes of voices 

from the past -- survivors of Nazi-occupied nations, dissidents who 

disappeared in Soviet prisons, Japanese Americans ordered to internment camps, 

political activists persecuted under McCarthyism.

<P>No, none of these historical analogies is appropriate -- yet. But we 

civilians have just as much responsibility to protect our liberties as do 

combat soldiers. And right now, we are governed by an administration that 

wields far too much power -- simply because it can.

<P>Fifteen months ago, we discovered that two immense oceans can't protect us 

from attacks on our own soil. Afterward, a traumatized people wanted to trust 

their president. But our leaders have taken advantage of our fear. The Bush 

administration has planted the seeds of a security state that can, without 

judicial oversight, congressional opposition, and popular resistance, grow 

into a repressive government.

<P>I'm hardly alone in fearing our government's excessive usurpation of power. 

Nearly two dozen cities and towns have passed resolutions declaring their 

determination to refuse federal requests that violate citizens' civil rights 

or liberties.

<P>Also worried is the American Civil Liberties Union, which recently launched 

a multimillion-dollar national advertising campaign called "Keep American Safe 

and Free." Television spots feature a close-up of a hand cutting up and 

rewriting the U.S. Constitution. A voice-over charges Attorney General John 

Ashcroft with violating our right to free speech and our guarantee against 

unreasonable searches and seizures.

<P>"The Bush administration," says ACLU national spokeswoman Emily Whitfield, 

"has presented Americans with a false dichotomy that we must choose between 

being safe or free." The ACLU is even asking Americans to write Ashcroft to 

express our defiant willingness to defend American civil rights and liberties.

<P>Hussein, a brutal and bullying dictator, is not the person who most 

directly threatens our democracy. Al Qaeda terrorists and North Korean leaders 

pose a far more dangerous threat to our nation.

<P>Threats to democracy, however, are not always external. They sometimes 

burrow from within. Keep your eye on those members of the Bush administration 

who can't wait to dismantle big government services and regulations but seem 

way too eager to expand the state's power to curtail our civil rights and 

liberties.
