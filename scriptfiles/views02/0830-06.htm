<p>When Rio hosted the first Earth Summit in 1992, there was so much goodwill 

surrounding the event that it was nicknamed, without irony, the Summit to Save 

the World. This week in Johannesburg, at the follow-up conference known as Rio 

+ 10, nobody is claiming that the World Summit on Sustainable Development can 

save the world--the question is whether the summit can even save itself. </p>

<p> The sticking point is what UN bureaucrats call "implementation" and the rest 

of us call "doing something." Much of the blame for the "implementation gap" is 

being placed at the doorstep of the United States. It was George W. Bush who abandoned 

the only significant environmental regulations that came out of the Rio conference, 

the Kyoto Protocol on climate change. It was Bush who decided not to come to Johannesburg 

(even his father showed up in Rio), signaling that the issues being discussed 

here--from basic sanitation to clean energy--are low priorities for his Administration. 

And it is the US delegation that is most belligerently blocking all proposals 

that involve either directly regulating multinational corporations or dedicating 

significant new funds to sustainable development. </p>

<p> But the Bush-bashing is too easy: The summit isn't failing because of anything 

happening now in Johannesburg. It's failing because the entire process was booby-trapped 

from the start. </p>

<p> When Canadian entrepreneur and diplomat Maurice Strong was appointed to chair 

the Rio summit ten years ago, his vision was of a massive gathering that brought 

all the "stakeholders" to the table--not just governments but also nongovernmental 

organizations (environmentalists, indigenous and lobby groups) as well as multinational 

corporations. Strong's vision allowed for more participation from civil society 

than any UN conference before, at the same time as it raised unprecedented amounts 

of corporate funds for the summit (it helped that Coca-Cola donated its marketing 

team and Swatch produced a limited-edition Earth Summit watch). But the sponsorship 

had a price. Corporations came to Rio with clear conditions: They'd embrace ecologically 

sustainable practices but only voluntarily--through nonbinding codes and "best 

practices" partnerships with NGOs and governments. In other words, when the business 

sector came to the table in Rio, direct regulation of business was pushed off. 

</p>

<p> In Johannesburg, these "partnerships" have passed into self-parody, with the 

conference center chock-a-block with displays for BMW "clean cars" and billboards 

for De Beers diamonds announcing Water Is Forever. The summit's main sponsor is 

Eskom, South Africa's soon-to-be-privatized national energy company. According 

to a recent study, under Eskom's restructuring 40,000 households are losing access 

to electricity each month. </p>

<p> And this cuts to the heart of the real debate about the summit. The World 

Business Council for Sustainable Development, a corporate lobby group founded 

in Rio, is insisting that the route to sustainability is the same trickle-down 

formula already being imposed by the World Trade Organization and the International 

Monetary Fund: Poor countries must make themselves hospitable to foreign investment, 

usually by privatizing basic services, from water to electricity to healthcare. 

As in Rio, these corporations are pushing for voluntary "partnerships" rather 

than "command and control" regulations. </p>

<p> But these arguments sound different from a decade ago. Post-Enron, it's difficult 

to believe that companies can be trusted even to keep their own books, let alone 

save the world. And unlike a decade ago, the economic model of laissez-faire development 

is being militantly rejected by popular movements around the world, particularly 

in Latin America but also here in South Africa. </p>

<p> This time around, many of the "stakeholders" aren't at the official table 

but out in the streets or organizing countersummit conferences to plot very different 

routes to development: debt cancellation, an end to the privatization of water 

and electricity, reparations for apartheid abuses, affordable housing, land reform. 

The most ambitious is the Week of the Landless, a parallel event arguing that 

unfulfilled promises to introduce substantive land reform--in South Africa and 

across the postcolonial developing world--have been the single greatest barrier 

to sustainable development globally. </p>

<p> Key to these movements is that they are no longer willing simply to talk about 

their demands--they're acting on them. In the past two years, South Africa has 

experienced a surge in direct action, with groups like the Soweto Electricity 

Crisis Committee, the Landless People's Movement, Durban's Concerned Citizens' 

Forum and the Western Cape Anti-Eviction Campaign organizing to resist evictions, 

to claim unproductive land and to reconnect cut-off water and electricity in the 

townships. </p>

<p> A mass demonstration is planned for August 31, but the fate of the march is 

by no means certain. The South African government appears to have decided that 

if nothing else comes of it, the summit is at least an opportunity "to change 

misconceptions about safety and security in South Africa...[and] attract the attention 

of foreign tourists and investors," in the words of Provincial Police Commissioner 

Perumal Naidoo. </p>

<p> What this means in practice is that while street signs welcome delegates to 

"feel the pulse" of "the Sensational City," Sandton, the ultrarich suburb where 

the conference is being held, has been transformed into a military zone, complete 

with "mega search park" and remote spy planes patrolling the skies. All protests 

are confined to a 1.8-kilometer "struggle pen," as many are calling it, and even 

there, only police-permitted marches are allowed. </p>

<p> Vendors and beggars have been swept from the streets, residents of squatter 

camps have been evicted (many have been relocated to less visible sites, far from 

busy roads). Moss Moya, a township resident facing eviction from his home of eighteen 

years, holds out little hope that the summit will help South Africa's poor. "If 

they are going to help us," he said, "they need to see us." </p>

<p> But when Moya and his neighbors held a rally to resist the attempts to relocate 

them behind a grove of trees, the police cracked down, and Moya, a former ANC 

supporter, was shot in the mouth with a rubber bullet, knocking out six of his 

teeth. When he went to file a complaint with the police, he was thrown in jail. 

</p>

<p> Moya and some 1,000 other township residents decided to take their struggle 

to downtown Johannesburg, holding a peaceful rally outside the offices of the 

Premier of Gauteng, the province in which Johannesburg is located. Right underneath 

a sign that announces, The People of Gauteng Welcome WSSD Delegates to the Smart 

Province, seventy-seven demonstrators were arrested, including the entire leadership 

of the Landless People's Movement. (All but one--a US citizen, still facing deportation--have 

since been released.) </p>

<p> On August 24, police even attacked a candlelight "freedom of expression march," 

held to protest these and other mass arrests. The spontaneously organized march 

was headed to a downtown prison, but before the crowd of 1,000 local and international 

activists had walked a block, riot police surrounded them and barricaded the road. 

Without warning, stun grenades were fired at the marchers, injuring three. </p>

<p> The World Summit on Sustainable Development isn't going to save the world; 

it merely offers an exaggerated mirror of it. In the gourmet restaurants of Sandton, 

delegates are literally dining out on their concern for the poor. Meanwhile, outside 

the gates, poor people are being hidden away, assaulted and imprisoned for what 

has become the iconic act of resistance in an unsustainable world: refusing to 

disappear.</p>
