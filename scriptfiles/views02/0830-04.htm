<p>The question dominating the news: When will we go to war against Iraq?



<p>The answer: We are already at war with Iraq.



<p>The debate over the Bush administration's call for war is usually described 

as hawks v. doves -- those for the war pitted against those opposing war. 

In fact, the debate in mainstream news is hawks v. hawks; the question 

isn't whether or not to wage war, but what form that war should take.



<p>Bush and the ultra-hawks want a full-scale war as soon as feasible, to 

secure control over Iraq and its oil. The hawks at the moderate extreme 

argue for continuing "containment," a euphemism for devastating economic 

sanctions and regular bombing in the so-called "no-fly zones."



<p>Sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, are administered 

through the United Nations but in place only because the United States 

insists; most of the rest of the world has condemned them. The embargo has 

helped cause the deaths of more than 500,000 children under the age of 5, 

according to a UNICEF study. That's why two former U.N. humanitarian 

coordinators in Iraq -- Denis Halliday and Hans von Sponeck -- have 

resigned in protest, calling the sanctions immoral and even genocidal.



<p>Though the sanctions have strengthened Saddam Hussein's control over Iraq 

while punishing ordinary people, the United States insists they remain.



<p>Starting with a complete ban on oil sales and frequent restrictions even on 

basic medicines, the sanctions have gone through stages. Currently, there 

is no limit on total oil sales and most medicines are allowed in, but there 

are still major problems with funding projects to repair critical 

infrastructure and foster economic development.



<p>Combined with the almost complete (and quite deliberate) destruction of 

Iraq's civilian infrastructure, particularly water- and sewage-treatment 

plants, by U.S. forces during the Gulf War, the sanctions have meant 

increased malnutrition, disease and death -- not for Saddam but for the 

Iraqi people.



<p>U.S. official blithely claim that the so-called "smart sanctions" approved 

by the Security Council in July would solve these problems. But instead of 

feeding Iraqis, the changes mostly helped confuse the public -- which, 

according to some U.S. officials, was the original intent of smart sanctions.



<p>Now, as worldwide attention to the effects of sanctions has decreased, the 

humanitarian situation has worsened. Even as cumbersome bureaucratic 

procedures for approving imports were supposedly streamlined, the monetary 

value of "holds" (contracts held up by some nation on the Sanctions 

Committee, almost always the United States) is at $4.7 billion, higher than 

before smart sanctions were proposed. Worse, because of a retroactive 

oil-pricing scheme recently implemented by the United States (oil companies 

don't know what price they'll pay for Iraqi crude until after it is 

loaded), Iraqi oil exports are way down; in August, exports averaged 

800,000 barrels per day, compared with more than 2 million at earlier 

points. This funding shortfall means Iraq is unable to pay even for some 

approved humanitarian imports.



<p>U.S. officials blame all this on Saddam, and certainly the Iraqi government 

has made some questionable allocations of resources. But Tun Myat, the 

current U.N. humanitarian coordinator in Iraq, has described Iraq's food 

distribution as "second to none," echoing evaluations by other UN officials.



<p>While the sanctions kill slowly, the United States continues to patrol the 

no-fly zones in the northern and southern parts of Iraq, bombing at will 

and killing civilians -- at least 27 attacks by U.S. planes in 2002. The 

most recent, on Sunday (Aug. 25), killed eight, according to Iraq.



<p>When challenged, U.S. officials robotically repeat that they bomb only when 

threatened by Iraqi air defenses. However, despite U.S. claims, there is no 

U.N. Security Council authorization for this violation of Iraqi 

sovereignty. U.S. journalists rarely mention the obvious point -- that if 

the United States ceased its illegal patrols, Iraqi radar would not "light 

up" U.S. planes, making U.S. attacks unnecessary.



<p>While not militarily significant, these attacks serve to terrorize the 

Iraqi people and remind everyone that the United States exempts itself from 

international law. Combined with the sanctions, they constitute a war on 

the people of Iraq.



<p>While the fanatical hawks argue with the moderate hawks about the way in 

which a war against Iraq should proceed, virtually all the world opposes a 

full-scale war. It's time for us to realize that most of the rest of the 

world also wants to stop the containment war, end the suffering of the 

Iraqi people and begin the diplomatic process necessary for regional peace.
