<p>PRINCETON, N.J. -- Earlier this year Antonin Scalia decided to share some aspects 

of his worldview with the public. His inspiration seems to have been the death 

penalty: recent debates with his colleagues on the Supreme Court and his general 

reflections on the legitimacy of the state taking to itself the power to kill 

a citizen. Justice Scalia spoke on these matters at the University of Chicago 

Divinity School in January, beginning with the ritual disclaimer that "my views 

on the subject have nothing to do with how I vote in capital cases"; his remarks 

appeared in the May issue of First Things: The Journal of Religion and Public 

Life. They are supplemented by his dissent to the court's decision on June 20 

that mentally retarded people should not be executed. Justice Scalia's remarks 

show bitterness against democracy, strong dislike for the Constitution's approach 

to religion and eager advocacy for the submission of the individual to the state. 

It is a chilling mixture for an American. </p>

<P> Because Mr. Scalia is on the Supreme Court, and because President Bush has 

held him up as an example of judicial greatness, his writings deserve careful 

attention.</p>

<P> Mr. Scalia seems to believe strongly that a person's religious faith is something 

that he or she (as a Roman Catholic like Mr. Scalia) must take whole from church 

doctrine and obey. In his talk in Chicago, Mr. Scalia noted with relief that the 

Catholic Church's recent opinion that the death penalty was very rarely permissible 

was not "binding" on Catholics. If it had been, Mr. Scalia said, this teaching 

would have led the church to "effectively urge the retirement of Catholics from 

public life," given that the federal government and 38 states "believe the death 

penalty is sometimes just."</p>

<P> Mr. Scalia apparently believes that Catholics, at least, would be unable to 

uphold, as citizens, views that contradict church doctrine. This is exactly the 

stereotype of Catholicism as papist mind control that Catholics have struggled 

against throughout the modern era and that John F. Kennedy did so much to overcome. 

But Mr. Scalia sees submission as desirable — and possibly the very definition 

of faith. He quotes St. Paul, "For there is no power but of God: the powers that 

be are ordained of God."</p>

<P> "The Lord," Mr. Scalia explained in Chicago, "repaid — did justice — through 

His minister, the state."</p>

<P> This view, according to Mr. Scalia, once represented the consensus "not just 

of Christian or religious thought, but of secular thought regarding the powers 

of the state." He said, "That consensus has been upset, I think, by the emergence 

of democracy." And now, alarmingly, Mr. Scalia wishes to rally the devout against 

democracy's errors. "The reaction of people of faith to this tendency of democracy 

to obscure the divine authority behind government should not be resignation to 

it, but the resolution to combat it as effectively as possible," he said in Chicago. 

</p>

<P> Mr. Scalia is right about one thing. Modern democracy did upset the divine 

authority of the state. That has usually been considered by Americans to have 

been a step forward. The great 17th-century dissenter Roger Williams declared 

that government derived no authority whatsoever from God, but was "merely human 

and civil." Thomas Jefferson put matters bluntly in 1779: "[O]ur civil rights 

have no dependence on our religious opinions any more than on opinions in physics 

or geometry."</p>

<P> That view prevailed among the framers at Philadelphia in 1787. Throughout 

their debates, even when they prayed for divine guidance, they rejected the idea 

that political authority lay with anyone or anything other than the sovereign 

people. The only extended discussion of religion in the Federalist Papers has 

James Madison listing zeal in religious opinion as one of "the latent causes of 

faction" that cause men "to vex and oppress each other" and that need institutional 

checks.</p>

<P> There have always been Americans who have thought as Justice Scalia does now. 

In 1781 a Massachusetts minister, Jonas Clark, preached that religion is "the 

source of liberty, the soul of government and the life of a people." But ever 

since the Revolution, this has been a minority view, even an eccentric one, among 

Americans. It has had no appreciable place in our constitutional history because 

the framers rejected it.</p>

<P> They had many reasons for doing so, not least the factionalism mentioned by 

Madison. They had an idea that sovereignty rested with a free people, even if 

some among those people didn't believe in God, or in the same God, or in the same 

way.</p>

<P> Such a belief in the worth of people independent of religious considerations 

(whether their own or those of the state) has distinguished secular democracy. 

This seems to irritate Mr. Scalia. It seems to indicate a humanist egotism that 

might lead a person to think individual lives are so valuable that it is not the 

privilege of the state to take them. "Indeed, it seems to me," Mr. Scalia said 

in Chicago, "that the more Christian a country is the less likely it is to regard 

the death penalty as immoral. Abolition has taken its firmest hold in post-Christian 

Europe, and has least support in the churchgoing United States. I attribute that 

to the fact that for the believing Christian, death is no big deal."</p>

<P> This might imply that the death penalty would have little deterrent effect 

for the faithful. It might also imply that devout Christians have fewer moral 

scruples about disregarding the Old Testament's injunction against killing. ("For 

the nonbeliever, on the other hand, to deprive a man of his life is to end his 

existence," Mr. Scalia said sarcastically. "What a horrible act!") But that is 

not quite Mr. Scalia's point. He wants us to know that Catholics and perhaps other 

religiously minded people have the moral sense to hold their own wills as slight 

things compared to those of God and His minister, the state — with the partial 

exception of judges.</p>

<P> In Chicago, Mr. Scalia argued strenuously that in America a judge who morally 

opposed the death penalty ought to resign. "Of course," Mr. Scalia said, "if he 

feels strongly enough he can go beyond mere resignation and lead a political campaign 

to abolish the death penalty — and if that fails, lead a revolution."</p>

<P> But leading a revolution would inevitably bring some interference with the 

application of laws, not to mention all the other atrocities that typically attend 

revolutions. Only a judge could think it better to play Robespierre than to issue 

too ambitious an opinion.</p>

<P> One senses that Mr. Scalia's true priority is to get secular humanists off 

the federal bench. In his dissent to Atkins v. Virginia, the recent decision against 

executing mentally retarded criminals, Mr. Scalia wrote, "Seldom has an opinion 

of this Court rested so obviously upon nothing but the personal views of its members." 

The ones he had in mind were not all the members, just the six who disagreed with 

him. Mr. Scalia dissents vigorously against them for letting their personal notions 

infect the law.</p>

<P> In Chicago Mr. Scalia asserted, not for the first time, that he is a strict 

constructionist, taking the Constitution as it is, not as he might want it to 

be. Yet he wants to give it a religious sense that is directly counter to the 

abundantly expressed wishes of the men who wrote the Constitution. That is not 

properly called strict constructionism; it is opportunism, and it threatens democracy. 

His defense of his private prejudices, even if they may occasionally overlap the 

opinions of others, should not be mislabeled conservatism. Justice Scalia seeks 

to abandon the intent of the Constitution's framers and impose views about government 

and divinity that no previous justice, no matter how conservative, has ever embraced.
