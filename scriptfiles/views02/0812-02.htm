<p>As Senate Foreign Relations Committee witnesses gave their differing opinions on what to do about Iraqi President Saddam Hussein during the recent hearings, most everyone could agree on several points: They're not certain what weapons of mass destruction [WMD] Hussein may have, where they are, or what WMD he may procure in the future, they don't know if Hussein would risk his own annihilation by attacking the United States or our allies, or, if so, when? While the senators and witnesses discussed a possible war with Iraq, I wondered if they'd ever read Graham Greene's, Our Man in Havana?

<p>Greene's story is about an English vacuum cleaner salesman, Jim Wormold, who is haplessly recruited into the British Secret Service. Wormold soon discovers that espionage is more lucrative than selling vacuum cleaners, but he has nothing to report. So he creates an international network of fictitious agents and sends London drawings of a new bomb, which bears an odd resemblance to a vacuum cleaner. Wormold's game turns deadly, however, when bodies start piling up, as competing foreign powers try to obtain the nonexistent weapon.

<p>Greene's indictment of Western intelligence is a fitting analogy here. Because based on the information the Bush administration has presented so far, we lack credible evidence that Hussein had anything to do with 9/11, that he poses an immediate threat to our national security, or that he intends to. We also lack a cohesive war plan, a coalition of allied and regional support, or an exit strategy if and when Hussein is deposed. In addition, war may further destabilize a region already in turmoil, cost thousands of American lives and, based on Gulf War casualty reports, hundreds of thousands of Iraqi lives, drive up deficit spending astronomically, cause extensive damage to Iraq's infrastructure, and alienate many of our friends and create new enemies. Given this set of circumstances, why is President George Bush so fixated on war with Iraq? Would war be worth it? Have we exhausted all the alternatives yet?

<p>Most people would agree that Hussein is a dangerous, ruthless dictator and a criminal. He invaded Iran and Kuwait, he's enslaved and gassed his own people, he's producing chemical and biological weapons, he wants to build nuclear ones, and he defies international laws. As a result, since the Gulf War, the international community has maintained an arms embargo and crippling economic sanctions against Iraq, and Great Britain and the United States have bombed large swaths of Iraq almost weekly. The impoverished and brutalized Iraqi people, and the world, would be well-rid of Hussein.

<p>But is the Bush administration justified in launching a preemptive strike, conceivably in violation of domestic, international and humanitarian laws? Earlier this year Bush released his Nuclear Posture Review, which redefines the use of nuclear arms as acceptable in some conventional warfare scenarios against terrorists and rogue states [i.e., Iraq]. We are currently researching small nuclear weapons, euphemistically termed "mini-nukes" and "bunker-busters," which we may use in a preemptive strike. In her recent book, The New Nuclear Danger, Nobel Peace Prize nominee Dr. Helen Caldicott says, a five-kiloton mini-nuke would have a blast radius of approximately one mile. By comparison, the approximately 13-kiloton bomb we dropped on Hiroshima during World War II had a blast radius of about one-and-a-half miles, killing an estimated 70,000 people and destroying almost nine-tenths of the city. The World Court recently ruled that "the threat or use of nuclear weapons is illegal in almost all conceivable circumstances." Meanwhile, Bush has also dismissed or ignored a number of international treaties and conventions, such as: the Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty, the International Criminal Court, and the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Before we march to war against Iraq, Bush needs congressional approval in order to avoid violating the United States Constitution. But Bush has yet to make a case for war to Congress, the American people, or our allies, as he continues to build-up our military presence in the Middle East [i.e., Qatar and the Arabian Sea]. This fall Bush is scheduled to present to Congress his National Security Strategy, which will detail an unprecedented preemptive-strike doctrine. Even though under international law a country has always had a right to defend itself against attack, therefore rendering a preemptive-strike policy unnecessary.

<p>As the world's only superpower, the Bush administration is setting a dangerous example for other countries to follow. So, for whatever it's worth, I believe Hussein is to some extent besides the point. There's a much larger issue at work here and that's unrestrained American hegemony. Does President Bush have the right to strike at any perceived threat anywhere in the world, possibly using nuclear weapons, whether or not a threat ever materializes? Can the United States arrogate to itself the right to attack any country it chooses without provocation, without fear of punishment or reciprocal damage, and without being answerable to any other country, international body, treaty or law? As Hiroshima's Mayor Tadatoshi Akiba reportedly asked, does the United States–in particular President Bush–have the right to unilaterally "determine the fate of the world"?

<p>Iraq must be very nervous right now, as it tries to second-guess what Bush may do? But if Iraq is nervous, so must Iran and North Korea be. After all, they may be next as Bush pursues his mysterious vacuum weapon and the bodies of innocent people pile up, in a war which may not end in our lifetimes.
