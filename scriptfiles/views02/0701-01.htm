<p>TODAY the world reaches a milestone in the effort to punish perpetrators of 

some of the worst human rights abuses - genocide, war crimes, and crimes against 

humanity. A treaty to establish the first permanent international criminal court 

comes into force today, and the court should be up and running by the middle of 

next year. 

<P>The International Criminal Court, or ICC, is the product of many years of discussions 

among dozens of governments. It will serve as a living monument to the millions 

of victims of killings and torture over the past several decades, from Cambodia 

to Congo, who never obtained justice against the perpetrators of such abuses. 

<P>The ICC will also inherit the legacy of ad hoc international<i> </i>war crimes 

tribunals established after World War II, as well as those more recently established 

for the Balkans and Rwanda. The court will be composed of judges and a prosecutor 

chosen by states that have ratified the 1998 Rome Statute of the ICC and will 

have jurisdiction over the most heinous abuses that result from international 

conflict. </P>

<P>One might expect that the US government would be organizing celebrations for 

today, or at least planning to ensure that the ICC be made part of this year's 

Independence Day activities. After all, the goals of civil rights, due process, 

and basic justice that are imbedded in our Constitution are the central elements 

of the ICC Treaty.</P>

<P>Instead, the Bush administration has renounced the Clinton administration's 

signing of the treaty and has set out to cripple this new institution. Last month, 

US officials brought their offensive against the court to the United Nations, 

where they are seeking a Security Council resolution that would exempt from the 

jurisdiction of the court member-state officials participating in all UN peacekeeping 

operations. The issue has come to a head in Security Council debate on a resolution 

to extend the UN mission in Bosnia.</P>

<P>No matter how the Bosnia issue is resolved, the Security Council - most of 

whose members have signed or ratified the treaty - will resist a broad exemption 

for all UN peacekeeping missions, as such an exemption would conflict with the 

text of the treaty and its principle of accountability. In turn, the Bush administration 

has threatened to bring home US peacekeepers from around the world if it does 

not get its way. </P>

<P>The Bush administration says it is acting to insulate US officials from the 

risk of unfair and politicized prosecutions by the ICC, but US actions are wildly 

out of proportion to any such threat against Americans. </P>

<P>For one thing, the ICC is not permitted to initiate a prosecution against any 

individual if the person's country of nationality is prepared to investigate the 

case. Even if the administration does not believe the ICC will respect that requirement, 

the Treaty permits the Bush administration to negotiate agreements with other 

governments against surrender of US citizens to the ICC.</P>

<P>Rather than an assault on the court, the Bush administration should become 

involved in the development of this institution to ensure that it effectively 

promotes justice.</P>

<P>Senior officials at the State Department do support a less confrontational 

US approach toward the court, but they have been run over by a Defense Department 

juggernaut not only against the ICC, but also against US involvement in peacekeeping 

generally. This is unfortunate for several reasons. </P>

<P>First, if the United States makes good on its threat to pull out of peacekeeping 

missions, we will damage our own security interests. From the Balkans to the Iraq-Kuwait 

border, US soldiers and civilians have played critical roles in keeping the peace 

and ensuring against instability.</P>

<P>Second, at a time when we are depending on the leadership of others in peacekeeping 

in Afghanistan, the Balkans, and East Timor, our disengagement will be an affront 

to allies whose support in the war on terrorism and other issues will be crucial 

in the years ahead.</P>

<P>Finally, the administration's hardline posture will inevitably encourage its 

friends on Capitol Hill to seek to eliminate US financial support for UN peacekeeping, 

making a mockery of US protestations of support for the United Nations at a time 

when the president is asking so much of the institution in Afghanistan and elsewhere.</P>

<P>It is probably far too much to ask Bush to embrace the International Criminal 

Court. But it is certainly reasonable to expect his administration to abandon 

an arrogant and self-defeating campaign against the ICC, which will serve only 

to antagonize valued allies and undermine US leadership around the world.</P>

Clinton administration, is a visiting lecturer of public and international affairs
