It was still dark outside this morning when their voices came across the 

radio. On Tuesday, January 15, 2002, a studio full of programmers who've been 

in exile for a year, returned to the air at Pacifica radio station WBAI in 

New York City.

<p>

"It's so good to hear you all again," callers told returned "Wake Up Call" 

producers Bernard White, Sharan Harper, Janice K. Bryant, Robert Knight and 

Amy Goodman. "It's Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday . . . Happy birthday." 

<p>

The return of White and the others to listener-supported WBAI, comes after 

the Interim National Board of Pacifica Radio voted this weekend to resolve 

many of the issues the network has been struggling with for years. 

<p>

The historic meeting took place this Friday, Saturday and Sunday at the union 

hall of the Hotel Trade Council in New York. More than five hundred concerned 

listeners from around the country piled in to the overheated room. Some had 

been in the very same building a year ago, when a multi-pronged campaign was 

launched to oust board members who seemed to have contempt for the 

progressive principles and grassroots structure on which Pacifica Radio 

stands.

<p>

The network owns noncommercial stations in New York, Washington, Houston, Los 

Angeles and Berkeley. Activism in every location -- and others besides -- has 

taken a variety of forms: civil disobedience, lawsuits, pickets, a funding 

boycott, a public education and media campaign. 

<p>

Now, longtime movement-builder 

Leslie Cagan sits as Interim Chair of the Board. She leads a progressive 

majority. This weekend they voted to appoint a new Interim Executive Director 

of the Pacifica Foundation, to replace the general manager of WBAI, and to 

fire the high-priced law firms the previous board had hired to fight lawsuits. 

The two advisory boards that have been warring for control of Pacifica's 

Houston station, KPFT, were ordered to merge and work together. Finally, to 

uproarious applause, the board voted to reinstate 37 members of the 

staff and management who had been fired, banned and suspended from New York 

station WBAI since December 22, 2000. 

<p>

"What we've seen is a profound people's victory, not just in New York, but 

all over the country," New York Local Advisory member Miguel Maldonado told 

WBAI listeners later. 

<p>

Are these victorious days for Pacifica Radio? Absolutely.  Now onto the 

rebuilding part. 

<p>

Today is Dr. King's birthday.  "The end is reconciliation," said Dr. King. "The end is redemption, the end is the creation of the Beloved Community." And Beloved Community is what Pacifica is all about. The network, started more than fifty years ago by incarcerated war-resister Lew Hill, was founded on the very same idea.  

<p>

King talked about differences, international and inter-personal disputes, resolved by nonviolent, inclusive means. His enemy was supremacist-thinking: the prioritizing of one human life over another. In the Beloved Community King described, adversaries worked together -- but the community was far from conflict-free. 

<p>

Community radio, as Lew Hill perceived it, was a very similar place. In the 

world of commerce, who sells most wins. Who has most power has most 

influence. Pacifica's Lew Hill pioneered a non-corporate, anti-commercial 

model of radio where every participant had an equal share.  Listeners pledge 

to finance the stations. Producers pledge to serve.

<p> 

Since its inception, every station has been hard-put to work that equation: listeners don't always like what they hear, producers don't always care. But Hill's vision was of a 

place for the airing of differences, the respectful exchange of views.  "The 

Exacting Ear," was the name of Hill's publication. A healthy society needs 

penetrating minds, he believed, to think and share for the good of all.

<p>

As the fired and the banned return to WBAI's airwaves and the network 

proceeds to heal, it's worth remembering King. Does Beloved Community mean 



abandoning a progressive agenda?

<p>

Lyn Gerry said earlier this year, "The people who founded Pacifica did so 

because they had something to say and nowhere to say it. " That has never 

been as true as it is today. "Pacifica is about something specific," wrote 

Gerry in a letter to concerned listeners. "It was not to be some sort 

of 'neutral' broadcasting entity, nor the tool of a political party." 

<p>

A Beloved Community, where all are equal, is absolutely no neutral affair. Nor is Beloved Community only community for those whom we love.

<p>

King said that the Bible's "Good News was meant for all -- for communist and capitalist, 

for their children and ours, for black and for white, for revolutionary and 

conservative." This inclusiveness is embodied in the Pacifica dream, but sometimes programming has depended too heavily on a familiar few. 

<p>Washington D.C. Local Advisory Board Member Sam Husseini has said that at times Pacifica's airwaves have become what he calls  "wildlife preserves" for those with marginalized views. 

<p>

After years of focusing on issues of personnel and policy, it's time for 

Pacifica to refocus on programming. What's on Pacifica's airwaves needs to win hearts 

and minds as well as comfort them. Can it do it? Sure. With the unique programming it has produced for years --  including Goodman's Democracy Now! which returned this month from exile -- and lots of time for 

questions and listening. There needs to be welcome room for everyone, especially those 

with doubts. 

<p>

At last weekend's meeting, WPFW Producer Fahima Seck made a rousing appeal: 

"The country is at war and if we ever needed free speech and democracy it's 

now. We are under siege. The information is crucial. We need to put aside our 

differences. These are the best and worst of times." 

<p>

Board Chair Leslie Cagan says that Pacifica faces debts of more than 

$3 million, incurred predominantly by the national office in the last couple 

of years. "We've taken a huge step toward returning control of the stations 

back to the communities they are in," Cagan said on WBAI shortly after the 

board meeting, but there are daunting practicalities facing the new regime.

<p>

As for programming -- "We're going to be moving forward with vision," said 

Dan Coughlin, interim executive director. "It's going to be a people's radio 

network once more." 

<p>

What does that mean exactly? We may not know the details, but we know in broad strokes, and we know we need it: A struggling, difficult, 

justice-loving, beloved community of the air.
