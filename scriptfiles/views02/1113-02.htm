<p>GEORGE W. BUSH has just had the best week of his presidency. Not only did the Republicans take back the Senate and pick up seats in the House. As a statesman Bush wins in two seemingly incompatible ways: He gets credit both for being tough with Saddam Hussein <i> and </i>for working through the United Nations. Not bad.

<P>



   Political moderates in the United States, Europe, and the Middle East who agreed that Saddam is an outlaw but who pressed Bush to use multilateralism and UN inspections are now almost as cornered as the Iraqi dictator. It's heads I win, tails you lose. If by some miracle Saddam genuinely cooperates with the UN, Bush emerges both tough and statesmanlike. If Saddam refuses or is proven a liar, the world community, however uneasily, will be compelled to support Bush's war.

<P>



   It would be giving Bush too much credit to suggest that this was his plan all along. Two months ago Vice President Cheney was sneering at UN inspectors and Defense Secretary Rumsfeld and his ultrahawks at the Pentagon were declaring that the United States would go it alone. It's actually to the immense credit of Bush's critics at home and in Europe as well as Secretary of State Colin Powell that Bush was compelled to work through UN and to accept an inspection ultimatum instead of an early war. But that goes politically unnoticed.

<P>



   Even though the compromise resolution is a victory for the French and other nations who insisted that inspections be tried first, Bush, in drastically giving ground, looks strong rather than weak. In a stroke he is bringing to heel Saddam, the UN, and the very critics who forced him to moderate his policy.

<P>



   Iraq, of course, has been a menace as a source of weapons of mass destruction from the day Bush took office. And Iraq has been in precisely the same ''material breach'' of the inspection deal that ended the Gulf War that has obtained since 1998 when the inspectors left, saying they had been prevented from doing their jobs. 

<P>



   Bush discovered Iraq only when it was politically convenient. And even with UN blessing, an Iraq war could prove profoundly destabilizing in the Middle East.

<P>



   The abrupt, trumped-up Iraq crisis, however, cynically and brilliantly served three political purposes, two domestic and one international: First, it carried out a wag-the-dog strategy. Going into a close election, the Iraq crisis split Democrats, took the spotlight off other issues, and rallied voters to support their commander in chief.

<P>



   Second, the sudden emergence of the Iraq threat served to divert attention from Bush's less than stellar leadership on the more serious challenges of terrorist attack and civil defense (the press should stop using the Orwellian phrase ''homeland security,'' which sounds more like Goebbels than Jefferson).

<P>



   Third, the Iraq caper carries out the global policy of Bush's most right-wing advisers, such as Pentagon aides Paul Wolfowitz and Richard Perle, who hold that the United States should not just be a global leader but entirely in charge of remaking the world.

<P>



   Given all of this, what is the opposition to do?

<P>



   For starters, give Bush credit for recognizing that people like leadership. Bush received half a million fewer votes than Al Gore, but he acted as if he had a mandate. Rather than repair to the cautious center, Clinton-style, in the hope of ingratiating himself with Democrats, Bush played hardball from day one.

<P>



   Second, Bush is crystal clear about his goals, domestically and globally. When his views are not popular - privatize Social Security, put the drug industry in charge of drug benefits, give free rein to self-serving CEOs - he is clever at disguising them. But he absolutely knows what he believes.

<P>



   But the man is not 10 feet tall. His policies, foreign and domestic, are vulnerable both politically and substantively. Most of his domestic program, when understood, is not popular. His foreign policy is dangerous. But effective rebuttal will take leadership and political courage on the part of now-traumatized Democrats.

<P>



   In short, the Democrats need to take a page from Bush's book - not the substance but the political gumption. There are five or six Democrats auditioning for the right to run against George W. Bush in 2004. They might begin by offering a tough, sustained, systematic, and principled critique of what Bush is offering and a clear alternative.

<P>



   The way to challenge this president is not with intermittent, tactical, incremental, and poll-driven pot shots - Al Gore, take notice - but by having both convictions and the courage of them. This is the political lesson of Bush's moment of triumph.
