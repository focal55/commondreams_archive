<p>Tony Blair's "dossier" on Iraq is a shocking document. Reading it can only 

fill a decent human being with shame and outrage. Its pages are final proof &#150; 

if the contents are true &#150; that a massive crime against humanity has been 

committed in Iraq. For if the details of Saddam's building of weapons of mass 

destruction are correct &#150; and I will come to the "ifs" and "buts" and "coulds" 

later &#150; it means that our massive, obstructive, brutal policy of UN sanctions 

has totally failed. In other words, half a million Iraqi children were killed 

by us &#150; for nothing.</p>

<p>Let's go back to 12 May 1996. Madeleine Albright, the US Secretary of State, 

had told us that sanctions worked and prevented Saddam from rebuilding weapons 

of mass destruction (WMD). Our Tory government agreed, and Tony Blair faithfully 

toed the line. But on 12 May, Mrs Albright appeared on CBS television. Leslie 

Stahl, the interviewer, asked: "We have heard that half a million children have 

died. I mean, that's more than died in Hiroshima. And, you know, is the price 

worth it?" To the world's astonishment, Mrs Albright replied: "I think this is 

a very hard choice, but the price, we think the price is worth it."</p>

<p>Now we know &#150; if Mr Blair is telling us the truth &#150; that the price 

was not worth it. The price was paid in the lives of hundreds of thousands of 

children. But it wasn't worth a dime. The Blair "dossier" tells us that, despite 

sanctions, Saddam was able to go on building weapons of mass destruction. All 

that nonsense about dual-use technology, the ban on children's pencils &#150; 

because lead could have a military use &#150; and our refusal to allow Iraq to 

import equipment to restore the water-treatment plants that we bombed in the Gulf 

War, was a sham.</p>

<p>This terrible conclusion is the only moral one to be drawn from the 16 pages 

that supposedly detail the chemical, biological and nuclear horrors that the Beast 

of Baghdad has in store for us. It's difficult, reading the full report, to know 

whether to laugh or cry. The degree of deceit and duplicity in its production 

speaks of the trickery that informs the Blair government and its treatment of 

MPs.</p>

<p>There are a few tidbits that ring true. The new ammonium perchlorate plant 

illegally supplied by an Indian company &#150; which breached those wonderful 

UN sanctions, of course &#150; is a frightening little detail. So is the new rocket 

test stand at the al-Rafah plant. But this material is so swamped in trickery 

and knavery that its inclusion becomes worthless.</p>

<p>Here is one example of the dishonesty of this "dossier". On page 45, we are 

told &#150; in a long chapter about Saddam's human rights abuses &#150; that "on 

March 1st, 1991, in the wake of the Gulf War, riots (sic) broke out in the southern 

city of Basra, spreading quickly to other cities in Shia-dominated southern Iraq. 

The regime responded by killing thousands". What's wrong with this paragraph is 

the lie is in the use of the word "riots". These were not riots. They were part 

of a mass rebellion specifically called for by President Bush Jr's father and 

by a CIA radio station in Saudi Arabia. The Shia Muslims of Iraq obeyed Mr Bush 

Sr's appeal. And were then left to their fate by the Americans and British, who 

they had been given every reason to believe would come to their help. No wonder 

they died in their thousands. But that's not what the Blair "dossier" tells us.</p>

<p>And anyone reading the weasel words of doubt that are insinuated throughout 

this text can only have profound concern about the basis for which Britain is 

to go to war. The Iraqi weapon program"is almost certainly" seeking to enrich 

uranium. It "appears" that Iraq is attempting to acquire a magnet production line. 

There is evidence that Iraq has tried to acquire specialized aluminum tubes (used 

in the enrichment of uranium) but "there is no definitive intelligence" that it 

is destined for a nuclear program"If" Iraq obtained fissile material, Iraq could 

produce nuclear weapons in one or two years. It is "difficult to judge" whether 

al-Hussein missiles could be available for use. Efforts to regenerate the Iraqi 

missile program"probably" began in 1995. And so the "dossier" goes on.</p>

<p>Now maybe Saddam has restarted his WMD program Let's all say it out loud, 20 

times: Saddam is a brutal, wicked tyrant. But are "almost certainly", "appears", 

"probably" and "if" really the rallying call to send our grenadiers off to the 

deserts of Kut-al-Amara?</p>

<p>There is high praise for UN weapons inspectors. And there is more trickery 

in the relevant chapter. It quotes Dr Hans Blix, the executive chairman of the 

UN inspection commission, as saying that in the absence of (post-1998) inspections, 

it is impossible to verify Iraqi disarmament compliance. But on 18 August this 

year, the very same Dr Blix told Associated Press that he couldn't say with certainty 

that Baghdad possessed WMDs. This quotation is excised from the Blair "dossier", 

of course.</p>

<p>So there it is. If these pages of trickery are based on "probably" and "if", 

we have no business going to war. If they are all true, we murdered half a million 

Iraqi children. How's that for a war crime?</p>
