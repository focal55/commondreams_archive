            Poor Tom Daschle.

            <p>He can't call for a repeal of the Bush tax cut because so many 

              top senators in his party voted for it.

            <p>He can't call for any major initiatives without repealing the tax 

              cut (and for fear of being tagged a big spender). The result is 

              that everyone is mad at him. Conservative Democrats like Zell Miller 

              and John Breaux think he's a political moron. Liberal Democrats 

              like Paul Wellstone think he's a substantive traitor.

            <p>They're right about one thing: His agenda is incoherent. But in 

              that respect, poor Tom is only a faithful reflection of the Democratic 

              Party itself.

            <p>Now, incoherence isn't necessarily a defect in political life, 

              if it can be marketed effectively to gain the power to shape events 

              on your terms. Ronald Reagan's agenda--boost defense, slash taxes 

              and balance the budget--was masterfully incoherent, and he never 

              paid a political price for the massive deficits it bequeathed. As 

              a result, American politics took a long-term turn to the right.

            <p>George W. Bush's agenda--the surplus is big enough to do it all, 

              so let's start with big tax cuts for the wealthiest--turned out 

              to be brilliantly incoherent as well. It's on track to push the 

              U.S. political center of gravity even further to the right, by which 

              I mean shrinking government as a force in equalizing opportunity 

              and mitigating some of the burdens of bad luck.

            <p>Daschle's--and the Democrats'--current problem is that successful 

              incoherence requires bold, inspiring goals (or incompetent opposition, 

              which helps explain Bush's domestic successes). Timid incoherence 

              is simply a sign of confusion.

            <p>That's the lesson of the great Republican irrationalists: If you're 

              going to be incoherent, shoot for the moon. Put those huge gaps 

              in logic and math in the service of "ending the evil empire," not 

              toward pushing puny goals like a "patients' bill of rights." Who'll 

              storm the barricades for that?

            <p>Yet Democrats can't think big. Take health care. Every day brings 

              fresh news of rising costs and shrinking coverage. The ranks of 

              the 40 million uninsured seem sure to soar.

            <p>It's a disgrace. It's a major problem. It should be a political 

              opportunity.

            <p>So what do Democrats, in their wisdom, focus on? Health coverage 

              for the recently unemployed, as part of the faux debate over a "stimulus" 

              bill.

            <p>Why is this the limit of Democratic ambition? You can't distinguish 

              this goal from what Bush himself says he wants to do.

            <p>Democratic strategy today is a game of inches. Inches don't inspire.

            <p>This game of inches can't change the landscape, and it can't begin 

              to address the larger challenges (in health care, urban schooling 

              and more) that matter--issues that Democrats remain the supposed 

              voice for in our system. For those who care about substance over 

              symbols, the key question of the decade may be this: Can Democrats 

              develop a political strategy that would include solving our biggest 

              problems?

            <p>The outlook is discouraging. And meanwhile, the clock is ticking. 

              Every day the baby boomers get closer to their rocking chairs. The 

              surge in health and pension costs after 2010 will drain away the 

              cash and political energy to do anything but cope with their retirement.

            <p>If you're a conservative, that's fine by you. If you think there's 

              an unfinished agenda for the nation that needs to be funded, this 

              is a calamity.

            <p>Republicans are happy to run out the clock. For Senate Majority 

              Leader Daschle and the Democrats, the fog is so thick you can't 

              even see the myopia.
