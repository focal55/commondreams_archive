<p>Over the last year I've made a couple of firm predictions. The first was that 

sooner or later George Bush would launch a war to topple Saddam Hussein; the second 

was that the American people would regain their sense of balance in the aftermath 

of the 11 September bombings &#150; i.e. the country of the middle ground would 

reassert itself. The question now is whether the latter development &#150; for 

it has come to pass &#150; will cancel out the possibility of the first. Will 

the return to the center ground of the majority of American public opinion make 

it impossible for George Bush to rally domestic support for his plans to oust 

Saddam?</p>

<p>A headline in yesterday's <i>Washington Post</i> spoke the truth when it declared: 

"Bush Faces Daunting Task in Building Public Support." It did not say "impossible 

task", but merely pointed to the danger of attacking Saddam when only 37 per cent 

of poll respondents believe Bush has clearly explained his rationale for a war 

with Iraq. If you are about to commit vast numbers of troops with a risk of mass 

casualties and the wholesale destabilization of the Middle East, then the least 

people deserve is an explanation.</p>

<p>Thus has the doctrine of pre-emptive action, so passionately urged by the locker-room 

tendency on the right, come unstuck. The likes of Richard Perle and Paul Wolfowitz 

have been shown to be fearfully out of touch with public sentiment. Not so the 

worried congressmen and senators who have been besieged with letters, e-mails 

and calls from constituents. Across America there is an audible shout of "wait 

a minute". Set aside the so-called Vietnam syndrome, foreign wars have never been 

intrinsically popular in the US.</p>

<p>Over the last decade the real crisis in international affairs has not been 

domineering Yankee power but the struggle to make America engage with the rest 

of the world. In Bill Clinton we saw an instinctively internationalist president 

who needed to be continually wary of any public perception that he was too busy 

with "abroad". There is big irony here; it was the Republican right in particular 

that encouraged isolationist drift but that now finds itself unable, for the time, 

to convince Americans that it should send their children to fight in the Middle 

East.</p>

<p>Messrs Perle and Wolfowitz would argue that this time it is very different. 

This is no Bosnia or Rwanda or Somalia, no appeal to humanitarian instincts, but 

a situation in which the national interests of the US are directly threatened. 

Why then do a majority of Americans seem unconvinced of the urgency of the situation? 

Part of the truth is that President Bush has made little attempt to make a compelling 

case for war. More specifically he has failed to link 11 September and the horror 

it represented with Saddam Hussein. People want to know just how Iraq threatens 

their home town.</p>

<p>There was an assumption that in the climate of moral outrage that followed 

11 September, Mr Bush's long-standing desire to get rid of Saddam would have wide 

support. Also what appeared to be a relatively uncomplicated victory in Afghanistan 

emboldened the hawks in the White House. The current crisis in "liberated" Afghanistan 

should tell Mr Bush that the line between confidence and hubris can be perilously 

close.</p>

<p>I expect that when Mr Bush does present his evidence it will lay out much that 

we already know. We will be given details of Saddam's chemical and biological 

weapons capacity. There will be evidence, too, of his attempt to re-launch a nuclear 

weapons program, and finally &#150; but critically in terms of public opinion 

&#150; there will be a dossier on Saddam's links to al-Qa'ida. What none of us 

can tell until we see the information is whether the intelligence is speculative 

or solid. Even if the intelligence is less than overwhelming in relation to al-Qa'ida, 

Mr Bush may win grudging backing for his war. But grudging backing is as bad as 

no backing if the war starts go wrong.</p>

<p>The assumption that Saddam's army will simply fold as it did during the last 

Gulf War may turn out to be wrong-headed. The Iraqi leader never committed his 

best troops to battle, and when the Allied forces stormed into Kuwait and Iraq 

during Operation Desert Storm they faced waves of miserable conscripts. The real 

fighting forces were held back to deal with the internal war against the Shia 

and the Kurds, who, as Saddam anticipated, rose in rebellion when the regime seemed 

threatened.</p>

<p>During the last Gulf War, Saddam continually underestimated the determination 

of the Allies to launch an invasion. He did so largely on the basis that he believed 

the coalition would fall apart as evidence grew of civilian casualties from the 

air campaign. This time around he will calculate that public opinion in the US 

and Britain will either forestall an attack, or revolt when the military and civilian 

cost becomes too high. Saddam may well be willing to allow a war to start in the 

belief that it will collapse from political pressures well before US armour ever 

reaches the gates of Baghdad. Thus he has little incentive to cave in now to what 

are likely to be very tough demands on weapons inspections. If Saddam is convinced 

that the rest of the world is opposed to war and that the US and Britain are isolated, 

he will play tough and hope to humiliate Bush before a shot is fired. But it is 

at this point that American public opinion could swing in behind the President 

and the countdown to war will have begun.</p>

<p>The list of what-ifs that attend any war scenario is scary. Mr Blair senses 

this more acutely than his American counterpart, if only because he is more inclined 

to hear the advice of his own diplomats and intelligence people. Thus when he 

arrives in Camp David today he will surely be asking how Mr Bush proposes to deal 

with the prospect of large-scale casualties if Saddam's &eacute;lite forces make 

a stand in the cities. How will the US respond if Saddam deploys chemical and 

biological weapons against Allied forces and against the Israelis? And what does 

he plan to do for Iraq after Saddam is ousted? Iraq is a country of different 

nations &#150; Sunni, Shia and Kurd &#150; and could easily slide into Yugoslavia-style 

anarchy. Mr Bush needs to say whether he plans to turn Iraq into an international 

protectorate with thousands of Allied troops patrolling the area for years into 

the future.</p>

<p>But most of all Mr Bush needs to make a compelling case to his own people, 

and the rest of the world, for going to war in the first place. So expect to see 

a big public relations campaign to shock the American people into supporting war, 

with or without wide international support, and expect a sudden increase in the 

tempo of American efforts to try and win Arab support by pressing Ariel Sharon 

to talk to the Palestinians. It's hard to believe there will be any meaningful 

dialogue, and the best Bush can expect is a lowering of anti-war rhetoric from 

Arab leaders. Also expect Saddam to give a little but not enough and... expect 

war this winter.</p>
