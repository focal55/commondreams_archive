<p>CHICAGO --</B> George Bush's much-anticipated <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2002/06/print/20020624-3.html" target="_new">speech</a> 

on how to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, weighed in at 1,867 words. By 

my count, more than one thousand words were devoted to criticizing and making 

demands of the Palestinians, while just 137 words dealt with what Israel should 

do. And if you look for any criticism at all of Israel, you will not find it. 

The few remaining words were taken up with cliches and platitudes.</P>

<P>The content of few statements can have been leaked in advance as much as this 

one, and yet Bush's pronouncement still managed to surprise by its sheer breathtaking 

unfairness and unwillingness to address a reality which is clearly perceived by 

the rest of the world.</P>

<P>The speech was so pro-Israeli that <I>Jerusalem Post</I> reporter David Horowitz 

told National Public Radio that the Sharon government may feel they could have 

written it themselves. Bush has entirely accepted the Israeli view that "terror" 

alone is what is fueling the conflict, and defined all Israeli violence as self-defense.</P>

<P>As expected, it is up to the Palestinians to "reform" themselves before any 

demands, no matter how mild, are made of Israel. Bush declared: "I call on the 

Palestinian people to elect new leaders, leaders not compromised by terror. I 

call upon them to build a practicing democracy, based on tolerance and liberty. 

If the Palestinian people actively pursue these goals, America and the world will 

actively support their efforts."</P>

<P>Bush's apparent call on the Palestinians to get rid of Yasir Arafat immediately 

grabbed the headlines. But this call, just as Israel has re-re-re-invaded almost 

every Palestinian city, once more placed Arafat under house arrest and announced 

"massive action" imminently in the Gaza Strip, may actually serve as a green light 

to Sharon to kill or expel Arafat. Sharon whose popularity is flagging as he has 

failed to bring security through repression may now feel emboldened to make the 

move against Arafat that many in Israel are demanding. This would only increase 

the chaos and violence. On the other hand, now that Bush has openly identified 

Arafat as the obstacle to progress, Sharon may well do all he can to preserve 

Arafat in hale and vigorous health.</P>

<P>Arafat, demonstrating how incoherent and detached from reality he has become, 

reacted to Bush's speech by calling it a "serious contribution to the Middle East 

peace process." Such a declaration deserves at best pity for a man whose faculties 

are clearly failing him, but is more likely to generate among Palestinians only 

anger, derision and contempt.</P>

<P>Bush's message amounts to a demand that the Palestinians must under the totalistic 

conditions of military occupation develop all the institutions of a fully independent, 

democratic state and a fully functioning democracy. Yet, while demanding democracy 

from the Palestinians, Bush is not shy to tell them in advance whom they cannot 

have as their leaders.</P>

<P>What will be the Palestinians' reward for achieving this impossible task? Not 

independence, but according to Bush "the United States of America will support 

the creation of a Palestinian state whose borders and certain aspects of its sovereignty 

will be provisional until resolved as part of a final settlement in the Middle 

East."</P>

<P>Hussein Ibish originally pointed out in <I>The Los Angeles Times</I> that "interim 

independence and partial sovereignty make as much sense politically as a woman 

being somewhat pregnant. Independence and sovereignty are either fully realized 

or meaningless." (June 20, 2002) Palestinian cabinet minister Nabil Shaath has 

since repeated this analogy on CNN. </P>

<P>Bush complained that "Today, the elected Palestinian legislature has no authority, 

and power is concentrated in the hands of an unaccountable few." He observed--correctly--"The 

Palestinian parliament should have the full authority of a legislative body." 

What he left out is that it was the Oslo Accords, signed with the full blessing 

of the United States that explicitly limited the powers of the Palestinian legislature 

and gave the Israeli military authorities the right to annul any law passed by 

it.</P>

<P>Bush worried that "Today, the Palestinian people lack effective courts of law 

and have no means to defend and vindicate their rights." Yet he failed to mention 

that the very worst abuses were carried out by the infamous "State Security Court" 

established with the full approval of the United States and blessed in person 

by then Vice President Al Gore when he visited Jericho in 1994. Since then the 

Palestinian security services have arrested people and violated their human rights 

not merely with the acquiescence of the United States, but with the active encouragement, 

training and supervision of the CIA. Palestinian courts have no jurisdiction at 

all over the Israeli settlers living on confiscated land, and so even reformed 

will not provide Palestinians with "means to defend and vindicate their rights." 

This is the difference between real independence and 'provisional' independence. 

And it is this lack of real means to defend their rights that leads many to conclude 

that the only means available is violence.</P>

<P>On the issue of violence, Bush made it very clear that only the Palestinians 

must renounce it. Israel was given a free hand to "continue to defend herself." 

Palestinians are required to stop "terror" immediately, but Bush only called on 

Israel to withdraw its forces to the positions held prior to September 28, 2000 

and to stop settlement construction in the occupied territories, "as we make progress." 

This is essentially a license for Israel to carry on with aggressive violence 

unilaterally, since the settlement building enterprise is based solely on violence--the 

violent expropriation of Palestinian land, the violent demolition of Palestinian 

homes,, and the violent suppression of any Palestinian who tries to get in the 

way of this relentless colonization--which Sharon has openly declared will continue 

until he can bring a million more Jews to settle all of "Judea and Samaria."</P>

<P>Forty years ago, Frantz Fanon explained that between the colonizer and the 

colonized native "it is the policeman and the soldier who are the official, instituted 

go-betweens, the spokesmen of the settler and his rule of oppression... It is 

obvious here that the agents of government speak the language of pure force. The 

intermediary does not lighten the oppression, nor seek to hide the domination; 

he shows them up and puts them into practice with the clear conscience of an upholder 

of the peace; yet he is the bringer of violence into the home and into the mind 

of the native." ("The Wretched of the Earth," chapter 1)</P>

<P>So it is now with the "clear conscience of the upholder of the peace" that 

Bush is effectively inviting Sharon to accelerate the settlement enterprise until 

there is "progress." Since the violence and despair that the settlements generate 

can only bring the opposite of progress towards security and peace, it is an open 

invitation.</P>

<P>When Bush speaks about Israeli "occupation"--it is merely a word, an abstraction. 

It is not a system of foreign military dictatorship over millions of people which 

is the very antithesis of every democratic value Bush claims to stand for and 

which invades every transaction of daily life. First and foremost he views it 

not as a condition affecting the Palestinians but as something to that harms Israelis, 

because "permanent occupation threatens Israel's identity and democracy."</P>

<P>Bush clearly views the Palestinians as being the direct cause of Israeli suffering: 

" I can understand the deep anger and anguish of the Israeli people. You've lived 

too long with fear and funerals, having to avoid markets and public transportation, 

and forced to put armed guards in kindergarten classrooms. The Palestinian Authority 

has rejected your offer at hand, and trafficked with terrorists. You have a right 

to a normal life; you have a right to security; and I deeply believe that you 

need a reformed, responsible Palestinian partner to achieve that security." </P>

<P>But as for the Palestinians--dispossessed of their country and freedom for 

fifty-four years--Israel has no culpability at all: "I can understand the deep 

anger and despair of the Palestinian people. For decades you've been treated as 

pawns in the Middle East conflict. Your interests have been held hostage to a 

comprehensive peace agreement that never seems to come, as your lives get worse 

year by year." </P>

<P>That is all Bush has to say. It is as if the Palestinians, due to a bit of 

rotten luck, have caught a cold. Yet if one reads carefully, it seems that if 

anyone is responsible for the Palestinians plight it is those who have "treated 

them as pawns." This is usually a code word for other Arab states. Indeed, Bush 

places the Palestinians' relationship with Israel on the same plane as their relations 

with other Arabs, as if the two can be compared, as if Israel is just another 

one of many countries with which the Palestinians can't get along. Why then does 

Bush declare that after the Palestinians meet his impossible demands for a fully 

functioning democracy "they will be able to reach agreement with Israel and Egypt 

and Jordan on security and other arrangements for independence."? Later he affirms 

that the 'provisional' Palestinian state "could rise rapidly, as it comes to terms 

with Israel, Egypt and Jordan on practical issues, such as security." All of this 

is an effort to wipe away any of the unique historic responsibility Israel has 

for the conflict as well as being an effort to try to co-opt "moderate" Arab leaders 

to Bush's "vision."</P>

<P>Is there anything hopeful in this speech? I cannot find anything unless it 

is Bush's call--eventually--for an independent Palestinian state and an Israeli 

withdrawal. But there is nothing new even in this, and his latest statement does 

not even go as far as US Secretary of State Colin Powell's speech in Louisville, 

Kentucky last November or Bush's own Rose Garden declaration last April. The notions 

of true independence and a real end to the occupation are so thoroughly undermined 

by the conditions attached and the full backing given to an Israeli government 

that openly opposes these goals as to be utterly meaningless.</P>

<P>In the final analysis, Bush's speech having failed to offer the only thing 

that can at this point stop the spiral towards disaster--a clear timetable, guaranteed 

by the international community to end the Israeli occupation and return to political 

negotiations,--may only make things worse. Israel's far-right government will 

be emboldened that its patient strategy of pushing its aggression further step 

by step and weathering the periodic gusts of American and international criticism 

has paid off with a full US endorsement of its current policies. We can expect 

an acceleration of Israeli violence and settlement activity with predictably disastrous 

results. On the Palestinian side--among those who could distract themselves from 

the task of survival long enough to care what Bush has to say--his speech will 

only increase despair, and may bolster support for those who have argued that 

the international intervention Palestinians have been waiting and working for 

for more than fifty years will never come, and only by continuing to take the 

fight directly to the Israelis can Palestinians free themselves. </P>

<P>The future for Palestinians and Israelis is as grim as it has ever been. What 

Bush has offered is not a formula for provisional or any other kind of Palestinian 

statehood, but a vision of permanent war.</P>
