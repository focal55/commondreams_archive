<p>It would appear that President Bush is rapidly gaining intellectual and moral ground. He gives talks on the 

"new ethic of responsibility," delivers radio addresses

 on morality in business, and according to dutiful

press  reports, the president has taken to discussing Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics in his free time.



<p>But just what would Aristotle make of Bush? And how

would the Nicomachean Ethics, the classic roadmap to a 

more just society, stack up with the President's

proposed FY 2003 budget? 



<p>On the surface, there are connections. Aristotle's 

passion was education, and Bush has called it his "top 

priority." Aristotle advocated equitable distribution

of wealth, and President Bush has repeatedly stated

that America's poor "deserve better from this country."



<p>But that's where the similarities end - in words. The

following are quotes from Aristotle, followed by the 

Bush budgetary response.



<p>Aristotle: Early childhood education is "all-important."



<p>The President's FY 2003 budget either freezes or cuts

funding to crucial programs benefiting the nation's 12 

million impoverished children. Slated to be axed, cut 

back or frozen are programs designed to help local 

communities improve access to early learning

opportunities, programs providing child/after-school

care to needy families, and programs for early

literacy. Even Head Start, which the President has

referred to as "the nation's premier early childhood

education program," is given an increase so deficient

as to prevent any new children from joining.



<p>Aristotle: "Unjust is unequal."



<p>The Bush budget posts a $106 billion deficit, the first

since 1997, and predicts exploding debts in the future 

- due primarily to spending increases on programs for

the administration's lucrative corporate donors. For 

example, the $1 billion per day currently spent on the

US military will balloon over the next five years with 

weapons purchases alone rising by 30%. Meanwhile,

slashed or frozen will be numerous low-income family  

support programs such as Home Energy Assistance and

Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. The budget 

leaves impoverished families behind, as it coddles

defense contractors and creates bulging debts for

future generations to bear.



<p>Aristotle: "This is why we don't allow a man to rule,

but rational principle, because a man behaves in his 

own interests."



<p>Major environmental agencies are dealt a $1 billion

blow in the Bush FY 2003 budget, but conservation 

programs, rather than corporate and industrial

interests, take the biggest hit. The Environmental

Protection Agency (EPA), for example, loses $300

million, and funding for clean water protection is

similarly slashed. In contrast, billions in tax breaks

and subsidies will suddenly become available for fossil

fuel and nuclear power companies, and further millions

will be used to open up public lands for drilling and 

mining. Simultaneously, the amount of timber to be sold

from public lands will be increased by 50%, further

decimating wildlife habitat, and contributing to global warming.



<p>Aristotle: "Men have been undone by reasons of their

wealth."



<p>In this era of accounting shenanigans and corporate

financial meltdowns, it becomes easier to question the 

values upon which our society operates. And as the FY

2003 budget is debated in the next months, it will 

become increasingly important to follow the money

trail, and question the kind of world our budget is

creating for the next generation.



<p>Because an equitable, sustainable world - not words -

is the ultimate ethical responsibility for all of us.
