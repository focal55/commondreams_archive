<p>As America's war drums beat ever louder, the Bush administration has embarked 

upon an unprecedented exercise in diplomatic softening-up. Under the fashionable 

rubric of 'public diplomacy', the White House is aiming to legitimize war in Iraq 

by explaining to a global audience the selfless idealism of the American way. 

While Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld appeal to the 'kick-ass' militarism of the 

US mainstream, new more subtle pro-American radio stations and cable channels 

proliferate throughout the Middle East. In Washington, the urgent need to challenge 

hostile media perceptions has seen the public diplomacy spin unit moved from the 

State Department to the White House West Wing. 

<P>Yet none of this will make the slightest difference. As this week's coverage 

has shown, America will continue to be resented as brash, imperialistic and arrogant. 

There can be no global improvement in the United States 'brand' so long as George 

W. Bush remains President. For with a resonance apparent in few other republics, 

the bearer of the US presidency defines the American image. With Reagan it was 

the frontier spirit, with Bush senior East Coast Waspishness. The current President 

Bush regards himself as America's Churchill, but he is in fact heir to a far less 

attractive aspect of the Anglo-American heritage - Puritanism. 

<P>From the landing of the Mayflower, those Pilgrims who fled the tyranny and 

irreligion of Stuart England believed they were establishing a new moral order. 

America was to be the Promised Land, the New World free from the decayed corruption 

of courtly Europe. Its virgin wilderness offered a modern Garden of Eden. And 

the model piety of the Puritan settlers would act as a beacon for the fallen old 

world to follow. America was unique and its people blessed. 

<P>Across the centuries the Puritan spirit, which helped foster an incredible 

economic dynamism, a self-righteous moral certainty and, in seventeenth century 

Salem (as later in the hands of Joseph McCarthy), a frightening propensity to 

crush free-thinking, has remained quietly resilient in American political discourse. 

Now in the character of George Bush, and most spectacularly in the form of Attorney 

General John Ashcroft, it has come to dominate America's public image. 

<P>Bush's presidency was built on Puritan legend. He placed the story of his own 

personal redemption at the heart of his political narrative. As Clinton was the 

boy from a broken home who battled against an alcoholic step-father, Bush was 

the man who at the age of 40 saw the light. His youthful alcoholism, his rumored 

drug abuse, and his numerous arrests were forgotten as he swapped the bottle for 

Bible study with librarian wife Laura. Dubya had lived and loved in darkness but 

he saw the error of his ways, embraced the Lord and the slate was wiped clean. 

A true Pilgrim's Progress. 

<P>Brilliantly, the Bush campaign projected the morality of this Puritan journey 

on to the American body politic. After the decadent excesses of the Clinton years, 

it was, as Bush repeated over and again, 'time to scrub the Oval Office clean'. 

America had to purify the Presidency if it was to reclaim its status as the Promised 

Land. 

<P>Once in power, the Puritan culture flourished. John Ashcroft undermined centuries 

of church-state separation by demanding his office staff join him in Bible readings. 

Inside the White House, Bush insisted on smart dress and smart manners and in 

contrast to Clinton's late-night policy rambles he rose early each day for a two-hour 

work-out. According to accounts published in the New York Times, a glamorous evening 

with President Bush consists of 'dinner at seven, coffee on the Truman Balcony 

and bed by 10'. Where Clinton reveled in the metropolitan intellectualism of Martha's 

Vineyard, Bush has made the bleak philistinism of Crawford, Texas, his spiritual 

home. 

<P>Such puritan mores were of amusing if parochial interest until the events of 

11 September. In the administration's ensuing reprisals on the Taliban and broadening 

'war on terror' against al-Qaeda, Bush claimed to have realized the divine calling 

of his presidency. He was involved not in a legitimate defense of the national 

interest but a Manichean struggle between good and evil, black and white, fear 

and freedom. In language strikingly redolent of his Puritan forebears, Bush accepted 

it was his destiny to fight 'this crusade, this war on terrorism'. The President 

declared himself and the nation engaged in a life and death struggle with 'the 

evil one', Osama bin Laden. A man who was not simply a terrorist with messianic 

delusions, but 'an incredibly evil man'. 

<P>As crusades have a habit of doing, the war on terror has widened its remit. 

Bush is now committed to conquering an entire 'axis of evil' as sinful, backward 

and fallen as Puritans once regarded the old world. And according to Defense Secretary 

Rumsfeld, the White House is ready to do this with or without old world, European 

support. America has rediscovered its unique, special calling - to drain the swamp 

of terrorism and 'let in the light' of Western democracy and free market economics. 

The Puritan heritage of unilateral moral righteousness has resurfaced as never 

before. 

<P>This hubristic moral certainty now defines the global image of the United States. 

Across the world, post-11 September sympathy is evaporating as Bush embarks on 

a unilateral war on terror which interprets geopolitics as a seismic struggle 

between good and evil. A struggle which would in the Pentagon world view have 

regarded the armed resistance of the African National Congress (ANC) as evil just 

as it now believes Ariel Sharon to be 'a man of peace'. 

<P>But behind the Puritan righteousness, there is as ever the whiff of hypocrisy. 

As recent reports have indicated, if in the early days of the administration Bush 

hadn't been so concerned with rubbishing the Clinton legacy rather than following 

up intelligence reports, or John Ashcroft hadn't prioritized combating pornography 

above fighting global terrorism, Osama bin Laden and the al- Qaeda network might 

have been dealt a lethal blow. 

<P>Yet just as debilitating for America's long-term global interests is the damage 

Bush is doing to the predominantly progressive legacy of American political history. 

Among the anti-globalization European young and across much of the Arab world, 

the radicalism and inspiration of the American story is being pushed out by impressions 

of big business, unchecked militarism and imperial hegemony. 

<P>It isn't just a question of forgetting America's extraordinary force for good 

throughout most of the twentieth century. Rather, Bush is endangering a greater 

legacy: the revolutionary idealism of George Washington and the enfranchising 

liberalism of the founding fathers, who sent the language of autonomy and self-respect 

around the world. A political language that secured human rights and peacefully 

undercut authoritarian regimes across the centuries. Equally at risk is the introspective 

spiritualism of the American tradition. In an administration over-shadowed by 

oil and B52s, the individualism of Henry D. Thoreau as well as the humanitarian 

dignity of his intellectual heir, Martin Luther King, is forgotten. America's 

legacy of civil society, of environmental activism, women's rights and identity 

politics will count for naught with a President who snubs the Earth summit while 

unilaterally planning war on Iraq. 

<P>America's progressive heritage, its surest route to a positive global reception, 

is being jettisoned by the regressive Puritanism of the Bush White House. Yet 

the President blunders on incredulous at any expression of disquiet. The worst 

move he could now make is to relocate those charged with 'selling America' from 

the State Department to the West Wing. For it is Secretary of State Colin Powell 

who alone in this grisly administration manages to embody a remaining vestige 

of America's true greatness.</p>
