<p>Medieval scientists sought to turn base metals into gold, creating 

wealth for themselves and their rulers.  Likewise, modern science, 

harnessed by capitalists, seeks to turn fresh water into gold.  While 

the former failed in their explicit goals, they set out a path leading 

to the field of chemistry.  The latter group, led by transnational 

corporations in the water industry, doubly succeeded.  



<p>First, the fundamental ingredient of the modern day alchemists is 

freshwater, H2O, not base metals.  Fresh water is more valuable to life 

on earth than any amount of gold.  Water is the elixir of life, in which 

our vary body's composition and survival depend on.  It is necessary for 

our food to grow, our rivers to flow, and to support a plethora of 

diverse ecosystems and species on Earth.  For all their acclaimed worth, 

gold and diamonds cannot compete with water.  Compounding the problem, 

less than 1% of all water is accessible for consumption. 



<p>Second, transnational corporations (TNCs) have found a method of 

converting water to gold.  The research and development department, 

probably headed by some free market "think tank", searched for ways to 

improve water, and the solution was simple: make it a product, own it, 

sell it.  The catalyst in this reaction is privatization.  TNCs, with 

the backing of US hegemony and its neoliberal institutions -- the World 

Bank and International Monetary Fund -- have once again revolutionized 

the means of creating wealth, capital, gold. Privatization removes 

publicly owned water supplies from the public and into the hands of 

private companies, with private interests -- turning water to gold.  Its 

needless to say, but I'll say it anyway, gold can't sustain life. 

  

<p>The private water industry seizes water out of the very mouths of the 

thirsty and deposits it in the coffers of TNCs, where they work their 

magic metamorphosing water into gold.  Privatization reverses the 

seemingly irreversible flow of water -- from life-giving to life-taking. 

Water, long-viewed as a common property resource available to all, and 

basic human right, is transformed into a commodity.  It is bought and 

sold. Paid for in meaningless pieces of paper stamped with God and $.  



<p>The message is simple: if you want to live, pay up.  Conversely, if you 

can't pay, you don't have a right to life.  That has been the lesson 

Western capitalism is attempting to teach the rest of the world. From 

Bolivia to Argentina to Ghana to the Philippines, water privatization 

combined with a prohibition on public subsidies for the poor, has 

elevated the (lack of) rules of the market above human rights.  



<p>How do TNCs convert water to gold? They charge more.  When water is 

privatized, prices go up.  When prices go up, access to water goes down. 

In the industrialized country of Great Britain, rate hikes after 

privatization caused poorer residents to lose access to water in their 

homes, because they couldn't afford to pay for it.  The consequences in 

countries where two-thirds of the population lives in poverty, such as 

Cochabamba, Bolivia, are grave.  There, people rejected a World Bank 

sanctioned privatization scheme, even after it was implemented. So too 

in Tucuman, Argentina.  And the struggle continues in Ghana, as the 

government plans to privatize water there.  Modern alchemists have 

succeeded in creating a reaction that increases the wealth of the few, 

at the cost of the many.  Privatization experiments span all continents. 

The G8 summit deep in the Canadian forest last week produced plans to 

expand experimentation across Africa, as a component of Western "aid" 

packages to reduce suffering of hundreds of millions on the African 

continent. 



<p>What will the results be? If history is any indicator of the future, the privatization 

of water and subsequent creation of gold for TNCs has many byproducts, none of 

which are beneficial to the populace. Take Cochabamba, Bolivia as an example. 

There, the municipal water supply was taken from the city and control was centralized 

at the state level. Then the public water utility was sold to a consortium of 

US and Italian-based TNCs, without public comment, participation, or approval, 

and at the order of the World Bank. Rate hikes soared, and many residents were 

unable to pay. On the bright side, peaceful demonstrations ensued, grassroots 

coalitions formed, and negotiations began. Democracy flourished in reaction to 

an undemocratic and unjust co-optation of public resources. Then violence erupted 

from the arms of the state, in a desperate attempt to quash protest and maintain 

the status quo -- a neoliberal policy of privatization benefiting the world?s 

elite at the cost of the majority poor. 

<p>At the same time, the new private water alchemist, Aguas del Tunari, 

worked steadily to turn its water into gold.  Yet that gold is liken to 

a magician's illusion rather than a chemist's reaction.  Wealth isn't 

immaculately conceived by capitalism either, although capitalists and 

developers like to think they are doing God's work.  Instead, the gold 

comes from the people. It is transferred from water consumers to 

transnational capitalists. From those in need to those consumed by 

greed. 



<p>History also shows us that people can successfully oppose privatization 

of their water.  In Cochabamba and Tucuman, water contracts were 

cancelled due to popular resistance.  The TNCs were ousted, but their 

search for gold continues.  In both cases, the TNCs involved are suing 

the citizens of both countries, through the World Bank's arbitration 

branch, for millions of dollars in compensation for the loss of 

"potential profits."  When providing services doesn't cut it, they go 

straight for the throat.  As these countries are beholden to 

international financial institutions, the citizens are held captive 

under an enormous, unsustainable debt that pits the interest of capital 

against the interests of life. 



<p>Which will prevail? Popular victories are adding up, as people mobilize 

to resist capitalism, neoliberalism, and its privatization tool.  Yet 

Western economic and cultural domination looms large.  It has just 

expanded the experimentation to Africa, a continent where reparation is 

needed more than loans.  The stated intentions of development "aid" to 

help the three-quarters world appears, based on concrete evidence and 

past experiences, to be the antithesis of the actual results.  If 

history repeats itself in Africa, millions will be left worse off, with 

even less access to clean water and sanitation.  Illness, disease, and 

death are sure to follow.  Perhaps this is the G8's solution to the 

world's perceived "population problem" -- privatize their resources, take 

their money, and watch them die.  After all, the goal of capitalism 

isn't to sustain life, but to produce wealth, even at the cost of life.
