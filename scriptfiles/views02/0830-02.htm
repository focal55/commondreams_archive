<p>Labor Day came twice last year. A week after the parades and picnics, Americans 

had their real Labor Day on Sept. 11. Americans poured out thanks to firefighters, 

police officers, paramedics and other workers who put themselves on the line to 

save others. Wall Street stockbrokers and secretaries, CEOs and minimum wage workers 

died--and survived--together. 

<p>The spirit of shared sacrifice was shattered in October as a parade of companies 

led by Enron began imploding from CEO greed. 

<p>Some of America's worst CEOs make more in a year than the best CEOs of earlier 

generations made in their lifetimes. 

<p>CEOs pumped up stock with accounting steroids, hitting quarterly earnings homeruns 

while doing serious damage to their companies, workers, shareholders and the economy. 

<p>Global Crossing Chairman Gary Winnick, who Fortune called "the emperor of greed," 

cashed in $735 million in stock over four years while leading the company to bankruptcy. 

The double crossing Winnick bought a California estate worth $94 million after 

$30 million in renovations. Meanwhile, reports NBC, "Global Crossing workers lost 

their jobs, their severance pay, and promised medical benefits. Entire 401(k)s 

were decimated. With the exception of a select group of executives, Global Crossing 

employees could not unload their stock for five years." 

<p>Back in 1950, when Business Week began ranking CEO pay, the highest-paid executive 

was General Motors President Charles Wilson, who made $4.4 million in inflation-adjusted 

dollars. In 2001, the highest paid CEO was Oracle's Lawrence Ellison at $706 million--nearly 

$2 million a day. 

<p>Wilson would have had to work for 160 years to match Ellison's $706 million. 

<p>The average CEO of a major corporation made $11 million in 2001, including 

salary, bonus and other compensation such as exercised stock options. That’s more 

than $33,000 seven days a week, in a year when the economy tanked. 

<p>CEOs made about 565 times as much as security guards, 445 times as much as 

emergency medical technicians and paramedics, 442 times as much as secretaries, 

312 times as much as firefighters and 271 times as much as police officers. 

<p>Back in 1960, CEOs made an average 38 times more than schoolteachers, according 

to Business Week. By 1990, CEOs made 63 times as much. In 2001, CEOs made 264 

times as much as public school teachers. 

<p>The Census Bureau recently analyzed what people could expect to earn, on average 

(adjusted to 1999 dollars), during a hypothetical 40-year working life at full-time 

jobs. College graduates could expect $2.1 million and high school graduates $1.2 

million. 

<p>Workers with a professional degree, such as doctors and lawyers, could expect 

to earn $4.4 million during their working life--not even half what CEOs make in 

just a year. 

<p>While CEO pay spiraled out of control, worker pay was largely stagnant for 

decades. Average hourly earnings for production workers in 2001 were 9 percent 

lower than their 1973 peak, adjusting for inflation. 

<p>If workers' wages had kept pace with productivity gains since 1979, average 

hourly earnings would have been $21.71 last year, not $14.33. 

<p>This Labor Day, workers need rescue. Congress should start by raising the minimum 

wage, which would help boost the stagnant pay of average workers as well. 

<p>It takes more than three jobs at the minimum wage of $5.15 an hour--$10,712 

a year--to support a family. The real value of the minimum wage peaked in 1968 

at $8.28 per hour (in 2002 dollars). Today's minimum wage workers earn 38 percent 

less. 

<p>Members of Congress made 9 times as much as minimum wage workers in 1968 and 

14 times as much today. In 1997, when the minimum wage was last raised, to $5.15 

an hour, members of Congress earned $133,600. Since then, they've increased their 

pay by $16,400--much more than minimum wage workers earn in a year. Unless the 

Senate blocks it, Congressional pay will rise from $150,000 now to $155,000 in 

January 2003. 

<p>Congress should forgo another pay hike until the minimum wage has been raised 

enough to bring it back to the 9-to-1 ratio that prevailed in 1968. That would 

help Congress become more representative of low-and middle-income Americans and 

less representative of the swindling CEOs who pretended what was good for them 

was good for the country.
