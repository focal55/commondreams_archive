<p>Bush has been appearing at a number of events with union workers-- from 

announcing tariffs on imported steel to supposedly protect steel jobs to 

promising oil drilling jobs in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) to 

Teamsters. Does this mean that Bush's "compassionate conservatism" includes a 

pro-union component?</P>

<P>Hardly.</P>

<P>Despite all the media fuss over Teamsters and some building trades support 

for ANWR drilling, the media has largely ignored the opposition to Bush's energy 

policy by major unions ranging from the Service Employees International Union to 

the Communication Workers of America. As for steel tariffs, Bush's policy 

ignored a key demand of the Steelworkers union: guaranteeing the health care and 

pensions of workers threatened by the bankruptcy of their previous employers. 

</P>

<P>But then, promoting corporate bailouts while ignoring direct help for workers 

has been Bush's policy from day one of his administration. When airlines were 

bailed out after the September 11<SUP>th</SUP> attacks, none of the $15 billion 

in money went to help the workers laid off by the airlines. Worse, both before 

and after the attacks, the administration intervened to block strikes at 

Northwest, Delta and United Airlines to prevent workers from demanding fair 

treatment by the airlines. </P>

<P>Bush may be trying to clothe his anti-worker actions by cutting a few deals 

with folks like Jimmy Hoffa, Jr. at the Teamsters union, but even many top 

Teamster officials aren't buying it. Chuck Mack, the Teamsters Vice President 

for the Western Region, has called Bush's labor policy "a nightmare for 

workers." The AFL-CIO Building Trades Department labeled Bush's policies 

"nothing short of a declaration of war on construction workers." And these are 

supposedly the unions closest to the administration.</P>

<P>It's not hard to see why the attacks on Bush are so scathing, since beneath 

his rhetoric, he has mounted an attack on unions and workers rights on a 

sweeping scale. Topping the anti-worker agenda of the Bush administration, of 

course, was its 2001 tax cut for the wealthy last year, which aside from paying 

back his campaign contributors, was designed to bankrupt the government and 

prevent new spending for national health insurance, day care or any other 

initiatives to assist working families. But the anti-worker agenda is shown in a 

wide range of other initiatives and appointments Bush has made. Here is just a 

partial review since his taking office. </P>

<P>In his first days in office, Bush issued four executive orders to directly 

undermine labor organizing</P>

<UL>

<LI><b>Ending Project Labor Agreements:</b> The first order (found illegal by the 

  courts later in the year) sought to bar what are known as project labor 

  agreements on all federally funded construction projects, agreements that 

  encourage union contracts and labor peace that been regularly used since the 

  1940s. </LI>

</UL>

<UL>

<LI><b>Ending Rights When Federal Contractors Change:</b> The second revoked a 

  rule designed to reduce turnover in low-wage jobs which had required federal 

  contractors to rehire displaced workers when the government changed 

  contractors. </LI>

</UL>

<UL>

<LI><b>Abolishing Labor-Management Systems:</b> The third order abolished 

  employee participation systems in the federal government that had given 

  employees a voice and led to numerous cost-savings measures benefiting all 

  taxpayers. </LI>

</UL>

<UL>

<LI><b>Undermining Union Dues:</b> The fourth (also struck down by courts as 

  illegal) required government contractors to post notices highlighting ways for 

  workers to object to union dues, while not requiring the posting of any other 

  workers rights to organize or join unions. </LI>

</UL>

<P>Bush followed these orders with a "review" and termination of a number of 

Clinton-era regulations. These included:</P>

<UL>

<LI><b>Ergonomics Regulations:</b> Bush signed off on the GOP's repeal of 

  regulations designed to prevent injuries from repetitive motion and compensate 

  the victims of on-the-job injuries. The administration has yet to issue 

  replacement regulations and have announced they will favor "voluntary" 

  measures by businesses that have contributed millions of dollars to the GOP to 

  preserve the status quo.</LI>

</UL>

<UL>

<LI><b>Contracts for Corporate Criminals: </b> The Bush administration repealed 

  "responsible contractor" rules that would have denied billions of dollars in 

  government contracts to chronic corporate violators of our environmental, 

  labor and safety laws. </LI>

</UL>

<UL>

<LI><b>Black Lung Regulations:</b> Bush's administration attorneys persuaded a 

  federal judge to suspend new black lung regulations that went into effect on 

  January 19, 2001 that would helped streamline claims by dying miners in 

  claiming benefits from the mining industry.</LI>

</UL>

<P>Bush has also loaded up his administration with a range of rightwing 

anti-union officials who have pledged to rollback day-to-day enforcement of 

workers' rights:</P>

<P><b>Labor Department Secretary:</b> After the firestorm of protest over his 

initial choice of Linda Chavez as Labor Secretary, Bush's second choice was 

Elaine Chao, a policy analyst from the conservative Heritage Foundation think 

tank, where she had attacked affirmative action programs and minimum wage laws 

as undermining "free enterprise." Under her leadership, the department has 

pledged that it would emphasize "compliance assistance" for companies, rather 

than actual enforcement of workplace laws.</P>

<P><b>Occupational Safety and Health Administration:</b> Similarly, Bush's OSHA 

chief John Henshaw has announced a focus on compliance and "voluntary" programs 

and using enforcement only to stop "the worst law breakers."</P>

<P><b>Labor Department Solicitor:</b>  Facing a firestorm of opposition<B>, </B>Bush 

used a recess appointment to bypass the Senate to make anti-worker lawyer Eugene 

Scalia (son of the Supreme Court Justice) the top lawyer for the Labor 

Department. Scalia has campaigned against ergonomics rules as "junk science" and 

in a 10-year career as a labor lawyer, he represented only two workers amidst a 

practice of fighting for large corporations against workers rights.</P>

<P><b>National Labor Relations Board:</b> Again bypassing the Senate, Bush made two 

recent recess appointments to the five-member NLRB, Michael Bartlett and William 

Cowen. Barlett previously headed labor policy at the Chamber of Commerce, while 

Cowen was founder of a notoriously anti-union labor firm. With a new majority of 

GOP appointees, we can soon expect serious reversals of pro-union precedents by 

the NLRB.</P>

<P><b>Justice Department:</b> John Ashcroft's anti-civil liberties policies have 

gotten the headlines, but he has also taken advantage of the post-Sept 

11<SUP>th</SUP> crisis to terminate union representation and collective 

bargaining agreements in several Justice Department agencies in the name of 

"national security." </P>

<P>All of this has been done largely without any new legislation, but if the GOP 

can retake control of the Senate this fall, Bush will no doubt continue this 

record with a whole new raft of anti-union legislation. </P>

<P>Bush may be using a few select union leaders as props for photo opportunities 

as the camera bulbs flash brightly, but his policies are increasingly leaving 

workers rights in the dark</P>
