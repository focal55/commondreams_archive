<p>History is not always a reliable guide to the future. But the fact that every 

global recession in the past 30 years has been preceded first by a crisis in the 

Middle East and then a spike in the oil price does little to reassure those fretting 

over the economic consequences of a war on Iraq. It may explain why the International 

Monetary Fund, a body not given to exaggeration, warned last week that ousting 

Saddam Hussein would not be "a very healthy development", and one that could lead 

to the panic selling of shares. The fund's image of "fear feeding on fear" on 

the world's stock exchanges emphasizes that the devastation would not be confined 

to the Middle East. Although there may be political capital in equating the Iraqi 

leader to Hitler there is none in comparing world war two's reinvigoration of 

the US economy to any putative boost that America might enjoy if it bombed Baghdad. 

The assessment this time is clearly tilting towards the view that a strike against 

Saddam would be more of a burden than a boon. 

<P>The reason is oil, on which America runs. Contrary to hawkish opinion, a battle-scarred 

Iraq - even a post-Saddam one sympathetic to the US - will not instantly produce 

millions of barrels of oil, despite the country's extensive reserves. So oil is 

unlikely to head down quickly apart from shedding the "war premium" currently 

built into its price. But if the Iraqis lashed out at Saudi Arabian and Kuwaiti 

installations crude, according to former Saudi minister Sheikh Yamani, could end 

up costing $100 a barrel. This would not help Opec, whose members meet this week, 

as high prices hurt oil-consuming, and hence oil-producing, nations. Experts reckon 

that a $10 rise in the price of oil cuts more than 0.2% off growth in America 

and Europe.

<P>Any draining away of growth will come at a time when the strength of the biggest 

economies is ebbing. American consumers are still spending on cheap Jeeps and 

property, but the stock market is slipping ominously downwards. George Bush's 

America is attracting less foreign direct investment, and is likely to produce 

fewer patents than under Bill Clinton. The result is that the country is moving 

from economic miracle - 3% growth a year for a decade - to mirage in one presidency. 

If the US economy is spluttering, other economic superpowers are sinking. Europe 

is struggling to export goods, and consumers appear reluctant to spend. Japan, 

the land of falling prices and wages, appears incapable of reviving its own fortunes, 

let alone the world's. 

<P>Previous experience may not be enough to avert disaster, as no recession is 

the same as the last. Crises in the past have been marked by high inflation and 

low growth, but today the shadow of deflation is being cast. Too many airline 

seats, too much steel and too much unused airtime on telephones all point to a 

collapse in prices in these goods. Rising oil prices at first spark inflation, 

but end up being deflationary by reducing purchasing power. These two conditions 

could usher in a very different downturn - one which policymakers have not dealt 

with in Britain since the 1920s and in the US since the 1930s. The White House 

ought to be worrying about how to reflate the economy when its parlous state will 

have supplanted the war on terror in opinion polls. War will do more harm than 

good to the US economy, and it is foolish to suggest otherwise. The 1973 Arab-Israeli 

conflict, the Iranian revolution and the first Gulf war all punctured global growth. 

The last of these saw George Bush's father win a war and lose an election. If 

the president takes the battle to Iraq, he risks history repeating itself.
