<p> Thank you for that very gracious and warm Cincinnati welcome. I'm honored to be here tonight. I appreciate you all coming.</P> 







<P>Tonight I want to take a few minutes to discuss a grave threat to peace and America's determination to lead the world in confronting that threat.</P> 







<P>The threat comes from Iraq. It arises directly from the Iraqi regime's own actions, its history of aggression and its drive toward an arsenal of terror.</P> 







<BLOCKQUOTE>



<FONT COLOR="#990033"><B>Chris Toensing, editor of <I>Middle East Report</I>: “This might indicate that Iraq is actively threatening the peace in the region. There is no evidence whatsoever that Iraq is doing so, or has any intention of doing so. Other powers are actively disrupting the peace in the region: Israel is trying to crush Palestinian resistance to occupation with brute force, and the U.S. and Britain have bombed Iraq 46 times in 2002 when their aircraft are ‘targeted’ by Iraqi air defense systems in the bilaterally enforced no-fly zones. Most of our ‘friends’ in the region -- Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Jordan -- have strongly urged us not to go to war, and to tone down the war rhetoric.  Aren't they better positioned than we are to judge what threatens their safety?”</B></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>







<P>Eleven years ago, as a condition for ending the Persian Gulf War, the Iraqi regime was required to destroy its weapons of mass destruction, to cease all development of such weapons and to stop all support for terrorist groups.</P>

in 1988 (which the U.S. did not even contemplate at the time), it certainly is not

<P>It is seeking nuclear weapons.</P> 







<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR="#990033"><B>Susan Wright, co-author of <I>Biological Warfare and Disarmament: New Problems/New

  Perspectives</I>: &quot;How does Bush know this? It's as if the inspections

  have already been conducted and we know the outcome. We’re expected to accept the administration’s word for this without seeing any evidence.

  We have no way of judging the accuracy of these claims and the only way to do

  so is to hold inspections. The only country in the region that is known to

  possess a nuclear arsenal is Israel.&quot; [The Administration

  says that it does not know if Israel has nuclear weapons: <A HREF="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines02/0521-06.htm">



www.commondreams.org/headlines02/0521-06.htm</A>]</B></FONT>

  <p><font color="#990033"><b>Mahajan: &quot;There’s no evidence that Iraq has

  gotten anywhere with seeking nuclear weapons. The pitiful status of evidence

  in this regards is shown by claims in e.g. Blair’s dossier that Iraq is

  seeking uranium from Africa, year and country unspecified. South Africa is, of

  course, the only country in the continent that has potentially the capacity

  for enrichment of uranium to bomb quality, and claims not to have supplied

  Iraq with uranium. Unenriched uranium does Iraq little good, since enrichment

  facilities are large, require huge investment, and cannot easily be hidden.&quot;</b></font></p>

</BLOCKQUOTE>







<P>It has given shelter and support to terrorism and practices terror against its own people.</P>







<P>The entire world has witnessed Iraq's 11-year history of defiance, deception, and bad faith.</P> 







<P>We also must never forget the most vivid events of recent history. On September 11, 2001, America felt its vulnerability -- even to threats that gather on the other side of the earth. We resolved then, and we are resolved today, to confront every threat, from any source, that could bring sudden terror and suffering to America. </P>







<P>Members of the Congress of both political parties, and members of the United Nations Security Council, agree that Saddam Hussein is a threat to peace and must disarm. We agree that the Iraqi dictator must not be permitted to threaten America and the world with horrible poisons, and diseases, and gases, and atomic weapons.</P> 







<BLOCKQUOTE><font color="#990033"><b>Toensing: &quot;Only two members of the U.N.

  Security Council would appear to agree with the idea that Iraq threatens, or will threaten,

  'America and the world' with Weapons of Mass Destruction, making the next sentence disingenuous at

  best.&quot;</b></font></BLOCKQUOTE> 







<P>Since we all agree on this goal, the issue is: How can we best achieve it?</P> 







<P>Many Americans have raised legitimate questions: About the nature of the threat. About the urgency of action -- and why be concerned now? About the link between Iraq developing weapons of terror, and the wider war on terror.</P> 







<P>These are all issues we have discussed broadly and fully within my administration. And tonight, I want to share those discussions with you.</P> 







<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR="#990033"><B>Toensing: &quot;Bush may have shared the discussion, but he did not share the evidence, saying, like the British dossier and CIA reports, that intelligence has established the threat. But Americans apparently will not be seeing

  it.&quot;</B></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>







<P>First, some ask why Iraq is different from other countries or regimes that also have terrible weapons. While there are many dangers in the world, the threat from Iraq stands alone -- because it gathers the most serious dangers of our age in one place.</P> 







<P>Iraq's weapons of mass destruction are controlled by a murderous tyrant, who has already used chemical weapons to kill thousands of people. This same tyrant has tried to dominate the Middle East, has invaded and brutally occupied a small neighbor, has struck other nations without warning, and holds an unrelenting hostility towards the United States.</P>







<BLOCKQUOTE>

  <p><FONT COLOR="#990033"><B>Stephen Zunes, author of <I>Tinderbox: U.S.

  Middle East Policy and the Roots of Terrorism</I> and associate professor of

  politics at the University of San Francisco: &quot;The hostility toward the

  United States is a direct consequence of U.S. hostility toward Iraq. Iraq was

  quite unhostile to the United States when it was receiving support from the

  United States during the 1980s. The answer is certainly not to appease Iraq's

  tyrannical regime, as was done in the past. However, to imply this hostility

  is unrelated to the U.S. destruction of much of Iraq's civilian infrastructure

  and other actions during the Gulf War which went far beyond what was necessary

  to rid Iraqi forces from Kuwait and the U.S.-led sanctions and its impact upon

  the civilian population is very misleading.&quot;</B></FONT>

  </p>

  <p><font color="#990033"><b>AbuKhalil: &quot;If Bush wants to punish nations

  that 'tried to dominate the Middle East, has invaded and brutally occupied a

  small neighbor, has struck other nations without warning' then he would have

  to punish Israel for an occupation of Palestinian lands that lasted far longer

  than the now famous (yet brief) Iraqi occupation of Kuwait. Of course,

  Iraq did attack Iran and Kuwait, and Israel in the span of 30 years has attacked Egypt, Iraq, Tunisia, Lebanon, Syria, Egypt, Jordan, not to mention

  Palestine, and not to mention a civilian Libyan airliner that was downed by

  Israeli forces in 1973.&quot;&nbsp;</b></font></p>

</BLOCKQUOTE>







<P>By its past and present actions, by its technological capabilities, by the merciless nature of its regime, Iraq is unique.</P>







<P>As a former chief weapons inspector for the U.N. has said, "The fundamental problem with Iraq remains the nature of the regime itself: Saddam Hussein is a homicidal dictator who is addicted to weapons of mass destruction."</P>







<P>Some ask how urgent this danger is to America and the world. The danger is already significant, and it only grows worse with time. If we know Saddam Hussein has dangerous weapons today -- and we do

--&nbsp; does it make any sense for the world to wait to confront him as he grows even stronger and develops even more dangerous weapons?</P>







<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR="#990033"><B>Zunes: &quot;He was far more dangerous in

  the 1980s when the U.S. was supporting him. It will take many years, assuming

  military sanctions continue in effect, before he comes close to the strength

  he was then. If U.N. inspectors are allowed to return, it would be impossible

  -- even if they don't find 100 percent of everything -- to get much stronger

  than he is today.&quot;</B></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>







<P>In 1995, after several years of deceit by the Iraqi regime, the head of Iraq's military industries defected. It was then that the regime was forced to admit that it had produced more than 30,000 liters of anthrax and other deadly biological agents. The inspectors, however, concluded that Iraq had likely produced two to four times that amount. </P>







<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR="#990033"><B>Zunes: &quot;If this is really a concern,

  then why did the United States supply Iraq with the seed stock of anthrax

  spores back in the 1980s?&quot; [William Blum, &quot;Anthrax for Export: U.S.

  Companies Sold Iraq the Ingredients for a Witch's Brew,&quot; <I>The Progressive</I>,

  April 1998, p. 18]</B></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>







<P>This is a massive stockpile of biological weapons that has never been accounted for, and is capable of killing millions. </P>







<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR="#990033"><B>Zunes: &quot;This is like saying that a man

  is capable of making millions of women pregnant.  It's a matter of delivery systems, of which there is no proof that Iraq currently has.&quot;</B></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>







<P>We know that the regime has produced thousands of tons of chemical agents, including mustard gas, sarin nerve gas, and VX nerve gas. Saddam Hussein also has experience in using chemical weapons. He has ordered chemical attacks on Iran, and on more than forty villages in his own country. These actions killed or injured at least 20,000 people, more than six times the number of people who died in the attacks of September 11.</P> 







<BLOCKQUOTE><font color="#990033"><b>Mahajan: &quot;All of this was done with

  the full support, approval, and connivance of the U.S. government.

  U.S.-supplied 'agricultural credits' helped fund the sustained

  counterinsurgency campaign in northern Iraq; the United States supplied

  military intelligence to Iraq for use against Iran even when it knew Iraq was

  using chemical weapons in the war; and the United States ran diplomatic

  interference for Iraq at the U.N.&quot;</b></font>

  <p><FONT COLOR="#990033"><B>Toensing: &quot;The U.S. restored diplomatic relations with Iraq in 1984, while it was in the midst of fighting the first of these

  wars of aggression, because the U.S. wanted to contain the Islamic Revolution in Iran. The

  U.S. and Britain tilted toward Iraq throughout the war, and U.S. allies in the region, chief among them Saudi Arabia, bankrolled the Iraqi war effort. The

  U.S. was still trying to become closer to Iraq when it invaded

  Kuwait.&quot;</B></FONT></p>

</BLOCKQUOTE>







<BLOCKQUOTE>

  <p><FONT COLOR="#990033"><B>Zunes: &quot;He attacked Iranian troops because he

  knew Iran had no allies that would defend it. And we now know that officials

  from the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency assisted Iraq in targeting Iranian

  forces in the full knowledge that they were using chemical weapons. Saddam

  used chemical weapons against Kurdish civilians because he knew they couldn't

  fight back.&nbsp; And the U.S. helped cover up the Halabja massacre and other

  assaults by falsely claiming the Iranians were responsible. In other words,

  Saddam is a coward. He will use WMDs when he knows he won't have to suffer the

  consequences, especially when the world's most powerful country is supporting

  him.&quot;</B></FONT></p>

</BLOCKQUOTE>







<P>And surveillance photos reveal that the regime is rebuilding facilities that it has used to produce chemical and biological weapons.</P>







<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR="#990033"><B>Toensing: &quot;That it 'has used.' The last time Bush made a big deal of this, he claimed that Iraq was again using the facilities in this way, an assertion which the

  <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines02/0927-08.htm"> IAEA promptly rebutted as

  unverifiable</a>. It still is

  unverifiable.&quot;</B></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE> 







<P>Every chemical and biological weapon that Iraq has or makes is a direct violation of the truce that ended the Persian Gulf War in 1991.</P>







<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR="#990033"><B>Mahajan: &quot;There are no credible

  allegations that Iraq produced chemical or biological agents while inspectors

  were in the country, until December 1998. The reason we don't know whether

  they are producing those agents or not since then <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/middle_east/2161552.stm"> is that inspectors were

  withdrawn at the U.S. behest</a> preparatory to the Desert Fox bombing campaign.&quot;</B></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>







<P>Yet Saddam Hussein has chosen to build and keep these weapons, despite international sanctions, U.N. demands, and isolation from the civilized world.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>







<P>Iraq possesses ballistic missiles with a likely range of hundreds of miles -- far enough to strike Saudi Arabia, Israel, Turkey, and other nations -- in a region where more than 135,000 American civilians and service members live and work.</P> 







<BLOCKQUOTE><font color="#990033"><b>Toensing: &quot;This is a neat rhetorical trick. Bush knows that

  <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;u=/nm/20021004/wl_nm/iraq_usa_turkey_dc_3"> Turkey</a>

  and Saudi Arabia themselves do not feel under threat from Iraq's WMD, so he doesn't claim that. Rather, it's the threat to

  U.S.servicemen and oil company employees based in those countries which should concern us. The questions 



left unasked are why Iraq would attack Americans, knowing the massive 



response that would incur, and of course why so many American troops 'live 



and work' in Turkey and Saudi Arabia. They're partly there in forward deployment against

  Iraq.&quot;</b></font></BLOCKQUOTE>







<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR="#990033"><B>Zunes: &quot;According to UNSCOM, 817 of Iraq's 819 Soviet-build ballistic missiles have been

  accounted for and destroyed.  They may possess up to a couple of dozen home-made versions, but none of these have been tested and it is questionable whether they have any functional launchers.&quot; </B></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>







<P>We've also discovered through intelligence that Iraq has a growing fleet of manned and unmanned aerial vehicles that could be used to disperse chemical and biological weapons across broad areas. We are concerned that Iraq is exploring ways of using UAVs for missions targeting the United States.</P> 







<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR="#990033"><B>Toensing: &quot;Other intelligence experts have disputed that UAVs are a threat, because the agents they released might disperse to basically harmless levels by the time they reached the ground if the UAV was trying to cover such a broad

  area.&quot;</B></FONT>

  <p><font color="#990033"><b>Mahajan: &quot;The claim that these UAVs have

  ranges that would enable attacking the United States, and that they could

  reach it undetected, is a startlingly new one, and entirely untenable. No one

  has ever produced evidence of Iraqi capability or intent to target the United

  States directly.&quot;</b></font></p>

</BLOCKQUOTE>







<P>And, of course, sophisticated delivery systems are not required for a chemical or biological attack -- all that might be required are a small container and one terrorist or Iraqi intelligence operative to deliver it.</P> 







<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR="#990033"><B>Mahajan: &quot;Bioterrorist attacks and

  delivery of biological agents aren’t that easy -- the very limited effects

  of the anthrax attacks showed that. In fact, the loss of life in the anthrax

  attacks occurred mostly among the postal workers who were not issued

  antibiotics, and not among the congressional staff who were. As for chemical

  attacks with 'a small container and one terrorist,' they would be severely

  limited in effect.&quot;</B></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>







<P>And that is the source of our urgent concern about Saddam Hussein's links to international terrorist groups.</P> 







<P>Over the years, Iraq has provided safe haven to terrorists such as Abu Nidal, whose terror organization carried out more than ninety terrorist attacks in twenty countries that killed or injured nearly 900 people, including 12 Americans.</P> 







<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR="#990033"><B>Michael Ratner is president of the Center

  for Constitutional Rights: &quot;Although U.S.intelligence

  agencies have not found a relationship between Saddam Hussein and al Qaeda,

  Bush mentions one, but no evidence is shown. Likewise he tries to frighten

  Americans by talking about the crimes of Abu Nidal, but Abu Nidal is dead.

  Again it is an attempt to create fear by association with something from the

  past, not evidence of a current threat.&quot;</B></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>







<P>Iraq has also provided safe haven to Abu Abbas, who was responsible for seizing the Achille Lauro and killing an American passenger. And we know that Iraq is continuing to finance terror, and gives assistance to groups that use terrorism to undermine Middle East peace.</P> 







<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR="#990033"><B>Toensing: &quot; Yes, but neither of these groups is ideologically anti-American. Their attacks are aimed at Israel and Israeli interests, including the killing of Leon Klinghoffer and other Americans. This is a crucial piece of

  context.&quot;</B></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE> 







<P>We know that Iraq and the al Qaeda terrorist network share a common enemy -- the United States of America. We know that Iraq and al Qaeda have had high-level contacts that go back a decade. Some al Qaeda leaders who fled Afghanistan went to Iraq.</P> 







<P>These include one very senior al Qaeda leader who received medical treatment in Baghdad this year, and who has been associated with planning for chemical and biological attacks. We have learned that Iraq has trained al Qaeda members in bomb making, poisons, and deadly gases.</P>







<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR="#990033"><B>Jennings:&nbsp; &quot;The claim that al-Qaeda

  is in Iraq is disingenuous, if not an outright lie. Yes, the U.S.has known for

  some time that up to 400 al-Qaeda-type Muslim extremists, the Ansar al-Ialam,

  formerly 'Jund al-Islam,' a splinter of the Iranian-backed Islamic Unity

  Movement of Kurdistan, were operating inside the Kurdish security zone set up

  under U.S.protection in the North of Iraq. For some reason this was kept quiet

  and has not been much reported in the mainstream media. Finally last Spring

  the Kurds themselves attacked and killed most of the terrorists in their

  territory, sending the rest fleeing for their lives across the border into

  Iran. Since this area was under U.S. protection, and not under Saddam Hussein's

  rule, it's pretty hard to claim that al-Qaeda operates in Iraq.&quot;</B></FONT>

  <p><font color="#990033"><b>Mahajan: &quot;Al-Qaeda has carried out no

  chemical or biological attacks. The anthrax attacks in the fall of 2001 were

  almost certainly from a U.S. government employee.&nbsp; It’s hard to know

  what, if anything, to make of claims that one “senior al Qaeda leader” got

  medical treatment in Baghdad. Giving medical treatment, even to criminals, is

  not illegal, and with so little evidence given to us, there’s no reason to

  suppose this isn’t another story like the one about a meeting between

  Mohammed Atta and Iraqi intelligence in Prague (now discredited).&quot;</b></font></p>

</BLOCKQUOTE> 







<P>And we know that after September 11, Saddam Hussein's regime gleefully celebrated the terrorist attacks on America. Iraq could decide on any given day to provide a biological or chemical weapon to a terrorist group or individual terrorists.

Alliances with terrorists could allow the Iraqi regime to attack America without leaving any fingerprints.</P> 







<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR="#990033"><B>Mahajan: &quot;Biological or chemical

  weapons would undoubtedly leave fingerprints, just as the anthrax attacks in

  the fall did. Even if Iraq couldn't be conclusively shown to be the source of

  such materials, the U.S. government would assume Iraq was the source. Iraq has

  been under the gun ever since the Gulf War, and can't possibly assume that it

  could get away with such an attack. Moreover, Saddam has traditionally seen

  WMD as his ace in the hole, protecting him from defeat. Paranoid dictators do

  not give control of something they see as the foundation of their security

  into the hands of networks, like al-Qaeda, which they can't control.&quot;</B></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE> 







<P>Some have argued that confronting the threat from Iraq could detract from the war against terror. To the contrary, confronting the threat posed by Iraq is crucial to winning the war on terror.</P>







<P>When I spoke to the Congress more than a year ago, I said that those who harbor terrorists are as guilty as the terrorists themselves. Saddam Hussein is harboring terrorists and the instruments of terror, the instruments of mass death and destruction. And he cannot be trusted. The risk is simply too great that he will use them, or provide them to a terror network.</P> 







<P>Terror cells, and outlaw regimes building weapons of mass destruction, are different faces of the same evil. Our security requires that we confront both. And the United States military is capable of confronting both.</P> 







<P>Many people have asked how close Saddam Hussein is to developing a nuclear weapon. We don't know exactly, and that is the problem. Before the Gulf War, the best intelligence indicated that Iraq was eight to 10 years away from developing a nuclear weapon; after the war, international inspectors learned that the regime had been much closer. The regime in Iraq would likely have possessed a nuclear weapon no later than 1993.</P> 







<P>The inspectors discovered that Iraq had an advanced nuclear weapons development program, had a design for a workable nuclear weapon, and was pursuing several different methods of enriching uranium for a bomb.</P>







<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR="#990033"><B>Toensing: &quot;Yes, inspectors learned all of

  this -- the inspections worked.&quot;</B></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE> 







<P>Before being barred from Iraq in 1998, the International Atomic Energy Agency dismantled extensive nuclear weapons-related facilities, including three uranium-enrichment sites.</P> 







<BLOCKQUOTE><font color="#990033"><b>Robert Jensen, author of <I>Writing  Dissent</I> and an associate professor at the University of Texas at Austin: &quot;Bush at least acknowledged

  that we know little about Saddam's nuclear capability, <a href="http://www.fair.org/activism/usat-iraq.html">but

  he lied about why</a>. Bush claimed that Iraq barred the inspectors of the

  International Atomic Energy Agency in 1998. <a href="http://www.iaea.org/worldatom/Programmes/ActionTeam/faqs.html#status">In

  fact, the inspectors, along with those from the U.N. Special Commission, were

  withdrawn by their agencies</a> -- not expelled by Iraq -- in December 1998

  when it became clear the Clinton administration was going to bomb Iraq (as it

  did) and the safety of the inspectors couldn't be guaranteed. The inspectors <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/iraq/stories/unscom010899.htm">also

  spied for the United States</a>, in violation of their mandate.&quot;</b></font></BLOCKQUOTE>







<P>That same year, information from a high-ranking Iraqi nuclear engineer who had defected, revealed that despite his public promises, Saddam Hussein had ordered his nuclear program to continue. The evidence indicates that Iraq is reconstituting its nuclear weapons program.</P> 







<P>Saddam Hussein has held numerous meetings with Iraqi nuclear scientists, a group he calls his "nuclear mujahedeen" -- his nuclear holy warriors.</P> 







<P>Satellite photographs reveal that Iraq is rebuilding facilities at sites that have been part of its nuclear program in the past.</P> 







<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR="#990033"><B>Toensing: &quot;As Lincoln Chafee said on NPR, if these satellite photos exist, then surely the public has a right to see them. Surely mere photos would not compromise sources and

  methods.&quot; [In 1990, after Iraq invaded Kuwait, the U.S. government

  claimed that Iraqi troops were threatening Saudi Arabia; <a href="http://www.projectcensored.org/stories/c1991.htm#6">this

  turned out to be false</a>.]</B></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE> 







<P>Iraq has attempted to purchase high-strength aluminum tubes and other equipment needed for gas centrifuges, which are used to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons.</P> 







<BLOCKQUOTE><font color="#990033"><b>Mahajan: &quot;The aluminum tubes can also be used in

  conventional artillery, which Iraq is allowed to have. In the past, when Iraq

  tried to build such centrifuges, they used steel tubes. This is an incredibly

  weak indicator.&quot;</span></b></font></BLOCKQUOTE> 







<P>If the Iraqi regime is able to produce, buy, or steal an amount of highly-enriched uranium a little larger than a single softball, it could have a nuclear weapon in less than a year.</P> 







<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR="#990033"><B>Toensing: &quot;Both the CIA report and the British dossier say that this is very unlikely as long as Iraq remains under

  sanctions.&quot;</B></FONT>

  <p><font color="#990033"><b>Mahajan: &quot;This means only that it has the

  technological know-how to create the high-explosive 'lenses' necessary to set

  off the appropriate nuclear chain reaction. As long as it retains its

  scientists, this will remain the case.&quot;</b></font></p>

</BLOCKQUOTE>  







<P>And if we allow that to happen, a terrible line would be crossed. Saddam Hussein would be in a position to blackmail anyone who opposes his aggression.

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR="#990033"><B>Mahajan: &quot;Again, such an act is not at

  all consonant with the history or the mindset of Saddam Hussein. One

  organization hosted by the Iraqi government, which is classified as terrorist

  by the State Department, is the Iranian Mujahedin-I-Khalq, whose activities

  are directed against the current government of Iran. They have never had

  access to any nonconventional resources from the Government of Iraq. Saddam

  Hussein sees the radical Islamist terrorist networks like al-Qaeda as a huge

  potential threat to his own rule, something that concerns him far more than

  any unrealistic ideas of revenge against the United States. Anything that

  could allow al-Qaeda (which, in its turn, is likely more concerned with

  replacing regimes in the Middle East with new radical Islamist regimes) to

  blackmail him would be the last thing he would give them.&quot;</B></FONT>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR="#990033"><B>Jacqueline Cabasso, Executive Director of

  the Western States Legal Foundation: &quot;The hypocrisy in this speech -- and

  in the Bush Administration’s overall national security strategy -- is

  monumental. If having weapons of mass destruction and a history of using them

  is a criteria, then surely the United States must pose the greatest threat to

  humanity that has ever existed. While Bush warns that 'we cannot wait for the

  final proof.... the smoking gun that could come in the form of a mushroom

  cloud,' his September 2002 National Security Strategy states that 'America

  will act against...emerging threats before they are fully formed....by acting

  preemptively.' And his top-secret <i>Nuclear Posture Review</i>, leaked to the

  <i>New York Times </i>earlier this year, reveals that 'U.S. nuclear forces

  will continue to provide assurance.... in the event of surprising military

  developments....Current examples of immediate contingencies include an Iraqi

  attack on Israel or its neighbors....' It doesn’t take a lot of

  imagination to predict that if Iraq is attacked by the U.S. it might launch

  whatever it has at Israel -- itself a nuclear power. Further, while the U.S.

  is massively expanding its biological weapons research capabilities ­ for

  example by upgrading its bioresearch facilities at the Livermore and Los

  Alamos Nuclear weapons labs to aerosolize live anthrax and genetically modify

  bioorganisms ­ it is blocking a protocol to the Biological Weapons Convention

  that would allow international inspectors into U.S. facilities. The Bush

  Administration’s unilateral headlong rush to war threatens to unleash

  unprecedented regional instability and potentially catastrophic loss of life.

  It’s hard to image a more self-destructive course of action.&quot;</B></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>  







<P>Understanding the threats of our time, knowing the designs and deceptions of the Iraqi regime, we have every reason to assume the worst, and we have an urgent duty to prevent the worst from occurring.</P> 







<P>Some believe we can address this danger by simply resuming the old approach to inspections, and applying diplomatic and economic pressure. Yet this is precisely what the world has tried to do since 1991.</P> 







<P>The U.N. inspections program was met with systematic deception. The Iraqi regime bugged hotel rooms and offices of inspectors to find where they were going next. They forged documents, destroyed evidence, and developed mobile weapons facilities to keep a step ahead of inspectors.</P> 







<P>Eight so-called presidential palaces were declared off-limits to unfettered inspections. These sites actually encompass 12 square miles, with hundreds of structures, both above and below the ground, where sensitive materials could be hidden.</P>

<P>I hope this will not require military action, but it may. And military conflict could be difficult. An Iraqi regime faced with its own demise may attempt cruel and desperate measures. If Saddam Hussein orders such measures, his generals would be well advised to refuse those orders. If they do not refuse, they must understand that all war criminals will be pursued and punished.</P> 







<P>If we have to act, we will take every precaution that is possible. We will plan carefully, we will act with the full power of the United States military, we will act with allies at our side, and we will prevail. </P>







<P>There is no easy or risk-free course of action. Some have argued we should wait -- and that is an option.

  <I>Iraq Under Siege</I>: &quot;But the people of Iraq have good reason to feel otherwise. As Nicholas Kristof of the <I>New York Times</I> noted

  <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views02/1004-01.htm"> in his October 4 report from

  Baghdad</a>, 'while ordinary Iraqis were very friendly toward me, they were enraged at the U.S. after 11 years of economic sanctions.... Worse,

  <a href="http://www.progressive.org/0801issue/nagy0901.html"> U.S. bombing of water treatment

  plants</a>, difficulties importing purification chemicals like chlorine (which can be used for weapons), and shortages of medicines led to a more than doubling of infant mortality, according to the U.N. Food and Agriculture

  Organization.'

  Another war on Iraq -- this time, a 'pre-emptive' attack aimed at 'regime

  change' -- will lead to more civilian casualties and damage to Iraq's infrastructure. And Iraqis are right to worry that the regime Washington installs, in violation of their right to self-determination, will be one that serves U.S. interests, not their own.







We should recall the impact of the last war. In the words of Gulf War veteran Anthony Swofford, a former Marine corporal, writing in the New York Times, October 2,

  'From the ground, I witnessed the savage results of American air superiority: tanks and troop carriers turned upside down and ripped inside out; rotten, burned, half-buried bodies littering the desert like the detritus of years -- not weeks -- of

  combat.'

  U.S.hegemony in the Middle East.&quot;</B></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
