<p>For President Bush to pretend to be shocked that some of the nation's top executives 

deal from a stacked deck is akin to a madam feigning surprise that sexual favors 

have been sold in her establishment. Dubya may have gaps in his education, but 

ignorance of "aggressive accounting" techniques and other scams they don't teach 

in Biz 101 is not one of them.

<P>Not only was the prez and ex-businessman himself a pro at milking failed corporations 

he made look good on paper, but too many family members, friends and members of 

his administration have been implicated in scandals of the sort he now condemns. 

For Bush to argue that the unraveling of corporate America is the work of a "few 

bad apples" is a dangerous line of reasoning for him because an embarrassing number 

of those apples have fallen very close to the tree of his presidency.

<P>For example, the troubles of Vice President Dick Cheney are just beginning; 

the dubious accounting practices initiated at Halliburton when he was CEO are 

now the focus of a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation. The SEC is 

forced to investigate this and other potential business outrages despite the extreme 

reluctance of its chairman, Harvey L. Pitt--who was selected for the job by George 

W. himself after a career as a top lobbyist for stock brokers and accounting firms 

that opposed tough SEC regulation. Cheney has also steadfastly refused to turn 

over the names of energy corporation officials, including Enron executives, who 

guided him in the secret meetings in which Bush's energy plan was crafted. Bush 

still seems not the least embarrassed that Enron's chairman, Kenneth Lay, was 

a personal friend and the largest contributor to his presidential campaign.

<P>Enron alums remain safely ensconced at the top of the Bush administration. 

Special prosecutor, anyone? Clearly, the antics of the Texas crowd make the petty 

shenanigans of the Clintons and those Arkansas boys look like the work of small-time 

hustlers.

<P>When the president once referred to himself as the black sheep of the Bush 

family, it was a joshing, self-congratulatory admission that he was even more 

rascally than the rest. That ever-charming "what me worry'' quality stood him 

in good stead as he ran through the money of numerous family friends who invested 

in a long string of his losing ventures.

<P>George W. was saved from repeated financial disaster by one merger after another, 

business maneuvers that made no economic sense to the new partner beyond the acquisition 

of the presumed clout of the son of a Central Intelligence Agency chief turned 

vice president turned president.

<P>The final such deal was with Harken Energy, a firm that bailed out Bush's Spectrum 

7 Energy Corp., which owed the banks $2 million. Bush's political connections 

appeared to pay off when Harken, which had zero experience drilling in water, 

suddenly won a contract with the Persian Gulf sheikdom of Bahrain for offshore 

oil exploration, which in turn boosted Harken's stock.

<P>However, the company failed to find oil in Bahrain, and insiders like Bush 

knew that banks were refusing to continue to carry Harken's considerable debt.

<P>Bush cashed out for nearly $850,000 before the company reported a $22-million 

loss and the stock lost 75% of its value.

<P>Bush, who failed to properly report the transaction to the SEC until eight 

months after the deadline, was on the audit committee of Harken's board of directors 

but denied knowing of the upcoming negative quarterly report. He also claimed 

ignorance of a shell game in which Harken insiders purchased one of the company's 

major subsidiaries with money provided by Harken, fabricating a $10-million profit.

<P>In the end, Bush was spared the fate of some other free-wheeling financial 

hustlers--insider trading charges--by a compliant SEC. It certainly couldn't have 

hurt that the SEC's then-chairman was appointed by Bush's father and that the 

SEC general counsel had been Dubya's own lawyer in 1989.

<P>How can Bush now, with a straight face, tell the nation that he will order 

the SEC to brand as criminals those guilty of the same sorts of actions? As a 

matter of consistency, he should in the very least demand that Martha Stewart, 

a comparative innocent when judged by Bush family standards, be treated no more 

harshly than he was. 

<P>Indeed, if justice were consistent, Stewart, and perhaps even Lay, might be 

planning a run for the presidency.
