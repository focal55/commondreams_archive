<p>And just when you thought it couldn't get any more Orwellian, Henry Kissinger 

is named chairman of the "independent" commission investigating the Sept. 11 terrorist 

attacks.

<p> What's next? Pete Rose being named chairman of a blue ribbon committee to 

investigate gambling in professional sports? Or how about Oliver North being appointed 

as head of a federal probe into the illegal arms trade?

<p> At this point, I wouldn't be surprised if the Bush administration appointed 

O.J. Simpson chairman of a new national task force on domestic violence, given 

No. 43's post-9/11 concern for women's lib, especially in Afghanistan and Saudi 

Arabia. (The Marines are now fighting the feminist cause?)

<p> My mother used to tell me: "Sean, sometimes perception is everything." I'm 

sure former Securities Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey Pitt can relate.

<p> Pitt resigned his chairmanship last month, realizing that with his record 

of meeting with the heads of companies under SEC investigation and with his close 

ties to the accounting industry at a time when the SEC is supposed to be cracking 

down on corporate accounting fraud, it was best that he step aside.

<p> In a letter to President Bush, Pitt said he was resigning because of the "the 

turmoil surrounding my chairmanship... . Rather than be a burden to you or the 

agency, I feel it is in everyone's best interest if I step aside now to allow 

the agency to continue the important efforts we have started."

<p> Will Kissinger follow suit? Even though his international consulting firm 

client list has not been made public, "reports have been widely circulated that 

it includes Persian Gulf states, oil companies, and transportation firms," the 

Boston Globe reported.

<p> The Globe also reported National Security Archive founder and former staff 

member of the Senate Watergate committee Scott Armstrong's reaction to Kissinger's 

appointment. "He laughed for a solid minute." 

<p> Perhaps Armstrong was laughing to keep from crying. Kissinger "has so many 

clients whose interests are so completely tied up in the results of this investigation," 

Armstrong told the Globe. "The minute you start talking about clerics in Saudi 

Arabia, it's in no way in the interests of his clients for the whole truth to 

be told."

<p> Anyone with even slightest political consciousness knows of the shady dealings 

Kissinger is alleged to have been involved with. But in case you are not familiar 

with some of the lowlights, you ought to read Christopher Hitchens book "The Trial 

of Henry Kissinger."

<p> In it, you'll read about the esteemed statesman's connection to the bombing 

of Cambodia and about his role in helping to set the stage for the 1973 coup in 

Chile that brought Pinochet to power.

<p> Armstrong also told the Globe that when Kissinger left his government post 

in 1976, he took thousands of State Department documents to help him write his 

memoirs. Kissinger has yet to return them.

<p> Kissinger, Armstrong said, is "a man with a private sense of history. He does 

not have a credible approach to assuring the public that he's interested in getting 

to the bottom of things or that we will do so through an open process."

<p> President Bush urged Kissinger's commission to "follow the facts wherever 

they may lead." One thing the panel ought to get to the bottom of is the reports 

of two employees of the instant messenger service firm Odigo, which has offices 

in Israel and the World Trade Center (before the plane bombings), having received 

warnings of the pending attack hours before it happened.

<p> In the weeks following the attacks, one of Israel's leading daily's, Ha'aretz, 

quoted Odigo CEO Micha Macover as saying "two workers received the messages predicting 

the attack would happen."

<p> And Odigo vice president of sales and marketing, Alex Diamandis, told Newsbytes 

reporter Brian McWilliams that Odigo workers in New York were warned prior to 

the attack but that the message did not identify the World Trade Center as the 

target.

<p> According to Computerworld reporter George A. Chidi Jr., Odigo officials have 

been cooperating with the FBI in investigating exactly what transpired. Don't 

you think it's important to know if, in fact, Odigo employees had better intelligence 

than the FBI and CIA?

<p> Frankly, I'd like to see Kissinger go before the International Criminal Court. 

Oh yeah, the Bush administration doesn't recognize that court as a legitimate 

authority. 

<p> But even if Kissinger is never put in the dock, I'd feel a lot better if he 

weren't the chairman of the 9-11 investigation commission, but instead devoted 

the rest of his public life to performing deep voice duets with Barry White or 

being cast as the voice of cartoon characters in Disney animated movies.
