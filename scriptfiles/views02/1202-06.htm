<p> Clarence Moriwaki sees something all too familiar in the words used in the 

War on Terrorism. 

<p> "They call them detainees, instead of prisoners," the Bainbridge Island man 

says of about 1,200 people rounded up after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. "It's 

the same kind of Orwellian doublespeak that they used during World War II." 

<p> Moriwaki and Mary Woodward fretted recently over coffee after showing me the 

island's old Eagledale Ferry Dock site. There a small marker commemorates the 

227 people of Japanese descent, most of them American citizens, who were rounded 

up March 30, 1942, and taken from this idyllic island to the Manzanar internment 

camp in the desolate Mojave Desert. These were the very first of some 120,000 

Americans who would lose their freedom in unconstitutional imprisonment lasting 

up to three years. 

<p> "They called them evacuees," said Woodward, whose parents published the Bainbridge 

Island Review, one of the few newspapers in the nation to consistently criticize 

the government action. "You evacuate a burning building. These people were taken 

prisoner." 

<p> Moriwaki and Woodward hope the Bainbridge story might help to remind our nation's 

leaders of the risks of curtailing civil liberties. Within days of passing the 

Homeland Security Act, Congress also approved a bill that directs the Interior 

Department to study whether to establish the Eagledale Ferry Dock site under the 

National Park Service. The Bainbridge committee has artist renderings of a larger 

memorial keyed around its central message, <i>Nidoto nai yoni</i>. "Let it not 

happen again." 

<p> The bill's sponsor, U.S. Rep. Jay Inslee, D-Bainbridge Island, acknowledges 

a lesson in its success. "It's the perfect moment, because the kinds of fear and 

stress that gave rise to (the internments) in 1942 are the same that we're seeing 

now." 

<p> Granted, most "detainees" rounded up after 9/11 <i>reportedly</i> are not 

American citizens, as most of the World War II prisoners were. Many were illegally 

in this country and <i>reportedly </i>have been deported. I emphasize "reportedly," 

because no one can be sure. The federal government has refused to give any information 

on these detainees and has sought to close immigration hearings and move other 

proceedings from the court system to military tribunals where they can keep the 

curtains closed. 

<p> That gives Lucy Dalglish, executive director of the Reporters Committee for 

Freedom of the Press, fits. "Not to say that some of these people shouldn't be 

kicked out of the country," she says, "but there needs to be some sort of way 

for the public to know what the government is doing." 

<p> For sure, these are uncertain, scary times that require smarter ways to flush 

out and apprehend enemies. But what scares me as much as the threat of a terrorist 

attack is the threat to civil liberties, citizen privacy and public access to 

government. 

<p> Astonishingly, President Bush has put a convicted felon in charge of the Department 

of Defense's Total Information Awareness program. Former National Security Advisor 

John Poindexter, who masterminded the Iran-Contra scandal and was saved from a 

prison sentence for his five convictions because of a technicality, proposes to 

combine databases to track the dealings of American residents, citizens and otherwise, 

with no warrants necessary. 

<p> And you thought your grocery-store savings card was innocuous, right? 

<p> How are we supposed to trust the government won't overstep its bounds with 

a convicted liar in charge? 

<p> Can Congress trust Poindexter? Can Congress protect us? Can we trust Congress? 

<p> Before the Homeland Security Act vote in the House, Inslee entered into the 

record a statement trying to clarify that the act was not an endorsement of Poindexter's 

plan. He had proposed a bipartisan colloquy, which would have carried more weight, 

but Republican leadership refused. 

<p> A feisty, inquisitive press is one way that citizens have been able to keep 

tabs on their government and hold officials accountable. The press' watchdog role 

has never been more important, but its abilities are being curtailed. Even before 

the 9/11 attacks, Bush was buttoning down access to government. Under the Clinton 

administration, the standard for responding to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) 

requests was to disclose unless there was a good reason not to. Under Attorney 

General John Ashcroft, the bent was shifted to require a good reason to disclose. 

The new Homeland Security Act limits FOIA access even further. 

<p> Dalglish is alarmed at the changes. "I'm afraid there's going to have to be 

some really egregious behavior before Congress is going to catch on." 

<p> That's something Clarence Moriwaki, Mary Woodward and I are worried about, 

too. 

<p> Citizens need to be able to look under the skirts of their government, not 

the other way around.
