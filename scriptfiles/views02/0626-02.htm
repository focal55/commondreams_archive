<p>LAST WEEK, a friend mused: 

<P>"Can you imagine Martha Stewart in federal prison?" 

<P>As a matter of fact I can. 

<P>And I imagine her living as beautifully and tastefully behind bars as any human 

being could. 

<P>I say this not because I am one of the lifestyle queen's millions of fans. 

I do not subscribe to Martha's magazines, read her newspaper column, watch her 

TV show, buy her home fashions at Kmart or own any of the books she's written, 

such as "Favorite Comfort Foods" and "Crafts and Keepsakes for the Holidays." 

<P>I do, however, sometimes catch Martha's daily radio spot. Once, she devoted 

it to step-by-step instructions on how to properly winterize and store your power 

mower. The process involved draining gasoline, dismantling parts and hanging the 

motor, if possible, on a wall in your garage or tool shed. From that day on, there 

was nothing I couldn't imagine the plucky, resourceful Martha Stewart doing. 

<P>Thus, if investigators for the House Energy and Commerce Committee find out 

that Martha really did have inside information when she sold about 4,000 shares 

of ImClone stock to escape financial disaster, this is what I imagine: Hello and 

welcome to "Martha Stewart's Prison Living." 

<P>You know, incarceration doesn't have to mean the end of a gracious and creative 

lifestyle. As regular listeners have learned, the term 'good enough' is simply 

not in my vocabulary. In just a few short weeks here in the women's minimum security 

facility at Danbury, Conn., I've discovered dozens of ways to transform prison 

living into a warm and cozy experience. 

<P>Believe me, you don't have to settle for taping ripped-out photos from a 4- 

year-old People magazine to your cell wall. 

<P>Take parsley, for example. This common little herb -- ignored or derided by 

many on the outside -- has myriad uses for gracious prison living. Ask your bi- 

weekly visitors to bring you a bunch or two when they come. Stored properly, in 

about 1-inch of water in your toothbrush cup, parsley will stay relatively fresh 

for up to 10 days. 

<P>Remember, parsley must never be kept in direct sunlight, something that shouldn't 

be a problem in most federal facilities. 

<P>Besides its crisp, outdoorsy fragrance, parsley provides a spot of welcome 

color in any cell and looks especially nice perched atop a brushed stainless steel 

institutional sink or toilet seat. 

<P>Obviously, parsley is ideal for sprucing up dreary, carbohydrate-heavy prison 

lunches and dinners. Pick a particularly pretty sprig to carry with you for, say, 

a T.G.I.F. dinner or bring an extra sprig for a cellblock mate and make it a really 

special occasion. 

<P>Speaking of carbohydrates, the mashed potatoes in most penal facilities make 

an excellent substitute for glue or paste. This can come in very handy if you 

want to add real pizazz to those old People magazine pinups by creating a custom-made, 

decoupage mural for your cell. 

<P>And while you're being creative with food, don't forget: Almost any flavor 

of jam or jelly makes a lovely lip gloss. My current favorite is Concord grape, 

but strawberry's nice, too. 

<P>I like to use my jam/jelly lip gloss every day, but it looks especially nice 

when I "dress up" by affixing a sprig of parsley to my prison jumpsuit. Most of 

the time I use a staple I've pulled out of a People magazine to pin on my little 

green boutonniere. Sometimes I just tuck the parsley behind one ear for a jeune 

fille effect. 

<P>That's all for today. Next time on "Martha" we'll talk about keeping hands 

and feet soft with mayonnaise and an easy way to turn ketchup and paper napkins 

into festive partyware. 

<P>For a copy of today's show, write or e-mail the warden here in Danbury and 

ask very nicely. In the meantime, a bunch of parsley is always appreciated.</i></p>
