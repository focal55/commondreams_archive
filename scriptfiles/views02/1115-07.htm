<p>The PepsiCo Corporation, a monolithic giant in the soda pop and fast food industry 

plays “cut throat hardball” with its competition. Fearing a 15 year old cheerleader's 

attempt to fund raise at school selling bottled water triggered the predacious 

instincts of PepsiCo to rear its ugly nature: profit at any cost. 

<p>When Pepsi got wind of West Salem High (Salem, Oregon) cheerleader Andrea Boyes’ creative idea to sell bottled water under the school logo, “Titans” they claimed “turf rights” and squashed the idea. Pepsi has a 10-year, $5 million contract with the Salem Keiser School District and only they can sell their bottled water, Aquafina brand, on school grounds.



 



<p>With September 7th, 2002 total assets reported at $23,793,000,000 one could only imagine the financial damage young Ms. Boyes might create for the soda giant. 



 



<p>Yes, young Ms. Boyes has learned a hard lesson in this brave new world of public school funding, where corporate entities have no shame about contractual powers and young adults are left jaded and powerless.



 



<p>It isn’t despicable enough that Pepsi lures cash-strapped public schools into peddling its elixirs of sugar, water and coloring. Doesn’t every good parent serve their children Pepsi in the morning, with a 12-ounce can loaded with approximately 9 ounces of sugar? Possibly PepsiCo executives can market an economics teaching packet for public schools, discussing the future potential of insulin sales as we passively watch a generation succumb to type-2 diabetes? Does being part of the “Pepsi Generation” include a life long membership to the osteoporosis and obesity club? 



 



<p>PepsiCo actions offer a glimpse into a tragic trend. Public schools are now forging collusive deals with the devil, while corporate taxes to help pay for education diminish. Reading, writing and brand loyalty is the mantra of companies like Pepsi and if even a young and motivated cheerleader threatens a penny of earnings: stop her cold in her tracks.



 



<p>This Pepsi debacle raises even more pertinent questions. Are we as a free society not willing to fund the public school systems of this nation? Are we afraid to ask corporate America, with its armies of publicly schooled employees, to donate their fair share of the tax base? Will we allow fast food, soda pop and candy to dominate the school day of some 60 million students? Will we sit back and watch the most commercially manipulated and marketed generation of children grow into adulthood facing a legacy of malnutrition? 



 



<p>Apparently, PepsiCo has declined to discuss the issue. Maybe they can buy off the cheerleaders at this Salem school with some free coupons to go to one of their other culturally rich icons: Taco Bell or Kentucky Fried Chicken. 



 



<p>Around the nation, including this weekend, crowds of cheering parents and fans will urge on student athletes in an age- old American pastime. Football games, soccer games, volleyball and basketball games will bring together members of each community with a common sense of purpose: supporting children. And when they look up at the score- board and see the Pepsi logo, hopefully they will consider the story of one caring and motivated cheerleader who tried to make a difference in her hometown and the soulless corporate power that views children as vehicles for cash.



 

<p>If you listen closely, maybe you will hear a rousing jeer from the high school cheerleaders across the nation as they give PepsiCo a hearty Bronx cheer. And maybe, just maybe there will be a shortage of quarters entering the vending machines at those Salem high schools.
