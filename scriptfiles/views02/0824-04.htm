<p>George W. Bush, fresh off a brush clearing operation at his Crawford ranch, 

snubbed the Earth Summit in Johannesburg for a trip to Oregon, where he vowed 

to fight future forest fires by taking a chainsaw to the nation's forests and 

the environmental laws that protect them. 

<p>In the name of fire prevention, Bush wants to allow the timber industry to 

log off more than 2.5 million acres of federal forest over the next ten years. 

He wants it done quickly and without any interference from pesky statutes such 

as the Endangered Species Act. Bush called his plan "the Healthy Forests Initiative." 

But it's nothing more than a giveaway to big timber, that comes at a high price 

to the taxpayer and forest ecosystems. 

<p>Bush's stump speech was a craven bit of political opportunism, rivaled, perhaps, 

only by Bush's call to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil drilling 

as a way to help heal the nation after the attacks of September 11. That plan 

sputtered around for awhile, but didn't go anywhere. But count on it: this one 

will. 

<p>Bush is exploiting a primal fear of fire that almost overwhelms the crippling 

anxiety about terrorists. In a one of the great masterstrokes of PR, Americans 

have been conditioned for the past 60 years that forest fires are bad...bad for 

forests. It's no accident that Smokey the Bear is the most popular icon in the 

history of advertising, far outdistancing Tony the Tiger or Capt. Crunch. 

<p>But the forests of North America were born out of fires, not destroyed by them. 

After Native Americans settled across the continent following the Wisconsin glaciation, 

fires became an even more regular event, reshaping the ecology of the Ponderosa 

pine and spruce forests of the Interior West and the mighty Douglas-fir forests 

of the Pacific Coast. 

<p>Forest fires became stigmatized only when forests began to be viewed as a commercial 

resource rather than an obstacle to settlement. Fire suppression became an obsession 

only after the big timber giants laid claim to the vast forests of the Pacific 

Northwest. Companies like Weyerhaeuser and Georgia-Pacific were loath to see their 

holdings go up in flames, so they arm-twisted Congress into pour millions of dollars 

into Forest Service fire-fighting programs. The Forest Service was only too happy 

to oblige because fire suppression was a sure way to pad their budget: along with 

the lobbying might of the timber companies they could literally scare Congress 

into handing over a blank check. [For an excellent history of the political economy 

of forest fires I highly recommend Stephen Pyne's, Fire in America.] 

<p>In effect, the Forest Service fire suppression programs (and similar operations 

by state and local governments) have acted as little more than federally-funded 

fire insurance policies for the big timber companies, an ongoing corporate bailout 

that has totaled tens of billions of dollars and shows no sign of slowing down. 

There's an old saying that the Forest Service fights fires by throwing money at 

them. And the more money it spends, the more money it gets from Congress. 

<p>"The Forest Service budgetary process rewards forest managers for losing money 

on environmentally destructive timber sales and penalizes them for making money 

or doing environmentally beneficial activities," says Randal O'Toole, a forest 

economist at the Thoreau Institute in Bandon, Oregon. "Until those incentives 

are changed, giving the Forest Service more power to sell or thin trees without 

environmental oversight will only create more problems than it solves." 

<p>Where did all the money go? It largely went to amass a fire-fighting infrastructure 

that rivals the National Guard: helicopters, tankers, satellites, airplanes and 

a legion of young men and women who are thrust, often carelessly, onto the firelines. 

Hundreds of fire fighters have perished, often senselessly. For a chilling historical 

account of how inept Forest Service fire bureaucrats put young firefighters in 

harms way read Norman Maclean's (author of A River Runs Through It) last book, 

Young Men and Fire. In this book, Maclean describes how incompetence and hubris 

by bureaucrats led to the deaths of 13 firefighters outside Seeley Lake, Montana 

in the great fire of 1949. More recently, mismanagement has led to firefighters 

being needlessly killed in Washington and Colorado. 

<p>Since the 1920s, the Forest Service fire-fighting establishment has been under 

orders to attack forest fires within 12 hours of the time when the fires were 

first sighted. For decades, there's been a zero tolerance policy toward wildfires. 

Even now, after forest ecologists have proved that most forests not only tolerate 

but need fire, the agency tries to suppress 99.7 percent of all wildfires. This 

industry-driven approach has come at a terrible economic and ecological price. 

<p>With regular fires largely excluded from the forests and grasslands, thickets 

of dry timber, small sickly trees and brush began to build up. This is called 

fuel loading. These thickets began a breeding ground for insects and diseases 

that ravaged healthy forest stands. The regular, low-intensity fires that have 

swept through the forests for millennia have now been replaced by catastrophic 

blazes that roar with a fury that is without historical or ecological precedent. 

<p>Even so the solution to the fuels problem is burning, not logging. The Bush 

plan is the environmental equivalent of looting a bombed out city and raping the 

survivors. The last thing a burned over forest needs is an assault by chainsaws, 

logging roads and skid trails, to haul out the only living trees in a scorched 

landscape. The evidence has been in for decades. The proof can be found at Mt. 

St. Helens and Yellowstone Park: Unlogged burned forests recover quickly, feeding 

off the nutrients left behind dead trees and shrubs. On the other hand, logged 

over burned forests rarely recover, but persists as kind of biological deserts, 

prone to mudslides, difficult to revegetate and abandoned by salmon and deep forest 

birds, such as the spotted owl, goshawk and marbled murrelet. They exist as desolate 

islands inside the greater ecosystem. 

<p>Even worse, such a plan only encourages future arsonists. The easiest way to 

clearcut an ancient forest is to set fire to it first. Take a look at the major 

fire of the west this summer: the big blazes in Arizona and Colorado were set 

by Forest Service employees and seasonal fire-fighters, another big fire in California 

was started by a marijuana suppression operation, fires in Oregon, Washington 

and Montana have been started by humans. 

<p>In Oregon more than 45,000 acres of prime ancient forest in the Siskiyou Mountains 

was torched by the Forest Service's firefighting crews to start a backfire in 

order to "save" a town that wasn't threatened to begin with. The fires were ignited 

by shooting ping-pong balls filled with napalm into the forest of giant Douglas-firs. 

By one estimate, more than a third of the acres burned this summer were ignited 

by the Forest Service as backfires. That's good news for the timber industry since 

they get to log nearly all those acres for next to nothing. 

<p>Far from acting as a curative, a century of unrestrained logging has vastly 

increased the intensity and frequency of wildfires, particularly in the West. 

The Bush plan promises only more of the same at an accelerated and uninhibited 

pace. When combined with global warming, persistent droughts, and invasions by 

alien insects species (such as the Asian-long-horned beetle) and diseases, the 

future for American forests looks very bleak indeed. 

<p>Predictably, the Bush scheme was met with howls of protest from the big environmental 

groups. This is part of Bush's irresponsible anti-environmental Agenda," said 

Bill Meadows, president of the Wilderness Society. "The truth is that waiving 

environmental laws will not protect homes and lives from wildfire." 

<p>But they only have themselves to blame. They helped lay the political groundwork 

for the Bush plan long ago. And now the Administration, and its backers in Big 

Timber, have seized the day and put the environmentalists on the run. 

<p>The environmentalists have connived with the logging-to-prevent-fires scam 

for political reasons. First came a deal to jettison a federal court injunction 

against logging in the Montana's Bitterroot National Forest designed to appease 

Senator Max Baucus, friend of Robert Redford and a ranking Democrat. More than 

14,000 acres of prime forest inside formerly protected roadless areas are now 

being clearcut. Then last month came a similar deal brokered by Senate Majority 

Leader Tom Daschle with the Sierra Club and the Wilderness Society that allows 

the timber industry to begin logging the Black Hills, sacred land of the Sioux, 

totally unfettered by any environmental constraints. 

<p>Grassroots greens warned that such willy-nilly dealmaking with Democrats would 

soon become a model for a national legislation backed by Bush and Republican legislators 

that would dramatically escalate logging on all national forests and exempt the 

clearcuts from compliance with environmental laws. We've now reached that point. 

<p>And there's no sign the big greens have learned their lesson. 

<p>The latest proposal comes courtesy of the Oregon Natural Resources Council 

and the Sierra Club. It's rather timidly called the "Environmentalist New Vision." 

There's nothing new about the plan, except that it is being endorsed by a claque 

of politically intimidated green groups instead of Boise-Cascade. It calls for 

thinning ( i.e., logging) operations near homes in the forest/suburb interface. 

This is a pathetic and dangerous approach that sends two wrong messages in one 

package: that thinning reduces fire risk and that it's okay to build houses in 

forested environments. 

<p>In fact, there's no evidence that thinning will reduce fires in these situations 

and it may provide a false sense of security when there are other measures that 

are more effective and less damaging to the environment. 

<p>"Forest Service fire researcher Jack Cohen has found that homes and other structures 

will be safe from fire if their roof and landscaping within 150 feet of the structures 

are fireproofed," says O'Toole. "A Forest Service report says there are 1.9 million 

high-risk acres in the wildland-urban interface, of which 1.5 million are private. 

Treating these acres, not the 210 million federal acres, will protect homes. Firebreaks 

along federal land boundaries, not treatments of lands within those boundaries, 

will protect other private property. Once private lands are protected, the Forest 

Service can let most fires on federal lands burn." 

<p>As it stands, the Sierra Club's scheme will only result in more logging, more 

subdivisions in wildlands and, predictably, more fires. Any environmental outfit 

with a conscience would call for an immediate thinning of subdivisions on urban/wildland 

interface, not forests. Don't hold your breath. Too many big-time contributors 

to environmental groups own huge houses inside burn-prone forests in places Black 

Butte Ranch, Oregon, Flagstaff, Arizona and Vail, Colorado. 

<p>Of course, there's still resistance to these schemes. When Bush arrived in 

Portland to make official his handout to big timber, he was greeted by nearly 

a thousand protesters. On the streets of the Rose City, Earth First!ers and anti-war 

activists shouted down Bush and his plans for war on Iraq and the environment. 

The riot police soon arrived in their Darth Vader gear. The demonstrators, old 

and young alike, were beaten, gassed, and shot at with plastic bullets. They even 

pepper sprayed children. Dozens were arrested; others were bloodied by bullets 

and nightsticks. 

<p>This is a portent of things to come. When the laws have been suspended, the 

only option to protect forests will be direct action: bodies barricaded against 

bulldozers, young women suspended in trees, impromptu encampments in the deep 

snows of the Cascades and Rockies. 

<p>Not long ago, the occupation of cutting down the big trees ranked as one of 

the most dangerous around. Now, thanks to the connivance of Bush, Daschle and 

the big enviro groups, the job of protecting them will be fraught with even more 

peril. 

<p>Those brave young forest defenders, forced into the woods as a thin green line 

against the chainsaws, should send their bail requests to the Sierra Club and 

their medical bills to the Wilderness Society. They can afford it.
