<p> We are fighting a war against terrorism to defend American values of truth, 

liberty and justice. That's how President Bush sold this war to us after the horror 

of Sept. 11.</p>

<p>In those first days after The Reckoning, as a shocked nation grieved, the President 

held back tears and his lips quivered as he hung up the phone after checking on 

recovery efforts in New York.</p>

<p>Americans of all creeds and backgrounds stood shoulder to shoulder. We had 

good and right on our side - and yet some of us had healthy doubts about this 

war against enemies unknown.</p>

<p>As much as I lauded Bush, I wrote a few days after the attack that I feared 

this war on terrorism could turn into a war against the very rights that America's 

founders fought to secure against tyranny. Now, almost a year later, my fears 

have proved to be a painful reality.</p>

<p>In this nation of laws - based on the separation of powers, on the checks and 

balances of each branch of government - we have a police state in the making.</p>

<p>To say that this war is so unique as to demand the dismantling of basic constitutional 

protections, as Attorney General John Ashcroft maintains, goes against everything 

our young people in military service risk their lives for. It goes against the 

very core of what it means to be an American, and it clearly goes against the 

Constitution.</p>

<p>We have the right to know what the government's charges are against us. We 

have a right to an attorney. We are innocent until proved guilty. We are protected 

from illegal searches and seizures. Or so we thought.</p>

<p>The cases of two Americans accused of terrorism puts us on notice.</p>

<p>The two men - Jose Padilla, of Puerto Rican descent, and Yaser Esam Hamdi, 

who was born in Louisiana and raised in Saudi Arabia - are being held in solitary 

confinement, without access to lawyers, even without official charges filed against 

them. They are being treated as military combatants under a system in which the 

rules keep changing.</p>

<p>Federal Judge Robert G. Doumar has become so frustrated by the assaults on 

the Constitution in the Hamdi case that he blasted government lawyers last week 

for not producing any evidence.</p>

<p>"I have no desire to have an enemy combatant get out," Doumar said, "but due 

process requires something other than a declaration [by a Defense Department official] 

that he should be held incommunicado. Isn't that what we're fighting for?"</p>

<p>Many members of Congress - both Republicans and Democrats - are asking that 

question, too. Yet the Justice Department has refused to turn over information 

to Judiciary panels that are looking at the ramifications of the misnamed "Patriots 

Act."</p>

<p>For instance, how many times has the Justice Department obtained authority 

for roving surveillance? Ashcroft says that's classified, and the only ones who 

can know are members of Intelligence committees that meet behind closed doors.</p>

<p>That kind of secrecy has nothing to do with national security and everything 

to do with the type of power grabs that third-rate dictators demand. The U.S. 

Supreme Court inevitably will have to decide.</p>

<p>This isn't a matter of Bush being a good guy or not. We all want to get the 

bad guys. But we can't pretend to be the "good guys" if our government is willing 

to spit on basic rights and shred our Constitution in the name of justice.</p>
