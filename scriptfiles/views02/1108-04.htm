<p>The mid-term elections are over.  After spending hundreds of 

millions of business dollars, the Republicans now control the Senate and 

hold on to the House of Representatives.  It is amazing that the 

Democrats did not do worse.  They had decided months ago on a strange 

strategy -- that they were going to defeat the Republicans by not 

criticizing their belligerent leader, George W. Bush.

<p>In their ads, literature and debates between Senatorial and 

Representative candidates, mention of Mr. Bush by them was to praise not 

to challenge, or to expose the hypocrisy, and the damage to American 

workers and consumers by this corporation President.

<p>Listening to the debate from around the country on C-Span radio, I 

was astonished to see Democratic candidates in tight races eager to show 

their support for Bush's 2001 tax cut for the wealthy, for the 

give-a-way war resolution authority on Iraq, and for Bush's federal 

drive to take over the historical role of the states in personal injury 

law by restricting Americans' right to their full day in court.

<p>And what did Senate Democrat candidates such as Jean Shaheen in New 

Hampshire and Senator Max Cleland of Georgia get for their support of 

President Bush?  Why he roared into their states on Air Force One and 

campaigned against them, as he did against other Democrats who voted 

with him on these and other Republican litmus paper tests.

<p>The morning after election day, reporters asked Senator majority leader, Tom 

Daschle why the Democrats lost? He replied, because the Democrats were "up against 

a very popular President." That's a self-fulfilling point. Asked the same question, 

Democratic Party Chairman Terry McAuliffe answered: "Because they [the Republicans] 

outspent us." But it was Republican House speaker who gave the accurate response: 

"Because the Democrats did not have a message." 

<p>At a time of rising unemployment, a shaky economy, and growing 

Republican deficits, it would seem that the Democrats had 

opportunities.  Yet while the Republicans were shamelessly touting 

ending the estate tax for the 4000 estates a year that are in the 

multi-million dollar category, the Democrats were not highlighting the 

desperate need for raising the federal minimum wage (now about a third 

less in purchasing power than it was in 1968!) and extending 

unemployment compensation benefits.

<p>Most Democrats, with the prominent exception of the late Senator Paul Wellstone, 

took a dive on making Republican softness on corporate crime a major issue, coupled 

with solid reform proposals to crackdown on corporate scandals that stole billions 

from pension funds and 401ks and cost many jobs. (See <a href="http://www.Citizenworks.org" target="_new">Citizenworks.org</a>). 

<p>Namby-pamby was the Democratic routine on the increasing millions of 

Americans without health care coverage and on the staggering 

inefficiency, waste and greed of many giant HMOs and the drug industry.

<p>Although the Democrats had in their possession finely tuned economic 

stimulus plans, they tied their own by declining to go after a bloated 

military budget (now half of the U.S. government's entire 

non-discretionary budget) and the tens of billions of dollars in yearly 

corporate welfare subsidies and handouts.

<p>Instead, the Democrats' economic agenda was the raising of big bucks 

from business interests -- a sure way to silence championing the 

peoples' necessities.

<p>When the Democratic Party adopts a look-a-like strategy vis-a-vis the Republican 

Party, some of their voters may prefer the real thing and vote Republican. After 

all, only a shift of less than three hundred thousand votes in key states would 

have given the Democrats control of both Houses of Congress. 

<p>Amidst the din of endlessly repeated political television ads, it 

wasn't made very clear that the Democrats were going after the 

Republicans on down home consumer protection issues, such as insurance 

and food safety and affordable housing.  Environmental positions 

regarding cleaner air and water were not prominent either.

<p>Lessons for the future?  Don't give your major political opponents a 

free ride between and before elections.  Challenge the corporate 

takeover of elections, including the sudden surge of political 

television advertising paid directly by industries like the big 

price-gouging drug companies.  And get down to the neighborhood level 

with visible stands for the people.

<p>Otherwise the Democrats will become even better at electing very bad 

Republicans.
