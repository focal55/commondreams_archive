<p>PERHAPS IT WAS appropriate for a congressional symposium on corporate control 

of the media to be held in the basement of the Capitol.</p>

<p>After all, most members of Congress--loyal minions of Big Money that they are--would 

prefer that the topic never see the light of day. That's because if people became 

better informed about our media system, they might begin formulating tough questions. 

Questions such as ones posed at the July 11 symposium by communications scholar 

Robert McChesney, who wondered aloud: "Why do we let one company [Clear Channel] 

own 1,400 radio stations? In whose interests is that?" </p>

<p>It's probably not in your interests; in fact, the extreme concentration of 

media outlets in a few corporate hands is hardly in anyone's interests. Hence 

a deafening silence in the corporate media that has made media reform "one of 

the least visible issues" even though it may be one of the most important, said 

Rep. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who joined Rep. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, in organizing 

the symposium.</p>

<p>Media ownership--especially broadcast-media ownership--is clearly a political 

issue. The current broadcast-media landscape is the product not of the "invisible 

hand" of the marketplace, but of regulations, subsidies, and government-sanctioned 

monopolies.</p>

<p>In an article written earlier this year for The Nation magazine, McChesney 

and co-author John Nichols, another symposium participant, dispel the myth of 

"a natural order" in which media conglomerates "have mastered the marketplace 

on the basis of their wit and wisdom."</p>

<p>McChesney and Nichols argue that, in addition to the "huge promotional budgets 

and continual rehashing of tried and true formulas," corporate dominance of the 

media is made possible "by explicit government policies and subsidies that permit 

the creation of large and profitable conglomerates." The two media critics contend 

that when the FCC grants free monopoly rights to a small group of broadcasters, 

"it is not setting the terms of competition; it is picking the winners of the 

competition." These giveaways, they continue, amount to an annual sum of corporate 

welfare worth tens of billions of dollars.</p>

<p>What's especially galling--not to mention fundamentally anti-democratic--is 

that the government's decisions about who controls the airwaves are made in our 

name, but not with our informed consent.</p>

<p>The corporate media's stranglehold on the news causes crucial stories to receive 

little attention--or to be ignored altogether. The major media, as Sanders said, 

"deflect attention from the most important issues facing working people," so news 

on the health-care crisis or trade is buried under a mountain of sensationalistic 

stories about sex scandals and violent crimes.</p>

<p>Many independent media critics over the years have concluded that mainstream 

coverage generally reflects elite interests--especially where economic and foreign 

policy are concerned. McChesney argues in his book "Rich Media, Poor Democracy" 

that the corporate media tend to offer good, critical coverage of an issue only 

when it does not directly involve business and upper-class interests, or when 

there is significant disagreement over it within elite economic or policymaking 

circles. So, while you might see decent coverage on abortion rights or the Middle 

East (two topics that conservatives like to discuss when criticizing the media 

for being too liberal), don't expect much on labor rights or military spending 

that challenges the elite's center-right consensus.</p>

<p>In addition to institutionalized biases, there's also the simple fact that 

the major media conglomerates are becoming less and less interested in hard news. 

The Wall Street Journal recently reported that Time Warner's CNN has devised a 

new strategy that will stress "a slicker, more entertaining presentation." </p>

<p>The trouble CNN faces is that advertisers these days don't want to have their 

products associated with things like airline crashes or suicide bombings, so advertising 

revenue is falling even in times when the network's viewership may be up. Even 

the pro-business Journal laments that "viewers would be among the losers if the 

marketplace should force CNN to dilute its commitment to extensive coverage of 

news in Afghanistan or other global hot spots--as rising financial pressures have 

tempted it to do."</p>

<p>Knight Ridder, owner of 31 newspapers across the country, is another depressing 

case study. As Washington Post editors Leonard Downie Jr. and Robert G. Kaiser 

observe in their book "The News About the News," Knight Ridder has slashed costs 

by getting rid of newsroom staff and shrinking the space their papers devote to 

news--all to increase the corporation's profit margin. Wall Street has looked 

on approvingly as the company cultivates its new dedication to the bottom line. 

One Merrill Lynch analyst said Knight Ridder's "historic culture has been one 

of producing Pulitzer Prizes instead of profits, and while we think that culture 

is hard to change, it does seem to be happening."</p>

<p>We shouldn't begrudge corporations for putting profits ahead of the kind of 

journalism that is indispensable to a democracy; they are institutionally incapable 

of doing otherwise. </p>

<p>That's why we need to free journalism from the 10 or so corporations that now 

dominate it. And the impetus for change will have to come from ordinary people; 

it's not going to originate from inside the D.C. Beltway. "Members [of Congress] 

have to start hearing in their home districts that people want specific reforms 

of the media," Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., D-Ill., told McChesney and Nichols in their 

article for The Nation. </p>

<p>But what would a pro-democracy media-reform agenda look like? McChesney and 

Nichols offer several intriguing ideas, among them:</p>

<p>Apply existing antimonopoly laws to the media and expand the reach of these 

laws to restrict ownership of radio stations. Also, make an effort to break the 

grip of newspaper chains on entire regions.</p>

<p>Establish a nationwide tier of low-power, noncommercial radio and television 

stations.</p>

<p>Allow taxpayers a $200 tax credit to apply to nonprofit media.</p>

<p>Lower mailing costs for nonprofit and mostly noncommercial publications.</p>

<p>Decommercialize local TV news with rules that require stations to offer journalists 

an hour daily of commercial-free news time.</p>

<p>Is all of this achievable at once? Probably not, symposium participants agreed. 

But conscientious citizens have to find ways to get the reform ball rolling, because 

the alternative of leaving news gathering and reporting to the CBSNBCABC CNNFOXKnightRidder 

behemoth is too objectionable for any real democrat (note the small "d") to stomach.</p>
