<p>You can say this about the Bush administration: where others might see problems, 

it sees opportunities.</p>

<P> A slump in the economy was an opportunity to push a tax cut that provided 

very little stimulus in the short run, but will place huge demands on the budget 

in 2010. An electricity shortage in California was an opportunity to push for 

drilling in Alaska, which would have produced no electricity and hardly any oil 

until 2013 or so. An attack by lightly armed terrorist infiltrators was an opportunity 

to push for lots of heavy weapons and a missile defense system, just in case Al 

Qaeda makes a frontal assault with tank divisions or fires an ICBM next time.</p>

<P> President George H. W. Bush once confessed that he was somewhat lacking in 

the "vision thing." His son's advisers don't have that problem: they have a powerful 

vision for America's future. In that future, we have recently learned, the occupant 

of the White House will have the right to imprison indefinitely anyone he chooses, 

including U.S. citizens, without any judicial process or review. But they are 

rather less interested in the reality thing.</p>

<P> For the distinctive feature of all the programs the administration has pushed 

in response to real problems is that they do little or nothing to address those 

problems. Problems are there to be used to pursue the vision. And a problem that 

won't serve that purpose, whether it's the collapse of confidence in corporate 

governance or the chaos in the Middle East, is treated as an annoyance to be ignored 

if possible, or at best addressed with purely cosmetic measures. Clearly, George 

W. Bush's people believe that real-world problems will solve themselves, or at 

least won't make the evening news, because by pure coincidence they will be pre-empted 

by terror alerts.</p>

<P> But real problems, if not dealt with, have a way of festering. In the last 

few weeks, a whole series of problems seem to have come to a head. Yesterday's 

speech notwithstanding, Middle East policy is obviously adrift. The dollar and 

the stock market are plunging, threatening an already shaky economic recovery. 

Amtrak has been pushed to the edge of shutdown, because it couldn't get the administration's 

attention. And the federal government itself is about to run out of money, because 

House Republicans are unwilling to face reality and increase the federal debt 

limit. (This avoidance thing seems to be contagious.)</p>

<P> So now would be a good time to do what the White House always urges its critics 

to do — put partisanship aside. Will Mr. Bush be willing to set aside, even for 

a day or two, his drive to consolidate his political base, and actually do something 

that wasn't part of his preconceived agenda? Oh, never mind.</p>

<P> I think that most commentators missed the point of the story about Mr. Bush's 

commencement speech at Ohio State, the one his aide said drew on the thinking 

of Emily Dickinson, Pope John Paul II, Aristotle and Cicero, among others. Of 

course the aide's remarks were silly — but they gave us an indication of the level 

of sycophancy that Mr. Bush apparently believes to be his due. Next thing you 

know we'll be told that Mr. Bush is also a master calligrapher, and routinely 

swims across the Yangtze River. And nobody will dare laugh: just before Mr. Bush 

gave his actual, Aristotle-free speech, students at Ohio State were threatened 

with expulsion and arrest if they heckled him. </p>

<P> It's interesting to note that the planned Department of Homeland Security, 

while of dubious effectiveness in its announced purpose, will be protected against 

future Colleen Rowleys: the new department will be exempted from both whistle-blower 

protection and the Freedom of Information Act.</p>

<P> But back to the festering problems: on the economic side, this is starting 

to look like the most dangerous patch for the nation and the world since the summer 

of 1998. Back then, luckily, our economic policy was run by smart people who were 

prepared to learn from their mistakes. Can you say the same about this administration?</p>

<P> As I've noted before, the Bush administration has an infallibility complex: 

it never, ever, admits making a mistake. And that kind of arrogance tends, eventually, 

to bring disaster. You can read all about it in Aristotle. </p>
