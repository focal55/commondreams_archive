In advance of his visits to several Latin American countries,

President Bush has focused public attention on U.S. aid to developing

countries. As a result, the real purpose of his tour has gone

unnoticed. Bush is using his time in Mexico, Peru, and El Salvador to

promote neoliberal economic policies that actually serve to exacerbate

inequality and undermine democratic institutions in countries

throughout the region.<p>El Salvador, in particular, provides a case study in how Bush's

version of economic &quot;modernization&quot; has failed the poor.<p>Geography has never been George W.'s strong suit, but one might

expect him to try being sensitive to El Salvador's human rights

concerns, given that a U.N. Truth Commission blamed the right-wing

governments supported by his father for 90 percent of the

approximately 80,000 murders committed through the country's civil

war. Instead, President Bush's visit falls on the day normally

reserved for commemoration of Archbishop Oscar Romero's assassination.

The army's death squads gunned down Romero, a stalwart defender of the

country's poorest citizens, during a mass on March 24, 1980.<p>Ten years after the signing of the Chapultepec Peace Accords

ended more than a decade of bloody conflict, U.S.-supported policies

continue to impede progress toward human rights. Rather than atoning

for its sponsorship of Cold War crimes, the United States has overseen

a type of economic transformation that punishes the same communities

most victimized during El Salvador's time of violence. Under the

supervision of the IMF and World Bank in Washington, DC, the

conservative Salvadoran governments of the 1990s hacked social

services and sold off state enterprises in telecommunications and

utilities to private interests.<p>Businesses dramatically raised costs to consumers. At the same

time, the government led drives to bust the unions that fight to keep

wages in the &quot;modernizing&quot; economy from falling to sweatshop

levels. Over the past months it announced the firing of 10,000 workers

in the public sector -- a dramatic loss of jobs in El Salvador's small

labor economy.<p>Contrary to the objectives of the U.N.'s International Conference

on Financing for Development in Monterrey, Mexico, the forum which

prompted Bush to increase foreign aid, these economic policies worsen

living conditions for the majority of Salvadorans. The United Nations

Development Program reports that El Salvador's increasing levels of

income inequality rank among the highest in the world. Even the

official government measures show that half of the country lives in

poverty. Many Salvadorans can provide for their basic needs only

because of money sent back from relatives who have emigrated to the

United States. Indeed, with a regressive tax structure and a lack of

public assets creating huge debts for the government, the economy as a

whole depends on the $1.9 billion a year in remittances for its

survival.<p>Democracy is also a casualty in the neoliberal regime. Members of

the Bush administration have embraced the conservative ARENA party as

their ideological brethren. Bush himself praises his Salvadoran

counterpart, Francisco &quot;Paco&quot; Flores, as a &quot;brilliant

young leader&quot; and a &quot;breath of fresh air.&quot; But ARENA

frequently shows contempt for free speech and the rights of opposition

parties. When the rival FMLN gained a plurality in the Legislative

Assembly in 2000, ARENA led right-wing parties in refusing to let them

assume the presidency of that body. More recently, after a prominent

health-care union led several days of street marches protesting the

January cutbacks, they found their offices occupied by police. These

are exactly the type of abuses that Bush would need to remedy if he

were serious about his proclaimed desire to &quot;strengthen

democratic institutions&quot; in El Salvador.<p>In the context of economic turmoil and political abuses, human

rights have again become endangered. Due to an epidemic of street

crime, which has given the country one of the highest per capita

murder rates in the hemisphere, life for most citizens is as dangerous

now as during the war. ARENA persistently attempts to undermine the

Human Rights Ombudsman, an office created by the Peace Accords as a

major institutional safeguard against future abuses. And the process

of reckoning with past trauma has been difficult. Against the advice

of organizations such as Amnesty International, the right rushed an

amnesty law through the Assembly in the wake of the U.N. Truth

Commission report detailing many of the war's horrors. With few

exceptions, those responsible for atrocities never faced justice.<p>For its part, the Bush administration harbors figures like

Elliott Abrams, who, as a chief Reagan spin-doctor on Central American

affairs, steadfastly denied that horrific abuses ever happened.

Mentioning one notorious site of terror,<i> The New York Times</i>

noted in January that the families of those villagers massacred at El

Mozote have long been denied the &quot;foundations of healing&quot; --

the prosecution of criminals, the official naming of victims, and

appreciation of the urgent need for relatives &quot;to possess a shard

of bone to bury.&quot;<p>As neoliberals rush to forget the past, they may yet provoke its

repetition. Francisco Flores has advocated that the U.N. to return to

conduct a &quot;closing ceremony&quot; for the Peace Accords,

asserting that &quot;the agreement to fortify democracy in the country

has been completed.&quot; Furthermore, he has explained that with this

matter settled, he will have nothing further to discuss with the

leading opposition party.<p>Neither Flores nor Bush seem to understand that the pursuit of

democracy and human rights must always be an on-going process.<p>In January, Hector Dada Hirezi, a leading commentator and past

member of a transitional national government, argued that Salvadorans

are finding the Peace Accords, based on the premise of ending war

without producing winners and losers, being supplanted by an economic

system in which the poor lose and economic elites win. More ominously,

a major human rights institute at the University of Central America in

San Salvador has warned that the government, in charting its present

course, is &quot;cooking a broth of violence.&quot;<p>The rhetoric of poverty reduction has long been a part of U.S.

policy in Latin America. While foreign aid can be used to good ends,

allowing humanitarian gestures to disguise the policies that continue

to brew poverty and injustice constitutes a recipe for crisis. Bush

need only consider Argentina, a past neoliberal poster child whose

dollarized currency and foreign debt spiraled into economic meltdown.

Or go no further than El Salvador itself, where the issues that

provoked the country's long civil war look all too similar to the

poverty, inequality, and corruption that persist today.
