<p>Throughout the weeks of my summer holiday I imposed a ban on myself from hearing, 

watching, or reading the news, and have emerged more refreshed than uninformed. 

The “debate” about whether or not we should go to war with Iraq has got along 

fine without me, as I thought it might. Rummy and Condi, Dubya and Dick have been 

openly hinting for months now that there’s a war around the corner. “Will we, 

won’t we, will we, won’t we, will we bomb Iraq?” runs the current perversion of 

the Lobster Quadrille, and most of us have joined the dance. 

<p>Frankly, I’m finding it difficult to invest much emotion in the war we’ve been 

primed to expect. Maybe I’ve got democracy fatigue, or am just too old to subscribe 

any more to the notion that my opinion counts for more than a popcorn fart in 

a hurricane. Nevertheless, as with most of the other military ventures we’ve flirted 

with in my lifetime, I hope it won’t happen, think that it shouldn’t, and suspect 

that it will. Is Saddam a threat? Maybe. I doubt that it matters in the end. Facts 

are neither recognizable in nor indispensable to the smoke and mirrors productions 

we’ve come to take for granted. Rummy and Condi, Dubya and Dick have a script 

in hand and will likely as not stage their production of “Regime Change” even 

if Saddam abruptly repents of his sins and is declared a saint. Inaction is not 

an option, they insist, and to date no good Buddhist has succeeded in enlightening 

them otherwise. 

<p>Mantra Test: Given the political atmosphere, which of the following calls would 

you rate most likely to trigger an unequivocal response of Inaction Is Not An 

Option? Tick the correct answer. 

<p>1. ___ By age five, more than 30% of the world’s children will have suffered 

from malnutrition. 

<p>2. ___ Hydrocarbons in the atmosphere disrupt weather patterns and threaten 

our health. The wealthiest fifth of the world consumes more than 50% of its fossil 

fuel. 

<p>3. ___ Iraq could stand a dose of “regime change”. 

<p>4. ___ 800 million people go hungry every year. 

<p>5. ___ Henry Kissinger has never been tried for war crimes. 

<p>6. ___ Many Americans feel they cannot afford health care. 

<p>7. ___ Egypt, Zimbabwe, Israel, North Korea, Saudi Arabia, and a host of other 

countries (our own is perhaps no exception) could stand a dose of “regime change”. 

<p>8. ___ The richest 1% of Americans hold 38% of the country’s wealth. 

<p>9. ___ Corporate corruption has hurt the economy and robbed investors. 

<p>10. ___ Unexploded cluster bombs still claim 200 victims a year in Laos. Half 

are children. 

<p>Congratulations if you chose answer three. 

<p>Inaction, it turns out, has routinely been an option, often a preferred option, 

in issues concerning the environment, economic inequity, even genocide. Inaction 

is not an option? Tell it to an Indian from Bhopal, a Tutsi from Rwanda, a Palestinian 

from Jenin. Our government too often acts (or neglects to act) on behalf of a 

national interest so narrow that its perceived gains depend on or contribute to 

someone else in the world’s misfortune. Such a foreign policy will inevitably 

turn against us. Meanwhile, it need not surprise us that peace has become such 

an infrequent option in American foreign relations.
