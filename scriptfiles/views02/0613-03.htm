<p>The statute of the International Criminal Court was adopted on July 17 1998 

by an overwhelming majority of the states attending the Rome conference. To date, 

the Rome statute has been signed by 139 states, and 67 states have ratified it. 

One significant absentee as a ratifier is the US, but happily it has not followed 

through on the reported threat to remove its signature from the statute. 

<P>Within just four years, the treaty has achieved the 60 required ratifications 

- far sooner than was generally expected. The statute will become operative on 

July 1, when the court's jurisdiction over genocide, war crimes and crimes against 

humanity will take effect. 

<P>The second half of the 20th century saw the strengthening of human rights and 

a growing sense that because individuals live under the international legal system, 

they must necessarily have rights and obligations flowing from it. The fact that 

delegates at Rome were able to finalize the ICC statute is evidence of the existence 

of a social system built on universal respect for the idea of human rights - a 

system which denounces the most serious war crimes and crimes against humanity 

because of a recognition that tolerating such atrocities diminishes and threatens 

everyone. 

<P>The prospects for the ICC as a protector of the ideals of the international 

community as a whole become difficult to imagine, however, when some states elect 

to exclude themselves from that vision. This is particularly true when those states 

are powerful, and strikingly so when such powerful states, like the US, are traditionally 

associated with the very values the ICC seeks to endorse. 

<P>From its beginnings, an important element of the US conception of its own national 

interest has been the development and maintenance of an international rule of 

law. The importance the framers gave to international law is reflected in the 

constitution itself, whereby Congress is given power to "define and punish piracies 

and felonies committed on the high seas, and offences against the law of nations". 

<P>In the last century the US was a leading force in the establishment of the 

Permanent Court of Arbitration; a chief architect of the United Nations, the IMF 

and the World Bank; a leading sponsor of the ad hoc tribunals on Rwanda and the 

former Yugoslavia; and a vocal endorser of the idea of an International Criminal 

Court. Indeed, President Clinton called for a permanent war crimes tribunal shortly 

before the Rome conference when addressing genocide survivors in Rwanda. 

<P>The impact of the US failure to support the ICC may be symbolically important 

- a high-profile rejection of a major initiative for the rule of law in international 

affairs. But it will also be a lost opportunity if a state with a long-standing 

commitment to human rights does not take a lead in shaping the work of the world's 

first international criminal court. 

<P>The ICC statute has principles central to American conceptions of justice all 

over it, reflecting ideas such as due process, command responsibility and superior 

orders, to name but a few. 

<P>At the Rome conference in 1998, the US worked closely with the UK throughout 

long and difficult negotiations to ensure that the statute of the ICC contained 

adequate safeguards against politically motivated prosecutions of our citizens. 

It is plain that the UK was and remains satisfied that this was achieved. 

<P>Now, as then, the UK remains convinced that US and UK national interests in 

taking forward the court coincide; and that the overriding concern of the international 

community to bring an end to impunity for war crimes and crimes against humanity 

will be advanced significantly by the emergence of the ICC, with American participation. 

But not at any price. 

<P>The US claims that the Rome statute is flawed. Certainly it is not perfect. 

But while the statute is a reflection of wide agreement which inevitably involved 

some compromises, none of those compromises undermines the basic fact that the 

court will act only where national jurisdictions cannot. 

<P>In 1998 the UK concluded that the liberty and well- being of its citizens will 

not be threatened by malicious or politically motivated arrest and indictment 

in a foreign land by virtue of its commitment to the court. With time, it is to 

be hoped that the US will come to share that assessment with regard to its own 

people, and recognize that the concerns it has expressed, legitimate as they may 

now seem, are not well-founded.
