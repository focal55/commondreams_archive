In the four months since September, we've moved from our first waves 

of dread and rage over a massacre to the slower task of facing what has been 

lost. The new year is a good time to assess how we're doing. In a thousand 

ways we've honored our dead with honorable behavior toward each other, but in 

some quarters we're still captive to fear. We hurt.

<P>In our frustration with the impossibility of making our world safe, some 

are drawn to easier targets, willing to have straw-enemies set up in our midst 

to be shot down, to relieve the popular anger.

<P>Religious and political intolerance still vibrate in the national 

aftershock. Friends still tell me of suffering anti-Muslim slurs in what was 

meant to be polite company.

<P>And I've had my own instructive glimpse of a nation's psychology: I've 

watched, amazed, as some ultra-conservative journalists ignited an attack on 

my patriotism with a stunning prevarication that blazed like a grassfire 

through the Internet and countless newspapers including the Wall Street 

Journal.

<P>From deliberate beginnings, it roared through the fertile ground of 

careless journalism, where laziness can do the same work as malice. Not one 

editor called to verify before publishing an inflammatory misquote. The crowd 

wants drama, it seems.

<P>For the record, I do not believe the American flag stands for "intimidation, censorship, violence, bigotry, homophobia and shoving the Constitution 

through a paper shredder."

<P>I believe the opposite, and said so in a <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views01/0925-08.htm">Sept. 25 op-ed piece</a> in The 

Chronicle, defending the flag from men who had waved it to justify death 

threats against U.S. Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Oakland, and the murder of a Sikh man 

in Arizona.

<P>I asked if these monstrous men thought our flag stood for monstrous things 

(that's the source of the infamous quote, snipped from its context), and 

answered that I do not -- for me it's an emblem of peace, generosity, courage 

and kindness.

<P>I warned that in hard times, some confuse a nationalistic intolerance for 

patriotism. And my intolerant detractors chose this warning, out of all I've 

written, to turn on its head and use to bash me as unpatriotic.

<P>Believe me, irony is not dead.

<P>Like millions of Americans, I'm devoted to my country and also to spiritual 

convictions that don't allow me to celebrate violence as the best solution to 

any problem.

<P>I've joined a legion of writers in recent months -- Susan Sontag, Wendell 

Berry, Alice Walker, Molly Ivins, Arundhati Roy, Barry Lopez and many more -- 

who are addressing the complex struggle of reconciling national and moral 

imperatives.

<P>Extremists who won't tolerate this kind of dialogue have attacked us 

mightily in print, without quoting our actual words or ideas, but rather, 

declaring us un-American for fabricated reasons -- in my case they invariably 

haul out that one misquote about the flag -- and pronouncing direly that no 

one had better listen to us, they'd best play it safe and just hate us. A few 

citizens have obliged by sending me a brand of vitriol previously unthinkable 

to me, in my many years of receiving mail from strangers.

<P>But I hear in much greater numbers from readers who've read me -- not just 

read about me -- and who appreciate words expressing the complexities that 

have tormented them since our horrible September.

<P>If anyone believes ambivalence about war needn't be given a voice, because 

it's such a miniscule component of the American conversation, they should see 

this mountain of supportive mail.

<P>Thoughtful readers like these know enough to roll their eyes whenever 

anyone tries to claim sole custody of our flag and wield it as a blunt 

instrument. They've responded to the assaults on writers of conscience by 

purchasing our books in record numbers; they've risen above fundamentalist 

thinking by reading voraciously about Islam and relevant political history. 

Many Americans understand patriotism as a higher calling than gossip-mongering.

<P>If anyone else still thinks patriotism demands resolute obedience to the 

majority, let's go to Exhibit B. I have two American flags in my house. Both 

were gifts; one was handmade by a child, a few stars shy of regulation but 

nonetheless cherished. Each has its place where I can look up and remember: 

That's mine. It protects and represents me only because of Ida B. Wells, Susan 

B. Anthony and countless other women who risked everything so I could be a 

full citizen.

<P>Each of us who is female, nonwhite or without land would have been 

guaranteed in 1776 the same voting rights as a horse. We owe a precious debt 

to Americans before us who refused to believe patriotism just meant going with 

the crowd.

<P>Our history is one of courageous flag-wavers who risked threats and public 

ridicule for an unpopular cause: ours. Now that flag is mine to carry on, 

defending freedom and justice for all.

<P>As we rebuild ourselves from the most terrible assault we've ever known, we 

raise our flags for what we love, declaring that heartlessness can't steal 

heart. No insult can touch the fact that we care enough about our country to 

work for what's best in us.

<P>We've declared ourselves solidly behind New York and every victim of Sept. 

11, vowing that an injury to one of us is an injury to all. If our hearts are 

in that pledge, we can take the next step and dedicate ourselves to a mindful 

protection of religious and political minorities in our midst.

<P>There are as many ways to love America as there are Americans. Our country 

needs us all.
