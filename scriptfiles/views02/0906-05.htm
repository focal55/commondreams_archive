<p>I love this time of year - the climactic anomalies of summer drift imperceptibly 

into the climactic anomalies of autumn; the kids go back to school; the really 

important people return from their holidays and, well, it just puts you in the 

mood to bomb the shit out of somebody. But then, I'm not a really important person 

and am, therefore, a touch uncertain when it comes to picking which civilian population 

centers deserve to be turned into hamburger and grit. I mean, I'm not even clear 

why it's a good idea to bomb Saddam Hussein's civilians when it was a bad idea 

to bomb Pinochet's and Suharto's. 

<P>If being an evil madman, torturing and killing your own citizens and foreign 

nationals, and purchasing western hardware to do so are any kind of qualification, 

then we could have pounded innocent bystanders in Chile and Indonesia into dust 

ages ago. Pinochet liked to drop people into the ocean (dead and alive); Suharto 

preferred mass shootings and the odd alfresco castration; Saddam has a penchant 

for bombings. Which I can see might be a problem: Saddam and the Forces of Light 

have the same tactical specialty - how embarrassing, like turning up at a party 

in the same frock as your hostess. Saddam should have picked something more ethnic 

(snake pits, camel grenades), but we could find a compromise: the west uses high 

explosive, Iraq goes for anthrax, that would be fair. 

<P>People do worry about our Bombing Fairness Ratings; it's second only to poor 

TV coverage of missile attacks among factors likely to disturb the electorate. 

Perhaps if the voter could feel more involved. For instance, how hard would it 

be to add a top 10 of the nation's favorite targets to each televised national 

lotto draw? We'd be much more firmly behind George and Tony if they could make 

bombing fun. 

<P> For example, we could bomb people who talk in the cinema during films. It's 

a trivial transgression, but does indicate sociopathic tendencies - we have no 

real idea what these people might eventually do. Selecting five or six Exemplary 

Cinemas and bombing everyone inside would leave the rest of us with a sense of 

completion. You might argue that this kills non-talkers as well, but they have 

made a decision not to intervene and kill the talkers, so, frankly, they only 

have themselves to blame. 

<P>The simplest legislation could fill sports arenas and large car parks with 

people who look at you oddly or have offensive lifestyles, are bad whistlers or 

queue jumpers, use poor grammar or dress badly - just whoever prevents you from 

having a nice day. Of course, you could be on someone else's list, but that's 

half the thrill, isn't it? Will they obliterate you and your family before you 

can puree them? 

<P>There are more serious targets, naturally. If you do have a grudge against 

people inflicting death and misery on others, then the corporations and "green" 

oil companies could keep your rocket launchers warm for months - with special 

attention for Big Tobacco and those asbestos companies dragging their feet over 

compensation. Or you might want to blast the calcium out of all the property developers 

sitting on low-value green belt farmland, waiting until they've handed out enough 

brown envelopes to buy its reclassification as essential lebensraum for yuppie 

box maisonettes. Remember, you have the right to defend your country and your 

children's inheritance - apart from anything else, it always feels nice when you've 

finished. 

<P>Not that children aren't actually a little problematic - observers can get 

very sentimental when one or two children die, and 20 or 30 dead sons and daughters 

can upset them even more. But there is a solution: annihilate a few thousand kids 

and the impact of your actions mysteriously lessens - too much horror numbs the 

mind. This means your wisest course of action is to bomb all the children of all 

the groups you don't like, just to get those numbers up. Naturally, you'll also 

have to bomb their mothers, aunts and sisters, who will otherwise end up wailing, 

or demonstrating with annoyingly quiet dignity outside your embassy. 

<P>This kind of misogynistic carpet bombing will, unfortunately, piss off the 

affected husbands, uncles, brothers and so on - and the last thing you want is 

a mass of aggrieved blokes planning unimaginable revenge against your prudent 

security measures. So you'll have to bomb them, too, if you really want to defend 

your freedom-loving way of life and your own husbands, kids and whatnot. In fact, 

to be safe, you should blast every individual you dislike, their communities, 

their records, their journalists and any supporters they may have. It's tough 

and costly, but if it wasn't the only way, George and Tony and all those really 

important people would have told us, right?</p>
