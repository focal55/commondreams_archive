The U.S. policy toward the worsening Israeli-Palestinian conflict has swung from 

deliberately ignoring the escalating violence before Sept. 11, to open confrontation 

with Israel immediately afterward, to complete identification with Ariel Sharon 

now. 

<p> Meanwhile, horrifying attacks like the Jan. 17 killing of six Israelis at 

a bat mitzvah in Hadera by a Palestinian, and the deliberate flattening of dozens 

of Palestinian refugee homes in Gaza, and indiscriminate killings of Palestinian 

civilians by the Israeli army continue to take an intolerable toll for both sides.

<p> The immediate pretext for the latest U.S. shift toward Israel, however, was 

not any particular act of violence, but the capture Jan. 3 of the Karine A, a 

weapons ship allegedly destined for the Palestinian Authority. In the midst of 

an open conflict in which Israel has used every conventional weapon available 

to it - from M-16 rifles to F-16 warplanes - against Palestinians, who could really 

be surprised if some Palestinians seek to even the playing field? Or is the Bush 

administration - riding high on the war on terrorism but increasingly vulnerable 

due to the recession and the growing Enron scandal - simply unwilling to expend 

any political capital in an election year to challenge the instransigent Israeli 

lobby? 

<p> It will be a disaster if short-term domestic political considerations are 

allowed to trump the future of millions of ordinary Israelis and Palestinians, 

and the long-term U.S. interest in seeing these peoples at last live together 

in peace. The current U.S. approach, while seemingly pro-Israeli, will eventually 

hurt Israel as much as it will harm Palestinians.

<p> Even before his latest moves against Palestinian organizations, many Palestinians 

openly criticized Arafat for making major compromises without any concrete gains. 

In 1993 he led the PLO to recognize Israel within secure boundaries and agreed 

to negotiate while occupation and settlement construction continued. Arafat&#0039;s 

modest goal was to gain a state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Yet at the July 

2000 Camp David summit, Ehud Barak, Israel&#0039;s prime minister at the time, 

offered Palestinians not independence but a form of super-autonomy that would 

maintain all the structures of Israeli domination. 

<p> Meanwhile, Israeli land confiscation and routine human-rights abuses had made 

life under a seemingly endless occupation so intolerable that the Palestinian 

population rebelled. Israel&#0039;s deadly response to stone-throwing demonstrators 

lit the match to the ongoing orgy of violence.

<p> Israel&#0039;s humiliation and virtual imprisonment of Arafat does not deprive 

Palestinians of a beloved or highly respected leader - far from it. Yet it does 

threaten to destroy an important milestone for Israelis and Palestinians alike: 

the idea that a Palestinian leader, even a flawed one, can recognize Israel and 

make deep compromises for a workable peace. This may be precisely what Sharon 

and his supporters want, since they have never given up the dream of a Greater 

Israel stretching from the Mediterrannean to the Jordan River and perhaps beyond. 

<p> Palestinians who watch as the United States echoes that Arafat must crush 

all resistance to Israel, while Israel is allowed to do as it pleases, will be 

driven to conclude that fulfillment of their rights will come neither from making 

peace with Israel, nor from any intervention by the United States.

<p> This will strengthen support for those who believe the occupation will end 

only when the price of maintaining it becomes too high for Israel to bear. While 

Palestinians want only to live in peace and security in their own land, enough 

of them have been brutalized for so long that they no longer fear Israel or death. 

Hence no level of violence by the Israeli occupation will force Palestinians to 

acquiesce to it. 

<p> The Palestinian cause will survive the Arafat era, and Palestinians will be 

no less determined to win their freedom. But will the bloodshed have escalated 

so far that prospects for peace are even more remote than they are now? The United 

States can help answer that question, but the signs are not encouraging.
