<p>Although the economy was slowing even before President Bush took office, he 

has made the situation much worse than it had to be. What could have been a mild 

and brief recession has instead turned into a prolonged downturn likely to last 

more than two years.

<p>In terms of increases in unemployment and the gap between the economy's actual 

and potential performance, the downturn is already substantial.

<p>The president appears to believe that every economic problem is spelled T-A-X.

<p> That misguided thinking has precluded him from adopting a sound policy program.

<p>The centerpiece of his economic agenda, the tax cut that he pushed through 

Congress, was fiscally irresponsible.

<p>The administration also disingenuously disguised the true cost of the tax cut, 

both by having it magically disappear in 2010 and by using the little-known alternative 

minimum tax to reduce the recorded revenue loss.

<p>The administration belatedly tried to sell the tax cut as a short-term stimulus 

measure, but that is like arguing that a few new Ferraris are the solution to 

a city's public transportation problems. The cost-effectiveness is abysmally low.

<p>A much better alternative to the sports car approach to economic stimulus would 

have provided assistance to states and localities to meet the fiscal shortfall 

that inevitably develops as the economy goes into a downturn.

<p>This assistance would have provided more generous unemployment benefits to 

displaced workers, who will almost immediately spend the money on goods and services.

<p>Similarly, on the corporate scandals, the Bush administration should have acted 

faster and more resolutely.

<p>The administration still has not advocated legislation forcing companies to 

properly report stock options as expenses. The indiscriminate awarding of such 

options has been shown to be an important underlying source of the problems facing 

corporate America; they provided strong incentives to report large profits, and 

top executives did better for themselves by increasing these reported profits 

than by improving the fundamentals of the corporation.

<p>To be sure, I believed that the Clinton administration should have supported 

such a reform in the 1990s.

<p>At the time, my argument was based on the theory that bad information leads 

to bad decisions, with adverse consequences for the economy. Now we have the evidence.

<p>And yet the Bush administration still refuses to take the action.

<p>Some of my other qualms about economic policy during the 1990s apply with much 

more force now.

<p>For example, partly in an attempt to break the legislative deadlock with the 

conservative Republicans who took over Congress in 1995, the Clinton administration 

allowed the deregulation agenda to be pushed too far. But that does not mean Republican 

conservatives should be allowed to push it still further.

<p>Even today, the administration has not owned up to the excesses of the past--the 

mistakes, for instance, evidenced by electricity deregulation in California and 

elsewhere--nor has it set forth a program for dealing with the myriad scandals 

facing the financial industry, from allocations of initial public offerings of 

stock to distorted advice given by brokerage houses with clear conflicts of interest.

<p>As we should have learned long ago, market-friendly government regulation is 

necessary if markets are to work well.

<p>I wish that we had done more to address corporate welfare in the 1990s, but 

we didn't. Now Bush has made this situation much worse. Indeed, corporate coddling 

has reached new heights with soaring agriculture subsidies, most of which go to 

rich farmers and corporate farms, and new steel tariffs, which have rightly exposed 

us around the world to charges of hypocrisy.

<p>It's no secret that I am a tough grader on economic policy. The Bush administration 

may want to pretend that its F is really an A. But that won't change the reality.

<p>We'd all be better off if the administration would spend more time rethinking 

its policies and less time muddling the debate with doublespeak.</p>

the 2001 Nobel Memorial Prize in economics. He was chairman of the Council of 

Economic Advisors under President Clinton.</i></p>
