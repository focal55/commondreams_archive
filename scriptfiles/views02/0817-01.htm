<p>Jacqueline Marris and Tamara Brooks are my new heroines. These two brave Southern 

California teenagers not only acted to survive their ordeal but also made an important 

decision to speak out on national television after their kidnapping and rape Aug. 

1.

<p>With the loving support of their families, they performed a great service to 

rape survivors everywhere by refusing to be shamed into silence.

<p>Their act of courage, of course, does not mean that the stigma surrounding 

rape is fading.

<p> Media pundits revictimize these young women when they say that the teenagers 

came forward merely to claim their "15 minutes of fame." Brooks told reporters 

that they spoke because "We want to get the message across to everybody to never 

give up on anything. Whatever obstacles you have, you've got to fight your way 

through it."

<p>One of those obstacles is the societal stigma. My experiences, and those of 

hundreds of other rape survivors I have met, is that the stigma is alive and well.

<p>Justice Department figures tell us that one in six women have experienced an 

attempted or completed sexual assault. Maybe people feel that if they can distance 

themselves from the victims of rape by finding a reason to blame them, they and 

their loved ones won't be as vulnerable.

<p>Some examples of victim blaming I have heard from family, friends, neighbors, 

TV reporters, law officers, prosecutors and strangers include:

<p>"What were you wearing?"

<p>"What were you doing out so late?"

<p>"Be grateful you weren't hurt."

<p>"If you had only taken kickboxing, this never would have happened to you."

<p>"Why would your boyfriend want to stay with you?"

<p>Why go public, then, as more women are choosing to do? Their motivations may 

include changing antiquated laws, preventing rapes by the same perpetrator or 

helping others by putting a face to rape statistics and sharing their experiences 

of recovery.

<p>We can identify with a mother who speaks out after a drunk driver kills her 

child. Who would question why she would want to share her private grief and anger?

<p>Rape survivors who choose to speak publicly rarely have the support of their 

families, and too often don't have the support of rape crisis centers, which are 

concerned about the confidentiality of their critical counseling services.

<p>Jeri Elster, my friend and a fellow advocate of speaking out, was devastated 

when she discovered that her rapist, who was identified by DNA, could not be prosecuted 

because prosecutors ordered the testing after the then-six-year statute of limitations 

lapsed.

<p>Jeri says telling her story in front of TV cameras during state Assembly hearings 

was the best thing she ever did. Like a lot of survivors, Jeri felt completely 

disempowered by the rapist. It was a "much-needed emotional boost" to her when 

she helped change California law to effectively eliminate the statute of limitations 

on rape cases with DNA evidence.

<p>On Aug. 27, the 10th anniversary of Jeri's assault, she will lead a march in 

downtown L.A. to protest the disposal of DNA evidence by local law enforcement.

<p>Something unexpected happened after my own first interview on national TV about 

my rape. Women I knew and complete strangers came up to me and thanked me, whispering 

that they too had been raped. Most of them had never told anyone, not even their 

mothers and husbands.

<p>They are members of what I call the Secret Sorority, women silently burdened 

by the long-term effects of the trauma of rape. Rapists frequently threaten their 

victims: "Shut up!" and "If you tell anyone, I will come back and kill you!" When 

we decide to go public, we break their power over us. 

<p>No one aspires to be a poster girl for rape. We come out in spite of the risks, 

because we can and for our sisters who are scared silent.
