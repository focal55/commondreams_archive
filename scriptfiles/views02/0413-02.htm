Now that the Oscars are over and the best escapist diversions for the year 

have been chosen, it's time for a new award: the coveted DICK. Named after 

US vice president Dick Cheney, the DICK honors outstanding achievements in 

the art of duping the masses and using public resources for personal gain, 

and while this year's competition was understandably cut-throat, some DICKS 

clearly stand above the rest.



<p>The competition for Best Number-Fudging DICK was especially fierce this 

year, what with Enron's and Andersen's boards vying for top honors. An 

extraordinary performance at the House Armed Services Committee has yielded 

an even more deserving winner though ... US Defense Secretary Donald 

Rumsfeld! A Committee member has reported that in requesting a $48.1 billion 

increase to the military budget, Rumsfeld casually admitted that the 

Pentagon had misplaced $2.3 trillion. But not to worry, the missing 

trillions would no doubt surface in time, and certainly shouldn't influence 

the decision to grant an immediate additional $48.1 billion to the war 

machine. Funding is needed for important new weapons programs, and if that 

means cash will be diverted from little domestic programs, like oh, say, 

education and social services, then so be it. Apparently the missing $2.3 

trillion is no matter of real concern.



<p>The Best Supporting Domestic DICK category had so many competitors this 

year, it was impossible to call. Would the prize go to L. Brent Bozell III, 

founder of the conservative Media Research Center which devotes itself to 

"training our guns on any media outlet or any reporter interfering with 

America's war on terrorism or trying to undermine the authority of President 

Bush"? Could have, but then again why not give the Best Supporting Domestic 

DICK award to the entire US corporate media? The military incursions abroad 

and creeping societal rollback at home couldn't have happened without its 

myopic flag-waving support. Or that of the Democratic Party. Yes, just too 

many contenders! No winners this year: looks like we all are losers.



<p>More luck in the Best Supporting Foreign DICK category though. No surprise 

there ... big round of applause for UK Prime Minister Tony Blair! Always 

ready to salute US foreign policy, no matter how egregious or at what price 

domestically, Blair has proven an enthusiastic cheerleader for the Bush 

administration. Small matter that the local press mocks him as the 

"president's poodle" saying "whenever Bush has barked, Mr. Blair has rolled 

over with his legs in the air." Faced with sagging approval ratings and a 

crumbling domestic infrastructure, Blair gambles that war will give him the 

boost of legitimacy needed to hang on to office: if it worked for Thatcher 

in the Falklands, why not for Blair in Iraq? So British soldiers and weapons 

pour into quagmire war zones as Blair has Texan barbeques and postures at 

press conferences with Bush. Nice job Tony!



<p>The Best Profiteering DICK category was also crowded this year, but one 

candidate was just so much more ambitious and rapacious than the rest ... 

that's right, you guessed it  - "Read-his-lips" Bush Senior! If you sit on 

multiple defense contractor boards, it's always helpful to have a 

war-mongering son as US president. Carlyle and United Defense among others 

directly profit from Poppy Bush's connections (conflict of interest anyone?) 

and The London Observer has noted that Bush Sr.'s post-White House work has 

increased the family's net worth by several hundred percent.  Not limited to 

profiting from defense connections, Bush Sr. has made a killing from other 

operations too, such as the Canadian Barrick Goldstrike. Right before Bush 

Sr. left office in 1992, he helped coordinate signing over rights for a 

US-government owned estimated $10 billion gold mine in Nevada to Barrick - 

for only $10,000 in return. Any surprise that Barrick put Bush Sr. on its 

payroll soon after? And on and on. So The Best Profiteering DICK award 

winner for this year is particularly deserving, and we can look forward to 

accelerated Bush profit-taking in 2002.



<p>And now, drum roll please, our final winner for the grand prize of DICK Of 

The Year stays in the family - two thumbs up for Dubya! Where can we start? 

Stealing the presidential election, draining the US budget, targeting 

international environmental safeguards for destruction, alienating foreign 

allies while rolling back civil liberties at home, promoting escalating 

carnage (not to mention skyrocketing defense contractor profits) through the 

"War on Terror" - well, it's been quite a year. Not bad for a guy who was 

written off as a buffoon before September 11. Interesting that, according to 

Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney, Dubya placed a call to Majority Leader 

Senator Tom Daschle asking him not to investigate the 9-11 events, and that 

vice president Cheney also asked Daschle not to investigate the events that 

led to 9-11. It's like that $2.3 trillion - nothing to worry our little 

heads about.



<p>But the overriding question remains - who really is the biggest DICK? The 

"leader" getting away with duping the public, or the public allowing the 

leader to get away?
