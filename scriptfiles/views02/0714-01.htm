<p>All the headlines about corporate disclosures and the need for

transparency are sending shivers through the banking industry and its

regulators who have always lived in a protected and largely secret

world.</p>

<p>Hundreds of millions of dollars are expended on examinations of

depository institutions, but most of the key findings are treated as

inside information between the bankers and the regulators who see a

mutual advantage in keeping the depositors and investors-and even

Members of Congress-in the dark about the gritty details of their

performance. Only when an institution actually fails and taxpayer-backed

deposit insurance funds are lost do the hard facts of mismanagement and

regulatory miscues become public knowledge.</p>

<p>The lack of timely disclosures about bank conditions arose a few weeks 

ago when a recess appointee to the Securities and Exchange Commission, 

Cynthia Glassman, suggested that the so-called "Camel ratings" of banks 

be made available to the public. Camel ratings compiled by the

regulators are evaluations based on examiners' and supervisors'

assessment of six factors: capital, asset quality, management, earnings,

liquidity, and sensitivity to risk. Performance is based on numerical 

ratings of 1 to 5-with five designated as the worst.</p>

<p>Ms. Glassman's suggestion produced an immediate uproar among regulators 

and the bank lobbyists. Comptroller of the Currency John Hawke, who 

spent most of his career as a big-time bank lawyer and lobbyist,

immediately sent his spokesman out to denounce the idea of public

disclosure, contending that the Camel ratings were an "internal tool of

the regulators."</p>

<p>Other opponents suggested that disclosure of the ratings might cause a 

"run" on a bank by scared depositors. This brings back memories of the

savings and loan collapse in the 1980s when the Chairman of the Federal

Home Loan Bank-Danny Wall--continued to paint rosy pictures and withhold

bad news from the public while behind the scenes the savings 

institutions rotted and edged toward failure. At one point, Wall barged 

into the offices of the General Accounting Office in an attempt to block 

the release of a critical report citing mounting losses and increasing 

drains on the deposit insurance runs. And the friends of the savings and 

loans in key positions on Capitol Hill were all too happy to gloss over 

the worsening conditions until it was too late.</p>

<p>The costs to the taxpayers and the savings and loan industry

increased greatly under this blanket of secrecy. The public release of

the Camel ratings would make it impossible for regulators and banks to

hide conditions and let problems mushroom into disasters ala the savings

and loan collapse. And as the SEC's Ms. Glassman asks "why shouldn't

investors [as well as depositors] have this information."</p>

<p>Richard Carnell, a professor of law at Fordham University and former

Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, wholeheartedly endorses the idea of

public disclosure of the Camel ratings, arguing that the disclosure 

would "facilitate constructive criticism of how bank regulators measure 

risk." Carnell was one the key staffers on the Senate Banking Committee 

who urged action on the savings and loan crisis in the 1980s and crafted

many of the reforms after the collapse.</p>

<p>Rather than facing the market discipline which full disclosure would

help instill, the banks and other depository institutions prefer to 

utilize a costly deposit insurance system as a tranquilizer for the 

public. As thespeculation by the savings and loans revealed in the 

1980s, the taxpayer-backed insurance creates a moral hazard that 

encourages excessive risk taking.</p>

<p>Throughout this Congress, much of the banking industry has been on

Capitol Hill in an intensive lobbying campaign to have taxpayer-backed 

deposit insurance increased from its present limit of $100,000 per 

depositor to as much as $150,000 plus indexing for future inflation. The 

present $100,000 limit was pulled out of thin air in 1980 by a handful 

of House-Senate conferees seeking a means of helping the ailing savings 

and loans attract deposits in competition with big money center banks. 

Actually, under loopholes, a family of four could keep as much as two 

million dollars in insured accounts in a single institution.</p>

<p>The secrecy maintained by federal regulators combined with the

tranquilizer of the massive deposit insurance program effectively takes

the public out of the debate about banking policy. As a result, it is 

difficult to build public opinion about legislative and regulatory 

actions which impact on the safety and soundness-not to mention the 

efficiency--of banking corporations, and ultimately on the health of the 

deposit insurance funds.</p>

<p>That was certainly the case in 1999 when the combined lobbying forces

of banks, securities firms and insurance companies pushed through a near 

total rewrite of the nation's financial laws which authorized the 

formation of huge nationwide financial conglomerates-with little or no 

protections for consumers or the taxpayers who stand behind the deposit 

insurance funds.</p>

<p>So, the idea advanced by a lone member of the Securities and Exchange

Commission for disclosure of the regulators' ratings of banks is a 

welcome development in this desolate desert of secrecy which surrounds 

the banking industry. But, don't expect the banks or their regulators to 

agree voluntarily to come out in the sunshine. It is too convenient to 

leave bank regulation asan inside-game. The same is true for the 

Congress-particularly the House and Senate Banking Committees-which 

prefer to legislate favors for the industry without being bothered with 

messy facts in the hands of their voters back home.</p>

<p>But the Enrons, the Worldcoms and the Global Crossings-among others-are 

placing a new premium on open disclosure. Perhaps, the sunshine may 

ultimately reach the musty dark corners of the secret world of banks and 

bank regulation.</p>
