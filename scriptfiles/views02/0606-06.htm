<p>With a decision on Fast Track before a conference committee in the US House of Representatives we must consider how the effects of poorly debated trade agreements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement have disproportionally impacted women. NAFTA was passed under a Fast Track provision, which restricts the time Congress has to debate and does not allow amendments.

</P>

<P>Women are often the last hired and the first laid off from the workforce. Oregon has lost 11,000 jobs as a result of trade since NAFTA went into effect in 1994, according to figures from the Economic Policy Institute in Washington, D.C. Clearly any more trade agreements that further open the gate for a global race to find the lowest cost workers will hit women the hardest at a time when Oregon suffers from the nation's highest unemployment rate. Oregon is also first in the nation for hunger. What gain is there if a product is cheaper if once the money is spent your homeless and hungry and there is no job to replace it?

</P>

<P>As Oregon corporations, such as Columbia Sportswear, have been relocating manufacturing jobs out of the USA and increasing imports, statistics from the Bureau of Labor show that 60 percent of trade related layoffs affected women. These jobs are often manufacturing/trade based and, in a trade like textiles, for example, the layoffs have been devastating around the USA. South Carolina, for instance, has lost 53,900 textile jobs since the free trade agreement with Mexico. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities reports that in 1999, 33.5 percent of working single women and their children were living in poverty in the USA. Here, inside the wealthiest nation on Earth, children are living at third world standards and yet we are expected to support trade policies that are pulling jobs away from these families?

</P>

<P>Oregon NOW's task force for Feminist Trade Issues and Globalization's concern lies not just with American women but also with the adverse effect Free Trade as a negotiating model has had on families around the globe. There has been a rise in child labor world wide, at the same time as there is growing division between rich and poor. Free Trade is being used to lower not just tariffs but the regulatory standards that protect public health, environmental laws, consumer safety and consumer choices. As for working people, according to Mark Weisbrot, Co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, "for at least 70 percent of the US labor force, the liberalization of trade and investment over the last 20 years has lowered wages." Women find that they and their families are the least able to protect themselves from this race to the bottom.

</P>

<P>Clearly it is not in the interests of a sustainable economy or a healthy society to support a Fast Track agreement that does not have specific protections for women, public health and safety, workers and the environment. Surely this deserves a full and open debate. We urge a NO vote on Fast Track.
