<p>It's 10 p.m. -- do you know what your government is up to? It seems that Iraq is

not the only &quot;regime change&quot; that the Bush Administration is working

on. The US government has apparently decided that President Chavez of Venezuela

must go, one way or another.</p>

<p>

True, Saddam Hussein is a brutal tyrant who has invaded and threatened

neighboring countries -- whereas Hugo Chavez was democratically elected, has

shown no ill will toward any of his neighbors, and tolerates a steady barrage of

virulent, hate-filled propaganda against his presidency from the major

Venezuelan media.</p>

<p>

But these distinctions can be blurred, because both have offended the US

government, and both are sitting on a lot of oil. So most Americans can be

forgiven for having similar impressions of the two leaders, given what they hear

from the US media. A recent op-ed in the <i>Washington Post</i> referred to the

Chavez government as a &quot;dictatorship.&quot;</p>

<p>

This week the country's main business federation, supported by some union

leaders, called once again for a general strike against the Chavez government.

They are apparently following the same scenario that led to the military coup on

April 11.</p>

<p>

In our amnesiac political culture, half a year can be an eternity, more than

enough time for history to be rewritten and slates wiped clean. But it was

barely more than six months ago, on April 11, that opposition forces overthrew

the democratically elected government of Venezuela. They installed the head of

the business federation as president and dissolved the legislature and the

Supreme Court.</p>

<p>The Bush administration at first welcomed the coup, retreating the next day

after it became clear that other countries in the Americas were not going to

recognize the illegal government. And of course administration officials denied

having anything to do with the coup.</p>

<p>

There is a pile of evidence to the contrary, indicating that they had a lot to

do with it. There were numerous meetings between Bush administration officials

and coup leaders in the months preceding the coup. We also know that the

opposition received money from the United States government.</p>

<p>

But even more important is the political support and encouragement that

Washington provides. Those who are trying to overthrow the government of

Venezuela at this very moment know that the United States will do its best to

recognize and support any resulting dictatorship. They know this because neither

the White House nor the State Department has indicated that a coup would result

in any diplomatic or commercial sanctions against an illegal government.</p>

<p>It would be a simple matter for the Bush Administration to make such a

statement. But even in the recent mobilizations of October 21 and December 2,

with rumors of coup attempts flying everywhere, our top officials have

maintained a telling silence, and carefully avoided saying anything that would

discourage the violent opposition.</p>

<p>The US also supports the opposition's call for early elections. Although the

Venezuelan constitution provides for a recall election halfway through the

President's term, the opposition does not want to wait until August.</p>

<p>

There are two reasons for their impatience: first, the economy is in a deep

recession right now, and it could very well recover by August. Venezuela's

economy would get a tremendous boost from an increase in oil prices that would

likely result from a war with Iraq. Second, the recession is prolonged and

deepened because investors are essentially on strike against the government,

taking money out of the country and withholding investment in hope of getting a

new President. Like any strike, it cannot continue indefinitely.</p>

<p>

Of course it does not make any more sense for Chavez to hold early elections

than it would have for President Reagan to have done so in 1983, when -- due to

a recession and high unemployment -- his approval rating bottomed at 35 percent.</p>

<p>But the US press -- together with the Bush administration -- pretends that this

is a perfectly reasonable demand.</p>

<p>

A little noticed retraction published in the Chicago Tribune on April 20 summed

up the extreme prejudice of our major news organizations against the president

of Venezuela: &quot;An editorial on Sunday mistakenly said that Venezuelan

President Hugo Chavez had praised Osama bin Laden. The Tribune regrets the

error.&quot;</p>
