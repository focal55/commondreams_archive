<p>Hundreds of billions of dollars of the nation's wealth-the people's

resources-are being openly confiscated by corporate interests.</p>



<p>Government, the presumed protector of the public's property, has become,

instead, the enabler of the plunder and theft. The media, the nation's

self-professed watchdog, is apathetic, at best, in sounding the alarm

about the people's loss of control over resources they have paid for or

inherited from previous generations. These are the resources that

citizens legally hold in common-their common wealth.</p>



<p>As a result, corporations have found it easy to lay claim to a wide

range of public resources-from publically-funded medical advances to

national forests, public spaces in cities, the Internet, software

innovations, the airwaves, the public domain of creative works, the DNA

of animals, plants and humans. The appetite of Big Business for the

appropriation of public resources is limitless. Even public education

has not escaped the ambition of corporate control and takeover.</p>



<p>Surprisingly, corporate appropriation-the privatization--of public

resources has proceeded quietly with only sporadic public outcries

against the most blatant thefts. One public interest activist and

author-David Bollier-is making a valiant effort to change that. As

Bollier argues, the abuses go unnoticed because the thefts are generally

seen "only in glimpses, not in panorama, when it is visible at all."</p>



<p>Bollier's new book "Silent Theft-The Private Plunder of Our Common

Wealth" (Routledge, New York and London) is a loud wake-up call for

citizens interested in halting the steady exploitation and erosion of

the nation's resources and values for short-term gains by the few. And

the book does, indeed, provide the reader a wide, vivid and scary

panoramic view of what is happening to the public's resources-"the

commons" as Bollier calls them.</p>



<p>"We have become a nation of eager consumers-and disengaged citizens-and 

so are ill-equipped to perceive how our common resources are being 

abused," Bollier says. Bollier moves quickly to specifics- breakthrough

cancer drugs that our tax dollars helped develop, and the rights to

which pharmaceutical companies acquired for a song for which they now

charge exorbitant prices. The archaic 1872 law which gives mining

companies the lucrative right to mine valuable mineral resources on our

public lands for $5 an acre-a right that the mining industry preserves

through what Bollier describes as "well-deployed campaign

contributions."</p>



<p>Bollier is especially critical of the federal government's role in

giving away its most promising drug research and development to the drug

companies for a fraction of its actual value with the companies then 

charging whatever prices they can make the desperately ill bear.</p>



<p>"It is a sweet deal for drugmakers but an outrage for millions of

American taxpayers and consumers," Bollier says. "It is a scandalous

fact that the fruits of risky and expensive scientific work typically do

not accrue to the sponsors/investors-the American people-until drug

companies have extracted huge markups of their own. The American people

pay twice, first as taxpayers, reaping a lower (or nonexistent) return

on their investments, and second as consumers paying higher drug prices

charged by pharmaceutical companies."</p>



<p>Bollier reminds the reader that Americans own collectively one third of

the surface area of the country and billions of acres of the outer

continental shelf. The resources are extensive and valuable: huge

supplies of oil, coal, natural gas, uranium, copper, gold, silver,

timber grasslands, water and geothermal energy. The nation's public land

also consists of vast tracts of wilderness forests, unspoiled coastline,

sweeping prairies, the Rocky Mountains, and dozens of beautiful rivers,

and lakes.</p>



<p>"As the steward of these public resources, the government's job is to

manage these lands responsibly for the long-term," Bollier argues. "The

sad truth is that the government stewardship of this natural wealth

represents one of the great scandals of the 20th Century. While the

details vary from one resource to another, the general history is one of

antiquated laws, poor enforcement, slipshod administration,

environmental indifference and capitulation to industry's most

aggressive demands."</p>



<p>The increasing exploitation of the commons, Bollier argues, needlessly

siphons hundreds of billions of dollars away from the public purse each

year that could be used for countless varieties of social investment,

environmental protection and other public initiatives. The public's

assets and revenue streams are privatized with only fractional benefits

accruing to the public in

return, he says.</p>



<p>Bollier also contends that the enclosure of the "commons" by market

forces (usually the bigger companies) tends to foster market

concentration, reduce competition and raise consumer prices. He says it

also threatens the environment by favoring short-term exploitation over

long-term stewardship-"the flagrant abuses of public lands by timber,

mining and agribusiness companies are prime examples."</p>



<p>Despite his vigorous criticism of the exploitation and neglect of the

public's resources-"the commons"-Bollier remains optimistic that people

can be galvanized to reverse the current trend.</p>



<p>"Americans have a long tradition of creating innovative vehicles for

ensuring fair return to the American people on resources they

collectively own," he writes. "It is time to revive this tradition of

innovation in the stewardship of public resources and give it

imaginative new incarnations in the twenty-first century."</p>



<p>For anyone interested in joining the effort to reverse the

corporate exploitation of our public resources-David Bollier's "Silent 

Theft" is a first-class starting point.</p>
