<p>In attempting to make the case for invading Iraq, President Bush's speech 

Monday night revealed the folly of the new doctrine of pre-emptive attack. 

More clearly than any other statement by the White House, the president laid 

bare the weakness of his administration's foreign policy.

<P>According to the president, "we cannot wait for the final proof" that 

Saddam Hussein's government is planning an imminent attack against the United 

States. Even though President Bush acknowledged in his speech that Iraq does 

not currently threaten the United States, he said we must "assume the worst." 

Essentially, the White House is proposing that the United States invade a 

distant country without any evidence of impending aggression.

<P>Bush also spoke of an "international coalition" that would disarm Hussein. 

Bush knows the American public is loathe to go it alone. What he failed to do 

was tell us who the members of his war coalition are. Why? Because there is no 

coalition. Quite the contrary, Bush's aggressive rhetoric, disregard for 

international law, and his lack of any vision other than war without end is 

causing traditional friends of the United States to join the majority of the 

world's nations in distancing themselves from Washington in a fashion not seen 

since the Vietnam War.

<P>The flimsy justifications President Bush has provided for an urgent Iraq invasion 

have not convinced the world community. Iraq's neighbors, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, 

reject the notion of an imminent threat. The Muslim world -- whose support is 

vital to any real effort to end the causes of terrorism -- is adamantly opposed. 

In Europe, only England's Tony Blair and Italy's Silvio Berlusconi have voiced 

support for Bush. They both do so in the face of majority opposition from their 

fellow citizens and street demonstrations of hundreds of thousands of people. 

<P>Many in the global community also distrust the Bush administration's 

expanding war aims. It is not easy for our friends around the world to stomach 

the imperial scent of our newly enunciated military doctrine that proposes pre-

emption of any powerful rivals.

<P>The president wants to launch a war based on assumptions, and therein lies 

a problem. One of the great advances of the modern era has been the spread of 

the rule of law. This is the now common idea that democratically decided laws -

- not the capriciousness of individual rulers -- should govern human affairs.

<P>During the last half of the 20th century, this principle was expanded 

internationally through the United Nations. The U.N. weapons inspections in 

Iraq represent a good example of how the rule of law has been used, and can be 

used again, to avert conflict.

<P>Perhaps most repugnant to our allies is the transparent effort by the Bush 

Administration to eviscerate U.N. inspection and disarmament activities. They 

see a pattern of the Bush administration continuously upping the ante with 

Iraq, apparently to avoid a non-military outcome. They know that an American 

invasion will dramatically undermine the painstakingly constructed framework 

of international law built since World War II. The White House's belief that 

it can invade nations pre-emptively, without proof of an imminent attack, 

represents a major assault on that international rule of law.

<P>The Bush Administration's doctrine of pre-emptive attack raises troubling 

questions. What burden of proof will be used to decide when a pre-emptive 

attack is called for? If only assumptions are needed to launch a war, how will 

we separate true threats from phantom menaces? If clear evidence of impending 

aggression is not required to invade another country, what standards will be 

employed to decide when, where, and who to attack?

<P>By tossing out any reasonable standards of evidence as a prerequisite for 

military action, the White House puts us in a state of constant uncertainty 

and increased insecurity where almost anything could lead to war.

<P>President Bush says he wants to avoid "a future of fear." It's an admirable 

goal, but one hardly served by this new doctrine. In fact, the idea of pre-

emptive attack depends on fear. It presupposes insecurity and assumes we will 

always be threatened. Whereas the Cold War doctrine of deterrence and 

containment rested on strength, the new idea of pre-emption insists on U.S. 

vulnerability.

<P>There is no security in a world where wars can be started on nothing more 

than assumptions. When the smallest suspicion or the least distrust can ignite 

conflict, no one is safe. In the long run, pre-emptive wars will break down 

the international rule of law and erode global stability, jeopardizing all 

nations' security.

<P>President Bush's pre-emptive wars won't preserve the peace. Rather, the 

notion of pre-emptive war makes conflict all the more likely. It sets the 

United States on a course of permanent war.

<P>Members of Congress who stood in opposition to Bush have shown courage and 

wisdom. They are reflecting a profound unease with this war across the United 

States. In poll after poll, majorities of Americans are on the record being 

opposed to war with Iraq if the United States acts alone. Our leaders should 

listen to the people. We know our true safety as a nation flows from 

cooperation, not unilateral war.
