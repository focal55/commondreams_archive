<p>Even though he is unlikely to succeed in preventing a Congressional grant of 

blank-check warmaking powers to the Bush administration, Senator Robert Byrd, 

D-West Virginia, has done America the service of clarifying the issue at hand. 

Thanks to Byrd's fierce denunciations of an unnecessary resolution to promote 

an unnecessary war, members of Congress who side with the administration will 

not be able to plead ignorance to the charge that they abandoned their Constitutionally-mandated 

responsibilities in order to position themselves for the fall election. </p>

<p> Rarely in the history of the Senate has a member so bluntly identified the 

hypocrisy of the White House on a question of warmaking. But there was no partisan 

malice in Byrd's remarks. In a remarkable speech delivered as the Senate opened 

its debate on Bush's request for broad authority to use military force against 

Iraq, Byrd chastised his fellow Democrats for engaging in equally contemptible 

acts. </p>

<p> "The newly bellicose mood that permeates this White House is unfortunate, 

all the moreso because it is clearly motivated by campaign politics. Republicans 

are already running attack ads against Democrats on Iraq. Democrats favor fast 

approval of a resolution so they can change the subject to domestic economic problems," 

declared the senior Democratic senator. "Before risking the lives of American 

troops, all members of Congress -- Democrats and Republicans alike -- must overcome 

the siren song of political polls and focus strictly on the merits, not the politics, 

of this most serious issue." </p>

<p> With fury entirely appropriate to the moment, Byrd roared: "We are rushing 

into war without fully discussing why, without thoroughly considering the consequences, 

or without making any attempt to explore what steps we might take to avert conflict. 

The resolution before us today is not only a product of haste; it is also a product 

of presidential hubris. This resolution is breathtaking in its scope. It redefines 

the nature of defense, and reinterprets the Constitution to suit the will of the 

Executive Branch. It would give the President blanket authority to launch a unilateral 

preemptive attack on a sovereign nation that is perceived to be a threat to the 

United States. This is an unprecedented and unfounded interpretation of the President's 

authority under the Constitution, not to mention the fact that it stands the charter 

of the United Nations on its head." </p>

<p> Typically, Byrd was strongest when he asked today's politicians to square 

their actions against the historical imperatives and insights that he, above all 

other members of Congress, recognizes and understands. In a speech that began 

with reference to the Roman historian Titus Livius and closed with a detailed 

recreation of the Senate debate that preceded the 1991 Persian Gulf War, Byrd 

summoned the words of an Illinois congressman who in the 1840s chastised a proponent 

of expanded presidential warmaking powers: </p>

<p> "Representative Abraham Lincoln, in a letter to William H. Herndon, stated: 

‘Allow the President to invade a neighboring nation whenever he shall deem it 

necessary to repel an invasion, and you allow him to do so whenever he may choose 

to say he deems it necessary for such purpose - - and you allow him to make war 

at pleasure... The provision of the Constitution giving the war-making power to 

Congress, was dictated, as I understand it, by the following reasons: Kings had 

always been involving and impoverishing their people in wars, pretending generally, 

if not always, that the good of the people was the object. This, our Convention 

understood to be the most oppressive of all Kingly oppressions; and they resolved 

to so frame the Constitution that no one man should hold the power of bringing 

this oppression upon us. But your view destroys the whole matter, and places our 

President where kings have always stood.'" </p>

<p> The West Virginian asked the Senate: "If he could speak to us today, what 

would Lincoln say of the Bush doctrine concerning preemptive strikes?" No doubt, 

Lincoln would join millions of Americans in telling senators to listen to the 

wisdom of Robert Byrd.</p> </p>
