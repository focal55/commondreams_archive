<p>PHILIP BERRIGAN&#39;S public life was all about symbol: He took a hammer to 

war planes, beating them symbolically into plowshares. He poured blood on government 

documents, burned draft records with homemade napalm and served a total of 11 

years in prison for crimes against authority. 

<P> But it was a life of substance and deep spirituality as well. The former Josephite 

priest who died Friday and whose funeral was yesterday witnessed for peace long 

after his &quot;actions&quot; lost their shock value. 

<P> He was the most famous member of the Catonsville Nine, a group of otherwise 

law-abiding Americans who grabbed draft records and burned them outside a Selective 

Service office in Catonsville in 1968. 

<P> From that day forward, Philip Francis Berrigan sought out demonstrations against 

military power - and particularly nuclear weapons. He welcomed the prison terms 

he earned, saying that only there could he truly identify with the poor. 

<P> He led Bible study classes for inmates and helped them with educational and 

legal problems. On the outside, he painted houses for a living and gave his money 

away. He criticized his church for being hostile to the poor. 

<P> His superiors in the Baltimore chancery worried in 1968 that civil disobedience 

of the sort practiced that day in Catonsville would &quot;alienate a great number 

of sincere men in the cause of a just peace.&quot; He hoped a group of middle-class 

citizens and clergy might trigger a broader and more powerful movement against 

the war. He was at least partially right - something that seems to have given 

him little solace in the face of incessant war or war planning. His death seems 

more poignant, coming as it does with the nation preparing for war yet again. 

<P> In his own heart, he confessed, he worried about giving up, of ending his 

campaign against war. &quot;I hope that I can keep going until ... until I die,&quot; 

he said. Surely, he did. 

<P> In a last statement of belief, he wrote, &quot;I die with the conviction, 

held since 1968 and Catonsville, that nuclear weapons are the scourge of the earth 

... a curse against God, the human family and the earth itself.&quot; 

<P> Because of &quot;myopic leadership,&quot; &quot;greed for possessions&quot; 

and a public &quot;chained to corporate media,&quot; he concluded, the nation 

has scarcely responded to the nuclear threat. 

<P> However one might view his politics or his view of the world, he lived a life 

of rare commitment to conscience and belief.
