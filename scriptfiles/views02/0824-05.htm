<p>Congress is gingerly "debating" war against Iraq. There are sharp differences 

over whether the timing is proper and about the balance between costs and benefits. 

However, the accounting is so narrow that the biggest questions are mostly off 

limits. 

<p>It's not only a matter of whether a US war for "regime change" in Iraq makes 

sense. What ought to be debated is the Bush doctrine of pre-emptive war, a historic 

shift in international policy and philosophy. Do the times demand so fundamental 

a reversal? Where does it lead? 

<p>If a real debate shapes up, here are just a few matters of logic that Congress 

might weigh: 

<p>1) The primary argument for the Bush doctrine and its implementation against 

Iraq is that terrorists would be able to obtain weapons of mass destruction from 

Saddam. If a terrorist group is bent on getting such weapons, is Iraq likely to 

be the source? With all the attention on Iraq, there are unfortunately many more 

convenient places to do nefarious business. Many countries have developed weapons 

of mass destruction vastly more formidable than Saddam could achieve. It is not 

rare for corruption to penetrate military and corporate circles, and organized 

crime networks are global. A terrorist might do better in Russia, China, Israel, 

Pakistan, and India. For that matter, the terrorist who mailed deadly anthrax 

presumably found his source in the bowels of the US biological weapons program. 

A cautionary tale about what money may buy is the recent arrest of Israeli settlers 

and soldiers for selling arms to Palestinian groups. A new Gulf War, with all 

its tragic consequences, doesn't answer the problem. 

<p>2) Beyond Iraq, the Bush Doctrine sets up a terrible dilemma for the future. 

What if other countries, which (unlike Iraq) have established biological and nuclear 

military capacities, undergo political changes antagonistic to supposed US interests? 

We have never been short of designated "enemies" and "evil-doers", and that is 

hardly contingent on the fate of Saddam Hussein. Are we prepared to handle disputes 

that may arise with other nuclear powers on the basis of the doctrine of pre-emptive 

strike? For that matter, can we entrust every future American chief-of-state (not 

to speak of the current hawkish Administration) with the power of unilateral military 

pre-emption? 

<p>3) Can the doctrine of pre-emptive war be a strictly American privilege? Henry 

Kissinger has argued, "it is not in America's national interest to establish pre-emption 

as a principle available to every nation" (Los Angeles Times Syndicate International, 

August 9, 2002). How do we get ourselves a copyright on pre-emption? The almost 

universal opposition outside the United States to war against Iraq is only a forerunner 

of the international distrust that the Bush Doctrine will create. If pre-emptive 

military strike is OK for the USA, will it be acceptable for China or Russia or 

Pakistan or any other nation? No wonder the world is leery. As much as the power 

of the United States is recognized by all, the rest of the world is not ready 

to have its fate determined in Secretary Rumsfeld's war room. 

<p>The tragedy we're heading toward is all the worse because hope for a better 

future is exactly in the opposite direction. Only serious international cooperation 

can cope with the daunting problems of our times. The Bush Doctrine succumbs to 

unprecedented alienation in a hostile world. It is the antithesis of a solution 

to the horrors of terrorism and war. 

<p>Never was a thorough national discussion more needed. Congress should drop 

the restraints and open the doors to real debate.
