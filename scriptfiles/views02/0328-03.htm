 "If you're so rich, why aren't you smart?"

That ought to be the question of the year for the

big financial gurus, many of whom promoted

stocks of companies like Enron, Global Crossing

and other houses of cards right up to their

collapse.



         

<p>It's not like you had to be an accounting

genius to see through some of the tricks these

companies used: e.g. Enron counting the entire

value of its energy trades as revenue, instead of

just the commissions that they actually earned.

But this raises a bigger question about the whole

stock market bubble, and one that is still relevant:

what do these people and companies that offer

financial advice really know?



         

<p>Millions of people who put their

retirement savings in stocks within the past couple

of years now find that they will be working

longer, and retiring less comfortably than they had

planned. Yet most of them were told by financial

planners, not to mention the business pundits, that

stocks were a sure bet -- at least for those who

were holding for the long run.



         

<p>But even now, with the S & P 500 off 25

percent from its peak, stocks are still highly

overvalued by any historic measure. This means

that the average person holding stocks today is

almost certainly going to do very badly, if they

are investing for the long term.



         

<p>How can we know this? Well, over the

long run, no one holds stocks just because they

have faith in the future. At some point the

companies have to deliver earnings that justify the

prices of these stocks; otherwise investors will

move into bonds and other assets, and the price of

stocks will fall.



         

<p>Right now the average stock has a price-

to-earnings ratio that is about 23 to 1, even

looking at pre-recession earnings. That's about 59

percent higher than the historic average of 14.5 to

1 over the last 75 years. In other words, the price

of stocks -- relative to the earnings that the

underlying companies are capable of producing --

is 59 percent higher than it used to be.



         

<p>At present, no one has come up with a

scenario for the economy that would explain how

stocks could maintain such a high value relative to

earnings, over the long run. At least, there is no

scenario that is consistent with what economists

are willing to believe is a plausible story about our

economic future.



         

<p>For example, today's stock prices might be

sustainable if stocks were considerably less risky

than they were in the past. So much less risky that

people were willing to hold them for a real return

of about 4.5 percent year, or not much more than

they could get on a government bond. But who do

you know that is investing in stocks for these

kinds of returns?



         

<p>Alternatively, stocks could be a good long-

term investment if the economy were to grow

twice as fast in the future as it did over the last 20

or 30 years. But you won't find anyone betting on

that prospect.



         

<p>All of this is arithmetic, and the numbers

can be put on a spreadsheet. The interesting thing

is that so few of the professionals seem to care

whether their advice is consistent with what they

know about the economy. When was the last time

you heard a financial advisor even try to explain

why he or she did not consider today's overpriced

stock market to be a bubble?



         

<p>Of course there are often severe conflicts

of interests involved: for example, stock analysts

promoted failing technology companies that

generated fees for the Wall Street brokerage firms

employing them. And if you are a mutual fund

manager investing other people's money, there is

an incentive to follow the herd. The conventional

wisdom holds that you will be blamed if you miss

out on a speculative run-up in stock prices while

everyone else is riding it; and perhaps not burned

so badly if your performance crashes along with

everyone else's when the bubble bursts.



         

<p>But these institutional failings can't

explain why so many professionals advised

buying into a bubble at its peak, nor the general

lack of respect for logic and arithmetic. A nagging

question remains: what do financial advisors

really know?
