<p>Last week Citigroup, the nation's largest financial services holding

company, trotted out one of its top executives, Robert Rubin, to spread

some soothing words about how to clean up the corporate scandals and

repair the sagging stock market.</p>

<p>Rubin's (and Citigroup's) message appeared as a lengthy op-ed in the

Washington Post under the headline "To Regain Confidence." As former

Secretary of Treasury in the Clinton Administration, Rubin commands a

following, particularly in the financial press so important to

Citigroup's vast empire.</p>

<p>The need for Citigroup to use Rubin to pose as an ally of reform became 

obvious two days later when the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on 

Investigations released hundreds of pages of documents that the

Subcommittee Chairman Carl Levin said proves that Citigroup and J. P.

Morgan Chase "knowingly assisted Enron Corporation in disguising debt by

structuring sham financing vehicles."</p>

<p>The scheme not only facilitated Enron's deception which cost investors

and employees hundreds of millions of dollars, but earned more than $200

million in fees for Citigroup and J. P. Morgan Chase.</p>

<p>Citigroup's Rubin didn't provide an inkling of his bank's complicity

in the Enron scandal when he penned his piece for the Washington Post.

But he may well have had Citigroup's secret involvement in mind when he

argued that "regulatory and legislative changes and enforcement should

be balanced and appropriate."</p>

<p>With the revelations pouring out of the Senate hearing, it is

understandable that Citigroup and its executives would be entering a

plea for "balanced and appropriate" enforcement-a light tap on the

wrist, perhaps.</p>

<p>At least one Senator at the hearing-Peter Fitzgerald of

Illinois--raised questions about how many of the current scandals could

be blamed on Congress' decision in 1999 to allow banks, insurance

companies and securities firms to merge and form giant financial

conglomerates such as Citigroup.</p>

<p>That question must have troubled both Citigroup and Rubin who played

such major roles in the enactment of the legislation-Rubin as Secretary

of the Treasury and Citigroup as the biggest beneficiary of the action.

Rubin left the Treasury in July of 1999 and Citigroup announced he had

been hired by the corporation on October 26-four days after the final

compromise was reached on the legislation.</p>

<p>In answering Senator Fitzgerald's question about the wisdom of the 1999 

legislation which merged banks and securities firms, Lynn Turner, the

former chief accountant of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said

"securities firms and banking firms can't be working together, entering

into transactions together and using the security arm to try to get

banking business."</p>

<p>That echoed what many of us warned the Congress about repeatedly when 

the legislation was being hammered through by Rubin and Citigroup and

the biggest players in the financial industry. The lobbying, greased

with record campaign contributions from financial services corporations,

drowned out all warnings about the dangers now so apparent in Enron and

other corporate debacles.</p>

<p>For consumer and community organizations around the nation, the new

revelations about Citigroup should come as no surprise. Community

groups have been trying for years to get legislative and regulatory

action that would halt predatory lending and other deceptive practices

by Citigroup's affiliates.</p>

<p>Citigroup became the nation's largest predatory lender when it acquired 

Associates First Capital in September 2000 and merged it with another 

its subsidiaries, CitiFinancial Credit. Last year, the Federal Trade

Commission (FTC) filed lawsuit against Associates First Capital,

Citigroup and CitiFinancial Credit Company seeking an injunction against

unfair and deceptive lending practices.</p>

<p>Here is what Jodie Bernstein, director of FTC's Bureau of Consumer

Protection, had to say about the practices of the Citigroup affiliates:</p>



<p>"They hid essential information from consumers, misrepresented loan

terms, flipped loans and packed optional fees to raise the costs of the

loans. What had made the alleged practices more egregious is that they

primarily victimized consumers who were the most vulnerable-hard working

homeowners who had to borrow to meet emergency needs and often had no

other access to capital."</p>

<p>Last year, Citigroup paid $20 million to North Carolina customers of

Associates and $300,000 to the state to settle allegations that

consumers had been tricked into buying expensive and unneeded credit

life insurance as part of their mortgage loans. The New York Times

reported last fall that Citigroup had settled 200 lawsuits pertaining to

practices of Associates with at least

twice that number still pending in the courts.</p>

<p>But, these facts, like the funny money games now revealed in the Senate 

hearings, were strangely missing in Robert Rubin's lengthy rendition in

the Washington Post about actions that were needed for the nation to

regain confidence.</p>

<p>To paraphrase an old adage: Citigroup, heal thyself.</p>
