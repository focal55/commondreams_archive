<i>“Washington (AP)—The government has called on law enforcement 

personnel across the nation to remain vigilant against domestic terrorism until March 11, extending a standing alert through the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City."</i> 







<p><b>1. 

Report suspicious behavior.</b>  Use common sense.  If an Arab-looking individual is out in your neighborhood late at night poking in a car trunk, that does not necessarily warrant calling the FBI.  Nor, for that matter, should you over react if you seen an Arab-looking person on an airplane.  That might make authorities mad as heck.  Truly suspicious behavior consists of something like finding someone odd trying to learn how to fly big jet planes that can be loaded with jet fuel and turned into dangerous weapons.  Be sure to report anything of that sort to the FBI immediately so they can efficiently thwart terrorism. 



<p><b>2. 

Listen to Donald Rumsfeld.</b>  Not for nothing has the Secretary of Defense emerged as the debonair authoritative voice of the Pentagon.  His briefings will boost your confidence in the war against terrorism and help you realize that our government does not engage in killing civilians in Afghanistan or anywhere else in the world.  With people like Nelson Mandela and that irksome New Hampshire economist with his civilian death statistics running about being negative, we are fortunate to have Mr. Rumsfeld’s soothing words. 



<p><b>3. 

Watch CNN.</b> What better way to stay in a state of high alert than watching CNN’s continuing sound and light show coverage of the war on terrorism.  The useful running scrawl at the bottom on the screen is filled with tidbits of information about all aspects of the ongoing crisis.  To be sure, the major networks will rise to the occasion when things get really rough, and the visage of Dan Rather affirming his fearless desire to go wherever his President leads never fails to inspire. 



<p><b>4. 

Keep in mind that this extended alert is “based on the continuing high level of generalized threat information.”</b>  That means this is serious business.  Generalized threat information is the worst kind.  The best analogy we can think of is generalized anxiety disorder, which sort of means you are anxious about everything.  Besides, when you keep everybody anxious, you can turn around after the next terrorist attack and say, see we told you! 



<p><b>5. 

Don’t worry about anthrax.</b>  The fact that the government has no idea where the anthrax came from, how it travels, or what can best be done to treat the illness and prevent its spread; these matters should not concern you.  After all, the government did not know that 18 men were going to hijack three airplanes and fly them loaded with jet fuel into buildings in New York and Washington, DC, did it?  There is just so much we can expect the government to know.  Take heart in the fact that the next time anthrax turns up in someone’s mailbox, Homeland Security officials will be on television to explain to you to the best of their abilities what is happening.  That is why you should watch CNN. 



<p><b>6. 

Fly your American flag.</b>   



<p><b>7.    

Ignore nonsense talk about how the government is taking away civil liberties.</b>  The government is doing what it must in this time of emergency.  It is seizing power to better protect you and our way of life. Attorney General John Ashcroft has thoughtfully explained all of this in detail.   



<p><b>8. 

Do not get cynical.</b>  True, the government has declared alerts before, and nothing has happened. But don’t you realize the alerts themselves are preventing acts of terrorism?  Only when all of us are vigilant and keep an eye on our neighbors, co-workers, family, and friends can we ensure the safety of all Americans. We do not need critics, dissidents, and jaded individuals at a time like this.      



<p><b>9. 

Send suggestions to the government on how to keep the public riveted to the war on terrorism.</b>  After all, the current alert ends on March 11.  The trial of Zacarias Moussaoui will not begin until next fall.  How will we maintain the current state of anxiety over terrorism in the interim?  It is essential that people not be distracted by trivialities like the collapse of Enron. 







<p><b>10. 

Go about your normal life.</b>  How many times has our President said this?  Please -- go to work, shop, travel, see one of the uplifting new movies Hollywood is rushing to turn out, and rest assured that your government has taken control of the situation.  Just remember to report suspicious behavior and be careful what you say.
