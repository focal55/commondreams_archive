<p>In the post 9/11 world, there is undoubtedly a government official whose job 

is to invent innocuous-sounding, if not reassuring, acronyms for government initiatives 

against terrorism.

<p> Operation TIPS is a case in point. The Terrorism Information and Prevention 

System will recruit millions of utility, transportation and other workers to report 

on "potentially unusual or suspicious activity in public places." In other words, 

Operations TIPS is using private citizens to spy on each other.

<p> The Bush administration's reliance on acronyms with public-relations punch 

was apparent as early as last October when, still reeling from the events of Sept. 

11, it proposed and Congress swiftly passed the USA Patriot Act ("The Uniting 

and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept 

and Obstruct Terrorism" Act of 2001). Like Operation TIPS, the label doesn't tell 

the whole story.

<p> Among the less well-known aspects of the Patriot Act are provisions permitting 

the Justice Department to obtain information secretly from booksellers and librarians 

about customers' and patrons' reading, Internet and book-buying habits, merely 

by alleging that the records are relevant to an anti-terrorism investigation. 

The act prohibits librarians and booksellers from disclosing these subpoenas, 

so the objects of investigation don't know and therefore cannot defend themselves 

and their privacy, or contest the government's actions in court.

<p> In a sample of 1,000 libraries responding to a survey last February, 85 reported 

receiving requests to turn over information about patrons to police or FBI agents. 

We have no way to know how many other libraries, and how many booksellers, received 

similar requests. We don't know how many requests were made under the Patriot 

Act, because of its secrecy provisions. What we do know is that the Patriot Act 

authorizes the government to obtain information secretly from librarians and booksellers 

about customers' and patrons' interests and activities, and that law enforcement 

officials are seeking such information. The Justice Department has refused to 

provide any data about these investigations, even to Congress.

<p> Librarians and booksellers have voiced their dismay at being conscripted, 

under court order and threat of prosecution, to report covertly on their patrons 

and customers. Secretly obtaining information about what people read, to try to 

figure out what they think, undermines more than privacy; it threatens core First 

Amendment principles, as many librarians and booksellers understand.

<p> The Constitution clearly protects the right to read a book, embrace an idea 

or express a thought - even an unpopular or "unpatriotic" book, idea or thought. 

The freedom of thought and expression is so fundamental to our democracy that, 

as the Supreme Court recently noted, the "government may not prohibit speech because 

it increases the chance an unlawful act will be committed 'at some indefinite 

future time.'" In so holding, the court relied on the "vital distinction between 

words and deed, between ideas and conduct." In other words, the government is 

free to prohibit and punish illegal conduct, but may not criminalize ideas or 

punish people for their thoughts. Perversely, under the Patriot Act, reading certain 

books or researching certain topics - both constitutionally protected activities 

- now apparently provide grounds for criminal investigation.

<p> The Justice Department's recent decision to repeal the domestic terrorism 

surveillance guidelines unmistakably sends this signal. The guidelines were adopted 

in 1976 in response to revelations that, under the infamous COINTELPRO ("counterintelligence") 

program, civil rights and anti-war activists who were neither accused nor suspected 

of crimes became targets of government investigation because of their outspoken 

criticism of government policies. To prevent such abuses, the 1976 guidelines 

authorized surveillance of political, religious and other groups only if there 

was actual evidence of criminal activity. Without this restriction, covert surveillance 

of political dissidents with no known connection to criminal activity is bound 

to resume.

<p> According to a brief recently filed by the Justice Department in defense of 

secret immigration hearings, the "First Amendment creates no general right of 

access to government information or operations." The gag order imposed on librarians 

and booksellers goes even further in withholding information from the object of 

an investigation. As a result, proceedings under the act will be shrouded in secrecy, 

not only making it impossible for targeted individuals to counter the government's 

allegations, but also preventing the public at large from making an informed judgment 

about whether the government is effectively countering terrorism or unfairly targeting 

innocent people.

<p> The rush to enact programs with reassuring-sounding names may have been understandable 

a year ago. Now, however, it would be patriotic to consider whether, despite their 

appealing acronyms, some hastily enacted programs threaten the freedoms we value 

most. It is peculiar, to say the least, for our government to fight terrorists 

by adopting their techniques - secrecy and intimidation. 

<p> Besides, exactly how many terrorists does the FBI expect to find through the 

local library or the bookstore?
