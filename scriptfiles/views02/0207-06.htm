An African commentator has said, &quot;New York and London are the suburbs of Dakar.&quot; We must enact a comprehensive but simple plan to bring Africa, for our mutual benefit, into the world economy. Debt must be canceled.<p>Debt is largely a by-product of the old world order. The Cold War was a mask for oppression and kleptocracy. Superpowers wrote large checks to dictators and asked no questions. And now we want that money back, the same money that was spent on brutalizing the population. No. That money should be used to help rebuild the state. When debt is forgiven on conditions of democracy and accountability, it works.<p>The Economist has mistakenly described Africa as &quot;The Hopeless Continent.&quot; Hope is all it's got. We can find Marshall Plans, we can have bankruptcy protection for states and we can have immediate debt forgiveness.<p>Tony Blair has called Africa &quot;a scar on our conscience.&quot; It is more. It is the gaping wound of the world's soul. - <i>Bob Geldof, writing in The Daily Telegraph (London)</i>.</p>
