<p>George Bush is bent on war against Iraq. All the world knows it, from Blackpool 

to Baghdad, and from Paris to Moscow. That is why the maneuvering over United 

Nations resolutions and arms inspections has an unreal quality. It is just possible 

that UN-approved coercive inspections, of a kind that would so humiliate Saddam 

Hussein that he might fall without war, can prevent a conflict. But, aside from 

this thin chance, international diplomacy now is less about preventing war than 

about preventing an open break between America and Europe and Russia. 

<P>It is also about what other powers will be able to say about the war after 

it is over, and what influence they will have on postwar American policy. That 

they tried to prevent it, if it proves a disaster, that they were supportive, 

if it proves a success, that they kept it within the bounds of international law, 

or that America and Europe can still act together, whichever way it goes. 

<P>In other words, we are not discussing what we seem to be discussing but something 

else. This may not be either honest or rational, but reaction partakes of the 

quality of action, and going to war against Iraq in the way that the US plans 

to do is not a rational project. Let us add at once that few enterprises of this 

kind have been rational. Was the Vietnam war rational? Was the Falklands war rational? 

Is Chechnya rational? Saying an Iraq war is not rational does not mean that reasoning 

has not gone into the decisions which led to the policy. "Reasoning" and "rational" 

are not the same. 

<P>An Iraq war looms because a group of American conservatives, now very influential 

inside and outside this administration, came to the conclusion years ago that 

Saddam had challenged the US and got away with it, and that his victory could 

not be allowed to stand. 

<P>Not allowed to stand because he might once again disturb a region of political 

and economic importance to the US, and because he might threaten Israel, a cause 

as dear to the hearts of most of this group as the security of America itself, 

or understood as indistinguishable from it. 

<P>Not allowed to stand, also, just to show how feeble the previous Democratic 

administration had been. Not allowed to stand, finally, because the US could not 

be seen to be thwarted. It set the wrong precedent. Let the precedent, rather, 

go the other way and show that a tyrant who defied America would regret that choice. 

Others would take note. It may be that an Iraq war will be above all a war of 

example. 

<P>It could be said that all this is rational on its adherents' terms. The irrationality 

lies not on that side but in the way they have looked at the risks that have to 

be weighed against the possible benefits, and in the larger scheme of which their 

Iraq project is a part. Whether such a war will increase American and Israeli 

security, or strengthen the America-centered world order, the proponents of war 

cannot know and will not know, perhaps, for quite a long time after the war is 

over. 

<P>There is more uncertainty here than there always is in war planning, because 

of the imponderables of weapons of mass destruction and of the effect of a conflict 

on Muslim attitudes. Then there is the imponderable of what the Bush hawks would 

do with a victory, of whether they would go on to try to re-order the whole of 

the Middle East in an over-ambitious surge that could lead to disaster. 

<P>The critics, of course, also have no foreknowledge. The one thing that can 

be said for certain about wars is that the risks and costs, political as well 

as purely military, are almost always either underestimated, as in Vietnam, or 

exaggerated, as they were in Kosovo and Afghanistan. The coming war is clearly 

not being rationally discussed in the US. With only a few exceptions, dissent 

has fastened on detail, pace and style. Republicans are committed, with a few 

honorable exceptions, to the position that the administration's policy is unarguably 

right. Democrats, again with a few exceptions, are committed to the principle 

that they must not be seen to be against the war, in case it is a huge success, 

but should have sounded enough warning notes to be able to accuse the Republicans 

of mismanaging it in case it turns out for the worse. 

<P>The rational position on Iraq is neither that war is absolutely necessary to 

deal with an increasingly dangerous Saddam nor that war is an absolutely crazy 

and immoral undertaking. It is perhaps best put by saying that some of the consequences 

of a successful war, above all the liberation of the Iraqi people, are very desirable, 

but that the risks of war are nevertheless higher than the risks of carrying on 

with some form of containment. 

<P>If the decision was still in play, then debate should be vigorously joined 

on this issue. But the decision is not still in play. Debate on whether the war 

is right or wrong will not now influence the Americans. What happens when an enterprise 

of this kind is undertaken by a great power is that nations and other groups consult 

their interests. The arguments now are not about right and wrong, but about where 

interests do or do not coincide. 

<P>At one end of the spectrum are sections of the Iraqi opposition. They do not 

worry themselves over the fact that the fate of the Iraqi people has never been 

high on the administration's list. It is enough for them, as one Iraqi puts it, 

that "the US has decided it is in their interests to do what we want them to do". 

<P>The Labour government under Tony Blair is in an oddly similar position in that 

Blair sees an Iraq war as a continuation of the humanitarian interventions of 

the 90s. For him, it will be about rescuing the Iraqi people, and about trying 

to reconcile American power with the international institutions in which Blair 

believes far more than does the Republican right wing. 

<P>As for other European states, their common concern is to limit the damage to 

the American-European relationship. Europe does not wish to find itself alone, 

after the war, looking at an alienated America in one direction and at a dangerously 

disturbed Middle East in another. 

<P>We are bumping along towards a conflict which will settle much more than the 

fate of Iraq. Its outcome will surely shape both American politics and the whole 

of international life for years to come. Some good may come of it, and certainly 

some bad. In what measure is to some extent still open to human control. How to 

exercise that control is the difficult question now faced by all nations.</p>
