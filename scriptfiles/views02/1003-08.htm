<p>I wonder how Barbra Streisand feels. </p>

<p> On September 29, at the fancy Kodak Theatre in Los Angeles, she headlined 

a $6 million fundraiser for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. With 

her on the stage was House minority leader Richard Gephardt. As she sang a politics-drenched 

rewrite of "The Way We Were" ("Mis'ries/seems that's all that fills the news/blame 

the fellas in the White House/for the way we are"), she interjected comments bashing 

George W. Bush and the Republicans. At one point she commented, "I find bringing 

the country to the brink of war unilaterally five weeks before an election questionable--and 

very, very frightening." This remark echoed a confidential memo a Streisand aide 

sent Gephardt a few days earlier. In that note, Streisand pressed "Democrats to 

get off the defensive and go on the offensive." The memo also said, "Many of the 

industries run by big Republican donors and insiders clearly have much to gain 

if we go to war against Iraq. Barbra urges the Democrats to publicly convey this 

message to the American people." </p>

</table></font></font>That's hardly the message Gephardt pushed once he left Babs-land and returned 

to Washington. Three days after the concert, he brokered a deal with the White 

House that guaranteed passage of a resolution authorizing Bush to launch war on 

Iraq as "he determines to be necessary and appropriate" in order to "defend the 

national security of the United States against the continuing threat posed by 

Iraq" and to enforce United Nations resolutions. The Gephardt-backed measure was 

less of a blank check than the one Bush had sent to Congress. The differences, 

though, meant little. Under the negotiated resolution, Bush will have to report 

to Congress that "diplomatic and other peaceful means alone" were not sufficient 

to thwart Saddam Hussein and enforce UN resolutions. But Bush does not have to 

issue such a report until two days <i> after</i> he initiates an attack. Gephardt 

(and the GOP House leaders) are telling Bush, shoot whenever you like, explain 

later. And once bombs are falling and US troops are in harm's way, how many members 

of Congress are going to challenge Bush's finding, if they consider it unpersuasive, 

and then attempt to de-authorize a wartime president? ("I demand you withdraw 

100,000 troops and recall the bombers because you misread the last Iraqi communique 

on the inspections process!") </p>

<p> If war comes, it will not only be Bush's war. It will be Gephardt's war. Other 

key shareholders will be Democratic Senators Joseph Lieberman and John Edwards, 

two presidential wannabes who have been pre-running as get-Saddam hawks. Senate 

Majority Leader Tom Daschle's stake in the enterprise is uncertain as of this 

writing. He has griped about Bush's politicized rhetoric and raised questions 

about Bush's dash toward war, but has not opposed the underlying policy. (And 

Daschle can thank Gephardt, who held his own unilateral negotiations with the 

White House, for cutting a deal that undermined any move Daschle might have contemplated 

to limit the use-of-force resolution.) Most Democrats in both the House and the 

Senate are expected to vote in favor of authorizing Bush to mount a war--even 

a unilateral one--against Saddam Hussein. </p>

<p> Which means that on the most vital issue of this election season, there is 

little distinction between the two parties. The Republicans are almost entirely 

for this war; the Democrats are mostly for it. Whatever happens--good, bad, in-between--Gephardt 

and the war-enabling Dems will bear responsibility and will deserve to be judged 

alongside Bush. In fact, some might deserve to be judged more harshly. It is no 

secret that on Capitol Hill, many Democrats are motivated to vote for the resolution 

out of political calculation. They do not believe war against Iraq at this time 

is a good idea, but they fear looking soft or being caught on the wrong side of 

what might be a popular war. They are hoping to buy security--their own-- with 

blood. </p>

<p> Bush may be motivated in a similar fashion, but there's a greater chance he 

truly believes in the mission. Gephardt, too, might buy the ever-shifting national 

security arguments for this war pitched by Cheney, Rumsfeld, and Rice (rather 

than the caution expressed recently by retired General Wesley Clark, a former 

NATO commander; retired General Joseph Hoar, a former chief of the US Central 

Command; and retired General John Shalikashvili, a former chairman of the Joint 

Chiefs of Staff), but since 9/11 he has also adopted the political strategy of 

embracing the President on foreign policy matters in an attempt to prevent Republicans 

from hurling the time-tested weak-on-security charge against the Democrats. And 

against himself. Gephardt, after all, is eyeing a presidential run. </p>

<p> Perhaps when he lies awake at night, counting sheep on a White House lawn, 

Gephardt can say how much of his support for this war stems from policy concerns, 

and how much from crass political gamesmanship. But it's tough to see how his 

stance will benefit him and the Democrats. If the war goes well--and that is a 

possibility--Bush will receive most, if not all, of the credit and be strengthened 

for 2004. (Hopeful Democrats might note that Bush I was booted out of office after 

winning the Gulf War, but Bush II's accomplishments--"liberating Iraq" and "taking 

out" Saddam--will probably resonate more deeply and for longer than did his father's 

success in pushing Saddam out of Kuwait.) Me-too Democrats will likely find it 

difficult to tap the post-war celebration for political advantage. And if the 

war turns ugly, Gephardt and the other Democratic leaders now leaping aboard Bush's 

war-wagon will be in no position to complain. </p>

<p> So what's a frightened diva to do? Gephardt is not only <i> not</i> accusing 

Bush of using diversionary tactics, of practicing arrogant and perhaps dangerous 

unilateralism, and of greasing the wheels of war-profiteering. He is literally 

empowering Bush. He fiercely attacks the President on economic and budgetary matters. 

But he is greenlighting an endeavor that could further derail the federal budget 

and consume resources for the sort of domestic programs Streisand and Gephardt 

crave. With their wholehearted support of Bush's prospective war, Gephardt and 

other Democrats are essentially agreeing with Bush's argument that the nation's 

number-one priority is the anti-Saddam crusade. Not rising poverty. Not the rising 

number of Americans without health insurance. Not rising unemployment. Not pension 

reform. No matter how loud Gephardt thumps the podium on the House floor when 

he claims these are the <i> real </i> issues of the ongoing congressional campaign. 

</p>

<p> Gephardt's actions do not remove the war issue from the political table; they 

add momentum to preparations for war. He has cosigned the current centerpiece 

of the Bush presidency. In Streisandian terms, Bush said to Congress, "Don't Rain 

on My Parade," and Gephardt bounded forward with an opened umbrella. This war 

will be a Republican-Democratic duet.</p> </p>
