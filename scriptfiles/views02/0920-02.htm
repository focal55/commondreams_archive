<p>As the United States gears up for an invasion of Iraq, the great unanswered 

question continues to be: Why is the Bush Administration so determined to topple 

a government that has been effectively contained by American power for eleven 

years? </p>

<p> The White House has offered several reasons to justify an attack on Iraq--Saddam 

Hussein is on the verge of obtaining nuclear weapons; an invasion is needed to 

prevent the transfer of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons to international 

terrorists, and so on. Another factor, however, may be of equal importance--oil. 

Two key concerns underlie the Administration's thinking: First, the United States 

is becoming dangerously dependent on imported petroleum to meet its daily energy 

requirements, and, second, Iraq possesses the world's largest reserves of untapped 

petroleum after Saudi Arabia. </p>

<p> The problem of growing US dependence on imported petroleum was first raised 

in the <i>National Energy Policy Report</i>, released by the White House in May 

2001. Known as "the Cheney report," after its principal author, the Vice President, 

the document revealed that imported supplies accounted for half of US oil consumption 

in 2000 and will jump to two-thirds in 2020. And despite all the talk of drilling 

in Alaska, the report makes one thing clear: Most of America's future oil supplies 

will have to come from the Persian Gulf countries, which alone possess sufficient 

production potential to meet ever-growing US energy requirements. Thus, the report 

calls on the White House to place a high priority on increasing US access to Persian 

Gulf supplies. </p>

<p> Growing worries about the stability of Saudi Arabia, principal US supplier 

there, heightened by revelations of Saudi extremists' involvement in the September 

11 terror attacks, have prompted US strategists to seek a backup should future 

instability lead to a drop in Saudi oil production, which could trigger a global 

recession. Some strategists have proposed Russia as a backup, others the Caspian 

Sea states of Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan. But only one country has the capacity 

to <i>substantially</i> increase oil production in the event of a Saudi collapse: 

Iraq. With proven reserves of 112 billion barrels of oil (compared with 49 billion 

for Russia and 15 billion for the Caspian states), Iraq alone can serve as a backup 

for Saudi Arabia. At the same time, control over Iraqi oil would allow US leaders 

to more easily ignore Saudi demands for US action on behalf of the Palestinians 

and would weaken OPEC's control over oil prices. </p>

<p> Iraq has yet another key attraction for US oil strategists: Whereas most of 

Saudi Arabia's major fields have already been explored and claimed, Iraq possesses 

vast areas of promising but unexplored hydrocarbon potential. These fields may 

harbor the world's largest remaining reservoir of unmapped and unclaimed petroleum--far 

exceeding the untapped fields in Alaska, Africa and the Caspian. Whoever gains 

possession of these fields will exercise enormous influence over the global energy 

markets of the twenty-first century. </p>

<p> Knowing this, and seeking allies for his confrontation with Washington, Saddam 

Hussein has begun to parcel out concessions to the most promising fields to oil 

firms in Europe, Russia and China. According to the International Energy Agency's 

<i>World Energy Outlook</i> for 2001, he has already awarded such contracts for 

fields with an estimated potential of 44 billion barrels of oil--an amount equal 

to the total reserves of the United States, Canada and Norway (the number-one 

European producer) combined. At current rates of about $25 per barrel, that makes 

these contracts worth an estimated $1.1 trillion. </p>

<p> And here's the rub: The Iraqi dissidents chosen by Washington to lead the 

new regime in Baghdad have threatened to cancel all contracts awarded to firms 

in countries that fail to assist in the overthrow of Saddam. "We will review all 

of these agreements," said the head of the London office of the Iraqi National 

Congress (a dissident umbrella group backed by the United States), and those signed 

by Saddam Hussein will be considered invalid unless endorsed by the new government. 

Not surprisingly, US oil firms are expected to be awarded most of the Hussein-era 

contracts voided by the successor regime. </p>

<p> This could prove to be the biggest oil grab in modern history, providing hundreds 

of billions of dollars to US oil firms--many linked to senior officials in the 

Bush Administration--and helping to avert a future energy crunch in the United 

States. But is oil worth spilling the blood of American soldiers and Iraqi civilians 

who get caught in the way? This is the question Congress must ask if we are to 

have an honest debate on the merits of invading Iraq.</p>
