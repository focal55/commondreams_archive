<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">DURING MY LAST VISIT TO 

BAGHDAD, ON THE eve of last decade's Gulf War, I sat for three long hours in the 

middle of the night arguing with one of Saddam Hussein's top strategists. I thought 

both he and his mustachioed boss, whose smirking visage shone from his wristwatch, 

were truly miserable putzes. Najib Al-Hadithi, bunkered in his top-floor office 

in the Information Ministry building, plied me with tea and endlessly clicked 

his worry beads. He bellowed about millions of Iraqis, who he said were at that 

very moment preparing to heroically sacrifice themselves and fight to the last 

man against the imminent U.S. attack. </font>

<P> <FONT SIZE=2 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Right.</FONT> 

<P> <FONT SIZE=2 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">History played out rather 

differently. While emaciated and cowering Iraqi soldiers scrambled to surrender 

to CNN crews, friendly fire accounted for most of the very few American casualties. 

On the last day of the ground war, Colin Powell and Norman Schwarzkopf cooked 

and plowed tens of thousands of Saddam's soldiers into the sand along the so-called 

Highway of Death -- one of the greatest one-sided military massacres in recent 

history.</FONT> 

<P> <FONT SIZE=2 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It tested the imagination 

to think that anyone would rise to defend Saddam or his wretched regime. I had 

been to plenty of places in the world languishing under dictators, but nothing 

could compare with Iraq's sheer and sinister megalomaniacal evil. The place oozed 

fear and intimidation, with public or even private disparagement of the state 

considered a capital crime.</FONT> 

<P> <FONT SIZE=2 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Nor could there ever be any 

doubt as to who was in charge. Every public institution was named for Saddam. 

Entire stores sold nothing but Saddam paraphernalia. Fifteen- and 20-foot hand-painted 

Saddam portraits on nearly every street corner. Saddam in military uniform, in 

a white linen suit, in desert robes. Saddam steelily commanding troops, reading 

a book, studying a map, digging a trench, smiling in Ray-Ban ski glasses, loading 

a hunting rifle, playing with smiling little girls, puffing contentedly on a big 

stogy, lounging bare-chested on a Kurdish rug like a <I>Playgirl</I> centerfold, 

riding a horse with his red-checkered kaffiyeh trailing in the wind. Indeed, Saddam 

in seemingly every conceivable costume and pose except maybe a pink belly-dancing 

outfit from <I>A Thousand-and-One Nights</I>.</FONT> 

<P> <FONT SIZE=2 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And yet, as I strolled the 

crowded streets around the dazzling Golden Mosque in the ancient Kadhimiya quarter 

of the city and looked upon the black-robed Shiah women with tattooed lips and 

the old wizened men puffing on hookahs under green fluorescent lights in the corner 

tea shops, I couldn't think of one single justification for waging war against 

this nation or its people.</FONT> 

<P> <FONT SIZE=2 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And now, as Bush the Second 

noisily threatens to finish the job that Poppy pooped out on, I find even less 

justification, if that's possible. At least during the first Gulf War you could 

delude yourself into thinking we were rescuing occupied Kuwait and restoring rule 

to its syphilitic sheiks.</FONT> 

<P> <FONT SIZE=2 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But this time around, what? 

We can be chums with the nuclear-armed Chinese Stalinists who hold public executions 

of petty criminals and beat up senior citizens in Tian An Men Square. We contained 

the Soviets and their arsenal for 50 years, but we can't figure out a way to deal 

with Saddam short of invasion?</FONT> 

<P> <FONT SIZE=2 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When it becomes so patently 

obvious that the administration's warmongering stems not at all from any authentic 

security concerns but rather from cold and cynical domestic political calculation, 

why is there no clear and steadfast anti-war opposition?</FONT> 

<P> <FONT SIZE=2 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Instead, as <I>New Yorker</I> 

writer Henrik Hertzberg recently said, "In Washington one side wants war; the 

other wants debate about war." The result is a pro-war faction and a "maybe war" 

faction, he rightly says.</FONT> 

<P> <FONT SIZE=2 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">MOVE OVER, MIKE DUKAKIS; 

ALL THOSE OTHER Democratic hopefuls want to clamber onto that tank with you. To 

one degree or another, every major Democratic presidential contender, from Gore 

to Daschle to Gephardt to Kerry to Edwards, has recently endorsed the coming war 

against Iraq. At most they whimper and whine about "timing" or "consensus building" 

or congressional "consultation." But at the end of the day, they are all in the 

tank for Bush -- quite literally.</FONT> 

<P> <FONT SIZE=2 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Even when the Democrats get 

the "debate" they clamor for, the fix is in. Watching Senate Foreign Relations 

Committee Chairman Joe Biden's recent hearings on Iraq was like being transported 

back to the dog-and-pony show held around the Gulf of Tonkin incident four decades 

ago -- nothing but a one-sided overture to war.</FONT> 

<P> <FONT SIZE=2 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Al Gore, the new fighting-for-you 

Al Gore, the people-against-the-powerful Al Gore, the populist Al Gore, finally 

worked up the courage two weeks ago to publicly mumble something about Iraq. It 

was mostly about having to convince our allies of our reasons before we drop the 

hammer. Which is well short of saying there are <I>no</I> convincing reasons. 

But why expect anything more from Fightin' Al Gore, who was among the few Democrats 

who crossed party lines to grant congressional approval of Poppy Bush's first 

Gulf War.</FONT> 

<P> <FONT SIZE=2 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All this adds up to the Democratic 

leadership being way out of sync with it's own constituencies. A recent CBS News 

poll revealed that, by a 52-37 margin, ordinary Dems don't think removing Saddam 

is worth the trouble.</FONT> 

<P> <FONT SIZE=2 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Nature does in fact abhor 

a vacuum. So into that gaping moral void left by the Official Democrats, a few 

unlikely Republicans have waltzed in to pick up the anti-war banner.</FONT> 

<P> <FONT SIZE=2 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Go figure. But today it's 

retiring Neanderthal House Majority Leader Dick Armey, and folks like former General 

and National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft, who raise the loudest voices against 

Bush's saber rattling (not to mention those pesky press leakers within the Pentagon 

itself). The otherwise loathsome Armey went as far as saying the U.S. "had no 

business" warring against Saddam. Good for him. And there was an angry Pat Buchanan 

slathered across cable TV this past week, sounding much like Gore Vidal, opposing 

the war and arguing that the U.S. "has to choose between being an empire or a 

republic."</FONT> 

<P> <FONT SIZE=2 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I buy that. But I wish someone 

other than Pitchfork Pat would make the case. No such luck in this dismal moment 

in American political history. For all the current national hand wringing about 

the future of Iraq, maybe we should be spending more energy worrying about the 

withered state of our own democracy.</FONT></p>
