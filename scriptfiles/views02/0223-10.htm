bad loans," President Bush told Asian reporters before his recent trip to 

Japan, South Korea and China, according to an article in the Feb. 18 New 

York Times.  The article did not mention that the U.S. borrows mainly from 

Japan.



<p>So are Japan’s loans to the U.S. bad?  If so, it stands to reason that U.S. 

borrowing from that nation could cause future problems.  Further, a Japanese 

economic restructuring, which the president wants, could have unclear 

effects on the U.S. economy.



<p>What’s one current purpose of U.S. debt held by Japanese lenders?  That 

would be to fund the U.S. trade deficit, the difference between what America 

buys and sells worldwide.



<p>A past purpose of Japanese lending was to fund public deficit spending on 

the U.S. military during the 1980s.  Public indebtedness rose sharply during 

the Reagan era.  This was done to protect Americans from the threat posed by 

the Soviet Union, which fell as the 1990s began.



<p>It has been said that history repeats itself, firstly as a tragedy and 

secondly as a farce.  Take President Bush’s current plans to increase 

funding for military/security spending to keep Americans safe from the “axis 

of evil”—Iran, Iraq and North Korea.  This will also help to push the 

federal budget from surplus into deficit.



<p>A Feb. 19 Knight Ridder article cast doubt on Japan’s ability to, in part, 

cope with its indebted banking sector.  Why?  Because “Japanese culture 

favors cozy political and personal ties over clear-eyed business decisions.” 

  Is American culture different?  Corporations that command the Bush 

administration would suggest otherwise.



<p>When it comes to reporting world affairs, the U.S. corporate news media 

deprives Americans of a critical context.  This can weaken the political 

consciousness of the general population.  Independent media is one cure for 

this condition.



<p>In the meantime, Japan has had a post-financial bubble economy, with slow/no 

growth, for roughly the past decade after years of strong growth.  One 

outcome has been fewer opportunities for profitable investments.  This 

helped to spur Japanese banks’ involvement in financial speculation, a 

factor in the nation’s current economic stagnation.



<p>Some have said that the U.S. economy may have entered a post-bubble crisis 

that began with the dot-com bust of technology stocks in spring 2000.  

Currently,  faked earnings and sour loans are emerging, working their way 

through the nation’s economy.  Like Japan, U.S. financial fragility has 

followed an economic expansion.



<p>So goes the cycle of financial peaks and valleys in rich nations such as 

Japan and the U.S.  In this respect, they are more alike than not, contrary 

to what passes for news and information in America’s “free press,” owned and 

operated by a handful of media corporations that are big and getting bigger.



<p>What goes around comes around.  So it is for capitalism, which has been a 

global system from its beginning.  The effects of expansion, speculation, 

recession and stagnation are far-reaching.



<p>We haven’t heard the last word on U.S. Japan relations.
