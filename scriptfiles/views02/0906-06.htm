<p>Every year Greensboro, North Carolina, holds a Fourth of July parade in which 

local organizations form the units. This year members of the Greensboro Peace 

Coalition decided--"after some hesitation," admits chairman Ed Whitfield--to join 

the line of march. They bought an ad in the local paper, printed leaflets and 

developed their own variation on this year's theme of "American Heroes": large 

posters of Americans, including Mark Twain, Albert Einstein and the Rev. Martin 

Luther King Jr., who have spoken out against the folly of war. </p>

<p> Though members had been participating in vigils since last October, when the 

bombing of Afghanistan began, many expressed qualms about marching into the thick 

of their hometown's annual patriotic celebration. But fifty activists showed up 

on the Fourth and got the surprise of their political lives. Along the mile-and-a-half 

parade route through downtown Greensboro, they were greeted mostly with applause, 

and, at the end of their march, they were honored by parade organizers for "Best 

Interpretation of the Theme." </p>

<p> Says Whitfield, "There is a real lesson in this. If you scratch the surface 

of the poll numbers about Bush and Ashcroft's overwhelming support, you get down 

to a lot of people with a lot of questions. Some of them are afraid that they 

are alone in what they are thinking. What it takes to get them excited and to 

get them involved is for them to see someone standing up so that they will know 

they are not alone." </p>

<p> The post-September 11 experiences of the Greensboro Peace Coalition, Berea 

College's Patriots for Peace, the Arkansas Coalition for Peace and Justice, and 

dozens of other grassroots groups serve as a reminder that while dissenters have 

not always spoken in a single voice, they have had in common not just their unease 

with the bipartisan Washington consensus but the often inspiring experience that 

there are many Americans who share their discomfort. Take Jennifer Ellis of Peace 

Action Maine, who recalls how overwhelmed Down East activists felt after September 

11. "But then we started to get calls from people saying, 'I don't know what your 

organization is, but it has the word "peace" in the title. What can I do?'" Some 

callers were already holding vigils, and her group started sending out weekly 

e-mails listing them. "We linked people up with local efforts to fight discrimination 

against Muslims, and we told people how to write members of Congress about civil 

liberties issues," she says. "Before long, all these people, in all these towns 

across Maine, were working together." </p>

<p> As with anti-World War I activists who looked to Wisconsin Senator Bob La 

Follette, critics of McCarthyism who celebrated Maine's Margaret Chase Smith's 

statement of conscience or foes of the Vietnam War who were inspired by the anti-Gulf 

of Tonkin resolution votes of Oregon's Wayne Morse and Alaska's Ernest Gruening, 

post-September 11 dissenters found solace in the fact that at least a few members 

of Congress shared their qualms. Three days after the attacks on the World Trade 

Center and the Pentagon, Representative Barbara Lee, a California Democrat, cast 

the only vote against the resolution authorizing the use of force to respond. 

Lee's vote earned her death threats and pundit predictions that she was finished 

politically, but she won her March Democratic primary race with 85 percent of 

the vote. And the "Barbara Lee Speaks for Me" movement that started in her Oakland-based 

district has spread; in July several thousand people packed a Santa Cruz, California, 

movie theater to celebrate "Barbara Lee Day." Said Santa Cruz Mayor Christopher 

Krohn: "She's become a national moral leader in awakening the movement for justice, 

peace and a thorough re-examination of US foreign policy." Responded Lee: "It 

must not be unpatriotic to question a course of action. It must not be unpatriotic 

to raise doubts. I suggest to you it is just the opposite." </p>

<p> Senator Russ Feingold, the Wisconsin Democrat who cast the only Senate vote 

against the USA Patriot Act's assault on civil liberties, still marvels at the 

standing ovations he receives when his vote is mentioned. "I thought this would 

be a difficult vote," says Feingold, who recently earned the best home-state approval 

ratings of his career. "What I didn't realize was that a lot of people are concerned 

about free speech and repression of liberties, even in a time of war. I didn't 

realize until I cast my vote that there was so much concern about whether it was 

appropriate, whether it was allowed, to dissent after September 11. I think that 

for a lot of people, my vote told them it was still appropriate to dissent." </p>

<p> Some members who have challenged the Bush Administration have suffered politically--notably 

Georgia Representative Cynthia McKinney, who lost an August Democratic primary. 

But most are secure in their seats, and one is even being boomed as a potential 

Democratic presidential contender. Representative Dennis Kucinich's February speech 

condemning the bombing of Afghan civilians and the repression of American civil 

liberties drew an overwhelmingly positive response that Kucinich, an Ohio Democrat, 

says is evidence of broad uncertainty about militarism abroad and economic and 

constitutional costs at home. </p>

<p> Democratic Representative Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin led several House members 

in writing a letter in December questioning White House policies that emphasize 

bullets and badgering as opposed to diplomacy and development; and John Conyers 

of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, has kept the 

heat on the Justice Department regarding civil liberties--often with the support 

of Judiciary Committee chair James Sensenbrenner, a conservative Republican. Still, 

says Kucinich, "our constituents are perhaps more prepared than Congress for the 

debate that should be going on." </p>

<p> Bill Keys, a school board member in Madison, Wisconsin, shares that view. 

Keys's October 2001 refusal to require the recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance 

in city schools earned three days of broadcast rebukes from radio personality 

Rush Limbaugh, physical threats and a movement to recall him from office. The 

recall drive fizzled before winter and, this spring, Keys was elected president 

of the board. "The strange thing is that once I became identified as this awful 

radical, people started coming up to me and saying, 'Don't you let them shut you 

up,'" recalls Keys. "If the last year taught us anything, it's this: Yes, of course, 

if you step out of the mainstream you will get called names and threatened. But 

you will also discover that a lot of Americans still recognize that dissenters 

are the real defenders of freedom."</p>
