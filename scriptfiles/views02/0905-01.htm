<p>For constancy in a confused world, look north. The Canadians are still awfully 

nice neighbors.

<p> They give us adorable ice skaters who smile through adversity and a joy for 

winter revelry that shows the season can be more than a slog through rush-hour 

slush. They are never rude or condescending toward American tourists. They provide 

exceedingly thorough yet entirely friendly airport security, shaming us for the 

dour sloppiness still so common at home.

<p> A recent visit confirmed these charms. And it brought deeper the realization 

that the United States is alone - completely, utterly, frighteningly - in the 

world.

<p> Not one word of support for President George W. Bush's plans to invade Iraq 

and force "regime change" appears in the Canadian media. The emphasis is on each 

utterance by every world leader who voices alarm about the American government's 

bluster on Iraq, its obstinance on global warming, its refusal to heed the concerns 

of the rest of the world.

<p> "When it comes to Iraq, father knew best," chided the Globe and Mail of Toronto 

in an editorial Saturday, praising the elder Bush's consensus-building before 

he acted to push back the Iraqi conquest of Kuwait.

<p> We are awash in a tide of remembrance for Sept. 11, enveloped by a rising 

din about what has happened to America in the year that has passed. Are we a better, 

stronger, nation? Are we more secure than we were on Sept. 10 - at home and abroad? 

More respected? Or do we need to ask again that annoying talk-TV question: Why 

do they hate us?

<p> A year ago, we knew who "they" were. They were so different. They dressed 

differently, worshiped differently. They had a profoundly different culture and 

view of world history. "They" were the fanatics, those who believe America is 

at the root of every grievance. And that we should be punished.

<p> Now it is not so easy to figure out who "they" are. "They" seems to have expanded.

<p> A whopping majority of the British public opposes going to war unilaterally 

against Iraq, despite Prime Minister Tony Blair's singular effort to convince 

them otherwise. In one recent poll, the Independent of London reported, more than 

half the British peoople named the current President Bush as the third biggest 

threat to world peace - after Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein.

<p> In Germany, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder invigorated his sagging re-election 

effort in part with sharp attacks on American war plans. Even his conservative 

rival flip-flopped. "The monopoly on the decision and action in this question 

lies with the United Nations," Edmund Stoiber said.

<p> Nelson Mandela, hero and moral exemplar to most of the democratic world, cannot 

get his phone call taken by George W. Bush. He settled for a talk with the father, 

and with Secretary of State Colin Powell. The current American president, Mandela 

complains, is "introducing chaos in international affairs." The word from Tokyo, 

from Beijing, from Moscow, is much the same.

<p> Whatever solidarity the rest of the world felt toward the United States after 

the terror attacks has vaporized. Now the consensus is that we've lived up to 

our stereotype. Americans are viewed as arrogant, self-absorbed, hypocritical. 

And this is what our friends say.

<p> It turns out the American people and the European people are much closer to 

one another on the details than the stereotypes suggest. A new poll shows broad 

agreement on both continents that the United States should invade Iraq only with 

United Nations approval and allied support.

<p> But the hawkish clique in Washington believes the UN produces nothing but 

gaseous waste. Bush has reluctantly conceded he should seek sanction from the 

U.S. Congress before going to war. He's never hinted he would stoop to the messy 

compromise required for UN approval. He is a commander, not a cajoler.

<p> Next week in New York, Bush will start trying to convince the world body there 

is no choice but to topple Iraq's frightening leader. It is a tough argument to 

win. More so now that the world sees this American president as pretty scary, 

too.
