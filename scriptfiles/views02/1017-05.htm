<p>I had lunch last week with a new friend. When Jack, now farming in West Virginia, 

began telling me about his Vietnam experiences, I understood his visceral opposition 

to war with Iraq. 

<p>Jack was a Marine, trained at Camp Lejeune, N.C. He was well-trained as a killer, 

trained to react reflexively to life-threatening challenges and to ask no questions. 

In the summer of 1965, he was sent to Vietnam as a machine gunner, landing just 

after a major U.S. offensive called Operation Starlight. 

<p>Culture shock hit immediately when he saw hands and feet dangling from trees. 

The first two times he killed someone he threw up. Quickly, he saw his friends 

die. But he was well-trained and became a good killer, often in squads of several 

soldiers on overnight ambushes and search-and-destroy missions against the Viet 

Cong and North Vietnamese. 

<p>Six months after he arrived, severe intestinal parasites sent Jack out of Vietnam. 

The day after he was flown out, 11 of his fellow Marines were killed on the front 

line. He still hasn't gotten over their deaths. 

<p>He came home, married, but couldn't adjust. &#034;I was a good killer, trained 

for battle. I couldn't use it here, and I couldn't fit in.&#034; For that reason 

and perhaps survivor guilt, he re-enlisted and was sent back to Vietnam. He described 

the intensity of being close to death, of having his nerves constantly focused 

on staying alive, on the compelling camaraderie with buddies whose lives he protected 

and who protected his. He described the heartbreak of carrying out dead soldiers. 

<p>When he returned home a year later, his wife wanted a child, whereas he wanted 

to buy a motorcycle and travel. They divorced amicably enough, in a pattern that 

he repeated again and again and describes as classic for a veteran with undiagnosed 

post traumatic stress disorder. 

<p>It was hard, he said, to find jobs and relationships that could approach the 

razor-sharp emotional edge of war. He had hated the war, yet it left him with 

an emotional need for its intensity. He wasn't comfortable without a gun for two 

years after returning and still can't sleep, waking frequently to patrol the perimeter. 

Gregarious, he has married four more times and taken many jobs, from installing 

swimming pools to selling health insurance to growing bean sprouts and Christmas 

trees, always moving on when the excitement or challenge of a job ended or when 

marriage normalized. In the process, he has fathered six children. 

<p>Jack doesn't avoid describing the havoc he has wrought in the lives of people 

he loves. What has saved him, he says, is finally being diagnosed with post traumatic 

stress disorder and treated appropriately by a doctor who invested effort in helping 

him. 

<p>The National Institute of Mental Health estimates that 1 million Vietnam veterans 

developed post traumatic stress disorder. The National Center for PTSD estimates 

that 30 percent of men and women who have spent time in Korea, the Persian Gulf 

and other war zones will develop the disorder. 

<p>Now classified as 100 percent disabled by post traumatic stress disorder, Jack 

devotes his life to helping other veterans. West Virginia's countless hills and 

hollows are a refuge for a large number of veterans who retreat there, often paranoid 

and too afraid to get help from a government agency. Jack helps because &#034;when 

you bottom out with PTSD, it's really bottom, bottom.&#034; 

<p>Jack adamantly opposes war with Iraq. &#034;It's the war machine again,&#034; 

he says, &#034;created only so big boys can make big money.&#034; And no matter 

how big the death toll in Iraq, he knows how hopelessly and senselessly millions 

more lives will be torn up when soldiers come back home.
