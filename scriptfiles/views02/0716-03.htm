<p>What about states' rights?</p>

<p>Before Enron, WorldCom and the rest of the Wall Street hustler stories broke, 

in this most recent wave of corporate criminality, anti-globalization protesters 

and other factions of what I loosely refer to as the economic justice movement 

were derided by even the liberal media as being senseless when it comes to economics.</p>

<p>But now that the bad apple theory has been exposed as a red herring offered 

by unregulated free-market worshippers, those so-called idiots who took to the 

streets of Seattle in 1999 appear to be, well, prophetic.</p>

<p>The muted message coming out of the protests has been: There's something wrong 

with the global economic system itself -- namely, a lack of democratic accountability.</p>

<p>And now, with even our business-is-king president conceding the point, we can 

finally have a discussion about corporate responsibility and social ethics without 

some F.A. Hayek or Milton Friedman fanatic drowning out opposition voices by using 

meaningless political epithets like "you're a socialist, Marxist, communist, liberal."</p>

<p>Late last week, The Wall Street Journal reported, "Ultimately, the proposals 

Mr. Bush advanced in (his) speech on Wall Street may well serve as the floor rather 

than the ceiling for Washington action."</p>

<p>Following the president's address, the Senate moved to go beyond Bush's timid 

proposals, voting 97-0 to establish sweeping new powers to target corporate fraud, 

creating a new corporate-fraud chapter in the federal criminal code.</p>

<p>The Senate also voted 96-0 to toughen criminal penalties for white-collar crimes, 

such as pension fraud, mail fraud and conspiracy -- a provision that would, according 

to the Journal, "allow courts to mete out the same punishments to guilty executives 

as now apply to drug kingpins."</p>

<p>The essence of what the Senate was trying to do was captured by Vermont Democrat 

Patrick Leahy when he said: "If you steal a $500 television set, you can go to 

jail. Apparently if you steal $500 million from your corporation and your pension 

holders and everyone else, then nothing happens. This makes sure something will 

happen." That's an implicit admission that our criminal justice system has long 

served the interest of the wealthy at the expense of the less affluent.</p>

<p>And not that anyone was expecting it, but the president could have appointed 

an independent counsel to investigate Vice President Dick Cheney's tenure at Halliburton, 

amid allegations by the conservative legal watchdog group Judicial Watch that 

the oil-field services business headed by Cheney engaged in fraudulent accounting 

practices from 1999 to 2001. It kind of puts the Clinton-Whitewater affair in 

a whole new perspective.</p>

<p>So now that the momentum has shifted toward greater corporate accountability, 

maybe the ideas coming out of such organizations as the Program on Corporations, 

Law and Democracy (POCLAD) will get broader consideration. That will remind us 

that the sovereignty rights of real people come before so-called corporate rights, 

as the framers of our Constitution intended (see <a href="http://www.poclad.org" target="_new">www.poclad.org</a>).</p>

<p>It was through pro-corporate judicial activism in the early 1900s that the 

Constitution and concept of private property found therein came to be interpreted 

as justification for the legal absurdities we have today in which individual rights 

and liberties meant for flesh-and-blood human beings are extended to corporations.</p>

<p>Want some relevant summer reading? Check out POCLAD's collection of essays 

and speeches called "Defying Corporations, Defining Democracy." In that book, 

I found this gem from an 1890 New York Court of Appeals case, involving the North 

River Sugar Refining Corp.</p>

<p>Writing on behalf of the court, Justice Finch declared: "The judgment sought 

against the defendant is one of corporate death ... The life of a corporation 

is, indeed, less than that of the humblest citizen ... Corporations may, and often 

do, exceed their authority only where private rights are affected. When these 

are adjusted, all mischief ends and all harm is averted.</p>

<p>"But where the transgression has a wider scope, and threatens the welfare of 

the people, they may summon the offender to answer for the abuse of its franchise 

or the violation of its corporate duty. The (North River Sugar Refining) corporation 

has violated its charter, and failed in the performance of its corporate duties, 

and that in respects so material and important to justify a judgment of dissolution 

... All concur."</p>

<p>Corporations used to be under the authority of the states in which they were 

chartered. Where are states' rights advocates on this issue today?</p>

<p>Why are they not echoing the sentiments of our great nation's founders -- such 

people as Thomas Jefferson, who spoke of the need "to crush in its birth the aristocracy 

of our moneyed corporations, which dare already to challenge our government to 

a trial of strength, and bid defiance to the laws of our country"?</p>
