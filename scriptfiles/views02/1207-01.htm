<p>History will eventually tell us whether Pearl Harbor Day 2002 is the gateway to a war as necessary as World War II or to a tragedy of unintended consequences redolent of World War I. But for this moment, farce has the edge: A savage dictator is delivering a "full" accounting of his weapons arsenal that only a fool would take for fact, and a president of the United States is pretending (not very hard) to indulge this U.N. rigmarole while he calls up more reserves for the confrontation he seeks. The rest of us are but pawns in a great game that only Joseph Heller could have devised. </p>

<P> The game comes with an ever-growing cast of peculiar players. In Iraq, there's a team of inspectors out of "H.M.S. Pinafore," charged with a mission that is probably impossible and whose results will soon be disregarded by the relevant parties anyway. In Washington, there's an unintentionally comic spokesman for our ally Saudi Arabia who on Tuesday declared that his country was the victim of unwarranted American intolerance bordering on "hate." </p>

<P> Whassup with that? It couldn't be that Americans have noticed that his government's official religion, the extremist Wahhabi sect of Islam, is the hate-filled creed that nurtured Osama bin Laden in the first place, or that Saudi Arabia has been Al Qaeda's "most important source of funds," as a task force of the Council on Foreign Relations reported in October. Or that the Saudi minister of the interior, Prince Nayef, maintained as recently as last week that the 15 Saudi hijackers of 9/11 were dupes in a Zionist plot. </p>

<P> The strangest player of all, predictably, is Henry Kissinger, whose first act as chairman of the "independent" commission to investigate 9/11 was to initiate a cover-up, fully backed by the White House, of the identities of the clients of Kissinger Associates, his consulting firm. Mr. Kissinger consistently sees the confidentiality of this list as a higher priority than service to his country. When the Senate's Committee on Foreign Relations a decade ago investigated the B.C.C.I. affair — a scandal that itself figures in the tangled history of Saudi/Al Qaeda money laundering — Kissinger Associates resisted the subpoena by threatening litigation "through an extensive appellate process to the Supreme Court." (The quote is from the committee's December 1992 report on its investigation.) The Senate retreated. The only list that may be as tightly guarded is that of the oil executives who met with Dick Cheney's energy task force — a secret that Mr. Cheney may yet defend all the way to the Supreme Court. </p>

<P> Might these lists overlap? Might some of the names be dear American business cronies of the Saudis? Do any of them have a vested interest in post-Saddam Iraq? It's stonewalled questions like these that make some of us nervous about the expanded war to come. We know Saddam Hussein is a thug and we want him gone. But the administration has never stuck to a single story in arguing the case for urgent pre-emptive action now. Saddam was in league with Al Qaeda — or maybe he wasn't. He has nuclear weapons — or maybe he won't have them until some years from now. Our goal is regime change — or disarmament — or both. Our post-Saddam endgame is — what? Something is missing from this picture, and meanwhile Al Qaeda is very much at war with us and, in a new development, the Israelis. You wonder if the Bush administration thinks we're as gullible as the Saudis do.</p>

<P> It's in this context that Bob Woodward's latest best seller, "Bush at War," could not be more timely. If journalism is the rough draft of history, the journalism in this book is the rough draft of the 9/11 report that Mr. Kissinger's commission will someday write. The administration cooperated with Mr. Woodward. The president himself was "quite open" — about what he wanted to talk about, at least.</p>

<P>Thus did the same White House that fiercely protects Mr. Cheney's oil-baron dealings leak to Mr. Woodward documents that might seem even more valuable — the notes from "more than 50 National Security Council and other meetings." Newt Gingrich complained in The Wall Street Journal, "It makes no sense for an administration that has jealously guarded its executive privilege to allow a reporter the access it denies to members of Congress." But it makes a lot of sense if a White House wants to put out a certain version of its story on the eve of a new war. Fifty meetings do not a complete history make. The chronicle in "Bush at War" is highly selective, and not just because it limits its narrative to the first 100 days after 9/11. The book often minimizes administration failings that should worry us as we prepare to march on to Iraq. </p>

<P> Mr. Woodward has said that his is "a neutral, non-judgmental account," but that is not the same thing as objectivity. When he quotes the president of the United States calling Seymour Hersh, the Woodward rival who has reported on wartime military failures, "a liar" and just lets the charge sit there unanswered, without comment from Mr. Hersh or anyone else, is that "neutral"? When he quotes Condoleezza Rice as saying post-9/11 that "as many packages or containers as possible coming into American ports should be examined," is it "non-judgmental" to leave out the fact that to this day this crucial domestic security directive remains largely ignored?</p>

<P> The big revelations generating the buzz for "Bush at War" are not real revelations at all. The Powell vs. Rumsfeld-Cheney battles over policy aren't news, and neither is it a shock that Fox News's Roger Ailes might have a back channel to a Republican administration. The truly sensitive issues for the Bush administration are those that are given short shrift in the book or are left out entirely. We hear no inside accounts of its failure to track down the anthrax terrorists. John Ashcroft's inability to arrest a single terrorist during his post-9/11 mass roundups goes unnoted. </p>

<P> The Saudis are remarkably minor figures. "We need to know whoever is giving [bin Laden] money and deal with them," says President Bush, who vows to personally contact the leader of any nation reluctant to cooperate with the crackdown. But the Saudis' continued resistance to these entreaties goes unreported. Even odder is that Mr. Woodward's book, for all its you-are-there theatrics in recounting the days after 9/11, makes no mention at all of what happened on 9/18: the administration's collaboration with the Saudis in flying bin Laden family members out of America. What old/oil boy network pulled those strings in the White House? Why did the F.B.I. not verify whether the fleeing bin Ladens were both personally and financially estranged from Osama? Neither the Americans nor the Saudis have yet lifted the veil on this dead-of-night exodus.</p>

<P> This omission is characteristic of a narrative that acknowledges the American failure to nab Osama or vanquish Al Qaeda but plays down the embarrassing details by racing through them perfunctorily. The pivotal battle of Tora Bora gets only two paragraphs, yet it was the Waterloo that allowed more than 1,000 Qaeda operatives (plus, in all likelihood, bin Laden) to escape. Newsweek, which did nail down the fiasco last summer, said the story was hard to get because "American officials, both civilian and military, prefer to focus on what went right." Though "Bush at War" does report setbacks in the war, they are usually the temporary setbacks in the administration's triumphal toppling of the Taliban, not those lasting defeats in routing Al Qaeda. </p>

<P> As American officials prefer, the book's focus is on what went right — and while much did, it is our failed pursuit of Al Qaeda that is relevant to our engagement in Iraq, especially as its agents steadily escalate their post-9/11 pace of terrorist activity. It is not reassuring that the same war planners who completely misjudged the enemy in Tora Bora are now plotting our cakewalk through Iraq.</p>

<P> Mr. Woodward does offer some useful, if unexamined, nuggets on Iraq, showing that Paul Wolfowitz wanted to target it from the start. According to "Bush at War," though, Mr. Wolfowitz was not driven by ideology or any certainty of a connection between Saddam and Al Qaeda, but by the expectation that "war against Iraq might be easier than against Afghanistan." In a subsequent interview, President Bush explained why he didn't want to go to war simultaneously with Al Qaeda and Saddam after 9/11: "If we tried to do too many things — two things, for example, or three things — militarily, then . . . the lack of focus would have been a huge risk." </p>

<P> The follow-up question that can't be found in "Bush at War" is simple enough: If it was a huge risk to split our focus between Saddam and Al Qaeda then, why isn't it now?</p>
