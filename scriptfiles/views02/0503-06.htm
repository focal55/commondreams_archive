<p>YALE UNIVERSITY decided last month to offer supplemental financial aid to 

students who have lost their eligibility for funding from the federal 

government due to a drug conviction. This decision places Yale at the 

forefront of a national movement to combat the injustices of the war on drugs.

<P>Students convicted of any kind of drug offense, misdemeanor or felony, are 

denied federal financial aid under the Drug Free Student Aid provision of the 

1998 amendments to the Higher Education Act. Nearly 50,000 students have lost 

their aid since the law took effect. At least that many others have been able 

to attend college and graduate school, despite drug convictions, simply 

because they could afford to pay the tuition without financial aid.

<P>Yale is the third university, after Swarthmore and Hampshire colleges, to 

publicly acknowledge the injustice of this provision, which punishes 

individuals for their inability to pay for school, not for their drug offense. 

Not only does the drug provision of the Higher Education Act inflict extreme 

hardship on low-income students, like most drug laws, the provision unfairly 

targets poor students of color.

<P>As a Yale graduate, I am well aware that Yale's new policy may affect few 

applicants for financial aid to that University. Nevertheless, Yale's decision 

is significant because it is grounded in moral principles and common decency 

and thus broadcasts a message of national significance. Indeed, Yale's new 

policy harks back to a similar commitment made by the University at the height 

of the Vietnam War. Yale chose to supplement the financial aid of students who 

were conscientious objectors to that war, and as a result, emerged as a 

powerful, ethical voice across the country.

<P>The drug provision of the Higher Education Act does nothing to reduce 

problems associated with alcohol or drug use on college campuses and instead 

imposes barriers to education for individuals for whom access to education 

should be a top priority. While many students who attend Yale are regular drug 

users of both licit and illicit drugs, more than 63 percent of those students 

can afford to pay Yale's tuition of $30,000 a year and can also afford to use 

drugs in the privacy of their own dorm rooms. Perhaps the biggest drug-related 

problem facing colleges is that of alcohol -- a drug not covered by the Higher 

Education Act.

<P>The drug provision of the Higher Education Act is only one of several laws 

that Congress recently has passed that create obstacles for persons in 

recovery, such as the denial of housing and welfare benefits to individuals 

convicted of a drug offense.

<P>If one of the most prestigious universities in America is moved to fight 

the injustice of this drug provision on its campus, then Congress should feel 

obligated to revisit and reform the act on behalf of those individuals who 

lack access to Yale's endowment. Even the original author of the drug 

provision, U.S. Rep. Mark Souder, R-Ind., has noted that the bill has had an 

impact that he never intended.

<P>Congress should heed the example set by Yale's new policy, which 

demonstrates the need for drug laws based on common sense, compassion and 

justice, rather than ignorance, fear, prejudice and punishment.
