<p>You want an American hero? A real hero? </p>

<P> I nominate Judge Damon J. Keith of the United States Court of Appeals for 

the Sixth Circuit. </p>

<P> Judge Keith wrote an opinion, handed down last Monday by a three-judge panel 

in Cincinnati, that clarified and reaffirmed some crucially important democratic 

principles that have been in danger of being discarded since the terrorist attacks 

last Sept. 11.</p>

<P> The opinion was a reflection of true patriotism, a 21st-century echo of a 

pair of comments made by John Adams nearly two centuries ago. "Liberty," said 

Adams, "cannot be preserved without a general knowledge among the people."</p>

<P> And in a letter to Thomas Jefferson in 1816, Adams said, "Power must never 

be trusted without a check."</p>

<P> Last Monday's opinion declared that it was unlawful for the Bush administration 

to conduct deportation hearings in secret whenever the government asserted that 

the people involved might be linked to terrorism.</p>

<P> The Justice Department has conducted hundreds of such hearings, out of sight 

of the press and the public. In some instances the fact that the hearings were 

being held was kept secret.</p>

<P> The administration argued that opening up the hearings would compromise its 

fight against terrorism. Judge Keith, and the two concurring judges in the unanimous 

ruling, took the position that excessive secrecy compromised the very principles 

of free and open government that the fight against terror is meant to protect.</p>

<P> The opinion was forceful and frequently eloquent.</p>

<P> "Democracies die behind closed doors," wrote Judge Keith.</p>

<P> He said the First Amendment and a free press protect the "people's right to 

know" that their government is acting fairly and lawfully. "When government begins 

closing doors," he said, "it selectively controls information rightfully belonging 

to the people. Selective information is misinformation."</p>

<P> He said, "A government operating in the shadow of secrecy stands in complete 

opposition to the society envisioned by the framers of our Constitution."</p>

<P> The concurring judges were Martha Craig Daughtrey and James G. Carr. The panel 

acknowledged — and said it even shared — "the government's fear that dangerous 

information might be disclosed in some of these hearings." But the judges said 

when that possibility arises, the proper procedure for the government would be 

to explain "on a case-by-case basis" why the hearing should be closed.</p>

<P> "Using this stricter standard," wrote Judge Keith, "does not mean that information 

helpful to terrorists will be disclosed, only that the government must be more 

targeted and precise in its approach."</p>

<P> A blanket policy of secrecy, the court said, is unconstitutional.</p>

<P> The case that led to the panel's ruling involved a Muslim clergyman in Ann 

<org idsrc="OTCBB" value="ARBR">Arbor</org>, Mich., Rabih Haddad, who overstayed 

his tourist visa. The ruling is binding on courts in Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio 

and Tennessee and may serve as a precedent in other jurisdictions.</p>

<P> The attorneys who argued the case against the government represented four 

Michigan newspapers and Representative John Conyers Jr., a Michigan Democrat. 

They took no position on whether Mr. Haddad should be deported.</p>

<P> "Secrecy is the evil here," said Herschel P. Fink, a lawyer who represented 

The Detroit Free Press. He said the government "absolutely" had an obligation 

to "vigorously" fight terrorism. But excessive secrecy, he said, was intolerable.</p>

<P> "We just want to watch," said Mr. Fink.</p>

<P> Judge Keith specifically addressed that issue. The people, he said, had deputized 

the press "as the guardians of their liberty."</p>

<P> The essence of the ruling was the reaffirmation of the importance of our nation's 

system of checks and balances. While the executive branch has tremendous power 

and authority with regard to immigration issues and the national defense, it does 

not have carte blanche.</p>

<P> Lee Gelernt, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union who represented 

some of the plaintiffs in the case, noted that the administration has been arguing 

since Sept. 11 that it needs much more authority to act unilaterally and without 

scrutiny by the public and the courts.</p>

<P> He said last week's ruling was the most recent and, thus far, the most important 

to assert, "That's not the way it's done in our system." </p>
