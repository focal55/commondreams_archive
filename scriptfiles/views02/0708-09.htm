<p>When are dead women and children not recognized as dead women and children? 

When they are killed by US bombs in Afghanistan! 

<p>In an all too familiar lethal pattern, US warplanes recently attacked four 

small villages in the Oruzgan province of Afghanistan. When initial reports surfaced 

from surviving family members about scores of civilian casualties, the first response 

by US military authorities in Afghanistan was denial of culpability. A US officer 

at the Bagram air base reluctantly admitted that while “there were civilian casualties 

during the operation..., military forces take extraordinary measures to protect 

against civilian casualties.” Only after incontrovertible evidence about the killings 

surfaced in the world media did Lt. General Dan McNeil, US commander in Afghanistan, 

announce on July 6, 2002 that 48 civilians had been killed. 

<p>Contradicting the claims by US military authorities about the concern for civilian 

casualties, one eyewitness was quoted in an Agence France Presse <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines02/0707-01.htm">report 

of July 7th</a> that “after bombing the area, US forces...refused to let the people 

help the victims or take them away for treatment.” A tribal leader in the area 

expressed anger and dismay at the US operation by asserting: “We fought in the 

same bunkers with the Americans against the Taliban, but now we are the enemy.” 

<p>Throughout the US war in Afghanistan, the targeting of civilians, whether intentional 

or not, has led to death and destruction on a massive scale. The managers of the 

war, however, have refused to acknowledge responsibility except in a few showcase 

incidents, such as the friendly fire that killed Canadian soldiers. 

<p>One of the most egregious examples of callous disregard for Afghan civilians 

happened last October when a village north of Kandahar was strafed by AC-130 gunships, 

resulting in the death of at least 93 civilians. The blunt response by one Pentagon 

official was that “the people there are dead because we wanted them dead.” Trying 

to avoid any further probing of the incident, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld said: 

“I cannot deal with that particular village.” 

<p>In fact, the Pentagon has not kept any statistics about civilian deaths in 

Afghanistan. Or, rather, there has been no concerted effort to provide the media 

with the awful death toll of innocents in Afghanistan. Fortunately, Professor 

Marc Herold of the University of New Hampshire has generated substantive information 

about such deaths and has made them available on his website. By the end of 2001, 

the US military had killed more than all of those murdered on September 11th. 

<p>Over the first six months of 2002, various reports of bombings of wedding parties 

and family gatherings in friendly villages have accumulated. And the anger of 

Afghans against the United States has been growing apace. One survivor of the 

recent attack on the wedding party at Kakrak agonized that the “Americans should 

be put on trial.” Perhaps it’s no coincidence that the refusal of the Bush Administration 

to join the International Criminal Court comes amidst the repeated war crimes 

in Afghanistan. 

<p>Even former war planners, such as John Warden, a retired Air Force strategist 

, are expressing concern over the direction of US bombing in Afghanistan. “We 

are now doing things that appear to give marginal return,” Warden asserts in a 

July 7 Washington Post article, “but at a potentially very high cost.” Given Warden’s 

part as a Pentagon spokesperson denying the bombing of a Baghdad bomb shelter 

that killed over a thousand civilians, it is instructive that there is questioning 

from former military strategists about US bombing in Afghanistan. 

<p>Of course, the Pentagon and the Bush Administration have tried to follow the 

script from the Gulf War in hiding civilian deaths behind a screen of technowar 

spectacle and muzzling of media sources. US warplanes deliberately destroyed the 

Kabul offices of Al Jazeera, the independent Arab television station that broadcast 

civilian deaths, along with reputed film of Osama bin Laden. (Remember him - the 

guy who was the supposed target for the war in Afghanistan.) At certain points 

the Pentagon has been aided, much to the later dismay of Dan Rather, by complicit 

media executives. CNN’s head, Walter Isaacson, early on maintained that it would 

be “perverse” to grant any extensive coverage to civilian deaths in Afghanistan. 

What’s more perverse is the failure to provide any consistent analysis of the 

failures and flaws of the war in Afghanistan and the attendant war against terrorism.

<p>In trying to manage public relations about the operation of warmaking, the 

Pentagon learned several important lessons from the Vietnam War - don’t let reporters 

get out into the field and don’t bother with body counts. The credibility of the 

military and the Johnson and Nixon Administrations suffered partially as a consequence 

of intrepid reporting and inflated body counts. So, in Grenada, Panama, and the 

Gulf War, the Pentagon tried to manage the news in order to cover-up the civilian 

casualties. 

<p>Now, as the Bush Administration and the Pentagon shift into gear for their 

preemptive warmaking against much of the world, they are developing a “Joint Stealth 

Task Force” that can launch sneak attacks whenever and wherever. Of course, the 

Bush Administration is going out of its way to mount a very visible campaign of 

“regime change” in Iraq. The Pentagon’s mission is to marshal a massive force 

for a potential invasion, an invasion that can be counted on killing tens of thousands 

of innocent Iraqis who will remain hidden or counted as mere collateral damage. 

<p>On the other hand, it may be impossible to lie about the statistics of US deaths 

as body bags start arriving in the United States. Before further tragic deaths 

occur, this Administration and the Pentagon have got to be corralled. Enough people 

have suffered from the cowboy in the White House, his hawkish cabinet, and the 

gun-slinging Pentagon.
