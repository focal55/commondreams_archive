<p>LAST MONTH the Air Force general in charge of developing the missile defense 

system declared that the elusive technology had finally proven itself. ''We no 

longer need to experiment, to demonstrate, or prevaricate,'' Lieutenant General 

Ronald Kadish said. ''We need to get on with this.''

<P>But the record of Pentagon assertions in favor of missile defense has been 

unreliable, to say the least. A project that is bringing tens of billions of dollars 

into military-industrial coffers carries an irresistible bias in its own behalf, 

and history shows that neither the Defense Department nor its contractors are 

reliable evaluators of the science and technology on which President Bush's vaunted 

''shield'' must stand. Leave aside for the moment the disturbing question of whether 

US initiatives toward missile defense will ignite a mortal new arms race with 

China and others. The remaining question of feasibility is grave enough. Can the 

nation afford $100 billion for a system that won't work? Can the government put 

the lives of citizens at risk behind a shield that will not protect? </P>

<P>Such questions are too important to leave to the obviously biased evaluators 

of the Pentagon and the defense industry. That is why the scientific claims of 

the Missile Defense Agency and its contractors must be examined by disinterested 

experts in the scientific community. On such independence rests the health of 

the US economy, the safety of the nation, and the integrity of science itself 

when so much else has been corrupted. These are the stakes of a dispute that has 

been brewing at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for more than a year.</P>

<P>Theodore A. Postol is a professor of science, technology, and national security 

policy at MIT. He earned a reputation as a debunker of the Patriot missile's Gulf 

War performance and then as a skeptic of missile defense. He challenged whether 

the system under design could ever reliably distinguish between incoming warheads 

and decoys. </P>

<P>At particular issue was a 1997 test conducted and deemed successful by the 

defense contractor TRW. After that ''success'' was questioned by federal investigators, 

MIT's Lincoln Laboratory was hired to evaluate it. In 1999 Lincoln Lab affirmed 

TRW's results. Soon thereafter Postol objected, challenging not only the Pentagon 

and its contractor - but his own university. The Government Accounting Office 

investigated and concluded that Postol was right in pointing out flaws in the 

TRW test, but Postol's charge had gone beyond flaws to fraud. ''Lincoln Lab,'' 

he said to me over coffee recently, ''covered up a program-stopping flaw in the 

missile defense system. A great university involved in a coverup?''</P>

<P>In April 2001 Postol went to MIT authorities about the matter, and then early 

this year he went public, raising the grave question of whether Lincoln Lab colluded 

in TRW's deception. Postol argued that the ''success'' of the experiment depended 

on a match between observed phenomena and predicted phenomena. Had TRW fraudulently 

substituted one for the other? Had Lincoln Lab knowingly covered up that substitution? 

Had Lincoln Lab misled federal investigators? Had top MIT officials ignored and 

distorted these charges? Postol demanded an investigation. Last February, MIT 

launched an in-house inquiry into Postol's charges. (The Boston Globe called for 

an independent investigation at that time, asking MIT ''to reconsider this self-protecting 

institutional reflex.'')</P>

<P>The internal MIT inquiry into its own conduct was concluded last month, and 

it called for the outside investigation Postol had been demanding all along. That 

recommendation has now gone to MIT's top officials, and what it will lead to remains 

to be seen. </P>

<P>Postol, for his part, has already reached a conclusion and is hoping for a 

congressional intervention. In letters he sent in late October to Representative 

Howard Berman, Democrat of California, and Senator Charles Grassley, Republican 

of Iowa, cosponsors of the False Claims Act, Postol wrote, ''In effect, Lincoln 

verified and certified as accurate bookkeeping arithmetic when Lincoln knew that 

the bookkeeping practices were fraudulent.''</P>

<P>This might sound like a reprise of the Enron scandal when both a company and 

its watchdog accountants were caught lying - a corruption not only of a basic 

system but also of the system's oversight mechanism. But Enron, finally, involved 

only money. The corruption that Postol alleges goes to the quick of scientific 

integrity, to the dead center of the academy's relationship to government and, 

even more crucial, to the method by which future US defense strategies will be 

devised.</P>

<P>The independent investigation demanded by the courageous Postol is long overdue. 

His demands might seem like disloyalty to a besieged university protective of 

its reputation. They might seem like mere ''prevarication'' to a Pentagon wanting 

''to get on'' with missile defense. But to America there is nothing esoteric about 

the truth, especially when falsehood, igniting an arms race, can pave the road 

to war.</P>
