<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->Here's 

a brief description of two very different parts of the country. 

<p> The first is Ridgewood Avenue, that segment of U.S. 1 that links Holly Hill 

to Daytona Beach. Like most of U.S. 1's 2,500 miles America's original highway 

hymn to ugliness it isn't pretty. It ruts and wears its way through rutted and 

wearied storefronts, pawn shops and porn shops, cash loan joints and used car 

lots, seedy delis and seedier motels, a few churches to spruce up hope and a television 

station's steeple, higher than any other, to remind the faithful of what matters 

most. The place hasn't changed that much from what it was in 1938 when Life magazine 

featured the highway as a mess of "hot-dog stands, signs, shacks, dumps and shoddy 

gas stations." 

<p> The other place is Hill City, Kansas, a Census Bureau blip in the Great Plains' 

wheat seas. Barely a town of two avenues and less than 2,000 people at the junction 

of U.S. 24 and U.S. 283, Hill City's biggest claim to fame is a small oil museum 

(you let yourself in by getting the key from the motel across the road) and its 

Pomeroy Inn, a bed & breakfast run by Don and Mary Worcester out of a turn-of-the-century 

saloon, and where the cinnamon buns taste of Eden. Otherwise the place is an ode 

to the uneventful. The lead story in the weekly Hill City Times recently was about 

Gwen and Roger Cooper's continuing progress on their soon-to-be-opened Gwen's 

Hometown Cafe downtown, where shuttered storefronts are the main fare. 

<p> Now, which of the two, Ridgewood Avenue or Hill City, rates as the best illustration 

of the "heartland"? It would naturally be Hill City, and in purely geographic 

terms, it would have to be. But geography is the least of the word's connotations 

anymore. The word is an ideological euphemism, a warm and fuzzy fabrication of 

that place that supposedly represents America's hard-working, self-reliant, honest, 

friendly, God-fearing, and of course supremely white, supremely heterosexual core. 

<p> The myth of the heartland is so potent that it has become the conservative 

ideologue's El Dorado, a geopolitical fiction without which Republicans since 

Ronald Reagan would have had no crutch on which to build their all-business, all-righteousness, 

no-tax, no-regulation America. It is to that El Dorado that George W. Bush retreats 

every time the more sclerotic realities of deficits or corporate corruption at 

the nation's extremities risk infecting his presidency, every time "blue-state" 

liberalism appears to breach his program for the "Real America." Because only 

in El Dorado can he make his fictions sound believable. 

<p> By posing against "heartland" backdrops such as Midwestern state fairs, Mount 

Rushmore or his beloved ranch in Texas, as he did in his latest "Home to the Heartland 

Tour" last August, Bush is saying something simple and appealing to those "red 

states" that gave his candidacy just enough legitimacy to become, with that Supreme 

Court nudge, a presidency. He is saying that a place like Hill City is the real 

America. A place like Ridgewood Avenue isn't, or at least not as much. 

<p> And yet that version of the heartland has never really existed anymore than 

George Washington's cherry tree or Jack Kennedy's virtue. The true heartland is 

closer to the kind of Kansas Truman Capote portrayed in "In Cold Blood" (the true 

story of a family murdered by drifters), the kind of Texas John Steinbeck called 

"a military nation," not just because capital punishment is a conveyor belt entertainment 

there, the kind of Oklahoma where whitebread, blue-eyed American fanatics blow 

up government buildings, the kind of heartland where Willa Cather's proud pioneers 

homesteaded an acre for every buried memory of America's Indian holocaust. 

<p> Economically, the "heartland" is the nation's least productive, least self-reliant, 

most anemic segment of the economy, the biggest gobbler of government welfare 

in the form of farm subsidies, the most rapacious abuser, at taxpayers' expense, 

of mining rights, grazing rights and water rights. As economist and columnist 

Paul Krugman noted recently, "blue America subsidizes red America to the tune 

of $90 billion or so each year." To top it off, those heartland states' murder, 

divorce, depression and suicide rates are higher than in "blue" states. Red-blooded 

conservatism has never seemed so grim, so hungry for hand-outs, so capably deluding. 

<p> But so many comparisons ultimately expose the idiocy of judging one part of 

America truer, or more American, than another. Hill City's wholesome, if deserted, 

sidewalks aren't any more American than Ridgewood Avenue's prostitute-addled corners, 

nor is Manhattan, N.Y., any less of a heartland than Manhattan, Kansas. It would 

be nice if the president quit making such distinctions in his subtle ways. But 

he believes in those distinctions as honestly as he believes his own fictions. 

It isn't up to him to make him realize that America is every square inch a heartland, 

or that it beats for a lot more hearts than his compassion has room for.
