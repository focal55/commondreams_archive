<p>Back when the first Gulf War was being

debated, I gave a speech at an anti-war rally in

Charleston, Illinois. A university student

interrupted to heckle. I stopped and looked at him:

"You look like you could carry a gun. If you think

this war is such a great idea, why don't you sign

up for it?"



<p>He didn't have an answer. But it wasn't

merely a rhetorical question. During the first Gulf

War, only two out of 535 members of Congress,

and no cabinet members had children who served

there. Republican Senator Chuck Hagel, a

Vietnam veteran, recently noted that "many of

those who want to rush this country into war . . .

don't know anything about war .  . .They come at

it from an intellectual perspective versus having

sat in jungles or foxholes and watched their

friends get their heads blown off."



<p>That includes President Bush, who -- like

many privileged young men -- avoided Vietnam

by serving in the National Guard; and Vice

President Dick Cheney, who got a student

deferment and beat the draft altogether.



<p>Today's "economic draft" continues a long

tradition of having poor and working people fight

and die for the ambitions of the rich and powerful.

And it is perhaps more clear than ever that this is

what our troops will be fighting and dying for.



<p>While the Bush Administration has (for

now) given up on its attempts to link Saddam

Hussein to September 11 or to terrorism, and has

offered scant new evidence of a security threat

from Iraq, there are other reasons for war. The

economy is sputtering, and a number of scandals

threaten to ruin this Presidency. The President

himself profited from accounting scams very

similar to those that brought down Enron, while

he was a director of Harken Energy Corporation.

Cheney is under even more suspicion for his

chairmanship at Halliburton, which includes --

among other things -- accounting irregularities

and his own $18.5 million profit from selling

stock not long before bad news about the

company became public. Then there is the most

massive intelligence failure in American history --

the ignored or unnoticed warning signals of

September 11.



<p>Add in various corporate accountability

scandals (including Enron) and voters' anger and

disgust, and any of the likely domestic issues in

the November elections -- for example, Medicare

and prescription drugs, Social Security -- and it is

easy to see why this administration is eager to

embrace war. Without even a single shot being

fired, the Bush Administration has managed to

shove aside almost all the issues that could hurt

them politically, and focus the media's attention

on Iraq.



<p>People have forgotten how much domestic

opposition there was to the first Gulf War, before

it started. For a while it looked like Congress

might not even give its approval, and opponents

organized the largest national anti-war

demonstration since the Vietnam era. But once the

war started, President George Bush I was able to

capitalize on the tendency, at the beginning of

every war, for people (including journalists and

politicians) to equate support for the war with

support for the troops that are in combat. The war

was over in a few weeks, US casualties were very

few, and as Adolph Hitler once noted, "the victor

will never be asked if he told the truth."



<p>No one knows if Bush II can repeat this

scenario. First there is the problem of conquering

Iraq and running the country, despite its

geographic and ethnic divisions. And then there

are the economic consequences of the war: a

potentially serious spike in oil prices, and huge

costs (the last Gulf war cost $80 billion in today's

dollars).



<p>But even if he can pull it off, Americans

will still lose. Aside from increasing hatred in the

rest of the world, there is a domestic cost to these

foreign adventures that pushes us toward the back

of the pack among developed nations in so many

areas that really matter: health insurance, poverty

rates, education, infant mortality. We lose because

we allow corrupt politicians to divert us from the

real issues here at home, simply by pointing a

finger overseas at the enemy-of-the-month. (Who

is usually a former friend and ally, as Saddam was

when he actually used his chemical weapons

against Iran, and Washington provided satellite

and intelligence data to help him).



<p>Last year George W. Bush joked that "you

can fool some of the people, all of the time -- and

those are the ones you have to concentrate on." It

remains to be seen if he can fool enough people to

get this war going.
