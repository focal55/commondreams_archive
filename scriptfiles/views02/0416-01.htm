FURNITURE: The United States seat at the International Criminal Court.

<p>

<IMG align=left hspace=14 vspace=14 SRC=images/seanlogo.jpg WIDTH=94 HEIGHT=124 BORDER=0>The first permanent war crimes tribunal will be officially open for business on July 1 now that the Rome Treaty has been signed and ratified by the 60-plus countries needed to establish the court.

<p>

Last week, when the final ratifying votes were cast at a United Nations ceremony, U.N. secretary-general Kofi Annan said: "Those who commit war crimes, genocide or other crimes against humanity will no longer be beyond the reach of justice. Humanity will be able to defend itself - responding to the worst of human nature with one of the greatest human achievements: the rule of law."

<p>

Even though many nations and non-government organizations have been working for years to establish such a court to fill a gap in international law made apparent by the Nuremberg and Tokyo trials of German and Japanese war criminals, "the United States has been the only vocal opponent of the permanent court, fearing its citizens would be subject to frivolous or politically-motivated prosecutions," the Associated Press reported.

<p>

Three weeks ago, "the Bush administration said it was considering 'unsigning' the treaty (initially signed by former President Clinton) to stress that it won't be bound by its provisions - provisions, by the way, disproportionately influenced by American legal minds.

<p>

Price: Credibility of claim to being global leaders when it comes to the rule of law, or best offer.

<p>

VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT: Good crisis management skills needed in oil-rich nation. Third biggest supplier of oil to the U.S. and the world's fourth-biggest oil exporter. Many citizens, however, living in squalor.

<p>

 Hugo Chavez was elected on anti-poverty platform, only to be the victim of a coup last week. Chavez replaced by Pedro Carmona, the pro-business authoritarian. When Carmona took power last week, the oil-friendly Bush administration said "now the situation will be one of tranquillity and democracy." The very next day the people of Venezuela mounted a successful nonviolent insurrection. Carmona resigned as pro-Chavez protesters demanded "Democracy, not dictatorship" in the streets of Caracas.

<p>

Applicant must be willing to accept high political risks. Considering the Bush doctrine of either you're with us or you're an evil terrorist, if the United States should accept Carmona the rightful ruler, even though the 19-nation Rio Group of Latin American countries voted not to recognize Carmona's government, Venezuela could shoot up on the United States' Top 10 terror list. Unless, of course, the next Venezuelan president can manage to keep the rabble in line so the oil profits can keep flowing.
