When elephants fight, it's the grass that

        suffers. Two nations like the United States and Iraq have

        unlimited potential for rendering irreversible damage to

        each other, to the environment and to the innocent people

        who get trampled underfoot in the stampede of war. <p>As

        a pacifist, I do not endorse violence. </p>

        

<p>But let's imagine for a moment that I went along with

        the idea that removing President Saddam Hussein from

        power in Iraq was a good idea, that this action would

        decrease the cycle of violence in the world, and that it

        were a decent and honorable thing to do. </p>

        <p>Imagine that we got rid of Saddam. Then what? </p>

        <p>There are still 23 million people living in Iraq, so

        long as we did not kill a significant number of them in

        dethroning the infamous leader of the Ba'ath party. Among

        the Iraqis left standing are young men and women who have

        grown up in a decidedly anti-American environment, who

        have been nutritionally deprived since conscious memory

        and who are living daily with the threat of future

        bombings which have dotted the landscape, virtually

        escaping Western media reports for the past eleven years.

        </p>

        <p>Are we naive to think that this same underdeveloped

        population that has endured hellishly hot summers, putrid

        water and abominable health conditions will now embrace

        American presence and show gratitude for our

        reinvigorated military effort against them? </p>

        <p>Imagine for a moment that we stopped finger-pointing

        and blaming Saddam for starving his people for the past

        eleven years. Imagine that we stopped blaming a

        recalcitrant Sanctions Committee and policy making team

        from the State Department. Imagine that we viewed the

        humanitarian crisis in Iraq simply as people in need. The

        unending, maddening seclusion maintained by the world

        community could then be addressed. </p>

        <p>What will we do for these civilian Iraqis with whom we

        have no argument, the unseen innocent survivors of an

        eleven-year siege? </p>

        

<p>A lasting peace plan in Iraq would have to begin by

        addressing the immediate needs of the average Iraqi

        people &#151; their access to potable water, their

        educational infrastructure, healthcare system, their

        agriculture and oil industries &#151; as well as their

        access to interstate and international travel.

        Restrictions on traveling to and from Iraq must be

        amended so that a dialogue may begin between Iraqis and

        other cultures throughout the world, starting with study

        abroad and student exchange programs.</p>

        

<p>In Iraq, doctors need vaccines, syringes with needles,

        X-ray film and blood bags. Teachers need books and

        pencils. Children need shoes and a happy childhood.

        Nursing mothers need proper nutrition to provide a

        healthy start for young lives. Iraqis need a wider array

        of food options and nutritional intake other than the

        lentils and rice available under the oil-for-food

        program.</p>

        

<p>Iraq needs an infusion of currency, a way to pay its

        citizens who desire to work, achieve and fulfill the

        demands of providing for their families. Immediately,

        Iraq needs a plan to rebuild its infrastructure &#151;

        the water and sewage treatment plants and electrical

        facilities so that air conditioning and ceiling fans

        function when the temperature is 140 degrees. </p>

        <p>We must accept responsibility for the life-altering

        consequences of our policies on people who should not

        have been targeted. </p>

        

<p>The world community, led by the United Nations, must

        apologize formally and publicly to the families who have

        lost loved ones as a result of the sanctions and

        no-fly-zone bombing campaigns in the North and south of

        Iraq. We must offer our sincerest condolences for our

        complicity in the crimes that killed more than half a

        million children. </p>

        <p>Unless we do this, the civilian Iraqis who are not the

        enemy will have every justification for taking every

        opportunity to avenge the egregious wrongs done against

        them. </p>

        <p>Gandhi tells a story about a wise man meditating by a

        river. A scorpion in a tree repeatedly falls into the

        water, and the wise man rescues him each time. And each

        time, the scorpion stings him. Another man sees this

        drama played out several times and approaches the wise

        man, asking why he continues to save the scorpion and

        risk being stung every time? &#147;It is his nature to

        sting,&#148; says the wise man. &#147;I am a human. It is

        my nature to save.&#148; </p>

        <p>Iraq needs no new war, no more bombs. They need simple

        human-to-human outreach. That is the right thing to do. </p>
