<i>"As a card-carrying scandalmonger, I am moved to ask: Where's the 

scandal?"  </i>--William Safire, 14 Jan. 2002.\1



<p><i>"Indignation is a precondition for whatever new laws and regulations 

are required to prevent behavior such as Enron's.  It has been said 

that the absence of honest emotion is the shared characteristic of 

American politics and professional wrestling.  One would like to hear 

from President Bush, regarding Enron's executives...." </i>-George F. 

Will, 16 Jan. 2002.\2





<p>So, now we know from two impeachable sources: "<i>Houston, we have a 

problem."</i>\3  And the problem's name is "Enron" - a nonsense word made 

up to keep the world from knowing what it did and who ran it.  But, 

"Enron" will soon take a meaning; it will become a noun representing 

the evils of the late 20th century American political economy.



<p align="center">***



<p>William Safire, Spiro Agnew's speech writer and the New York Times 

apologist for the two Bushes, Reagan and Nixon knows a scandal when he 

sees one.  He kept "Whitewater" alive for eight years.  His praise of 

the Bush II <http://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/14/opinion/14SAFI.html>

administration's failure in October and November to do anything in 

response to Enron's "heads ups" sounds faint indeed.



<p>It will be interesting to learn whether the only Bush administration 

response was sympathetic clucks over the phone.  Or, did officials 

respond as the head of Arthur Andersen's Enron audit team: "Man the 

shredders!"



<p>And, was the timing just co-incidental of the November 2001 Executive 

Order restricting access to Bush I and Reagan presidential records and 

the deposit of Bush II's gubernatorial papers in a federal facility 

not subject to the Texas freedom of information act.



<p>Say what you like about the Republicans, they know how to handle a 

scandal.  And that old Nixon hand, William Safire, learned his 

"Watergate" lessons well.

<p>George F. Will is the most craven of the conservative punditocracy. 

When it's time to head for the hills, he finds the highest one and 

from it decries the very behavior he's encouraged for years.  His 

column today 

<http://www.boston.com/dailyglobe2/016/oped/From_evasion_to_outrage_about_

Enron+.shtml> concludes:



<p>"Now, Washington takes center stage.  By casting a cool eye on 

Enron's debris and those who made it, government can strengthen an 

economic system that depends on it."\4



<p>I don't believe in shooting fish in a barrel.  One should put them on 

the ground and give them a running chance.  So, I won't recall Will's 

devotion to deregulation, to the corporatization of government, to the 

defanging or abolition of regulatory agencies.  No, as I admire this 

walking catfish hightailing it toward the Blue Ridge, I will merely 

quote

him:



<p>"[The Enron collapse] will remind everyone ... that a mature 

capitalist economy is a government project.  A properly functioning 

free-market system does not spring spontaneously from society's soil 

as dandelions spring from suburban lawns.  Rather, it is a complex 

creation of laws and mores that guarantee among much else, 

transparency, meaning a sufficient stream ... of reliable information 

about the condition and conduct of corporations."\5



<p>After reading this paragraph, my first thought, having triple-checked 

the byline, was that George Will had done a Stephen Ambrose on Paul 

Krugman. Then I reread the article's first sentence and knew it could 

only be words of the master:



<p>"Narcissistic and even solipsistic, as usual, Washington thinks 

Enron's collapse is primarily a Washington, meaning a political, 

story."\6



<p>Quick: think what "narcissistic" means and relate it to your guess on 

"solipsistic"\7 while trying to keep straight how "Washington" might 

be wrong in seeing Enron in political terms.  Confused?  You've just 

been Willed.

 

<p>By column's end, quoted earlier, Will has pointed to "corporate 

corruption", vacillation by Bush II, the accountants' failure and the 

"coziness between corporations and their directors".  All to get to 

the point that "government" has to "strengthen" the "economic 

system".\8



<p>In short, the "Washington" of the first paragraph has the Enron 

situation dead right.  What we have is a political problem of the 

first magnitude.



<p align="center">***



<p>In law, accounting and investigative reporting, there is only one 

great rule: "Follow the money."  But in this case, following the money 

will keep us from addressing the great questions Enron forced upon us.



<p>According to Edward Ericson, Jr. 

<http://www.newmassmedia.com/nac.phtml?code=har&db=nac_fea&ref=18688>,

Enron has "2,832 subsidiaries, of which 874 are registered in the 

Cayman Islands or other tax and bank secrecy havens."\9 So, for years 

to come, we will be treated to stories about how money flowed fro and 

to - and to whom.



<p>And, diverting stories, just like Will's, they will be because they 

will focus on the scandal.  They will obscure the fact that "Enron" is 

to the 1980s and 90s as "Teapot Dome" was to the 1920s and "Standard 

Oil was to the 1890s.  "Enron" cuts across a broad range of political 

issues. Like it or not, we - the people, the polity - will have to 

address in

"Enron":

<p>

<ul>

<li>The role of money in elections.<br>

<br>

</li>

<li>The relationship between corporations and society - are 

corporations "accountable" to society or merely "responsible"?<br>

<br>

</li>

<li>The desirability of regulating "natural" monopolies, such as 

electric utilities.<br>

<br>

</li>

<li>The social, military, environmental, societal and global costs of 

relying on oil and natural gas as our principal energy sources.<br>

<br>

</li>

<li>The consequences to the nation's interests of corporations acting 

as independent agents in foreign countries - as Enron did disastrously 

in India.<br>

<br>

</li>

<li>The social consequences of shifting the management of retirement 

assets to the individual via 401k plans and the like.<br>

<br>

</li>

<li>The continued benefits of absolving shareholders of responsibility 

for corporate mis- and mal-feasance while spreading their costs, 

through bankruptcy, across society.<br>

<br>

</li>

<li>The viability in the modern world of the corporate form - something 

Adam Smith doubted in 1776.<br>

<br>

</li>

<li>The social benefits of co-operative programs between industries and 

environmental regulators.<br>

<br>

</li>

<li> The ability of the states to regulate corporate behavior.</li>

</ul>

<p>This list hardly exhausts the political questions "Enron" poses.  They 

could not have arisen at a worse time.



<p>The US and the West remain deeply shaken by the 9/11 attacks.  The US 

is led by an administration whose legitimacy is questioned by friend 

and foe alike and which has shown no capacity or desire to build and 

lead coalitions toward higher ends.



<p>But, there is never a good time for a perfect storm.  Perhaps the 

heightened sense of vulnerability we Americans feel will lead us to 

address "Enron" and the festering sores caused by the corporations 

unfettered of the 1980s and 90s.



<p>I suspect it will.
