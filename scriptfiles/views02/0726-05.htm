<p>A small weekly business paper in Texas recently published a story that gives 

new meaning to the phrase “getting high.” 

<p>The article, which appeared in the San Antonio Business Journal, pulls back 

the covers on a little-known tactic in the “war on drugs” that exposes airline 

passengers to potentially life-threatening risk, particularly in light of the 

expanding reach of global terrorism. 

<p>The tactic is brought to light by a Yale Law School professor, Steven B. Duke, 

who is attempting to prove the innocence of a client convicted of conspiracy to 

distribute heroin. The client was busted — or framed as Duke contends — after 

DEA agents transported 20 kilos (44 pounds) of heroin in December 1990 from Pakistan 

to New York City, via commercial airlines, and then allegedly used the heroin 

to snare distributors for a major drug syndicate. 

<p>A DEA spokesman in Washington, D.C., confirms that such a shipment via commercial 

airlines, called a controlled delivery, is still a tool in the agency’s crime-busting 

arsenal. In a controlled delivery, law enforcement allows a stash of illegal street 

drugs, like heroin or cocaine, to be transported from an originating location 

to its destination, under close surveillance, in an effort to snare drug-syndicate 

kingpins. 

<p>One DEA agent provided an affidavit in Duke’s legal case stating that during 

his tour of duty in Pakistan — from 1989 to 1993 — the DEA undertook “at least 

30 such controlled deliveries.” 

<p>Adding yet another layer of intrigue to the practice is the fact that the commercial 

airlines being used to transport the drugs are not necessarily informed that the 

shipments are occurring. In fact, one of the airline’s used in the December 1990 

shipment (Air France) claims that it was not aware its aircraft was enlisted as 

a mule in America’s war on drugs. 

<p>Still, on balance, some argue that controlled delivery is an effective law-enforcement 

tool in combating ruthless drug cartels. That may be true, at least when all goes 

as planned. 

<p>But when the system breaks down, or is corrupted, the consequences can be serious, 

even deadly. Duke outlines that threat in a 1999 letter to Jane Garvey, administrator 

of the Federal Aviation Administration: 

<p>“The DEA agents who brought the heroin to this country were allegedly linking 

up Pakistani drug producers and American dealers, through the assistance of informers 

working both in Pakistan and the United States. The drug dealers’ discovery that 

the distribution network had been infiltrated by informers was therefore an omnipresent 

possibility, which they might choose to defend against by blowing up the airplane. 

<p>“There is ample precedent for drug organizations planting bombs in airplanes 

occupied by passengers who are informants. In 1989, a commercial airliner headed 

for the United States was blown up in flight because the Medellin Cartel believed 

an informant was aboard. All 107 passengers and crew were killed. ...” 

<p>These revelations take on an even more ominous tone in the wake of Sept. 11. 

Consider the fact that of the 28 or so groups designated as terrorist organizations 

by the U.S. State Department, at least 10 (including al-Qaeda) have known ties 

to drug trafficking or drug cartels. 

<p>How hard would it be for terrorists to infiltrate an undercover DEA operation 

already replete with shadowy operatives — some of whom might be aware of a planned 

controlled delivery? A payoff here, a bag switch there and hours later there is 

a plane down somewhere — another casualty in the war on drugs. 

<p>Think it’s a wild conspiracy theory? Ask yourself, then, would you take the 

next flight out of your city if you knew it was hauling 44 pounds of heroin? 

<p>Of course, as it stands now, you wouldn’t know.
