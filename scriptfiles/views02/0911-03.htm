<p>I suppose I am one of those who "blame America first." That is the accusation 

hurled at anyone who suggests that this country helped to bring the attacks of 

Sept. 11, 2001, upon itself. 

<P> The natural attitude, here and elsewhere, is to blame everything on the enemy. 

<P> Why do these blowhards hate us? Because of who we are? Our president said 

that, as did many others. 

<P> The terrorists, it was said, hate us for our R-rated movies and our feminism, 

our hot dogs and our human rights, for our Christianity and our agnosticism. They 

hate us for being Americans. And if that is so, there is nothing to discuss, because 

we are not going to change who we are. We shall have to fight them. 

<P> But is that explanation believable? Would people who live halfway around the 

world hate us because of who we are? 

<P> Would they ignore the Germans and the French, shrug off the Japanese and the 

Chinese, but be mortally offended by the Americans? 

<P> Ask Middle Easterners why they hate us, and they say they don't. They do offer 

a sharp criticism of our government. 

<P> They detest our government's support of Israel, which they see as an expanding 

blob of Europeans pushing out people like them. 

<P> Osama bin Laden gave three reasons why the United States is his mortal enemy: 

<P> <b>1.</b> America's alliance with Israel; 

<P> <b>2.</b> American bases in Saudi Arabia, the Muslim holy land; and 

<P> <b>3.</b> The 10-year embargo of Iraq, which has caused hundreds of thousands 

of Iraqis to die. 

<P> These are not reasons to hate Americans for who they are. They are political 

reasons. They are things done by the governments we elected. That doesn't mean 

we have to accept these reasons as just cause for a massacre of civilians in New 

York &#151; of course not! &#151; but we might ask whether someone else would. 

<P> It is to inquire into the risks we bear because of what our government does. 

We cannot expect it to reliably defend us against suicide attacks, and especially 

so with our tradition of liberty. In the past year we have allowed it to snoop 

on us, to detain suspects without trial, to harass us at airports and X-ray our 

shoes. And still we worry. 

<P> Americans might be asking: Are our undertakings in the Middle East worth what 

we're giving up here? Instead we are thinking about whether to invade, conquer 

and occupy Iraq, on the theory that a war will make us safer. 

<P> Others would insert us in even deeper into the Middle East. In Time magazine, 

Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., says, "Change must also come to Saudi Arabia, Egypt, 

Pakistan, Iran [and] the Palestinian Authority... America's voice, as expressed 

by our government, must be outspoken in support of democratization in all of these 

countries." 

<P> Author Michael Ledeen laid it out in the Wall Street Journal: "We should instead 

be talking about using all our political, moral <i>and </i><i>military </i>genius 

[my italics] to support a vast democratic revolution to liberate all the peoples 

of the Middle East from tyranny." 

<P> Americans were raised on such talk, which imbues everything from political 

speeches to World War II movies. We do not hear the tone of moral imperialism 

in it. Foreigners pick it up immediately. They ask: "Who appointed <i>you </i>the 

world's policeman?" The American attitude is what China calls "hegemonism," the 

presumptions of a country that undertakes to manage the world. 

<P> And further &#151; a country that now undertakes to manage it mostly alone. 

<P> Tired of years of coalitions and compromises, Americans reach back for the 

freedom of action they had when America spoke only for itself. The clarity of 

it does feel better, and we do not want to give that up. 

<P> And so it comes natural to say that such-and-so is Saddam Hussein's fault, 

or bin Laden's, and not even a little bit our own &#151; because then we would 

be "blaming America first." 

<P> If we really want the freedom to act alone, let us make sure the fights we 

enter are our own. 

<P> We should be asking why we have these enemies at all. They are poor and far 

away, and they might not hate us if we left them alone.
