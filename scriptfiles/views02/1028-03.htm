<p> <font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Insisting that global terrorism 

can only be stopped by &quot;destroying it where it grows,&quot; George W. Bush 

has conveniently forgotten the US military's own terrorist training facility: 

the infamous Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation (WHISC). Located 

in Fort Benning, Georgia, WHISC has trained over 60,000 Latin American soldiers 

in the most heinous of counter-insurgency warfare techniques, and its graduates 

have gone on to comprise a bloody who's who of coups, chaos and destruction.</font> 

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WHISC is also the reason several 

non-violent protestors languish in US jails today, and with a <A HREF="http://www.soaw.org/new/article.php?id=259" target="_new" TA_new">massive 

demonstration planned</A> at the WHISC site November 15-17, that number is about 

to skyrocket. Between the upcoming protest and a House bill aimed at shutting 

down the operation once and for all, it's clear America's very own terrorist training 

camp will soon be in the spotlight. Less certain is whether the result will be 

a brutal chapter of our history closed, or a deadly double standard expanded.</font>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Established by the US military in 

Panama in 1946, WHISC(or School of the Americas/SOA, as it was previously known) 

was booted out and forced to relocate stateside in 1984. Its graduates have repeatedly 

been implicated in cases of torture, rape, massacre and assassination, their victims 

frequently social rights activists and other civilians. Small wonder that former 

Panamanian President Jorge Illueca described the school as the &quot;biggest base 

for destabilization in Latin America.&quot;</font> 

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bowing to public pressure back home, 

in 1996 the Pentagon released several of the school's training manuals, detailing 

a curriculum advocating the use of blackmail, psychological warfare, torture and 

execution. By 2000, the appalling degree of human rights abuses committed by SOA 

graduates prompted several in the House of Representatives to try closing the 

school, but just before the key congressional vote, SOA personnel presented the 

Department of Defense with a compromise: &quot;Some of your bosses have told us 

that they can't support anything with the name 'School of the Americas' on it. 

Our proposal addresses this concern. It changes the name.&quot; And with that 

SOA was closed, WHISC was duly opened, and in spite of a few cosmetic additions 

to the curriculum, America's terrorist training camp continued business as usual.</FONT></FONT></font>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The farcical charade doesn't get 

very far with Fr. Roy Bourgeois, founder of School of the Americas Watch. One 

of the remarkable priests whose untiring social activism is detailed in Strabala 

&amp; Palacek's <A HREF="http://www.algora.com/Prophets.htm" target="_new" TA_new">&quot;Prophets 

Without Honor,&quot;</A> Bourgeois sees the Latin American military's role as 

keeping &quot;the poor on edge and the small elite in power. The School of Americas 

is connected to that.&quot; Bourgeois has done repeated stints in US prisons due 

to criminal trespass, or &quot;crossing the line&quot; into Fort Benning - but 

he isn't alone. Of the 10,000 who peacefully protested at WHISC last November, 

a full 36 were given sentences of up to six months in federal prison, and it's 

anyone's guess how many new US political prisoners will result from the upcoming 

protest. </font>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A bipartisan effort to shut down 

WHISC was narrowly defeated in the House last year, but a similar bill (<A HREF="http://www.theorator.com/bills107/hr1810.html" target="_new" TA_new">HR 

1810</A>) has been reintroduced by Rep. Jim McGovern (D-MA). HR 1810 already has 

112 sponsors, and if passed would not only close the school but also establish 

a joint congressional task force &quot;to conduct an assessment of the kind of 

education and training that is appropriate for the Department of Defense to provide 

to military personnel of Latin American nations.&quot;</font>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Which is probably why the Bush administration 

is pushing through plans to set up a <A HREF="http://www.latinamericapress.org/article.asp?lanCode=1&amp;artCode=3042" target="_new" TA_new">successor 

to WHISC in Costa Rica</FONT></A>. With billions in US military aid funneled to 

dirty wars throughout Latin America, local fighters are needed to carry out Washington's 

agenda, and their training cannot hinge on such niceties as law or public opposition. 

Case in point: Colombia has received military equipment and a $1.3 billion aid 

package- not to mention over 250 US military personnel on the ground - to help 

the government fight against what it calls counter-insurgents (frequently peasants 

or community leaders such as educators, union organizers and religious workers). 

Add to that a full 10,000 Colombian WHISC/SOA graduates and plans to set up WHISC-oriented 

training locally, and it's clear the US is not only inviting mission creep, but 

more importantly entering a bloody and unethical quagmire.</font>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The choice is ours: pay lip-service 

to fighting global terrorism as we secretly conduct terrorist training on the 

side, or confront this beast wherever it grows, both abroad and at home. </font>
