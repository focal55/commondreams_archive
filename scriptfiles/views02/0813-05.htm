<p>Dennis Kucinich is using his summer vacation to stir up working people across 

America. Come fall, he might just find that he is a serious contender for the 

Democratic nomination for president in 2004. 

<P>Indeed, while every Democrat who is even pondering a presidential run angled 

for a prime speaking slot at this week's Iowa AFL-CIO dinner - in hopes that the 

right message will kick-start their campaigns in that state's critical caucuses 

- Kucinich has been awarded the coveted keynoter spot. Later this month, he'll 

address the conventions of the United Steelworkers and Service Employees unions. 

<P>None of this means that the labor movement is ready to throw its considerable 

weight behind a still relatively obscure congressman from Cleveland. But it does 

suggest that Kucinich, whose passionate defense of workers' rights, civil liberties 

and sensible foreign policies recalls William Jennings Bryan more than it does 

most contemporary politicians, is certainly getting noticed. 

<P>Kucinich is in some senses an unlikely Democratic presidential prospect. He 

has cast votes against abortion rights protections, he has an intensely spiritual 

side and he is entirely unafraid of speaking his mind and standing his ground 

- even when it costs him politically. The former mayor of Cleveland was forced 

out of office at the dawn of the 1980s Reagan era when he refused to buckle under 

pressure from bankers and corporate power brokers who wanted to privatize the 

city's municipal utilities. 

<P>After Kucinich lost he was written off as a political ghost. But in the mid-1990s, 

he returned to haunt the corporate interests that had driven him from office more 

than a decade earlier. In 1994, Kucinich won a seat in the Ohio legislature as 

one of the few Democratic challengers to prevail in that Republican landslide 

year. Two years later, in 1996, he beat a Republican congressman and headed for 

Washington. 

<P>Unlike most politicians who suffer early in their careers, however, Kucinich 

did not come back cautious. Rather, the current chairman of the Congressional 

Progressive Caucus may well be the boldest member of the current Congress. 

<P>His courage was on display earlier this year when, in a speech to the Southern 

California chapter of Americans for Democratic Action, the congressman delivered 

the speech heard round the world. At a time when few members of Congress were 

willing to challenge a president with 90 percent approval ratings in the polls 

or that president's military adventuring abroad, Kucinich dared to demand that 

the United States stop and reflect on strategies that had led to the deaths of 

thousands of innocent civilians in Afghanistan, inflamed tensions in the Middle 

East, estranged the United States from European allies and undermined constitutional 

rights at home. 

<P>The talk of a Kucinich presidential run started after that speech, as dissenters 

from the Bush administration's military and economic policies hailed him as one 

of the few Democrats who was willing to challenge not just a popular president 

but the direction in which the nation was headed. 

<P>Whether Kucinich actually makes a run, and whether that run draws the support 

of powerful unions, remains a big "if." But there is no question that the congressman 

will continue to be the sort of outspoken dissenter from a dreary status quo that 

his party desperately needs. 

<P>"I believe the world is a profoundly creative place where we can turn war into 

peace, where we can turn famine into plenty, where we can turn fear into hope. 

But that does require us to speak up," says the Cleveland Democrat. "When we limit 

ourselves to the fears of the moment, we often miss opportunities to change the 

whole debate."</p> </p>
