<p>Once again the Supreme Court has taken a swipe at student's rights. Its ruling 

allowing random drug testing for students participating in extracurricular activities 

is but one in a series of decisions attacking students' constitutional rights. 

<P>The ruling turns every student into a suspect, even if there is no evidence 

of drug use. Essentially, we students are all deemed guilty until proven 

innocent, despite the fact that research shows students involved in after-

school activities are less likely to use drugs than other students.

<P>Moreover, rulings like this are turning schools into "enclaves of 

totalitarianism," to quote former Supreme Court Justice Abe Fortas. To quote 

Justice Fortas from Tinker vs. Des Moines Independent School District: "It can 

hardly be argued that either students or teachers shed their constitutional 

rights . . . at the schoolhouse gate."

<P>Why, then, did the Supreme Court uphold what would clearly be a violation 

of the Fourth Amendment if it occurred anywhere besides a school? In my 

opinion, it is a result of the conservative justices' view that youth are sort-

of citizens, who are not entitled to the same protections as adults. If we 

continue down this road, schools will soon only teach about the Constitution, 

not abide by it.

<P>As youth, we have to confront this belief every day. Our schools and our 

society demand adult behavior and responsibility out of us, punish us as 

adults, but refuse to allow us the same rights and freedoms as adults in 

return. This is unfortunate because, as William Harvard once said, "The 

greatest glory of a free-born people is to transmit that freedom to their 

children."
