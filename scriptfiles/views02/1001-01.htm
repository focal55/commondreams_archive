<p>It sure smells like imperialism. That's the word historians use when powerful 

nations grab control of desired resources, be it the gold of the New World or 

the oil of the Middle East.

<p>Imperialist greed is what "regime change" in Iraq and "anticipatory self-defense" 

are all about, and all of the rest of the Bush administration's talk about security 

and democracy is a bunch of malarkey.

<p>In the laundry list of reasons the Bush team has been trotting out in defense 

of a unilateral invasion of Iraq, oil is never mentioned. Is the fact that Iraq 

holds a huge pool of oil a piddling footnote to this debate? Is that Gulf War 

protest sign, "No Blood for Oil," too cynical, even passe? Perhaps we should ask 

National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, who served as a Chevron director and 

had an oil tanker named after her.

<p> Despite her corporate connections, Rice is a scholar, and she should know 

her history: For 50 years, we and the British before us have assumed the same 

neocolonial posture vis-a-vis Iraq as we do with Saudi Arabia and its surrounding 

sheikdoms and Iran. The Gulf War, fought to save U.S. corporate interests in Kuwait 

and Saudi Arabia, was only the latest example of this heavy-handed policy. Think 

Halliburton and Vice President Dick Cheney.

<p>The strategy is pretty much the same as that drawn up by the Romans: Find and 

support local strongmen who can deliver the goods to the imperial capital, come 

hell or high water. How they treat their own people is not our business; we have 

never cared about democracy in the Mideast unless one of its dictators happened 

to fail to toe our line.

<p>That is why our CIA facilitated the rise to power of Iraq's Baath party and 

ultimately the succession of Saddam Hussein as its current leader. The first Bush 

administration supported Hussein, providing him with the means to wage chemical 

and biological war, up to the day he invaded Kuwait, another of our client states. 

After his defeat, we became totally disinterested in the freedom of the people 

of the countries we had rescued. So much so, in fact, that Saudi Arabia was allowed 

to thrive as the world capital of religious hatred and the major sponsor of terrorists, 

producing Osama bin Laden and 15 of the 19 hijackers who gave us the Sept. 11 

tragedy.

<p>The same contempt for democracy has marked our policy toward Iran, that other 

member of the "axis of evil" we helped create. When Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh 

moved to eliminate foreign control over Iran's oil, the CIA and its British counterpart 

overthrew him in 1953. Despite our babbling about democracy, we had no compunction 

about replacing the elected Mossadegh with a guy who claimed the hereditary right 

to the throne as shah of all shahs.

<p>When the shah dared to act in the interest of his people--and his own bank 

account--by bolstering the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in the 

push for higher oil prices, we came to regard him, too, as expendable.

<p>Even our support of Israel had less to do with the struggle of a brave people 

for a deserved homeland and more with the usefulness of that country as an agent 

of our Mideast ambitions and a reliable ally in offsetting expanding Soviet influence 

in the region.

<p>With the end of the Cold War, we were at a loss for a noble rationale to justify 

our heavy Mideast presence, which has been enormously profitable to some American 

corporations and industries that are well represented in this administration. 

Support democracy? We do subsidize Israel, the region's only functioning democracy, 

but our motives look less than pure when we fawn over cooperative dictatorships 

such as the regime in the United Arab Emirates, which forked over $6.4 billion 

to Lockheed Martin for fighter jets and gives us access to its oil.

<p>Having just fought to free themselves from one of history's great empires, 

this nation's founding founders fiercely and repeatedly warned of the risks of 

imperial ambitions. Because of this, most Americans, whether liberal or conservative, 

grasp the fundamental truth that foreign entanglements destabilize, backfire and 

cost too much in lives and dollars. 

<p>Instead of exploiting our natural patriotism to fight a nonsensical war, our 

government should forgo the temptations of empire.
