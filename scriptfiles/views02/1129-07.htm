<p>Soaring after the Nov. 5 midterm elections, President Bush and the GOP Congress 

are planning their social policy. It’s another wolf in sheep’s clothing. I mean 

a policy that includes the administration of social spending by ‘faith-based’ 

groups, as reported in the Nov. 27 Washington Post. 

<p>Trying to sound like they live on Main Street, these Republicans claim that 

government social spending is flawed. By trying to help to people falling on hard 

times, government harms them. Churches can do a better job for families, according 

to Senate Majority Leader-elect Trent Lott (R-Miss.) He claimed in the Washington 

Post article that people living between the east and west coasts would support 

this ‘faith-based’ change in social policy. 

<p>"The only places where these ideas are considered bad are on the two coasts," 

Lott noted. "Where the meat is in the sandwich, the rest of America, these are 

pretty mainstream ideas." Jobless workers whose unemployment payments are slated 

to expire soon might disagree. Their fate is one of dire necessity. They are the 

people who must choose between food and rent. They don’t see doctors because their 

health insurance coverage has elapsed. By contrast, Lott lives well in his capacity 

as a leading member of Congress. Case in point is his taxpayer-funded health care 

for life. 

<p>To be sure, fake populism isn’t merely a GOP thing. Far from it. Recall that 

many Democrats with honorable exceptions such as the late Sen. Paul Wellstone 

(D-Minn.) have supported the shrinking of government spending for people in need, 

claiming that this policy was a public service to boost personal responsibility. 

Welfare reform was packaged as a benefit to people whose individual initiative 

had been weakened by government help that also hurt society. Across the Atlantic, 

former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher had said "there is no such thing 

as society. There are individual men and women, and there are families." U.S. 

politicians still ape her view in their policies. 

<p>Now it’s true that Democrats and the GOP use different rhetoric. They may disagree 

on the pace of eliminating the welfare state for people. However, their aim has 

been the same basic policy of driving down the living and working conditions of 

the U.S. public. Author Michael Parenti has termed this the "thirdworldization" 

of the nation. A walk down any downtown street across the country speaks volumes 

about this process, clear for those who choose to see it. 

<p>It was Democratic President Clinton who led the charge to end welfare (not 

poverty). He was the point man on the elimination of federally guaranteed cash 

payments to the poorest members of U.S. society. This policy knocked down a key 

peg of the welfare state for people established during the Great Depression. Surely 

many big campaign contributors cheered Clinton’s victory over the politically 

powerless. Why? The unctuous former president’s triumph forced more low-wage workers 

into the job market. This move to help business profitability required employees’ 

willingness to accept smaller (if any) salary increases from their employers. 

A more recent reduction of government spending with similar effects for people 

in the job market saw Congress, with President Bush giving it a wink and a nod, 

refusing to extend jobless payments to workers out of a job. Some 2.1 million 

jobless workers could lack federal or state benefits at the end of March 2003, 

according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. How will church groups 

deal with the sheer numbers of people living without regular paychecks and jobless 

payments? 

<p>A GOP policy of religious groups administering social spending brings up several 

more questions. One, where is the evidence that such groups can do a better job 

than the government? Two, are church administrators more (or less) accountable 

than government officials? Three, will the Bush administration’s penchant for 

secrecy extend to this new ‘faith-based’ policy of social spending? 

<p>Overall, the GOP’s strategy is to distract those being economically attacked 

from their attackers. Thus the GOP praises (some) religion and chides (some) government. 

Democrats are less strident rhetorically. But the Democratic Party is offering 

virtually similar economic policies to those of the GOP concerning an improvement 

in the lives of ordinary people as the economy sputters. On that note, the fiscal 

crises of local and state governments are coming fast and furious. How will ‘faith-based’ 

groups cope with an untold number of human beings in need when the spending of 

state and local governments runs dry? 

<p>Consider what looms large for many in California. There, Democratic Governor 

Gray Davis in early Dec. will announce possible budget cuts that could put an 

unclear number of public employees out of a job, close schools and increase school 

class sizes. The state has a deficit of $21 billion from the dot-com meltdown 

that began in March 2000, and the national recession that officially emerged a 

year later. The fiscal bottom line? California needs a bailout from the federal 

government. Yet Uncle Sam’s past actions don’t bode well for the future. The GOP’s 

support of ‘faith-based’ government programs for people evades this political 

reality. 

<p>"In July, the United States Senate overwhelmingly approved a proposal to provide 

fiscal relief to states through a temporary increase in federal grants for Medicaid 

and social services, but it never became law," reported the Nov. 26 New York Times. 

"The Bush administration and Senator Don Nickles, the Oklahoma Republican in line 

to become chairman of the Budget Committee in the new Congress, opposed the increase." 

<p>Meanwhile, don’t expect a ‘faith-based’ administration of war spending from 

the GOP. War spending makes corporate America rich and increases the political 

power of the GOP and its Democratic "opponents." That kind of welfare is fine 

with them. And the U.S. working class, the people who Sen. Lott claims to represent? 

This group of increasingly disenfranchised folks pay for war spending while becoming 

less economically secure. Yet the GOP rejects government responsibility for people 

suffering the effects of the market economy. Presumably, government anti-poverty 

programs are to blame for the rising number of poor people. 

<p>In the U.S. now, the GOP’s attack (with Democratic assent) on the welfare state 

for the people is a leading feature of the class struggle. One side is winning. 

The other side is losing. But don’t take it on faith that this current phase of 

the conflict is cast in stone. 

<p>Take the Kensington Welfare Rights Union. It has launched a national campaign 

to detail poverty levels by calling for popular resistance based on the view that 

joblessness and homelessness as violations of human rights. By contrast, the GOP 

majority in the 108th Congress would like the U.S. population to reject such a 

vision of a better world and replace it with faith in market economy rules. Don’t. </i>
