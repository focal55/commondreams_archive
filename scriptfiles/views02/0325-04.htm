Singer Michelle Shocked strapped on her guitar and took the stage 

for the performance that would finish the first stop on the 

<a href="http://www.rollingthundertour.org" target="_new">Rolling Thunder Down-Home Democracy Tour</a>. Looking out at the faces 

of several thousand cheering Texans, the woman who has penned hits 

such as "Anchorage" broke into a huge grin and told the crowd,  

"We just didn't know what we were going to find when we showed up 

this morning. We didn't know if you all were going to show up. But 

I think it's been an unqualified success."

<p>

Shocked got no argument from the crowd, or from organizers of what 

may well be the most unlikely scheme to stir the nation's populist 

sentiment since someone suggested pulling together a protest 

outside the World Trade Organization summit in Seattle.

</p>

<p>

Texas populist Jim Hightower's plan to "put the party back into 

politics" with a rollicking national tour of speechifying, 

entertaining, organizing and coalition-building along the lines of 

the 19th-century Chautauqua gatherings had always been greeted 

with a measure of skepticism. Hightower's friends and allies 

mumbled that the Lollapalooza of the Left idea might be a hair too 

ambitious. Would it really be possible, at a time when 

conservative President George W. Bush is supposed to be enjoying 

80 percent approval ratings, to pack a fairgrounds east of Austin 

for a day of Bush-bashing, corporation-crunching, plutocrat-poking 

politics with a punch? Hightower admitted that he worried about 

whether he would prove right one of the best lines of Oklahoma 

populist Fred Harris: "You can't have a mass movement without the 

masses."

</p>

<p>

But the organizers needed have worried. The masses were ready for 

this movement.

</p>

<p>

"This is just what a lot of us have been waiting for -- the call 

to action," said Cate Read, an airline industry analyst who 

watched from her Houston office as employees from the nearby Enron 

building carried their belongings out of the collapsed 

corporation's headquarters. "People are ready to start making some 

noise about what's been going on in this country. The media makes 

it sound like everyone's for everything George W. Bush does and 

that is just not the case -- not even in Texas."

</p>

<p>

By the time filmmaker and author Michael Moore arrived at mid-day, 

to the foot-stomping, fist-pumping and cheers of close to 7,000 

rebels against the consensus, this corner of Texas was definitely 

not Bush country.

</p>

<p>

"Where are we? In a barn?" Moore yelled over the roar of the crowd 

that had packed into what was, indeed, the Travis County 

Exposition Center's horse and hog showbarn. Clearly delighted, the 

most populist of popular entertainers let rip with an assault on 

the suggestion that dissent is no longer appropriate in 

post-September 11 America.

</p>

<p>

"Let me tell you something about the (president's) 80 percent 

approval rating..." bellowed the author of the nation's No. 1 

best-seller, "Stupid White Men." "It's bullshit" came the yell 

from a fellow in a cowboy hat. "That's right," responded Moore, 

"it's bullshit."

</p>

<p>

Echoing the slogan emblazoned on stickers many at the event wore, 

Moore declared, "We are the majority in this country." For the 

last six months, he argued, we've been told 'watch what you say,' 

'don't dissent,' 'don't question the leader.' Let me tell you 

something: There is nothing more American than asking these 

questions."

</p>

<p>

If there was a theme for the day, it may well have been that 

dissent is back in fashion. Hip-hop, Tejano, rhythm & blues and 

folk performers including MC Overlord, Ruben Ramos, Marcia Ball 

and Shocked flavored their shows with rebel yells, performance 

artists played the Enron scandal for laughs, game booths allowed 

kids to toss a ball and knock down a nuclear missile. Workshops 

took on everything from radioactive waste to

</p>

<p>

genetically-modified food, from militarism to racial profiling, 

from corporate excess to the   "selected-not-elected" presidency 

of a former Austin resident named Bush. Columnist Molly Ivins got 

people all worked up. 

</p>

<p>

Everyone got into the act, even Doris "Granny D" Haddock, who 

walked across the country at age 90 to raise the issue of campaign 

finance reform and who, at 92, is madder than ever about 

special-interest influence on government. "I have 16 

great-grandchildren," she said, to chants of "Go Granny D." "I 

want them brought up in a democracy, not a fascist state -- which 

this country is fast becoming."

</p>

<p>

Between Granny D and Marcia Ball's rhythm and blues show, US Rep. 

Jesse Jackson Jr., D-Ill, delivered the day's most passionate 

address. "We come to this Chautauqua because Dr. King was right: 

America has issued a promisory note and it has come back marked 

insufficient funds," boomed Jackson, recalling the sudden shift in 

attitudes about federal spending last fall. "On September 10, we 

were told there was not enough money for Social Security. But on 

September 12 or thereabouts, there was $40 billion to find

a cave man in Afghanistan -- and we haven't found him yet."

</p>

<p>

To rising applause from an audience that stayed into the 

fast-cooling Texas night to hear him, Jackson recounted the $95 

billion in new military and corporate-welfare spending that has 

been authorized since the September 11 attacks.

</p>

<p>

"We come to this Chautuaqua because 53 million children trapped in 

separate and not equal schools, and 45 million Americans without 

health insurance, deserve the same (level of) national response 

that bin Laden got," boomed Jackson, as he called for a 

restructuring of national priorities that recognizes a need not 

just for security against attack from abroad but also for security 

from hunger, illness and neglect at home.

</p>

<p>

"My friends, I don't know how to make the Democratic party better 

and I don't know how to make the Republican party better," Jackson 

concluded, as tour organizers were already preparing for 

Chautauqua events in Atlanta, Chicago, Pittsburgh and other 

cities. "So let us move forward from this Chautauqua not to make 

the parties better but to make the union better and more perfect 

for all."</p>
