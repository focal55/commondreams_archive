<p>WASHINGTON — It's an inspired choice. Bold, counterintuitive, edgy, outside 

the box.</p>

<P> Who better to investigate an unwarranted attack on America than the man who 

used to instigate America's unwarranted attacks?</p>

<P> Who better to ferret out government duplicity and manipulation than the man 

who engineered secret wars, secret bombings, secret wiretaps and secret coups, 

and still ended up as a Pillar of the Establishment and Nobel Peace Prize winner?</p>

<P> It was Dick Cheney's brainstorm, naturally. Only someone as pathologically 

opaque as the vice president could appreciate the sublime translucency of Henry 

Kissinger. And only someone intent on recreating the glory days of the Ford and 

Nixon White Houses could have hungered to add the 79-year-old Dr. Strange—— I 

mean, Dr. Kissinger to the Bush team.</p>

<P> There will be naysayers who quibble that the president's choice to lead the 

9/11 commission is not so much a realist as an opportunist, not so much Metternich 

as Machiavelli. </p>

<P> They will look askance at Mr. Kissinger's résumé: keeping the Vietnam War 

going for years after he realized it might be unwinnable; encouraging the illegal 

bombing of Cambodia; backing Chile's murderous Pinochet; playing Iago to President 

Richard Nixon, telling him he'd be "a weakling" if he did not prosecute newspapers 

running the Pentagon Papers; wiretapping journalists and his own colleagues to 

track down leaks on the Cambodia bombing.</p>

<P> If you look for the words "Kissinger" and "secret" in the same sentence in 

Nexis, the search cannot be completed; there are too many results. When he was 

dating Jill St. John and Liv Ullmann and preaching that power is an aphrodisiac, 

he even coyly called himself "a secret swinger."</p>

<P> In Walter Isaacson's biography, "Kissinger," the same words cascade: "deceitful," 

"disingenuous," "paranoid," "insecure," "temper tantrum," "flatterer," "two-faced" 

and "secretive." The über-diplomat has even been criticized for dissembling in 

his own memoirs. But secretiveness is not a disqualification for jobs in this 

White House. Quite the contrary: only the clandestine and the conspiratorial need 

apply.</p>

<P> Mr. Bush, after all, worked very hard to suppress any investigation of 9/11. 

He had to cave to the victims' families, who were hellbent to hear what the president 

learned in his August 2001 briefing about Al Qaeda plans, and what wires were 

crossed at the C.I.A., F.B.I. and I.N.S.</p>

<P> Now Mr. Bush can let the commission proceed, secure in the knowledge that 

Mr. Kissinger has never shed light on a single dark corner, or failed to flatter 

a boss, in his entire celebrated career. (He was one of Mr. Bush's patient tutors 

in foreign policy during the campaign.)</p>

<P> If you want to get to the bottom of something, you don't appoint Henry Kissinger. 

If you want to keep others from getting to the bottom of something, you appoint 

Henry Kissinger.</p>

<P> Mr. Bush learned about the diplomat's black belt in the black arts long ago, 

when he made a patsy of Bush père. As the ambassador to the U.N. in 1971, Bush 

41 was accused of aggressively making the case for Taiwan and against Beijing, 

even as Mr. Kissinger, the national security adviser, was secretly traveling to 

Beijing and undercutting Taiwan.</p>

<P> Afterward, Mr. Kissinger told George H. W. Bush he was "disappointed" that 

Beijing had gotten Taiwan's seat in the U.N. "Given the fact that we were saying 

one thing in New York and doing another in Washington," Mr. Bush drily observed, 

"that outcome was inevitable."</p>

<P> Fortunately, Bush Jr. was not held back by the revulsion that many in his 

generation have for Mr. Kissinger's power-drunk promotion of bloody American adventures 

abroad. As the former fraternity president told GQ magazine, he stayed a retro 

50's guy through the roiling 60's: "I don't remember any kind of heaviness ruining 

my time at Yale." </p>

<P> Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney are in tune with Mr. Kissinger's principles: that 

the greatest enemy of U.S. policy is the U.S. media, that American diplomacy may 

be happily indifferent to American public opinion, that the great unwashed masses 

of our democracy are just a big old drag on the elites who know what's best, and 

that corporate pals are a help, not a hindrance, in government work.</p>

<P> For this administration, outside the box is inside the box.  </p>
