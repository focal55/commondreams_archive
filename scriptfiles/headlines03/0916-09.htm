<p>UNITED NATIONS - Despite a U.S. veto threat, the  Security Council was poised to vote Tuesday on a resolution put  forward by Arab nations demanding that Israel not harm or  deport Palestinian President Yasser Arafat.

  </table></font>The resolution drafted by Palestinian U.N. envoy Nasser  al-Kidwa "demands that Israel, the occupying power, desist from  any act of deportation and to cease any threat to the safety of  the elected president of the Palestinian Authority."<P>
Washington, Israel's closest ally, is "not prepared to  support the resolution in its present form" because it does not  explicitly condemn terrorism by Palestinian militant groups and  is "very lopsided" against Israel," said U.S. Ambassador John  Negroponte.<P>
There was "a perfectly good peace plan already on the  table" and senior officials of the United States, Russia, the  European Union and the United Nations would meet later this  month in New York to explore next steps on the Middle East,  Negroponte told reporters.<P>
But in Paris Tuesday, France, which also has veto power on  the Security Council and opposed the U.S. invasion of Iraq,  signaled it would support the resolution on Arafat.<P>
French Foreign Minister spokesman Herve Ladsous said. "The  draft resolution does not pose a problem for us. It suits us."<P>
The council decided late Monday to schedule a vote on the  resolution at the request of Syria, which was acting on behalf  of Arab and nonaligned nations. The vote was expected in  midafternoon, diplomats said.<P>
The vote was set after nearly eight hours of harsh debate  in the 15-nation Security Council, in which more than 40  governments condemned a decision by Israel's security cabinet  to get rid of Arafat through unspecified means.<P>
LAST-MINUTE REVISIONS<P>
Syria unveiled last-minute changes in the draft text late  Monday in an attempt to broaden support.<P>
It added, for example, a phrase expressing "grave concern"  at the recent surge in violence, that attacks on both sides had  "caused enormous suffering and many innocent victims."<P>
But diplomats said the changes were unlikely to head off a  U.S. veto. While more amendments were always possible, Arab  envoys said they did not intend to compromise further.<P>
Speaking at the start of the nearly eight-hour council  debate, Terje Roed-Larsen, the U.N. special coordinator for the  Middle East peace process, questioned the Israeli decision in  principle to "remove" Arafat, whom he called the legitimate  leader of the Palestinians.<P>
Arafat's forceful removal could be dangerous as well as  counter-productive to peace efforts, he warned.<P>
But Israeli Ambassador Dan Gillerman dismissed Arafat as a  liar and a "professional terrorist" and predicted his removal  would swiftly lead to an end to the conflict.<P>
Arafat "is at the helm of those who have been supporting  mega-terror attacks in the style of the bombing of the twin  towers, to bring the region to the brink of catastrophe,"  Gillerman said, prompting Palestinian envoy al-Kidwa to walk  out of the chamber.<P>
