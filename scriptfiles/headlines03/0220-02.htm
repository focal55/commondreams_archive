<p> CANBERRA  - A short war with Iraq could cost the  world one percent of its economic output over the next few  years and more than $1 trillion by 2010, Australian researchers  said in a report Thursday.<p>

		A long war could more than triple the costs, they said.<p>

		The compounding effects of rising oil prices, extra budget  spending and economic uncertainty could cut $173 billion from  the world economy in 2003 alone, said the researchers, Reserve  Bank of Australia board member Warwick McKibbin and Center for  International Economics executive director Andrew Stoeckel.<p>

		Basing their projections on two scenarios -- a short war  with a year or two of rebuilding or a long war lasting five  years with five years of rebuilding -- the researchers said  conflict would sideswipe private investment and probably push  equity prices even lower.<p>

		"The conclusion is that even a short war will have a  significant and noticeable impact on the world economy, but on  current projections of world growth would not lead to  recession," they said.<p>

		"Even a short war could cost the world one percent of GDP  per year over the next few years."<p>

		While the United States was expected to bear the brunt of  the war costs, Britain, Australia and several European  countries would have to boost budget spending and Japan would  probably be a large contributor to the rebuilding phase, the  report said.<p>

		"Iraq and some other Middle Eastern countries are assumed  to spend considerably on defense, represented by an increase in  defense spending by OPEC," it added.<p>

		Oil prices were projected to initially rise 90 percent  above a baseline of $25 per barrel. Under a short-war scenario,  the price spike would quickly dissipate and the world oil price  would fall below $25 after the war was over, the report said.<p>

		It warned that the investors' uncertainty would compound  the rise in oil prices, even in a short-war case.
<p> "Altogether, there could be a drop of investment in the United States of over 
eight percent below baseline in 2003 and 2004. The fall is less for Japan and 
Europe, given the assumptions for their contribution to a war and rebuilding."
