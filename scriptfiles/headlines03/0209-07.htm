<p>Russia has said it will support a Franco-German plan aimed at averting war with Iraq.

<p>

The plan reportedly calls for the tripling of UN weapons inspectors in Iraq, banning Iraqi flights anywhere over the country and deploying UN peacekeepers.

<p>&quot;<i>I have no doubt that Russia will adhere to it</i>&quot;

<br><b>

Sergei Ivanov, Russian Defence Minister

</b>

<p>German Defence Minister Peter Struck said the proposal would be presented to the United Nations Security Council on Friday - the same day the chief UN weapons inspectors present their second critical report on Iraqi co-operation.

<p>

The plan seems certain to deepen a growing rift between the United States and European countries over how to ensure Iraq disarms.

<p>



Russia and France both possess the power to veto a new resolution, reportedly being drafted by the UK, which would clear the way for military action against Iraq.

<p>

<b>Russian backing</b>

<p>

Mr Struck said German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder would discuss the plan with the visiting Russian President, Vladimir Putin, in Berlin on Sunday.

<p>

He said Germany "could well take part" in a UN peacekeeping force in Iraq reportedly envisaged by the plan.

<p>

The defence minister said he hoped the plan would be "taken up positively" by the Security Council next Friday.

<p>

Russia's Defence Minister, Sergei Ivanov, said on Sunday that if the plan was presented to the UN, "I have no doubt that Russia will adhere to it."

<p>

Belgium also said it was favourable to 

the Franco-German plan, according to the French news agency AFP.



<p>

The BBC's Ray Furlong, who is in Berlin, says Vladimir Putin is keen to avoid a war, but at the same time wants to avoid the kind of damaging rows that Germany has had with the United States over Iraq.

<p>

The Franco-German plan might fit the bill, he says.

<p>

<b>US anger</b>

<p>

News of the initiative has been greeted with anger by American officials, who said Washington had not been consulted.

<p>



America has repeatedly indicated it is prepared to lead the way in disarming Iraq by force if the United Nations baulks at sanctioning military action.

<p>

Differences over how to deal with Iraq have soured relations between Germany and France and the US, which insists diplomatic attempts to disarm Iraq have failed.

<p>

US Secretary of State Colin Powell reacted to news of the Franco-German plan by saying that sending more inspectors to Iraq would be a "diversion", not a solution.<p>



On Saturday, US Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld warned that if the international community showed a lack of resolve, "there is no chance [Iraqi President] Saddam Hussein will disarm voluntarily or flee - and thus little chance of a peaceful outcome".

<p>

But German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer told Mr Rumsfeld: "I can't go to the public and say 'let's go to war because there are reasons'. I don't believe in them."

<p>

<B>New voice</B>

<p>

The Munich meeting also heard from Iran's deputy minister for international and legal affairs, Gholamali Koshroo - the first time Tehran has been represented at the gathering. 

<P>

Mr Koshroo urged Iraq to disarm, but stressed his country's opposition to a war. 

<p>

He also emphasised the need to deal with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  

<P>

BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Marcus, who is in Munich, says the speech - delivered in English - was measured and moderate in tone, ending with a call for the Muslim world and the West to develop a broader view of each other.</p>
