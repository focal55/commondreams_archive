</table></font>More than 100 members of the new U.S.-backed force protested in the town about 30 miles west of Baghdad after their police station and a municipality building came under attack overnight by guerrillas firing rocket-propelled grenades.

<p>There were no reported casualties.

<p>"We have the ability to protect these sites," said Riyadh Abdel-Latif, the town's police chief. "The presence of Americans endangers us. We asked the Americans more than a month and a half ago to leave Falluja."

<p>The protesters handed a petition to the mayor and U.S. commander in the town, saying they would resign in 48 hours if American troops did not leave.

<p>Falluja is a hotbed of anti-American sentiment. U.S. officials say they are facing organized resistance from mixed groups of Islamic militants, Saddam Hussein loyalists, armed gangs and Iraqis seeking revenge for the deaths of relatives.

<p>U.S. troops shot dead 15 protesters during demonstrations in the town three weeks after U.S. and British troops ousted Saddam on April 9.

<p>Frustration also grew with the U.S. failure to restore basic services including water and electricity.

<p>In an attempt to restore order since then, the United States has revived new police forces, many of whom served under the former regime and are regarded with suspicion.

<p>U.S.-backed Iraqi police have been targeted for cooperating with the occupation forces. The biggest attack was last week, when a remote-controlled blast killed seven Iraqi police recruits in Ramadi, 60 miles west of Baghdad.

<p>On July 1, American troops came under grenade attack in Falluja after an explosion at a mosque killed nine people.

<p>Residents blamed a coalition air strike for the blast. Iraqi police in Falluja and the U.S. military in a joint investigation said the explosion occurred during a bomb-making class, but a U.S. official later said he could not confirm it.
