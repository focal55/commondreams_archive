</table></font>Many Iraqis welcomed the overthrow of president Saddam  Hussein by the U.S.-led forces, but nearly eight weeks later,  protests against the foreign military presence are growing and  many say they want to run their country.<p></p> &quot;We advise you to leave our country or you will make enemies  out of us,&quot; said Shi'ite cleric Muaaed al-Khazraji in a speech  through a loudhailer. &quot;Please go home and we will be very  grateful because you got rid of Saddam.&quot;<p></p> The protesters marched from a large mosque to the  headquarters of the U.S-led administration chanting: &quot;Down, down  America! Down, down Saddam! Yes, yes for an Islamic state.&quot;<p></p> Some threatened to chop off the hands of any soldier who  tried to search an Iraqi woman. Security searches are common at  checkpoints in the city.<p></p> &quot;It is unacceptable in Islam that a man searches the body of  a woman. The American troops are doing that to our women,&quot;  cleric Ali Baghdadi said.<p></p> The crowd carried banners and one read in English: &quot;Saddam  and America are two faces of the same coin.&quot;<p></p> &quot;We call for setting up an Iraqi national government  immediately,&quot; said Sttar Nsyyaif, 33.<p></p> On Monday, Iraq's tribal leaders also told the Americans  they could face war if they did not leave soon and thousands of  sacked Iraqi soldiers had swarmed angrily around the U.S.  headquarters in Baghdad.<p></p> Tuesday's demonstrators, both Shi'ite and Sunni Muslims,  also protested about the detention of Jasim al-Saadi, a Shi'ite  cleric, who was arrested two days ago by U.S. troops and  released on Tuesday.<p></p> 
They also criticized U.S. moves to disarm Iraqis as part of  efforts to restore law and order after the war.
<p></p> &quot;We need these weapons to defend our country against the  Americans and any other occupier,&quot; Nsyyaif said.<p></p> Earlier, hundreds of sacked Iraqi civil servants protested  about losing their jobs after the U.S.-led civil demonstration  dissolved several former government offices.
