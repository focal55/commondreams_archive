<p>Two Britons being held by American forces in Guantanamo Bay are among the first six detainees likely to face trial before a US military tribunal, the Foreign Office said today.</p>
<p>It said Moazzam Begg, from Birmingham, and Feroz Abbasi, from Surrey, are among six prisoners designated by US authorities as the first who could face military trial.</p>

</table></font>US officials said all were suspected of being either members of the al&#150;Qa'ida terrorist network or otherwise involved in terrorism. The next step is for a chief prosecutor to draft charges against any or all of the suspects.</p>
<p>Officials at the US naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba have begun planning for construction of court facilities and an execution chamber, since the tribunals may consider imposing the death penalty.</p>
<p>Australian David Hicks is likely will be one of the six, the Australian government said today.</p>
<p>Federal Attorney General Daryl Williams said Hicks is among the six suspects eligible for trial by military tribunal.</p>
<p>Hicks, a Muslim who fought with the Kosovo Liberation Army, called his parents 17 days after the 11 September attacks to say he was with the Taliban. He also allegedly threatened to kill an American upon his arrival at Guantanamo, US officials said.</p>
<p>Some of the six may have attended terrorist training camps and some were involved in raising money and recruiting for terrorist groups, the officials said. Under an order signed by President George Bush creating the military tribunals, only people who are not US citizens may be subject to such trials.</p>
<p>Unlike traditional criminal trials, the proceedings of military tribunals can be kept much more secret. The United States has not convened such a tribunal since World War II.</p>
<p>Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz will make a separate decision on whether the suspects will actually face trials by what the Pentagon calls military commissions.</p>
<p>Although Pentagon officials would not say where the suspects are imprisoned or where their tribunals might be held, legal experts said the trials likely would be at Guantanamo, where almost 700 Taliban and al&#150;Qa'ida suspects are being held.</p>
<p>The Pentagon officials also raised the possibility that the military might continue to hold the suspects even if they are acquitted by a tribunal. The prisoners' status as "unlawful combatants" in the war against terrorism is separate from their guilt or innocence on charges brought before a tribunal, a military official involved in the tribunal process said.</p>
<p>Initial criticism of the administration's intent to use such trials was later tempered &#150; but only somewhat &#150; when the detailed rules governing them were released. Under those rules, defendants have many traditional legal rights, though they still do not have full constitutional protection, and the standards of evidence are looser.</p>
<p>While the six are the first to be declared subject to trial by tribunal, President Bush may designate more suspects for possible military trials. Terrorist suspect Zacarias Moussaoui is among those considered to be a prospect for such a trial.</p>
<p>A US District Court judge in Alexandria, Virginia, has ruled that, as part of his criminal trial in federal court, Moussaoui could question Ramzi Binalshibh, a suspected organizer of the 11 September attacks. Arguing that questioning could harm national security, the government is appealing that ruling. But if it loses, it could decide to move Moussaoui's case from civilian court to a military tribunal.</p>
<p>Binalshibh is another captive who has been mentioned as a possible candidate for a military tribunal.</p>
<p>Any tribunal cases would be decided by a panel of three to seven military officers who would act as both judge and jury. Convictions could be handed down by a two&#150;thirds vote; a decision to sentence a defendant to death would have to be unanimous.</p>
<p>All defendants would be given military Defense lawyers who would be able to attend any closed hearings discussing classified information. The defendants and their private, civilian lawyers could be excluded from secret hearings.</p>
