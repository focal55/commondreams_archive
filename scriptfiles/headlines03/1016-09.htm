<p>WASHINGTON  - At least 13 U.S. troops have  committed suicide in Iraq, representing more than 10 percent of  American noncombat deaths there, and the Army dispatched a  suicide-prevention expert to assess the problem, officials said  on Thursday.<P>
At least 11 U.S. Army soldiers have committed suicide  during Iraq operations, most with self-inflicted gunshot  wounds, and two Marines have committed suicide using firearms,  officials said.<P>

</table>One official said "a few more" Army deaths were being  investigated as possible suicides, and the Navy said the death  of one service member was under investigation. The Air Force  said it had no such cases.<P>
Army officials have expressed concern about the suicides,  many of which occurred after President Bush declared major  combat operations over in Iraq on May 1.<P>
A 12-person Mental Health Advisory Team dispatched by the  Army recently left Iraq after studying a wide range of mental  health concerns, including suicide, among U.S. troops facing  combat stress and longer-than-expected deployments.<P>
The 130,000 U.S. troops in Iraq are facing yearlong stints  amid daily guerrilla-style attacks.<P>
Lt. Col. Jerry Swanner, the Army's suicide-prevention  program manager at the Pentagon, was a member of the team, said  Martha Rudd, an Army spokeswoman.<P>
"Of course we're concerned," Rudd said. "Even one suicide  is alarming and upsetting."<P>
The suicide deaths are included among the 120 U.S. troops  who have died in "non-hostile" circumstances in Iraq in the  past seven months, mostly vehicle and other types of accidents.  Another 212 U.S. troops have died from enemy fire, according to  the Pentagon.<P>
"When war is actually going on, behavioral experts say the  soldiers aren't as likely to commit suicide during that period.  While they're fighting, they're not thinking about their  problems. But once open hostilities cease and the peacekeeping  part begins, for some soldiers that can be very rewarding work  but for some (others) it can be very stressful," Rudd said.<P>
She also noted that troops in Iraq have guns readily  available, enabling them to act on what otherwise might have  been a fleeting suicidal impulse.<P>
The team sent to Iraq included psychiatrists,  psychologists, social workers and experts in combat stress,  said Lyn Kukral, a spokeswoman for the Office of the Army  Surgeon General and the Army Medical Command.<P>
The team was expected to complete a report on its findings  and make recommendations in two to three weeks, officials said.<P>
"Suicide is just one aspect of many behavioral health and  individual readiness issues that the team is assessing. The  team is interested in identifying particular deployment  stressors and their impact on the deployed soldiers. The team  is also concerned with reviewing the effectiveness of current  combat-stress control doctrine," Kukral said in a statement.<P>
Kukral said 478 soldiers had been evacuated from Iraq for  mental health reasons as of Sept. 25.<P>
The Army and Navy annually average about 11 suicides per  100,000 personnel, the Air Force about 9.5 per 100,000 and the  Marines about 12.6 per 100,000.<P>
Referring to the Army rate, Rudd said, "I don't think the  suicides we've had in Iraq are going to seriously skew the  numbers."
