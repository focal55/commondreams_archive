<p>THE light was a strange yellowy gray and the wind was coming up, the 

beginnings of a sandstorm. The silence felt almost eerie after a night 

of shooting so intense it hurt the eardrums and shattered the nerves. My

footsteps felt heavy on the hot, dusty asphalt as I walked slowly towards the bridge at Nasiriya. A horrific scene lay ahead.

<p>Some 15 vehicles, including a minivan and a couple of trucks, blocked 

the road. They were riddled with bullet holes. Some had caught fire and 

turned into piles of black twisted metal. Others were still burning.

<p>Amid the wreckage I counted 12 dead civilians, lying in the road or in 

nearby ditches. All had been trying to leave this southern town 

overnight, probably for fear of being killed by US helicopter attacks 

and heavy artillery.

<p>Their mistake had been to flee over a bridge that is crucial to the 

coalition's supply lines and to run into a group of shell-shocked young 

American marines with orders to shoot anything that moved.

<p>One man's body was still in flames. It gave out a hissing sound. Tucked 

away in his breast pocket, thick wads of banknotes were turning to 

ashes. His savings, perhaps.



<p>Down the road, a little girl, no older than five and dressed in a pretty

orange and gold dress, lay dead in a ditch next to the body of a man who

may have been her father. Half his head was missing.



<p>Nearby, in a battered old Volga, peppered with ammunition holes, an 

Iraqi woman - perhaps the girl's mother - was dead, slumped in the back 

seat. A US Abrams tank nicknamed Ghetto Fabulous drove past the bodies.



<p>This was not the only family who had taken what they thought was a last 

chance for safety. A father, baby girl and boy lay in a shallow grave. 

On the bridge itself a dead Iraqi civilian lay next to the carcass of a 

donkey.



<p>As I walked away, Lieutenant Matt Martin, whose third child, Isabella, 

was born while he was on board ship en route to the Gulf, appeared 

beside me.



<p>"Did you see all that?" he asked, his eyes filled with tears. "Did you 

see that little baby girl? I carried her body and buried it as best I 

could but I had no time. It really gets to me to see children being 

killed like this, but we had no choice."



<p>Martin's distress was in contrast to the bitter satisfaction of some of 

his fellow marines as they surveyed the scene. "The Iraqis are sick 

people and we are the chemotherapy," said Corporal Ryan Dupre. "I am 

starting to hate this country. Wait till I get hold of a friggin' Iraqi. No, I won't get hold of one. I'll just kill him."



<p>Only a few days earlier these had still been the bright-eyed small-town 

boys with whom I crossed the border at the start of the operation. They 

had rolled towards Nasiriya, a strategic city beside the Euphrates, on a

mission to secure a safe supply route for troops on the way to Baghdad.



<p>They had expected a welcome, or at least a swift surrender. Instead they

had found themselves lured into a bloody battle, culminating in the 

worst coalition losses of the war - 16 dead, 12 wounded and two missing 

marines as well as five dead and 12 missing servicemen from an army 

convoy - and the humiliation of having prisoners paraded on Iraqi 

television.



<p>There are three key bridges at Nasiriya. The feat of Martin, Dupre and 

their fellow marines in securing them under heavy fire was compared by 

armchair strategists last week to the seizure of the Remagen bridge over

the Rhine, which significantly advanced victory over Germany in the second world war.



<p>But it was also the turning point when the jovial band of brothers from 

America lost all their assumptions about the war and became jittery 

aggressors who talked of wanting to "nuke" the place.



<p>None of this was foreseen at Camp Shoup, one of the marines' tent 

encampments in northern Kuwait, where officers from the 1st and 2nd 

battalions of Task Force Tarawa, the 7,000-strong US Marines brigade, 

spent long evenings poring over maps and satellite imagery before the 

invasion.



<p>The plan seemed straightforward. The marines would speed unhindered over

the 130 miles of desert up from the Kuwaiti border and approach Nasiriya

from the southeast to secure a bridge over the Euphrates. They would 

then drive north through the outskirts of Nasiriya to a second bridge, over the Inahr al-Furbati canal. Finally, they would turn west and secure the 

third bridge, also over the canal. The marines would not enter the city 

proper, let alone attempt to take it.



<p>The coalition could then start moving thousands of troops and logistical

support units up highway 7, leading to Baghdad, 225 miles to the north.



<p>There was only one concern: "ambush alley", the road connecting the 

first two bridges. But intelligence suggested there would be little or 

no fighting as this eastern side of the city was mostly "pro-American".



<p>I was with Alpha company. We reached the outskirts of Nasiriya at about 

breakfast time last Sunday. Some marines were disappointed to be 

carrying out a mission that seemed a sideshow to the main effort. But in

an ominous sign of things to come, our battalion stopped in its tracks, 

three miles outside the city.



<p>Bad news filtered back. Earlier that morning a US Army convoy had been 

greeted by a group of Iraqis dressed in civilian clothes, apparently 

wanting to surrender. When the American soldiers stopped, the Iraqis 

pulled out AK-47s and sprayed the US trucks with gunfire.



<p>Five wounded soldiers were rescued by our convoy, including one who had 

been shot four times. The attackers were believed to be members of the 

Fedayeen Saddam, a group of 15,000 fighters under the command of 

Saddam's psychopathic son Uday.



<p>Blown-up tires, a pool of blood, spent ammunition and shards of glass 

from the bulletridden windscreen marked the spot where the ambush had 

taken place. Swiftly, our AAVs (23-ton amphibious assault vehicles) took

up defensive positions. About 100 marines jumped out of their vehicles 

and took cover in ditches, pointing their sights at a mud-caked house. Was it harboring gunmen? Small groups of marines approached, 

cautiously, to search for the enemy. A dozen terrified civilians, mainly

women and children, emerged with their hands raised.



<p>"It's just a bunch of Hajis," said one gunner from his turret, using 

their nickname for Arabs. "Friggin' women and children, that's all."



<p>Cobras and Huey attack helicopters began firing missiles at targets on 

the edge of the city. Plumes of smoke rose as heavy artillery shook the 

ground under our feet.



<p>Heavy machinegun fire echoed across the huge rubbish dump that marks the

entrance to Nasiriya. Suddenly there was return fire from three large 

oil tanks at a refinery. The Cobras were called back, and within seconds

they roared above our heads, firing off missiles in clouds of purple tracer fire.



<p>There were several loud explosions. Flames burst high into the sky from 

one of the oil tanks. The marines believed that what opposition there 

was had now been crushed. "We are going in, we are going in," shouted 

one of the officers.



<p>More than 20 AAVs, several tanks and about 10 Hummers equipped with 

roof-mounted, anti-tank missile launchers prepared to move in. Crammed 

inside them were some 400 marines. Tension rose as they loaded their 

guns and stuck their heads over the side of the AAVs through the open roof, their M-16 pointed in all directions.



<p>As we set off towards the eastern city gate there was no sense of the 

mayhem awaiting us down the road. A few locals dressed in rags watched 

the awesome spectacle of America's war machine on the move. Nobody waved.



<p>Slowly we approached the first bridge. Fires were raging on either side 

of the road; Cobras had destroyed an Iraqi military truck and a T55 tank

positioned inside a dugout. Powerful explosions came from inside the 

bowels of the tank as its ammunition and heavy shells were set off by the fire. With each explosion a thick and perfect ring of black smoke ring 

puffed out of the turret.



<p>An Iraqi defense post lay abandoned. Cobras flew over an oasis of palm 

trees and deserted brick and mud-caked houses. We charged onto the 

bridge, and as we crossed the Euphrates, a large mural of Saddam came 

into view. Some marines reached for their disposable cameras.



<p>Suddenly, as we approached ambush alley on the far side of the bridge, 

the crackle of AK-47s broke out. Our AAVs began to zigzag to avoid being

hit by a rocket-propelled grenade (RPG).



<p>The road widened out to a square, with a mosque and the portrait of 

Saddam on the left-hand side. The vehicles wheeled round, took up a 

defensive position, back to back, and began taking fire.



<p>Pinned down, the marines fired back with 40mm automatic grenade 

launchers, a weapon so powerful it can go through thick brick walls and 

kill anyone within a 5-yard range of where the shell lands.



<p>I was in AAV number A304, affectionately nicknamed the Desert Caddy. It 

shook as Keith Bernize, the gunner, fired off round after deafening 

round at sandbag positions shielding suspected Fedayeen fighters. His 

steel ammunition box clanged with the sound of smoking empty shells and 

cartridges.



<p>Bernize, who always carries a scan picture of his unborn baby daughter 

with him, shot at the targets from behind a turret, peering through 

narrow slits of reinforced glass. He shouted at his men to feed him more

ammunition. Four marines, standing at the AAV's four corners, 

precariously perched on ammunition boxes, fired off their M-16s.



<p>Their faces covered in sweat, officers shouted commands into field 

radios, giving co-ordinates of enemy positions. Some 200 marines, fully 

exposed to enemy fire and slowed down by their heavy weapons, bulky 

ammunition packs and NBC suits, ran across the road, taking shelter 

behind a long brick wall and mounds of earth. A team of snipers 

appeared, yards from our vehicle.



<p>The exchange of fire was relentless. We were pinned down for more than 

three hours as Iraqis hiding inside houses and a hospital and behind 

street corners fired a barrage of ammunition.



<p>Despite the marines' overwhelming firepower, hitting the Iraqis was not 

easy. The gunmen were not wearing uniforms and had planned their ambush 

well - stockpiling weapons in dozens of houses, between which they moved

freely pretending to be civilians.



<p>"It's a bad situation," said First Sergeant James Thompson, who was 

running around with a 9mm pistol in his hand. "We don't know who is 

shooting at us. They are even using women as scouts. The women come out 

waving at us, or with their hands raised. We freeze, but the next minute

we can see how she is looking at our positions and giving them away to the fighters hiding behind a street corner. It's very difficult to 

distinguish between the fighters and civilians."



<p>Across the square, genuine civilians were running for their lives. Many,

including some children, were gunned down in the crossfire. In a surreal

scene, a father and mother stood out on a balcony with their children in

their arms to give them a better view of the battle raging below. A few 

minutes later several US mortar shells landed in front of their house. In all probability, the family is dead.



<p>The fighting intensified. An Iraqi fighter emerged from behind a wall of

sandbags 500 yards away from our vehicle. Several times he managed to 

fire off an RPG at our positions. Bernize and other gunners fired dozens

of rounds at his dugout, punching large holes into a house and lifting thick clouds of dust.



<p>Captain Mike Brooks, commander of Alpha company, pinned down in front of

the mosque, called in tank support. Armed with only a 9mm pistol, he 

jumped out of the back of his AAV with a young marine carrying a field 

radio on his back.



<p>Brooks, 34, from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, had been in command of 200 

men for just over a year. He joined the marines when he was 19 because 

he felt that he was wasting his life. He needed direction, was a bit of 

a rebel and was impressed by the sense of pride in the corps.



<p>He is a soft-spoken man, fair but very firm. Brave too: I watched him 

sprint in front of enemy positions to brief some of his junior officers 

behind a wall. Behind us, two 68-ton Abrams tanks rolled up, crushing 

the barrier separating the lanes on the highway.



<p>The earth shook violently as one tank, Desert Knight, stopped in front 

of our row of AAVS and fired several 120mm shells into buildings.



<p>A few hundred yards down ambush alley there was carnage. An AAV from 

Charlie company was racing back towards the bridge to evacuate some 

wounded marines when it was hit by two RPGs. The heavy vehicle shook but

withstood the explosions.



<p>Then the Iraqis fired again. This time the rocket plunged into the 

vehicle through the open rooftop. The explosion was deadly, made 10 

times more powerful by the ammunition stored in the back.



<p>The wreckage smoldered in the middle of the road. I jumped out from 

the rear hatch of our vehicle, briefly taking cover behind a wall. When 

I reached the stricken AAV, the scene was mayhem.



<p>The heavy, thick rear ramp had been blown open. There were pools of 

blood and bits of flesh everywhere. A severed leg, still wearing a 

desert boot, lay on what was left of the ramp among playing cards, a 

magazine, cans of Coke and a small bloodstained teddy bear.



<p>"They are f****** dead, they are dead. Oh my God. Get in there. Get in 

there now and pull them out," shouted a gunner in a state verging on 

hysterical.



<p>There was panic and confusion as a group of young marines, shouting and 

cursing orders at one another, pulled out a maimed body.



<p>Two men struggled to lift the body on a stretcher and into the back of a

Hummer, but it would not fit inside, so the stretcher remained almost 

upright, the dead man's leg, partly blown away, dangling in the air.



<p>"We shouldn't be here," said Lieutenant Campbell Kane, 25, who was born 

in Northern Ireland. "We can't hold this. They are trying to suck us 

into the city and we haven't got enough ass up here to sustain this. We 

need more tanks, more helicopters."



<p>Closer to the destroyed AAV, another young marine was transfixed with 

fear and kept repeating: "Oh my God, I can't believe this. Did you see 

his leg? It was blown off. It was blown off."



<p>Two CH-46 helicopters, nicknamed Frogs, landed a few hundred yards away 

in the middle of a firefight to take away the dead and wounded.



<p>If at first the marines felt constrained by orders to protect civilians,

by now the battle had become so intense that there was little time for 

niceties. Cobra helicopters were ordered to fire at a row of houses 

closest to our positions. There were massive explosions but the return 

fire barely died down.



<p>Behind us, as many as four AAVs that had driven down along the banks of 

the Euphrates were stuck in deep mud and coming under fire.



<p>About 1pm, after three hours of intense fighting, the order was given to

regroup and try to head out of the city in convoy. Several marines who 

had lost their vehicles piled into the back of ours.



<p>We raced along ambush alley at full speed, close to a line of houses. 

"My driver got hit," said one of the marines who joined us, his face and

uniform caked in mud. "I went to try to help him when he got hit by 

another RPG or a mortar. I don't even know how many friends I have lost.



<p>I don't care if they nuke that bloody city now. From one house they were

waving while shooting at us with AKs from the next. It was insane."



<p>There was relief when we finally crossed the second bridge to the 

northeast of the city in mid-afternoon. But there was more horror to 

come. Beside the smoldering wreckage of another AAV were the bodies of 

another four marines, laid out in the mud and covered with camouflage 

ponchos. There were body parts everywhere.



<p>One of the dead was Second Lieutenant Fred Pokorney, 31, a marine 

artillery officer from Washington state. He was a big guy, whose 

ill-fitting uniform was the butt of many jokes. It was supposed to have 

been a special day for Pokorney. After 13 years of service, he was to be

promoted to first lieutenant. The men of Charlie company had agreed they would all shake hands with him to celebrate as soon as they crossed the 

second bridge, their mission accomplished.



<p>It didn't happen. Pokorney made it over the second bridge and a few 

hundred yards down a highway through dusty flatlands before his vehicle 

was ambushed. Pokorney and his men had no chance. Fully loaded with 

ammunition, their truck exploded in the middle of the road, its remains 

burning for hours. Pokorney was hit in the chest by an RPG.



<p>Another man who died was Fitzgerald Jordan, a staff sergeant from Texas.



<p>I felt numb when I heard this. I had met Jordan 10 days before we moved 

into Nasiriya. He was a character, always chewing tobacco and coming up 

to pat you on the back. He got me to fetch newspapers for him from 

Kuwait City. Later, we shared a bumpy ride across the desert in the back

of a Humvee.



<p>A decorated Gulf war veteran, he used to complain about having to come 

back to Iraq. "We should have gone all the way to Baghdad 12 years ago 

when we were here and had a real chance of removing Saddam."

<p>Now Pokorney, Jordan and their comrades lay among unspeakable carnage. 

An older marine walked by carrying a huge chunk of flesh, so maimed it 

was impossible to tell which body part it was. With tears in his eyes 

and blood splattered over his flak jacket, he held the remains of his 

friend in his arms until someone gave him a poncho to wrap them with.

<p>Frantic medics did what they could to relieve horrific injuries, until 

four helicopters landed in the middle of the highway to take the injured

to a military hospital. Each wounded marine had a tag describing his 

injury. One had gunshot wounds to the face, another to the chest. 

Another simply lay on his side in the sand with a tag reading: "Urgent -

surgery, buttock."

<p>One young marine was assigned the job of keeping the flies at bay. Some 

of his comrades, exhausted, covered in blood, dirt and sweat walked 

around dazed. There were loud cheers as the sound of the heaviest 

artillery yet to pound Nasiriya shook the ground.

<p>Before last week the overwhelming majority of these young men had never 

been in combat. Few had even seen a dead body. Now, their faces had 

changed. Anger and fear were fueled by rumors that the bodies of 

American soldiers had been dragged through Nasiriya's streets. Some 

marines cried in the arms of friends, others sought comfort in the Bible.

<p>Next morning, the men of Alpha company talked about the fighting over 

MREs (meals ready to eat). They were jittery now and reacted nervously 

to any movement around their dugouts. They suspected that civilian cars,

including taxis, had helped resupply the enemy inside the city. When 

cars were spotted speeding along two roads, frantic calls were made over

the radio to get permission to "kill the vehicles". Twenty-four hours 

earlier it would almost certainly have been denied: now it was granted.

<p>Immediately, the level of force leveled at civilian vehicles was 

overwhelming. Tanks were placed on the road and AAVs lined along one 

side. Several taxis were destroyed by helicopter gunships as they drove 

down the road.

<p>A lorry filled with sacks of wheat made the fatal mistake of driving 

through US lines. The order was given to fire. Several AAVs pounded it 

with a barrage of machinegun fire, riddling the windscreen with at least

20 holes. The driver was killed instantly. The lorry swerved off the 

road and into a ditch. Rumor spread that the driver had been armed and 

had fired at the marines. I walked up to the lorry, but could find no 

trace of a weapon.

<p>This was the start of day that claimed many civilian casualties. After 

the lorry a truck came down the road. Again the marines fired. Inside, 

four men were killed. They had been traveling with some 10 other 

civilians, mainly women and children who were evacuated, crying, their 

clothes splattered in blood. Hours later a dog belonging to the dead 

driver was still by his side.

<p>The marines moved west to take a military barracks and secure their 

third objective, the third bridge, which carried a road out of the city.

<p>At the barracks, the marines hung a US flag from a statue of Saddam, but

Lieutenant-Colonel Rick Grabowski, the battalion commander, ordered it 

down. He toured barracks. There were stacks of Russian-made ammunition 

and hundreds of Iraqi army uniforms, some new, others left behind by 

fleeing Iraqi soldiers.

<p>One room had a map of Nasiriya, showing its defenses and two large 

cardboard arrows indicating the US plan of attack to take the two main 

bridges. Above the map were several murals praising Saddam. One, which 

sickened the Americans, showed two large civilian planes crashing into 

tall buildings.

<p>As night fell again there was great tension, the marines fearing an 

ambush. Two tanks and three AAVs were placed at the north end of the 

third bridge, their guns pointing down towards Nasiriya, and given 

orders to shoot at any vehicle that drove towards American positions.

<p>Though civilians on foot passed by safely, the policy was to shoot 

anything that moved on wheels. Inevitably, terrified civilians drove at 

speed to escape: marines took that speed to be a threat and hit out. 

During the night, our teeth on edge, we listened a dozen times as the 

AVVs' machineguns opened fire, cutting through cars and trucks like paper.

<p>Next morning I saw the result of this order - the dead civilians, the 

little girl in the orange and gold dress.

<p>Suddenly, some of the young men who had crossed into Iraq with me 

reminded me now of their fathers' generation, the trigger-happy grunts 

of Vietnam. Covered in the mud from the violent storms, they were 

drained and dangerously aggressive.

<p>In the days afterwards, the marines consolidated their position and put 

a barrier of trucks across the bridge to stop anyone from driving 

across, so there were no more civilian deaths.

<p>They also ruminated on what they had done. Some rationalized it.

<p>"I was shooting down a street when suddenly a woman came out and 

casually began to cross the street with a child no older than 10," said 

Gunnery Sergeant John Merriman, another Gulf war veteran. "At first I 

froze on seeing the civilian woman. She then crossed back again with the

child and went behind a wall. Within less than a minute a guy with an 

RPG came out and fired at us from behind the same wall. This happened a 

second time so

I thought, 'Okay, I get it. Let her come out again'.

<p>She did and this time I took her out with my M-16." Others were less 

sanguine.

<p>Mike Brooks was one of the commanders who had given the order to shoot 

at civilian vehicles. It weighed on his mind, even though he felt he had

no choice but to do everything to protect his marines from another ambush.

<p>On Friday, making coffee in the dust, he told me he had been writing a 

diary, partly for his wife Kelly, a nurse at home in Jacksonville, North

Carolina, with their sons Colin, 6, and four-year-old twins Brian and Evan.

<p>When he came to jotting down the incident about the two babies getting 

killed by his men he couldn't do it. But he said he would tell her when 

he got home. I offered to let him call his wife on my satellite phone to

tell her he was okay. He turned down the offer and had me write and send

her an e-mail instead.

<p>He was too emotional. If she heard his voice, he said, she would know 

that something was wrong.</p>
