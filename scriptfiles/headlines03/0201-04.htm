<p>Former president Jimmy Carter declared yesterday that President Bush has "not made a case for a preemptive military strike against Iraq" and urged, instead, permanent inspections and monitoring to disarm the Iraqi government.</p>

    <p>In a toughly worded statement issued as Bush met with British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Carter said that even if Secretary of State Colin L. Powell presents compelling evidence at the United Nations next week that Iraq possesses weapons of mass destruction, "this will not indicate any real or proximate threat by Iraq to the United States or to our allies."</p>

    <p>The winner of the Nobel Peace Prize said the administration bears significant responsibility for the hostility that has built around the world toward the United States, and he cited "vituperative attacks on U.S. policy by famous and respected men" such as former South African president Nelson Mandela and best-selling author John Le Carr&eacute;.</p>

    <p>He called the criticism excessive but said the erosion of international public opinion was a sobering reminder of "how much doubt and consternation has been raised about our motives for war in the absence of convincing proof of a genuine threat from Iraq."</p>

    <p>Carter said the marshaling of military forces in the Persian Gulf region and the inspection process underway in Iraq virtually guarantee that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein cannot threaten neighboring countries or the United States with weapons of mass destruction. "Any belligerent move by Saddam against a neighbor would be suicidal," he said. "An effort to produce or deploy chemical or biological weapons or to make the slightest move toward a nuclear explosion would be inconceivable."</p>

    <p>Instead, Carter argued, Hussein is more likely to use such weapons in the event of an invasion, "when all hope of avoiding the destruction of his regime is lost," than preemptively as an act of terrorism.</p>
