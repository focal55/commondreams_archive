<p>DURBAN, South Africa  - A boom in world tourism is  posing a huge threat to some of the planet's most sensitive  ecosystems, according to a study released on Friday.<P>
The study, by <a href="http://www.conservation.org/xp/CIWEB/home" target="_new">Conservation International</a> (CI) and the  <a href="http://www.unep.org/" target="_new">United Nations Environment Program</a> (UNEP), said tourism rose by  more than 100 percent between 1990 and 2000 in the world's  "biodiversity hotspots," which include the tropical Andes and  the Guinean forests of West Africa.

  </table></font>CI has identified 25 such areas, which contain 44 percent  of all identified endemic plant species and 35 percent of all  known endemic species of birds, mammals, reptiles and  amphibians.<P>
The hotspots cover only 1.4 percent of the planet's land  area and all been significantly altered by human activities.<P>
"In some places the growth (in tourism) has been  staggering," CI and UNEP said in a statement released at the  fifth <a href="http://www.iucn.org/themes/wcpa/wpc2003/index.htm" target="_new">World Parks Congress</a> in the South African port city of  Durban.

"Over the past decade, tourism has increased by more than  200 percent in both Laos and Cambodia, nearly 500 percent in  South Africa, (and) over 300 percent in the countries of  Brazil, Nicaragua and El Salvador," it said.<P>
Costas Christ of CI, one of the report's authors, told  Reuters tourist development in ecologically sensitive areas  often severely damages its main attraction -- the environment.<P>
"Many of these developments are in arid countries and so  the limited water supply comes under pressure...and if  development ultimately kills off the environment then tourists  have no incentive to come," he said.<P>
The report highlighted the Mexican resort of Cancun, where  world trade talks are being held, as an example of  unsustainable tourism which is impacting negatively on the  environment.<P>
"Prior to its development as a tourist resort in the 1970s,  only 12 families lived on the barrier island of Cancun," it  said.<P>
Now, the resort has 2.6 million visitors per year, the  local mangrove and inland forests have been cut down, and in  the settlement that has grown nearby, 75 percent of the sewage  of the population is untreated.<P>
Tourism is often said to benefit the environment by  creating jobs and other opportunities for poor rural  communities who might otherwise exploit local natural resources  for survival.<P>
