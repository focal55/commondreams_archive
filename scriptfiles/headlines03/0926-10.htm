<p>Barely one-third of Arizona voters say they would give President Bush a second term, a statewide poll revealed Thursday.<p>
The 34 percent support for his re-election, with 44 percent preferring someone else and 22 percent undecided, reflects a dramatic plunge in popularity for Bush. In 2000, he beat Al Gore in Arizona by a margin of 6 percentage points, or nearly 100,000 votes of 1.5 million cast.<p>
State Democratic Chairman Jim Pederson said the poll results are evidence that Arizonans are "increasingly frustrated with the Bush administration's performance on both the foreign and domestic fronts."<p>
But Bob Fannin, state Republican chairman, said Bush enjoyed unsustainably high ratings earlier this year, and party leaders had predicted a decline. The drop fits a pattern seen at this point in the first terms of both Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton, he said.<p>
Fannin also dismissed the poll results as an abstraction, because the election is more than 13 months away and no opponent has been chosen.<p>
Both parties' interpretations are valid, said Bruce Merrill, the Arizona State University journalism professor who conducted the poll for Channel 8 (KAET-TV) and the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication.<p>
"Polls measure opinions at a particular point in time," he said, "and things can change virtually instantly."<p>
Still, the results show that "in the short term, he (Bush) is in a difficult situation, and parallels with his father are real." After the 1991 Gulf War, the elder Bush's ratings soared, but an eroding economy led to his defeat in 1992.<p>
The poll also found that slightly more than half (52 percent) of respondents opposed providing $87 billion, as Bush has requested, for continued military presence and reconstruction in Iraq. Forty-two percent supported the request, and 6 percent were undecided.<p>
A total of 390 registered voters were surveyed statewide. Results have a sampling error of plus or minus 5 percentage points.<p>
Merrill said polls in Arizona often turn out to be within 2 or 3 percentage points of findings in nationwide polls.
