<p>WASHINGTON, Mar 16  - The U.S. capital saw its third massive protest against a possible war in Iraq on Saturday, even as participants struggled to remain optimistic in the face of a massive military build-up in the Persian Gulf.

</table></font>The balmy weather seemed to inspire a more relaxed atmosphere than previous outings, with some 50,000 people gathering at the Washington Monument to paint peace umbrellas, wave United States and United Nations flags, and listen to dozens of speakers from religious, labor and political groups.

<p>President George W. Bush was at his Camp David retreat, and travels to Azores, Portugal on Sunday for a summit with U.S. allies to discuss Iraq.

<p>Other large anti-war rallies were held across the globe, from Bangkok to Paris, Calcutta and Tokyo.

<p>Many here expressed frustration that Bush has largely ignored nationwide demonstrations and opinion polls that show strong opposition toward the push for war.

<p>Signs reading 'Merci France' and 'Got Fascist Fries?'--a reference to widely mocked efforts by some here to rename French fries as "freedom fries" after Paris opposed the U.S. plan to attack Iraq--dotted the crowd, along with the more traditional 'How Come He Never Mentions Oil?' and 'The World Says No'.

<p>"The French have been outspoken and they're being trashed in U.S. public opinion right now," said Scott Macleod from Baltimore. "People are gullible here, largely because the press is not adequately covering the anti-war movement."

<p>Media analysts agreed, citing a distinctly hawkish spin to most U.S. coverage.

<p>"Peace activists are brought on Fox (news channel) to be stood up and pistol-whipped by Bill O'Reilly, but the really dangerous conservatism is provided more subtly: men in ties sitting in front of bookcases thoughtfully discussing the pros and cons of invading Iraq," said David Davis, a writer and photographer in Colorado, who has written columns against the war. "It becomes so abstract."

<p>Sam Husseini, communications director for the Institute for Public Accuracy, said he believed the protests have given many people pause in the U.S., but clearly have not changed government policy.

<p>"There is an extraordinary split between an active population on the one hand and the administration policy on the other. It's been noted that the more people understand the situation, the more opposed they are to the Bush administration policy," he added.

<p>Gauging public support for the war is tricky, others said, although polls show U.S. citizens more or less evenly divided about going to war without U.N. backing.

<p>"It's probably true that a large number of Americans are disconnected from politics, because of overwhelming personal or economic problems, or from confusion, distrust, or fear," said Caroline Arnold, chair of the Kent Environmental Council in Kent, Ohio.

<p>"What Bush has done, I think, is to awaken a sleeping giant of conscientious Americans who are not disengaged and not ill informed," Arnold said. "They may be disillusioned, especially after the inconclusive election of 2000 failed to reflect the will of the majority, and many are suspicious of politicians and angry about government failures. Is it a majority? I don't know."

<p>While Saturday's rally and march to the White House was dominated by veteran activists, there were also groups of people attending their first protest. Margie Thomas said she and her husband drove for five hours from New Jersey despite having voted for Bush in 2000.

<p>Holding a sign that read 'Republicans Against the War,' Thomas said she was unconvinced by Washington's arguments for invading Iraq.

<p>"The general public and the administration will write off a lot of the people here," she said. "But the fact that we got out from in front of our TV set in our nice middle-class home to come here really indicates that they haven't made a case. Lots of people we know think like we do, but they're just not the protesting types."</p>
