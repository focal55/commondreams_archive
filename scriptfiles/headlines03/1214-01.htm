<p>TIKRIT, Iraq - U.S. troops captured Saddam  Hussein near his home town of Tikrit in a major coup for  Washington's beleaguered occupation force in Iraq.
<p> 
			
							"Ladies and gentlemen, we got him," the U.S. administrator  in Iraq Paul Bremer said Sunday in his first, pithy comments to  a Baghdad news conference. Cheers greeted the announcement.<p> 
			
							"The tyrant is a prisoner," he said, adding the capture was  made in a town near Tikrit Saturday.<p> 
			
							"There were no injuries. Not a single shot was fired," Lt.  Col. Ricardo Sanchez, the top U.S. general in Iraq, told the  news conference in the Iraqi capital.<p>

</font><!--/endimage/-->He then showed a videotape of a bearded Saddam in detention  and undergoing medical checks.<p> 
			
							Soldiers tore off a false beard and took samples from the  ousted dictator for DNA identity tests after digging down into  a cellar during an overnight raid on a house following a  tip-off, members of Iraq's U.S.-backed Governing Council said  Sunday.<p> 
			
							After seven months of increasingly bloody attacks on U.S.  forces and their allies following Saddam's ousting on April 9,  the arrest is a major boon for President Bush. His campaign for  re-election next year has been overshadowed by mounting  casualties and wrangling with key allies over Iraq.<p> 
			
							It may break the spirit of some of his diehard supporters  and ease anxieties of many Iraqis who lived in fear for three  decades under a man who led them into three disastrous wars.<p> 
			
							U.S. officials will also hope to extract key intelligence  on the alleged weapons programs which formed the public grounds  for Bush to go to war in defiance of many U.N. allies. Little  evidence of banned weapons has been found.<p> 
			
							Saddam, 66, had kept up a stream of belligerent rhetoric  from hiding, even after his sons Uday and Qusay were killed by  U.S. troops in July.<p> 
			
							Already vexed by its failure to find al Qaeda leader Osama  bin Laden, Washington blamed Saddam for promoting some of the  violence against its forces.<p> 
			
							But analysts warned that other groups could go on fighting.<p> 
			
							"This has lifted a shadow from the people of Iraq. Saddam  will not be returning," British Prime Minister Tony Blair said  in a statement.<p> 
			
							Saddam's sons Uday and Qusay were identified after  comparisons with DNA samples. The sons went down, guns blazing,  against overwhelming force, including missiles and aircraft.<p> 
			
							Their father was taken alive.<p> 
			
							Washington has made Saddam number one -- the "ace of  spades" -- on its list of 55 most-wanted Iraqis, and placed a  $25 million reward on his head.<p> 
			
							An informer was paid $30 million and given refuge in the  United States for turning in Uday and Qusay in Mosul.<p> 
			
							Saddam would be put on trial, Iraqi National Congress  leader Ahmad Chalabi told Reuters. A tribunal system for Iraqis  to try Saddam and fellow Baathist leaders was set up only last  week.<p> 
			
							"This is good for Iraq. He will be put on trial. Let him  face justice," Chalabi, who returned after the invasion from  years in U.S. exile, said in Baghdad.<p> 
			
							The word came just hours after the latest major attack on  Washington's Iraqi allies, with a suspected suicide car bomber  killing at least 17 people and wounding 33 at an Iraqi police  station in the restive town of Khalidiyah, west of Baghdad.<p> 
			
							GUNFIRE<p> 
			
							In early afternoon, gunfire broke out across the capital as  news filtered through that Saddam was in U.S. custody.<p> 
			
							U.S. officials had said Saddam had eluded American troops  by moving every few hours, probably in disguise and aided by  members of his clan in the Sunni Muslim areas around Tikrit,  north of Baghdad.<p> 
			
							The capture of Saddam is a morale boost for U.S. troops in  Iraq, who have been under daily attack from shadowy guerrillas,  some of whom they believe may have been directed by the former  president from hiding.<p> 
			
							U.S. forces, backed by Britain and Australia, toppled  Saddam in April.<p> 
			
							"His arrest will put an end to military and terrorist  attacks and the Iraqi nation will achieve stability," said Amar  al-Hakin, a senior member of the Shi'ite political party the  Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq.<p> 
			
							"We want Saddam to get what he deserves. I believe he will  be sentenced to hundreds of death sentences at a fair trial  because he's responsible for all the massacres and crimes in  Iraq."<p> 
			
							But Mustafa Alani, an analyst at the Royal United Services  Institute in London, warned that there were other anti-American  groups in Iraq ready to continue attacks.<p> 
			
							"There will be a reduction in operations sponsored by  former regime loyalists, but this is not the full story because  they are not the only group involved," he said.<p> 
			
							"For the Americans after the failure to capture Osama bin  Laden after so many years, it is a propaganda coup...It's an  intelligence prize because they can get information from him  about cells working now. And it's a huge victory."<p>
