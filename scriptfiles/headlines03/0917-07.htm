</table></font>"It's a black day for the United Nations and for  international law," chief Palestinian peace negotiator Saeb  Erekat said hours after the Bush administration vetoed the  measure on Tuesday.<P>
"I hope that Israel will not interpret the resolution as a  license to kill President Arafat," he told Reuters."<P>
Eleven Security Council members voted in favor of the draft  while Britain, Germany and Bulgaria abstained after hours of  consultations failed to lead to a compromise acceptable to both  the United States and Syria, the resolution's sponsor.<P>
The measure, drafted by Palestinian U.N. envoy Nasser  al-Kidwa with the support of Arab governments, demanded that  "Israel, the occupying power, desist from any act of  deportation and cease any threat to the safety of the elected  president of the Palestinian Authority."<P>It also called for "the complete cessation of all acts of  violence, including all acts of terror, provocation, incitement  and destruction" and called for increased efforts to implement  the international road map for Middle East peace.<P>
"We will come back to you, perhaps soon in the future,"  Al-Kidwa told the council following the vote. "We will not be  intimidated by what happened."<P>
After back-to-back suicide bombings killed 15 Israelis,  Israel touched off an international outcry last week by  announcing a decision "to remove" Arafat as "an obstacle to  peace," although it did not say how or when.<P>
During nearly eight hours of harsh debate in the 15-nation  Security Council on Monday, more than 40 governments condemned  the decision in principle to get rid of Arafat.<P>
After the veto, several council members including U.S.  Ambassador John Negroponte cautioned Israel that the veto did  not mean it should harm Arafat or send him into exile.<P>
"The United States does not support either the elimination  of Mr. Arafat or his forced exile. While Mr. Arafat is part of  the problem, we believe that this problem is best solved  through diplomatic isolation, and we have made this view  clear," Negroponte said.<P>
He said the text was vetoed because it failed to explicitly  condemn Palestinian militant groups, such as Hamas, Islamic  Jihad and the al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, which have been blamed  for suicide bombings in Israel.<P>
"This resolution did not take a clear stand against the  actions of these terrorist groups or call for decisive action  against them," Negroponte said.<P>
Syrian U.N. envoy Fayssal Mekdad called the veto  regrettable, stating that to kill or exile Arafat would violate  both international law and the U.N. Charter.
<P>
"Israel should not be a member of the United Nations  because it is not a peace-loving country," Mekdad added. "Syria  believes that Israel is responsible for its illogical policy  and Israel is as well responsible for having scuttled the peace  process in the Middle East."
