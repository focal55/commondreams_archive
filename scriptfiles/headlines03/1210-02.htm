OSLO  - Iran's Shirin Ebadi became the first  Muslim woman to receive the Nobel Peace Prize Wednesday and  sent a bold anti-war message to the West, accusing it of hiding  behind the Sept. 11 attacks to violate human rights.

  </table><!--/endimage/-->Reformist lawyer Ebadi, who was recognized for her work for  the rights of women and children in Iran, was handed the prize  by the head of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, Ole Danbolt  Mjoes, at a glittering ceremony at the Oslo City Hall.

				<P>Ebadi slammed the U.S. administration for double standards  in ignoring U.N. resolutions in the Middle East, while using  them as a pretext to go to war in Iraq. The audience included  Hollywood couple Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones, star  hosts of Thursday's Nobel concert.

				<P>"In the past two years, some states have violated the  universal principles and laws of human rights by using the  events of Sept. 11 and the war on international terrorism as a  pretext," she said in a prepared acceptance speech.

				<P>"Regulations restricting human rights and basic freedoms  ... have been justified and given legitimacy under the cloak of  the war on terrorism."

				<P>Wearing no headscarf for the ceremony, the 56-year-old who  won the $1.4 million prize for her work for the rights of women  and children in Iran, lashed out at what she called breaches of  the Geneva conventions at the U.S. Guantanamo Bay military  jail.

				<P>Ebadi said Guantanamo prisoners had been "without the  benefit of the rights stipulated under the international Geneva  conventions, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the  (U.N.) International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights."

				<P>Ebadi, Iran's first female judge before the 1979 Islamic  revolution forced her to step aside in favor of men, said it  was worrying that human rights were violated by the same  Western democracies that had initiated the principles.

				<P>The laureate said she, like other human rights activists,  questioned why some U.N. resolutions were binding to the West  and others were ignored.

				<P>Ebadi, who has become a symbol of reformist hope in Iran  while labeled a political stooge of the West by conservative  clerics, also pointed a finger at her own government, urging  Tehran to accept that reform is inevitable.

				<P>"In fact, it is not so easy to rule over a people who are  aware of their rights, using traditional, patriarchal and  paternalistic methods," she said.
