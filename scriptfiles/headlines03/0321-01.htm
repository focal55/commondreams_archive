<p>UMM QASR, Iraq  - U.S. Marines briefly raised the  Stars and Stripes flag over the new port area of Umm Qasr on  Friday after facing tougher than expected resistance in and  around the southern Iraq port.

<p>



		Reuters correspondent Adrian Croft, traveling with the  Marines, saw troops lower an Iraqi flag soon after they arrived  at the port complex, replacing it with the U.S. flag.<p>

</table></font>Some time later, Marines returned and removed the Stars and  Stripes. No reason was given for the decision, but Washington  has consistently stressed that invading U.S. forces want to  liberate Iraq, not occupy it.<p>



		U.S. troops moved into the huge port area to hunt for Iraqi  soldiers who might be hidden in the site. A dozen Marine  helicopters landed on a massive parking lot inside the  perimeter fence to bring in reinforcements.<p>



		"The (new) port is about 40 percent secure. There is still  shooting going on," said Marine Captain Rick Crevier from  Placerville, California, one of the operation's commanders.<p>



		He added the old port, one mile away, was still under  observation.<p>



		U.S. Marines poured over the Kuwaiti border just after dawn  heading for Umm Qasr, but were almost immediately pinned down  in a two-hour firefight with Iraqi soldiers armed with  machineguns and anti-tank rockets.<p>



		The Marines called in tanks and artillery fire to clear  their path.<p>



		STIFF RESISTANCE<p>



		Asked if the resistance was stiffer than expected, Crevier  said: "Yes, a lot more. We had some dug in troops and we were  starting to receive some mortar fire."<p>



		He added one Marine was slightly injured by broken glass.<p>



		He had no information about Iraqi casualties, but the  bodies of two men in civilian clothes were seen lying in the  streets as a U.S. armored convoy moved to the port area.<p>



		A third man sat in the road bleeding heavily. Nearby, two  cars were ablaze.<p>



		U.S. commanders said they were keen to secure Umm Qasr,  Iraq's largest commercial port, because they wanted to use it  to bring in humanitarian aid.<p>



		When Marines arrived at the port they were met by a huge  portrait of Saddam Hussein, showing a younger version of the  Iraqi President wearing a Western suit, which was hung next to  the main entrance.

		Hours later, the picture had been cut out of its frame and  spirited away, allegedly by a Marine looking for a war trophy.
