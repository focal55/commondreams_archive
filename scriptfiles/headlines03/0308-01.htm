<p>MEXICO CITY, March 7 — Politicians, editorial writers and ordinary people around the world said today they were bracing for war after hearing President Bush warn that only days may remain before a military action in Iraq, with or without the approval of the United Nations Security Council.</p>

</table></font>Public opinion in many countries strongly favors Security Council approval, surveys and polls suggest, including those in Mexico, one of 15 members of the Security Council. </p>

<P> The Mexican president, Vicente Fox, must soon decide how to vote on the British and American resolution that would authorize force against Iraq. Mr. Bush telephoned Mr. Fox on Thursday seeking his support. Mr. Fox has not revealed how Mexico will vote.</p>

<P> Any possible war without the Council's consent might well strengthen anti-American feelings and weaken popular support for American allies like Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain.</p>

<P> In London, Mr. Blair sought support for his pro-American stance from European viewers of MTV, the music channel. He was met with some skepticism.</p>

<P> "I'm able to produce anthrax in my bathroom," said Niklas Ergandt, 25, a Swede. "Why don't you bomb Sweden?"</p>

<P> On London's streets little popular support for the United States was evident. Theresa Searle, a Londoner in her 50's, shopping in fashionable Hampstead, called Mr. Bush "a warmonger." Mansur Akhtar, 31, said: "Saddam Hussein has to be removed, but I don't believe a regime change is a decision America should make alone. In the speech Bush gave last night he said: `I don't care about the rest of you. We are America. We know best.' "</p>

<P> Some European newspapers reflected that feeling. In Paris popular opinion was represented in a headline in Le Monde, "George Bush Announces an Imminent War With or Without the U.N," and also in Le Figaro, which called the United Nations debate a "dialogue of the deaf." Le Monde is considered left-leaning in its views, and Le Figaro is regarded as France's leading right-wing newspaper.</p>

<P> The Evening Standard, a London newspaper that often opposes Mr. Blair's government, said in an editorial that Mr. Bush's "robust approach may well appeal to the American people" but "makes life extraordinarily difficult here for Mr. Blair."</p>

<P> The editorial continued: "Mr. Blair has shown a remarkable capacity for following his convictions. Over the coming days, he will need that political courage, for this will be the most critical period of his premiership."</p>

</table></font>Today in his strongest pro-American remarks to date, Mr. Fox said, "Saddam is playing with fire" and "needs to reveal to the world his commitment to total disarmanent." But he stopped short of endorsing Mr. Bush's stance, saying the "good news and bad news" reported today by the United Nations' chief weapons inspector, Hans Blix, showed "advances in disarmament" without "total commitment for disarmament."</p>

<P> The perception that Mr. Fox faces severe political punishment if he does not support Mr. Bush is widespread in Mexico.</p>

<P> "No Mexican president in recent decades has been in as difficult a fix," wrote Jorge Chabat, a political analyst, in a widely syndicated column today. "Fox finds himself with little or no wiggle room" at the Security Council.</p>

<P> Ana Maria Salazar, a former United States deputy assistant defense secretary, wrote today in El Universal, Mexico City's biggest daily, that Mr. Bush was "playing Russian roulette" and that Mr. Fox should tell him, "I wouldn't want to be in your boots when television starts showing civilian victims and bodies of American soldiers."</p>

<P> In Argentina Adolfo Pérez Esquivel, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, wrote that war in Iraq would "be opening Pandora's box, threatening to set free the demons of death and destruction." The fate of the world, he wrote, was in the hands of Mr. Bush and three leaders who support him — Mr. Blair, Prime minister José María Anzar of Spain and Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy — whom he called "four musketeers with missles."</p>

<P> For his part Mr. Berlusconi seemed to be softening his stance, calling war a last resort in response to huge antiwar demonstrations in Italy last month. Polls now show that 70 percent of Italians are against any war without United Nations approval.</p>

<P> Mr. Berlusconi met today in Berlin with Chancellor Gerhard Schröder of Germany, who is opposed to military action. "I don't think that a war is inevitable," Mr. Berlusconi said. "I still hope that we can achieve disarmament without war. That depends almost entirely on the Iraqi dictator."</p>

<P> That hope seemed to fade in many cities around the world after President Bush's news conference.</p>

<P> "The United States insists that Iraq should not just destroy separate bombs, shells or missiles, but that it should cooperate with the United Nations with enthusiasm," said Yuri V. Fedotov, the deputy foreign minister of Russia..</p>

<P> "Apparently," he added, "this will not be simple to do."</p>

<P> In Baghdad the official Iraqi news agency said the United States and Britain had presented the Security Council with "the same allegations, fabrications and foolishness that have been and continue to be reproved by the whole world." </p>
