<p>WASHINGTON - In the days before he assumed the presidency in 2001, George W. Bush liked to boast about the foreign policy "Dream Team" he had assembled.
<p>	Vice President Dick Cheney, Secretary of State Colin Powell, national security adviser Condoleezza Rice and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld were all "smart people" who would compensate for the former Texas governor's lack of international experience.

BACKSTABBING DREAM TEAM?<br>

</table></font>"General Powell's a strong figure, and Dick Cheney's no shrinking violet, nor Condi Rice," Bush said in December 2000. "I view the four as being able to complement each other."
<p>	But after nearly three years in office, Bush's dream team is beset by infighting, backstabbing and maneuvering on major foreign policy issues involving North Korea, Syria, Iran and postwar Iraq. The result has been paralysis, inconsistency and a zigzagging U.S. policy that confuses lawmakers on Capitol Hill and disturbs America's friends, allies and would-be partners.
<p>	It has hampered U.S. policies in the Middle East, where the Israeli-Palestinian conflict continues to rage, caused anxiety in Asia, where the administration's refusal to deal directly with North Korea has dismayed allies, and has seriously soured relations with some North Atlantic Treaty Organization members, say U.S. and foreign officials.
<p>	One U.S. diplomat, who asked not to be named, recalled what he said was Chinese exasperation over what they perceived as conflicting messages from the administration on North Korea. "We actually don't care what your point of view is. Just have one," he quoted his Chinese counterparts as saying.
<p>	White House officials declined to comment for this story. But a senior administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, acknowledged that there have been severe rifts between members of Bush's foreign policy brain trust, but he insisted those disagreements are in the past.
<p>	"Everybody realizes that there are a number of jobs that have got to get done," the official said. "We're in Iraq. That's got to go right. We're in the Middle East peace process. That's got to go right. I think on some of those issues there are lots of points of view. But right now, over the last few weeks, are we debating those things in a useful, civilized manner? Yes."
<p>	The battles between Bush's foreign policy principals have largely been fought in private. But they spilled into public view recently after Bush announced he had tapped Rice to oversee a new group designed to reduce violence and speed the reconstruction of Iraq and Afghanistan.
<p>	Rumsfeld, whose Pentagon has led the charge of postwar Iraq, publicly bristled at the news and hinted that he had not been consulted. Rumsfeld suggested that in forming the Iraq Stabilization Group and putting Rice in charge, the president was finally having the National Security Council do its job of coordinating the various government agencies involved in rebuilding Iraq.
<p>	The Bush foreign affairs team can't seem to agree even when it embarks on a mission in unison. Tired of what it felt were negative media reports from Iraq, the White House launched a public relations blitz two weeks ago to put a positive face on rebuilding efforts. The president, Cheney and Rice delivered speeches stating the administration's case.
<p>	The outcome was a series of addresses that varied so much in tone and message that some leading lawmakers, such as Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., were left dismayed.
<p>	"I'm not certain who assigns these … or whether people just say `I've got to say something' and just blurt it out," said Lugar, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Bush "really has to indicate a unified voice, his voice, to the American people and people abroad. They respect the president, and that's diluted somewhat by these other voices."
<p>	Bureaucratic infighting in foreign policy is nothing new. During George Washington's administration, Thomas Jefferson and John Adams battled, often viciously, over whether the United States should tilt toward England or France. Secretary of State George Shultz and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger squabbled in the Reagan administration. National security adviser Henry Kissinger overpowered Secretary of State William Rogers in the Nixon administration, and Jimmy Carter's secretary of state, Cyrus Vance, quit after the failed 1980 attempt to rescue American hostages in Iran, which he'd opposed.
<p>	But the Weinberger-Shultz fights and those between Vance and Carter's national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski "look like Sunday school picnics" compared with the present fights "in terms of freezing the administration's ability to act," said a former U.S. official, who requested anonymity because he still deals with the U.S. government regularly.
<p>	The conflict pits so-called neo-conservatives led by Vice President Cheney and Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld against so-called pragmatists led by Secretary of State Powell and is fueled by a major difference in world outlook, say knowledgeable officials.
<p>	"This time it's not about tactics; it's about ideology," said one senior official who served in several Republican administrations. "There's no compromise possible between two opposing views of how this country should deal with the rest of the world."
<p>	The Cheney-Rumsfeld camp looks at the terrorist threat much as communism was viewed during the Cold War: a global network of evildoers whose links to one another are real even if they aren't visible. They oppose negotiating with regimes in Syria, Iran, Iraq and North Korea that support terrorism.
<p>	The pragmatists, who include CIA Director George Tenet and some members of the armed services, are ideological descendants of Kissinger. They continue to seek some form of detente with Syria, Iran and North Korea, believing that a combination of international sanctions, carrots and sticks can moderate their behavior.
<p>	The divisions between the two camps were muted at the outset of the administration, but they hardened after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, several top officials said.
<p>	"What happened was that Cheney and Rumsfeld essentially went on a crusade against terrorism, starting with Iraq, and Powell kept trying, mostly without success, to rein them in," said one official, who like the others spoke only on the condition of anonymity because Bush has demanded that his advisers stop talking to reporters about the disunity in his administration. "Cheney is always in Bush's ear, whispering `terrorism, terrorism, terrorism.' He's obsessed."
<p>	Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said he's hearing more complaints about Cheney's influence on foreign policy matters.
<p>	"If you look at Afghanistan, if you look at the (Israeli-Palestinian peace) roadmap, if you look at Iraq, if you look at bilateral and multilateral dealings with the Europeans, just as Powell looks like he will stitch the garment back together again, Cheney goes to the Heritage Foundation (a conservative think tank) and re-enunciates the policy of pre-emption," Biden said. "It's just what they did in Iraq. They outsmarted the centrist or the internationalists … in this administration, and the neo-cons carried the day."
<p>	One of the major internal battles centers on who will lead Iraq. Civilian leaders in the Pentagon have pushed for Ahmad Chalabi, a controversial Iraqi leader who for years lived in exile in London, to replace former President Saddam Hussein.
<p>	Chalabi, head of the U.S.-backed Iraqi National Congress and now a member of Iraq's Governing Council, had spent years winning over Washington figures such as Cheney and Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz by pledging support for democracy.
<p>	But Chalabi, who was convicted of bank fraud in absentia in Jordan in 1992 and sentenced to 22 years in prison, is distrusted by the State Department, the CIA and many senior U.S. military commanders. They view him as a self-serving and unreliable source of "intelligence" on Saddam's alleged weapons of mass destruction programs and links to al-Qaida, and doubted his claims to having secret supporters across Iraq who were ready to rise against the former dictator when U.S. troops arrived.
<p>	State Department officials last year withheld about $8 million in funding for the INC in a dispute over accounting irregularities. Shortly after that, the Defense Department agreed to pick up the funding for INC operations.
<p>	The disagreement over Chalabi came to a head during the war when Chalabi offered to send hundreds of fighters to join the U.S. assault on Baghdad and help put an "Iraqi face" on the invasion.
<p>	Senior U.S. military officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said U.S. commanders agreed to fly 700 of Chalabi's troops from Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq to the central city of Nasariya, but refused to let Chalabi accompany them.
<p>	Senior Defense Department civilians, anxious for Chalabi to win the acclaim of the Iraqi people by entering Baghdad with American forces, ordered that he be allowed to join the fighters. When they arrived in Nasariya, however, Chalabi and his fighters were secluded by U.S. commanders in an abandoned military facility and not included in the attack on Baghdad.
<p>	The decision to airlift Chalabi surprised many on Capitol Hill.
<p>	"Chalabi keeps bobbing up, always back and forth," Lugar said. "I thought it was an extraordinary action to send Chalabi to Iraq by the Department of Defense early on."
<p>	The internal turf battles have not been limited to Iraq.
<p>	In one early skirmish, the Pentagon defied a White House decision in early 2002 to conclude a legally binding treaty with Moscow that placed new limits on the number of nuclear warheads that could be fielded by the United States and Russia.
<p>	Bush had agreed to Russian President Vladimir Putin's insistence on a formal accord to help the Russian leader win support from parliamentarians and senior military officers who did not trust the United States to hold up its end of the agreement.
<p>	As U.S. and Russian diplomats hammered out the document, however, Pentagon officials, in separate negotiations with their Russian counterparts, continued to push for a non-binding agreement. As the negotiations moved forward, Pentagon officials unsuccessfully tried to change portions of the draft agreed to by diplomats, according to a senior U.S. official.
<p>	Eventually, Bush had to intercede with Rumsfeld, reminding him that he wanted a legally binding treaty, which Putin and Bush signed on May 24, 2002.
<p>	The longest-running battle among the administration's foreign policy titans has been waged over North Korea. Fissures and disagreements surfaced early when Bush surprised Powell by temporarily abandoning a Clinton administration policy of seeking an end to North Korea's missile program through negotiation.
<p>	The State Department insisted on talks to solve the problem, while the Pentagon opposed any negotiations. That argument was still going on as multi-nation talks involving North Korea got underway, first in April and then in August, in Beijing.
<p>	The talks have been stymied by North Korea's demand for a non-aggression pact from the United States. Powell has called Pyongyang's demands a non-starter, but added that there could be another way to give North Korea a written assurance that the United States won't attack. But that idea has met stiff resistance among the administration's hardliners.
<p>	Biden believes the neo-conservatives' rejection of any kind of nonaggression pledge has hurt the prospects of resolving the North Korea nuclear crisis.
<p>	The administration has "screwed it up so badly so far that it may not be redeemable," Biden said.
<p>	Bush himself has apparently grown tired of the internal bickering spilling into public view. He has implored his senior administration officials to cooperate with each other and last week ordered them to stop leaking their complaints to the media.
<p>	"Sometimes, you realize that too much time is being spent on the wrong things," one senior administration official said.
