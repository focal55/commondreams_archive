<p>UNITED NATIONS  - Despite the Bush
administration's coolness toward the United Nations, a U.S.
poll released on Wednesday found support for the world body
among three out of five, or 59 percent, of Americans.
<p>
 A major exception was among Republicans, where only 37
percent agreed that the United Nations was needed more than
ever in world affairs and believed the world body was less
relevant and less influential today.
<p>President Bush, who failed to win U.N. Security Council
authorization for the U.S. invasion of Iraq, had said the world
body's stance against Saddam Hussein would test its relevance.
<p>In the poll, 65 percent of women polled supported the
United Nations as compared to only 53 percent of men, according
to Zogby International, which conducted the survey on behalf of
the Council on Foreign relations.
<p>Those viewing the United Nations as more necessary than
ever included 81 percent of Democratic Party supporters, 66
percent of young voters between 18 and 29 years of age and 65
percent of union members.
<p>Zogby, based in Utica, New York, said it conducted
telephone interviews with 1,000 likely voters Sept. 5-9. chosen
at random across the country from listed residential phone
numbers.</p>
