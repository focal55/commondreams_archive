<p>SEOUL  - North Korea demanded Wednesday that the  United States withdraws all its nuclear weapons from South  Korea -- an action Washington says it carried out 12 years ago.<p>



		The demand appeared to be the latest attempt to portray the  United States as the real military threat in the crisis over  the communist North's nuclear weapons program.<p>



		"The U.S. should immediately withdraw nuclear weapons from  South Korea," the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA)  said quoting state newspapers.<p>



		"South Korea has turned into the biggest nuclear arsenal in  the Far East and a nuclear attack base as over 1,000 U.S.-made  nukes are deployed there," it said.<p>



		In September 1991, then U.S. President George Bush  announced the withdrawal of all U.S. tactical nuclear weapons  deployed abroad, including about 100 based in South Korea.<p>



		Although North Korea never publicly acknowledged the move,  this helped to pave the way for the December 1991 South-North  Joint Declaration on the De-nuclearisation of the Korean  peninsula.<p>



		Under that pact, the rival Korean governments pledged not  to test, produce, receive, store, deploy or use nuclear  weapons. They also agreed to mutual inspections.<p>



		"The U.S. imperialists have gone ahead with the  establishment of the "joint stealth operation force" for  carrying out a pre-emptive nuclear attack operation... since  they singled out the DPRK (North Korea) as part of an "axis of  evil" and target of its pre-emptive nuclear attack," the Rodong  Sinmun newspaper said.<p>



		That reference came on the anniversary of a speech by  President Bush in which he bracketed North Korea with Iraq and  Iran in an "axis of evil."<p>



		In his State of the Union speech this year, Bush accused  North Korea of deceit and blackmail, but said Washington would  work with its allies for a peaceful resolution of the crisis.<p>



		The nuclear crisis was sparked in October when Washington  said Pyongyang had admitted to reviving a nuclear arms program  it had previously agreed to shut down under a 1994 deal.<p>



		Pyongyang later expelled U.N. nuclear inspectors, removed  seals from a mothballed reactor and pulled out of the treaty  which seeks to prevent the spread of nuclear arms.
