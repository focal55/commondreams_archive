<p>WASHINGTON  - 

Veteran Democratic Sen. Robert Byrd

blasted President Bush on Friday for giving the United States

the image "of a belligerent bully," and said Bush's contrasting

handling of threats posed by North Korea and Iraq revealed

major flaws in his foreign policy.



  <p>

 Byrd of West Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate

Appropriations Committee that oversees federal spending, said

Bush appeared eager to apply his doctrine of taking pre-emptive

military action against less powerful countries such as Iraq,

but not against countries that may pose a nuclear threat such

as North Korea.

 <p>

 "What is the message we convey to the world if we are eager

to apply a doctrine of pre-emption on those countries with

limited ability to defend or counterattack, and yet waffle over

a pre-emptive response to dangerous regimes with firepower to

hit back?" Byrd said as a number of Democrats sharpened their

criticisms of Bush's handling of world affairs.

 <p>

 "The unanticipated result of this doctrine may be to

unleash a global scramble to acquire the means to deter the

U.S. from unprovoked attacks," he said on the Senate floor.

 <p>

 Bush has said the United States has the right to launch

pre-emptive strikes against nations that have or are developing

weapons of mass destruction that threaten the United States or

its allies, which he said would justify a U.S. attack on Iraq.

 <p>

 Byrd called that a bellicose position and said

policy-makers must "work to restore the image of the United

States to that of strong peacekeeper instead of belligerent

bully."

 <p>

 He said he was relieved the administration "appears to

fully comprehend the folly" of a pre-emptive strike on North

Korea, which may possess nuclear weapons, and was instead

trying to defuse the situation through diplomacy.

 <p>

 North Korea has expelled U.N. weapons inspectors and

threatened to resume missile testing in a standoff the Bush

administration has said it is determined to resolve

diplomatically.

 <p>

 Iraq denies it has chemical, biological or nuclear weapons,

and has admitted U.N. inspectors.

 <p>

 Byrd, who fiercely fought the resolution Congress passed in

October giving Bush authority to attack Iraq if necessary to

disarm it, urged Bush to cool "the fever pitch of war

rhetoric."

 <p>

 He complained the nation was mobilizing to attack Iraq

"without so much as a whisper of debate," and said Congress

must re-evaluate the situation before any military action.
