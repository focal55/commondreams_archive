<p>"Just to clarify . . . we support the troops," Pearl Jam lead singer 

Eddie Vedder told a Denver audience last week after getting booed and told to 

shut up for criticizing President Bush on stage. Some in the crowd, perhaps 

soothed a bit, cheered.

</table></font>In the current minefield of political expression, many peace activists are 

creating their own version of patriotism, whether it's carrying U.S. flags at 

anti-war rallies or slapping "Peace is Patriotic" bumper stickers on their 

cars. "Support the troops, not the war" has become a mantra at anti-war 

demonstrations nationwide.

<P>The use of nationalistic symbols and language by the peace movement 

occurred during the first Gulf War and even before. But as the current Iraq 

war continues, a new movement is emerging to wrestle patriotic words and 

images from conservatives -- and allow mainstream Americans to feel more 

comfortable about participating in anti-war demonstrations.

<P><b>UNDERGROUND PUBLIC RELATIONS</b>

<P>An underground public relations campaign has begun to introduce patriotic 

language into left-leaning groups, said George Lakoff, a UC Berkeley 

linguistics professor and author of "Moral Politics." Conservatives have 

"pretty much commandeered patriotic language," said Lakoff, who has been 

working with peace activists and others to craft a new strategy for 

progressives.

<P>"It became very clear right after Sept. 11 there was no patriotic language 

for progressives, that all the symbols had been taken over," Lakoff said. 

"This was a great shame because progressives are just as patriotic as anybody 

else. That is, progressives are loyal to the ideals of the country."

<P>Working Assets, a San Francisco long-distance service and credit card 

company that supports liberal causes, recently put up 100 signs on Washington, 

D.C., buses that read,''Support Our Troops. Bring them Home Now." The group 

also placed that slogan on billboards in Houston, Detroit, Manhattan, Los 

Angeles and San Francisco. The Houston billboard prompted a few death threats, 

the company's president said.

<P>"We are trying to take back the language," said Michael Kieschnick, 

president of Working Assets. "Our message is that it's time for those who are 

anti-war to make it clear that we care just as much about our soldiers as 

those who are pro-war. . . . It really isn't some tactic."

<P><b>GLOBAL SYMBOL</b>

<P>Many peace activists, however, are bothered by the use of patriotic symbols 

and are raising questions within their own movements. Some are 

internationalists who believe the entire U.S. government is immoral, not just 

Bush and the war itself, and they have chosen the globe or an upside-down U.S. 

flag as their symbols.

<P>The disparate groups of anti-war demonstrators have tried to remain united 

about the issue, however angry words have been exchanged between demonstrators 

who have brought U.S. flags to protests and others who view them with 

suspicion or derision.

<P>Jeff Paterson, a former U.S. Marine corporal who was discharged for 

refusing to fight in the first Gulf War, said the "support-the-troops thing is 

really the best PR they can put on an unjust, immoral and illegal invasion."

<P>"Personally I think the image of the earth is the best symbol to express 

our solidarity," said Paterson, 34, a San Francisco peace activist. "We're all 

in this together, and looking at the world through an American lens is 

actually in the long run not beneficial."

<P>Maya Jones, another Bay Area peace organizer, said the U.S. government used 

the symbolism of the U.S. flag after Sept. 11 to "manipulate people's grief 

and really capitalize and commodify grief, and used it as a symbol of a united 

people. This flag does not represent unity."

<P><b>CONSERVATIVES SUSPICIOUS</b>

</table></font>Conservatives, too, are suspicious when they see U.S. flags at anti-war 

rallies and draw parallels to the "traitors" who protested during the Vietnam 

War. Demonstrators have been labeled communists and "terrorist-supporting 

leftists" by a vociferous and vocal conservative wing.

<P>Kathy Wood with the Washington, D.C., chapter of Free Republic, a 

conservative group, said she witnessed a protester rip down a U.S. flag that 

was being held by a Vietnam veteran at a recent anti-war demonstration. She 

said the protester ripped the flag apart.

<P>"That is what they really feel about the American flag," Wood said. "This 

is just a charade to make them look more mainstream and get their message out."

<P>Indeed, patriotic messages from peace activists are commonplace. A marquee 

at the Grand Lake Theatre in Oakland reads: "Honor Our Troops, Bring Them Home,

<P>Peace Is Patriotic." A convoy of 100 hybrid vehicles converged on San 

Francisco in January, some carrying "Real Patriots Drive Hybrids" bumper 

stickers -- a message that environmentally friendly cars wean the U.S. from 

Arab oil.

<P>Kieschnick said Working Assets recently offered a service for 

protesters to choose between a half-dozen different protest signs available on 

a Web site. Those signs were then printed on placards, attached to sticks and 

made available at protests.

<P>He said the most popular sign requested was the "Support Our Troops. Bring 

Them Home Now." That is evidence, he said, that a large segment of mainstream 

America does not support the war and feels uncomfortable with the "hard left, 

down-with-America approach."

<P><b>MORAL DISTINCTIONS</b>

<P>The "support the troops" message opens up questions of the moral 

distinctions between the U.S. government that wages a war and the soldiers who 

fight in it. This has been a debate for decades, particularly during the 

Vietnam War when the treatment of individual soldiers came into focus.

<P>Not In Our Name, an activist group in the East Bay, decided the best 

response during this war is to support any soldier who refuses to fight, 

without making any official "support the troops" statement.

<P>Peace activists overwhelmingly say U.S. soldiers should not be personally 

attacked for fighting in Iraq, even if the anti-war movement believes the war 

itself is immoral.

<P>Andrea Buffa, a peace activist in San Francisco, said most of the soldiers 

in Iraq "are 19 years old and they are being ordered to do this by a lot of 

people who have never fought in a war. So I hold the leadership who are doing 

this accountable."

<P>"Fundamentally," said John Bostrom, 58, a consultant from Staten Island, N.

Y., who has been debating the issue online with other peace activists, 

"support-the-troops is a cry of fear and despair that our kids are going to 

die. That is the emotional level. Who could possibly oppose that?"</p>
