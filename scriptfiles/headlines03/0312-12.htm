<p>The City Council in the place hit hardest by the Sept. 11 attacks approved a resolution Wednesday opposing war with Iraq except as a last resort.</p>

    <p>The 31-17 vote came after months of debate over whether New York should stake out a position.</p>

    <p>"If we're going to be looking for a fight, let's fight poverty, let's fight firehouse closures, let's fight racism and sexism," said Yvette Clarke, a Democrat who supported the resolution.</p>

    <p>Democrat Alan Jennings said that after losing one of his closest friends in the World Trade Center attack, he was in no mood to vote for an anti-war measure.</p>

    <p>"Our troops are in the Middle East at this time to fight for our democracy," Jennings said. "I think this resolution sends the wrong message to our men and women in uniform."</p>

    <p>The resolution backed war only if "other options for achieving compliance with United Nations resolutions calling for the elimination of weapons of mass destruction and the means of their development have failed."</p>

    <p>Last month, 100,000 to 350,000 people took part in an anti-war protest near the United Nations. Recent polls show that 75 percent of New Yorkers oppose a war without the support of the United Nations.</p>

    <p>Since September, anti-war resolutions have been approved in such cities as Los Angeles; Kalamazoo, Mich.; Chicago; Portland, Maine; and Milwaukee.</p>
