<p>BRUSSELS - Telephone bugs have been discovered at  offices used by France, Germany and Britain in the building  where European Union leaders are due to hold a summit this  week, an EU spokesman said on Wednesday.

<p>



Sweden's EU ambassador said only a few intelligence  services were capable of installing such sophisticated devices,  which may have been in action undetected ever since the pink  granite EU Council building was inaugurated in 1995.<p>



		Officials said the wiretapping devices, found in a routine  security sweep on February 28, were attached to phone lines to  delegation suites used regularly by national leaders, ministers  and senior officials attending EU meetings.<p>



		The countries targeted were France, Germany, Britain,  Italy, Spain and Austria, the officials said.<p>



		The French newspaper Le Figaro, which broke the story in a  brief item in its diplomatic gossip column, accused the United  States of being behind the wiretapping, revealed amid acute  transatlantic tension over looming war in Iraq.<p>



		But Dominique-Georges Marro, head of the EU Council press  service, told reporters: "We do not know who is behind it. I  don't know who was on the other end of the line."<p>



		After EU ambassadors were briefed on the espionage affair,  Swedish envoy Sven-Olaf Petersson told reporters: "They were  very sophisticated installations, we are told, which only a few  intelligence services are able to install."<p>



		He said the devices had been found on February 28, attached  to certain phone lines in the central switchboard. It was not  clear why ministers and ambassadors were not informed until  after the Le Figaro report.<p>



		"TRANSPARENT" EU<p>



		"There are many indications that they were installed with  the building (in) 1994-95. It is naturally very serious that  someone has installed illegal listening devices in our  building," Petersson said.<p>



		The discovery added to the sense of gloom and distrust in  Brussels ahead of an EU summit set to be dominated by the Iraq  crisis, which has deeply divided the 15-nation bloc.<p>



		Britain, Italy and Spain have strongly backed the United  States' plans for war on Iraq while France and Germany have led  EU and wider international opposition to any military action.<p>



		Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou, whose country  holds the EU's rotating presidency, condemned the wire-tapping  but tried to laugh it off.<p>



		"To all those who feel a need to tap our phones let me say  that Europe is a very transparent organization. They are  welcome to use our Web site (to get information)... They should  not go to such lengths," he told a news conference.<p>



		One EU diplomat said several delegations had received a  warning two weeks ago to avoid confidential telephone calls in  the Council building because of the danger of eavesdropping.<p>



		But Papandreou said he only found out about the incident on  Wednesday morning, as did EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana  whose office is in the Justus Lipsius council building.<p>



		Neither Solana's office nor those of EU military personnel  were among those targeted, officials said.<p>



		The Council's security service is conducting the probe with  help from the authorities of host country Belgium and those  countries affected by the wiretapping, officials said.
