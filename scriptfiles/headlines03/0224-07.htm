<p>Western leaders were accused of being callous killers using the war on terrorism as a pretext to dominate the world as an international summit set to reject an invasion of Iraq without UN backing opened here.</p>
<p>The charge was laid by an impassioned Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who takes over from South Africa as chairman of the 116-nation Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), before a record number of more than 50 heads of state or government.</p>
<p>"It is no longer just a war against terrorism," the veteran Southeast Asian leader told them. "It is in fact a war to dominate the world."</p>
<p>In a vitriolic attack over the threat to invade Iraq, which is a member of the movement, Mahathir compared the political and military leaders of the world's great powers unflatteringly with suicide terrorists.</p>
<p>While the terrorists died as they attacked, "the great warriors who press the buttons see nothing of the mangled bodies, the heads and limbs which are torn from disemboweled bodies, the blood and the gore of the innocent people.</p>
<p>"And because they don't see, the button-pressing warriors and the people who commanded them go back to enjoy a hearty meal, watch TV shows or morale boosting troop entertainers and then retire to their cosy beds for a good sleep," he said.</p>
<p>Even for a man known for his outspoken views, it was an astonishing performance, designed to set the tone for a movement which includes all three countries described by US President George W. Bush as the global "axis of evil" -- Iraq, Iran and North Korea.</p>
<p>But among Mahathir's audience were also many US allies from the developing world, along with Pakistan's Pervez Musharraf, India's Atal Behari Vajpayee, Cuba's Fidel Castro and Afghanistan's Hamid Karzai.</p>
<p>Also present was Iraq's Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan, who has promised to show the summit evidence in the form of documents and tapes to tell "the truth of what is happening in Iraq" -- an apparent response to US Secretary of State Colin Powell's presentation to the UN Security Council on Baghdad's alleged weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p>A draft statement on Iraq, agreed after four days of wrangling by officials and foreign ministers, opposes any war against Iraq without the support of the UN Security Council.</p>
<p>NAM, which represents more than half the UN membership and was set up during the Cold War as a counter to the Western and Easter power blocs, will also call on Iraq to "actively" comply with UN demands that it disarm.</p>
<p>The organisation groups mainly developing countries from Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America, but six of its members -- Syria, Cameroon, Chile, Guinea, Pakistan and Angola -- are currently sitting as non-permanent members of the UN Security Council.</p>
<p>On North Korea, the movement backed down from an attempt to put pressure on Pyongyang to drop its nuclear weapons programme, officials said Monday,</p>
<p>A resolution says the leaders simply "noted the withdrawal of the DPRK (North Korea) from the NPT (Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty)", according to a final draft obtained by AFP.</p>
<p>An earlier draft "underlined the importance of the DPRK's participation in the NPT", but those words have been dropped following objections by North Korea.</p>
<p>The result is a compromise, as Pyongyang had orginally wanted a resolution blaming the United States for the nuclear crisis on the Korean Peninsula.</p>
