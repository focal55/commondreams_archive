<p>First it was chicken feed. Now it's wild seafood. For the second time 

in two months Congress has used maneuvers to make a major change in the 

nation's organic food standards.

<P>The latest change, proposed by Alaska Republican Sens. Ted Stevens and Lisa 

Murkowski to benefit Alaska's salmon fishermen, orders the federal government 

to find a way to certify wild seafood as organic.

<P>In a ploy that outraged organic advocates, the seafood amendment was tacked 

onto the hard-won repeal of the earlier change, which diluted feed 

requirements for organic chickens and livestock. Both were attached to the 

Iraq war spending bill that awaits President Bush's signature.

<P>"We've been working really hard on the repeal of this bogus livestock 

amendment, and we got that -- but in its place we got the fish provision we 

were opposed to," said Simon Harris, Bay Area spokesman for the Organic 

Consumers Association.

<P>The seafood amendment requires the U.S. Department of Agriculture to devise 

a plan to certify wild-caught fish and shellfish as organic.

<P>It has been sought for several years by Stevens and by California's 

fishing industry; both see the organic label as a potent marketing tool.

<P>The idea was turned down by the National Organic Standards Board, which 

helped write the standards that took effect last October.

<P>The organic standards are built around the idea that animals and produce 

are raised in closed systems where their foods and their access to any 

chemicals are controlled, explained James Riddle, board secretary. Wild fish 

don't fit that framework because there's no way to know what they've been 

eating or whether they've been swimming in pristine or polluted waters, he 

said.

<P>Stevens tried again during debate of last year's farm bill, and the fishing 

industry was granted the right to put "wild" on labels.

<P>Last week, with repeal of the organic feed provision on the line, Stevens, 

as chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, grabbed his opportunity and 

played hardball: no seafood amendment, no repeal.

<P>"I am delighted," said Zeke Grader, executive director of the Pacific Coast 

Federation of Fishermen's Associations in San Francisco. Under the organic 

standards, he said, "Farmed fish could potentially get an organic label but 

wild fish could not. I thought that was haywire."

<P>Grader doesn't think most wild fish would be able to win organic 

certification -- certainly not fish from the polluted Gulf of Mexico, or San 

Francisco Bay. But testing water and fish might allow some to qualify, he said.

<P>It will likely take several years for any new regulations to take effect.

<P>Opponents, who rose up en masse against the change in the organic feed 

provision, spoke out against the seafood law and looked for possible legal 

challenges, but didn't immediately mobilize for repeal.

<P>"When they come forth with a rule, then we'll get motivated again and have 

to beat the rule," said Troy Phillips, aide to Rep. Sam Farr, D-Santa Cruz, 

House leader of Congress' organic caucus.

<P>While celebrating the repeal of the chicken feed measure, organic activists 

said the seafood maneuver was another example of something they'd feared when 

the federal government got into organic regulation -- that politicians would 

change the standards to benefit special interests.

<P>"It's great news that the feed provision was repealed," said Bob Scowcroft 

of the Organic Farmers Research Foundation in Santa Cruz. "That said, it's 

another attempt to amend the Organic Food Act without a congressional hearing."

<P>He added, referring to the Georgia congressman who pushed through the 

feed change to benefit one chicken farmer in his district, "Do you think 

Stevens learned something from Nathan Deal?"</p>
