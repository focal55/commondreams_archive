<p>WASHINGTON  - A leading Republican senator on  Sunday called on the Bush administration to release most of the  classified portions of a congressional report on the Sept. 11  attacks, saying the sections were withheld only to avoid  harming relations with other countries.<P>

</table></font>Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama, who helped spearhead last  year's probe into the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, said the  administration wrongly blanked out 27 pages dealing with  suspected foreign support of those responsible for the attacks.<P>
"I think they're classified for the wrong reason," Shelby  said on NBC's Meet the Press program. "My judgment is 95  percent of that information should be declassified, become  uncensored, so the American people would know."<P>
Shelby said the section was classified because it "might be  embarrassing to some international relations."<P>
Shelby had said last week that he felt too much of the  report was classified, but had not been as critical of the  censorship as Democrats who said the Bush administration had  "an obsession with secrecy."<P>
Although congressional members have refused to name the  suspected country, uncensored portions of the report appeared  to point at Saudi Arabia.<P>
"When the Saudis are not helping us fight the war on  terrorism, when they're directly or indirectly financing that  war on terrorism, we have to hold them accountable," Sen.  Richard Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, said on CNN's Late  Edition.<P>
A Saudi official last week dismissed any implications in  the report of a Riyadh role in the Sept. 11 attacks as  motivated by political aspirations of Democrats in the next  election.<P>
The 900-page report released last week said intelligence  agencies missed opportunities to disrupt the Sept. 11 plot in  the months before the hijacked plane attacks.<P>
House Intelligence Committee Chairman Porter Goss, a  Florida Republican, defended the exclusion of portions of the  report, saying it could hinder current congressional  investigations on the attacks. Goss said on NBC's Meet The  Press he expected the pages to be made public after the  conclusion of the investigations.<P>
Sen. Bob Graham, who was involved in compiling the report,  said that a foreign government which he could not name for  legal reasons "provided logistical assistance to at least two  of the hijackers."<P>
"High officials in this government, who I assume were not  just rogue officials acting on their own, made substantial  contributions to the support and well-being of two of these  terrorists and facilitated their ability to plan, practice and  then execute the tragedy of September 11," Graham, a Florida  Democrat and a contender for president, said on the Fox News  Sunday program.<P>
The U.S. report raised suspicions but reached no definite  conclusion about whether Omar al-Bayoumi, a Saudi who knew two  of the Sept. 11 hijackers while living in San Diego, was  connected to the Saudi government.
