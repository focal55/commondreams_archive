Iraqis detained by U.S. troops accused their captors of torture and degrading treatment, rights group Amnesty International reported on July 23, 2003, calling on the occupying forces to bring human rights violators to justice. Detainees also said troops had shot some captives, the London-based rights watchdog reported, in a study based on interviews with former prisoners of U.S. forces across Iraq.

</table></font>Amnesty staff heard complaints that included prolonged  sleep deprivation and detainees being forced to stay in painful  positions or wear hoods over their heads for long periods.<P>
"Such treatment would amount to 'torture and inhumane  treatment' prohibited by the Fourth Geneva Convention and by  international human rights law," Amnesty said.<P>
U.S. military officials were not immediately available to  comment on the report.<P>
Amnesty staff gathered testimony from former detainees  around Iraq and from relatives of some still being held.<P>
The organization made several requests to visit detention  centers but were denied access by U.S. forces that have  struggled to impose law and order since the invasion which  toppled Saddam Hussein in April.<P>
"Detainees continue to report suffering extreme heat while  housed in tents; insufficient water; inadequate washing  facilities; open trenches for toilets; no change of clothes,  even after two months' detention," Amnesty said.<P>
Amnesty has said thousands are held in prisons run by U.S.  troops. They include Abu Ghraib, one the most feared jails  under Saddam, and Camp Cropper near Baghdad's airport.<P>
The human rights group said it had received several reports  of cases of detainees who have died in custody, "mostly as a  result of shooting by members of the coalition forces."<P>
Amnesty said 22-year-old Alaa Jassem was killed when  soldiers fired on detainees during a riot on June 13 at Abu  Ghraib. Demonstrators threw bricks and poles at the soldiers.<P>
"According to eyewitnesses, Alaa Jassem was in a tent when  he was shot. Seven other detainees were wounded," Amnesty said.<P>
Other allegations reported by Amnesty included the case of  Saadi al-Ubaydi on the morning of May 14, when two U.S. armed  vehicles crashed through the stone wall surrounding his home.<P>
"Several soldiers forced their way in and beat him with  their rifle butts. He ran out of the house to get away from  them. Soldiers shot him a few meters away and he died  immediately," the report said, citing witnesses in Ramadi.<P>
Many Iraqis complain troops use heavy-handed tactics that  humiliate householders when conducting weapons searches.<P>
"There continue to be many reports of members of the  coalition forces engaging in house searches and damaging or  destroying property without justification," Amnesty said.<P>
"There are also numerous reports of confiscation of  property, including large sums of money, upon arrest."
