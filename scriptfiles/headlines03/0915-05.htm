<p>MADRID   - A member of Iraq's Governing Council Monday accused U.S. troops of regularly mistreating Iraqi civilians so that the population had come to regard American forces as an army of occupation.

<p>"There is widespread discontent with the coalition forces, the majority of whom treat the Iraqi people with violence and contempt," Rajaa Habib Khuzai told a joint news conference with Spanish Foreign Minister Ana Palacio.

<p>"The opinion of the Iraqi people about the coalition forces is that they are forces of occupation," said Khuzai the head of a maternity hospital in the southern Iraqi city of Diwaniya and one of 13 Shi'ite Muslims on the 25-member council.

<p>Khuzai said the U.S.-backed Governing Council was in talks with coalition forces to transfer sovereignty to the Iraqi people, but no deadline had been established.

<p>Khuzai traveled to Spain ahead of a conference of international donors in Madrid next month which will examine projects for the mammoth task of rebuilding Iraq.

<p>Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar firmly supported the U.S.-led war which ousted Saddam. Spain has some 1,300 troops in Iraq compared with 155,000 U.S. soldiers.

<p>"Spanish troops treat (the Iraqi people) in a friendly way and not like occupation forces, as the Americans do," said Khuzai, who nevertheless expressed thanks to the U.S.-led force for "liberating" Iraq from the "dictatorship" of Saddam Hussein.

<p>The United States has lost 73 troops to hostile fire since the end of the major combat on May 1 amid growing Iraqi anger with civilian casualties.

<p>Hundreds of Iraqis chanting "America is the enemy of God" buried eight security guards at the weekend shot by U.S. troops who mistook them for anti-American guerrillas.

<p>But Khuzai denied there was widespread resistance to coalition forces in Iraq. Attacks on U.S. forces and oil installations were sabotage, not popular resistance, she said.

<p>"These are attacks carried out by the remains of Saddam Hussein's regime and some members of al Qaeda," said Khuzai, who studied and lived in Britain until she returned to Iraq in 1977.

<p>Khuzai singled out the bombing of the Baghdad U.N. compound last month which killed 23 people and a strike against a mosque in the southern city of Najaf which killed at least 83.

<p>"These incidents clearly point to al Qaeda more than resistance," she said.
