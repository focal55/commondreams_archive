<p>BAGHDAD -- The Kaiser style seems to work pretty well with the victims of bombs 

and missiles in Iraq -- at least for moral support.

<P>Dr. April Hurley, a family doctor for Kaiser Permanente in Santa Rosa, is 

spending much of her days and nights in the hospitals of Baghdad, where 

bleeding patients are cared for by harried Iraqi doctors and crowds of nervous 

relatives.

</table></font>Hurley's no-nonsense, just-the-facts manner, which would be familiar to 

countless Kaiser patients in Northern California, seems a bit bewildering to 

Sulav Jasem as the Iraqi woman explains the case of her 6-year-old daughter, 

Adara. The girl was severely burned on the face and back early Tuesday morning 

when their house collapsed during what they say was a U.S. missile and bomb 

attack on the western outskirts of Baghdad.

<P>"What happened then?" Hurley asks. "Where did you find her? What position 

was she in?"

<P>Jasem, cloaked in the black hijab shawl of conservative Muslim women, 

patiently fields Dr. Hurley's nonstop questions as a crowd of family members 

hovers over Adara's hospital bed.

<P>According to Jasem and others, a bomb hit their in-laws' house about 4:30 a.

m. Of the 11 people who were spending the night there -- several families who 

were huddling together for safety and solace amid the nightly bomb raids -- 

six were injured and five were killed. When frantic relatives clawed away the 

rubble, they found little Adara pinned under a smoldering sofa.

<P>As Dr. Hurley quizzes Jasem, the hospital room shudders with the dull 

thudding of U.S. missile and bomb impacts nearby. There is, of course, a real 

war outside, a huge power play between the world's superpower and a regime 

with few friends abroad. But Dr. Hurley is one of several hundred foreign 

activists, including a few dozen Americans, who have gathered in Baghdad to 

show their opposition to the war.

<P>Unlike most of the activists, who spend their time as "human shields" 

guarding power stations and other possible bomb targets, Dr. Hurley goes from 

hospital to hospital, interviewing bombing victims and jotting down details in 

a white notebook.

<P>She leans over Reem -- Jasem's sister-in-law, who is lying in a coma in a 

nearby bed -- and listens to the sounds emanating from the breathing tube. 

"Aargh, hunh hunh hunh," comes the rumbling moan.

<P>"Her breathing is very fast, but her sounds are good. Her sounds are really 

good," she tells Jasem through a translator.

<P>Hurley has been in Iraq since March 13 and plans to stay "for the duration,

" she says. She spends her days on a quixotic mission to help heal Iraqis 

through activism rather than traditional medicine. Iraqi doctors and hospital 

administrators have welcomed her, although they have kept her at arm's length.

<P>"Iraq has lots of doctors, so unless there's major bloodshed in the streets,

<P>I probably won't practice" medicine, Hurley says."There's not that much you 

can do when you're working as a doctor, because you're so busy and your time 

is so limited."

<P>Instead, Hurley hopes she can "get the story out" by e-mailing situation 

reports home, to be re-distributed.

<P>She doesn't worry much about what will happen after the war. "I think most 

of my private practice patients will wait for me," she says, "and I hope 

Kaiser will take me back."

<P>She worries more about the long-term psychological damage that the U.S. 

"shock and awe" campaign is producing among Iraqi youth.

<P>"I'm hearing about a lot of kids with irritability, sleeplessness, shaking,

" she says. "You can imagine what it's like being a kid, with the explosions 

we got last night."

<P>"A few days ago," she says, "I saw a man with multiple injuries who jumped 

up on a bed, yelling 'Don't touch me, I'll kill you! I want to fight the 

Americans!' He had lost his brain."

<P>Sometimes she encounters frustrations. On Tuesday night, for example, she 

spent about a half-hour trying to persuade the director of Jasem's hospital, 

Hussein Ali, to accept a truckload of medicine coming in next week. Very 

politely, Ali refused.

<P>Like most Iraqi doctors, Ali speaks passable English, but he misinterpreted 

Hurley's comments and thought she was suggesting that he accept a cargo truck 

of U.S. material.

<P>"We don't want occupation things," said Ali. "Thank you very much."

<P>Hurley finally resorted to handing out a large bag of colored pens and 

watercolor paints that she had brought with her.

<P>The parents of the young children in the ward seemed grateful. They grabbed 

the gifts and set them aside. Then they went back to their tearful vigils 

beside their relatives.</p>
