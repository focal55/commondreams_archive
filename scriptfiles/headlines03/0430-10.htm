<p>The American military was accused yesterday of doing nothing to prevent the mass smuggling of Iraq's antiquities – three weeks after the country's museums were ransacked.

<p>Dr Donny George, the Iraq Museum's head of research, said at the British Museum: "Anyone can take anything and go out of the country. It's a tragedy.'' Border checks were only being made on its western frontier by Jordanian police, he said.

<p>Dr George and his colleague at the British Museum, Dr John Curtis, said thousands of objects were now thought to have been looted from the Iraq Museum – one of the most important museum collections in the world.
<p>Among them is the Warka Vase from Uruk – a large limestone vessel decorated with a relief of ancient religious rites that dates from 3,100BC.
<p>Also lost is the spectacular gold covering of an ancient lyre from the Sumerian city of Ur; a headless, inscribed statue of King Entemena of Lagash, dating from 2,400BC, and an ivory carving of a lion attacking a Nubian, made in around 800BC, from Nimrud.
<p>A Roman statue from the time of the Emperor Trajan, and a marble statue of the Greek god Poseidon, from AD160, are also on the missing list.
<p>Later today, Koichiro Matsuura, the director general of Unesco, is due to meet Kofi Annan, the UN secretary general, in New York to ensure that the UN Security Council passes a resolution banning the export of antiquities from Iraq. This would massively bolster existing conventions protecting cultural heritage, which have not yet been ratified by America and some other countries.
<p>A full inventory of the damage will not be completed for months. After appeals by clerics, some objects are now being returned and there is a local amnesty to encourage looters to return items.
