<p>WASHINGTON, Nov. 5 &#0151; President Bush signed legislation on Wednesday to outlaw the procedure whose opponents call it partial-birth abortion. The president said the nation "owes its children a different and better welcome."</p>

Surrounded by cheering foes of abortion who gave the ceremony the air of a presidential pep rally, Mr. Bush engaged in the final act of a long fight to prohibit  the  procedure, described by its opponents as morally odious. The measure he signed  provides for the first ban on a specific abortion procedure since the Supreme Court ruling in Roe v. Wade, 30 years ago, gave women a  right to terminate their pregnancies.
<P>
Soon after the signing ceremony, however, a federal district judge in Lincoln, Neb., barred the government, at least temporarily, from enforcing the new law, though he limited his order so that it applied only to the four doctors who had brought a lawsuit before his court challenging the legislation's constitutionality.</p>
<P>
The judge, Richard G. Kopf, said the law appeared to be unconstitutional because it did not provide an exception for the preservation of the health of a pregnant woman. That was  the main issue on which a similar Nebraska state law was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 2000.</p>
<P>
Federal judges in New York and San Francisco were considering other  requests to block enforcement of the new law, on a day in which both sides in the debate over abortion split their attention between the political and judicial arenas.</p>
<P>
At the signing ceremony, several blocks from the White House in an office building named for a longtime abortion foe, President Ronald Reagan, Mr. Bush used emotional language to cast the procedure at issue as "troubling and tragic,"  rousing a crowd of more than 400 invited supporters to standing ovations.</p>
<P>
Before calling onto the stage with him the bill's main Congressional supporters, all men,  he vowed to fight court challenges and promote a "culture of life" defined by the protection of vulnerable children.</p>
<P>
"For years, a terrible form of violence has been directed against children who are inches from birth, while the law looked the other way," Mr. Bush said. "Today, at last, the American people and our government have confronted the violence and come to the defense of the innocent child."</p>
<P>
The ceremony was a moment of substantial victory for abortion opponents, who had seen similar bills twice pass Congress during the 1990's and then be vetoed by President Bill Clinton. In a sense, Mr. Bush's signing  was an ideological and emotional bookend to a veto ceremony in April 1996. On that occasion,  Mr. Clinton brought to the Roosevelt Room in the White House five women who had undergone the type of abortion in dispute and who spoke tearfully of the agonizing decisions they had faced in dealing with disorders that had threatened them and their fetuses.</p>
<P>
The law applies to a type of abortion, known medically as intact dilation and extraction, used to terminate pregnancies in the second or third trimester. Abortion opponents say  the procedure typically calls for the lower part of the fetus's body to be delivered, the head to be punctured and a dead but intact fetus to be delivered. It is rarely used, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.</p>
<P>
But it has become the focal point of a political, legal, medical and cultural dispute as intense as any in American public life. Anti-abortion groups see it as a particularly brutal procedure akin to infanticide, and some  describe the attack on it as a vehicle through which to challenge the broader right to abortion set out by the Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade.</p>
<P>
Abortion rights supporters say that the procedure can be justified as a means of protecting a  woman's health, among other reasons, and agree that banning it would be just the start of an effort to roll back the right of a woman to choose how to handle a pregnancy.</p>
<P>
The bill  won final Congressional approval last month on a 64-to-34 vote in the Senate. Seventeen Democrats voted in favor, giving the legislation a bipartisan cast that has been rare in votes involving abortion.</p>
<P>
But many Democrats attacked  Mr. Bush on Wednesday for signing the bill. Representative Louise M. Slaughter, Democrat of New York, called the legislation "an affront to American women and this nation's Constitution." The office of Representative Robert Wexler, Democrat of Florida, issued a statement saying he had "expressed his contempt" for Mr. Bush on the issue. </p>
<P>
One doctor, Howard Dean, the former Vermont governor running for the Democratic presidential nomination, said he was "outraged that President Bush has decided that he is qualified to practice medicine."</p>
<P>
Supporters of abortion rights said they were confident that the law would be ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court because, they said, it is so similar to the Nebraska law struck down by the court in 2000.</p>
<P>
But they said they were dismayed that the initial ruling in Nebraska by Judge Kopf was worded to apply only to the four doctors who had brought a  case there. They said they were hopeful that federal courts in New York and San Francisco would block the law's enactment nationwide.</p>
<P>
"This is a very serious and decisive moment," said Kate Michelman, president of Naral Pro-Choice America.</p>
<P>
Ms. Michelman said she was confident that the Supreme Court as currently constituted would strike down the law. But she said it was possible that it would take long enough for the case to reach the justices  that a vacancy could occur on the court, giving Mr. Bush, especially if re-elected,  an opportunity to tilt the balance against abortion rights by  nominating a successor open to revisiting Roe v. Wade.</p>
<P>
"Our message is that elections matter," Ms. Michelman said.</p>
<P>
Opponents of abortion said the process of getting the legislation passed and signed into law had been as valuable in educating the American people about abortion as in actually prohibiting the specific procedure. Some said they intended to push forward with other legislation to whittle away at abortion rights, including bills that would make it a federal crime to kill or harm a fetus.</p>
<P>
But a more intense focus on abortion could create political complications for Mr. Bush. Although he is an opponent of abortion,  he is also mindful that two groups he needs for re-election &#0151; moderate Republicans and swing voters, especially suburban women &#0151; tend to support abortion rights.</p>
