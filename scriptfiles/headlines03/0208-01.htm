<p>WILLIAMSBURG, Va.   - U.N. Secretary-General Kofi  Annan warned the United States on Saturday against making war  on Iraq on its own, arguing collective action under a U.N.  umbrella would have greater legitimacy and better odds of  success.<p>



		In an address marking the 310th anniversary of William and  Mary College, Annan also stressed that force should be used  only as a last resort.<p>



		But if the U.N. Security Council concludes, after a key  report by U.N. inspectors due on Friday, that Iraq is not  disarming as required by a string of resolutions, "the council  must face up to its responsibilities," he said in prepared  remarks.<p>



		"When there is strong U.N. leadership, exercised through  patient diplomatic persuasion and coalition-building, the  United Nations is successful. The United Nations is most  successful to all its members, including the United States,  when it is united and works as a source of collective action  rather than discord," he said.<p>



		"The broader our consensus on Iraq, the better the chance  that we can come together and deal effectively with other  burning conflicts in the world, which cause untold suffering  and which urgently need our attention: From Israel and  Palestine to Congo and Cote d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast), not to  mention our efforts to stabilize Afghanistan," he said.<p>



		President Bush has warned Baghdad that time is running out  for it to disarm on its own and is sending troops and equipment  to the region in preparation for a possible war.<p>



		The U.S. administration has argued it needs no further  action by the Security Council to disarm Iraq by force under  Resolution 1441 adopted on Nov. 8 and other earlier  resolutions.<p>



		But Bush has left open the door to an additional council  measure authorizing military action, although it is far from  clear at this time that such a measure could garner the  necessary nine votes and no vetoes in the 15-nation council to  be adopted.<p>



		France, in particular, has warned repeatedly that force  should be used only after all possibilities for a peaceful  resolution of the crisis have been exhausted, and has made  clear its view that that point has not yet been reached.<p>



		Annan warned that war "is always a human catastrophe" and  said the entire international community -- including "first and  foremost the leaders of Iraq itself -- have a duty to prevent  this if we possibly can."<p>



		While Iraq has not yet satisfied the Security Council that  it has fully rid itself of any weapons of mass destruction,  "this is an issue not for any one state, but for the  international community as a whole," he said in a clear  reference to Washington.<p>



		"When states decide to use force, not in self-defense but  to deal with broader threats to international peace and  security, there is no substitute for the unique legitimacy  provided by the United Nations Security Council," Annan said.<p>



		"States and people around the world attach fundamental  importance to such legitimacy, and to the international rule of  law," he said.<p>



		Annan said Secretary of State Colin Powell had made a  "strong" presentation to the council last Wednesday on Iraqi  arms programs that had "undoubtedly strengthened" the hand of  chief inspectors Hans Blix and Mohamed ElBaradei as they once  again this weekend pressed Baghdad to more fully cooperate with  their efforts.<p>



		But if Iraq "fails to make use of this last chance, and  continues its defiance, the council ... must face up to its  responsibilities," he said.<p>



		"Our (U.N.) founders were not pacifists. They knew there  would be times when force must be met by force," he said,   expressing the hope that the council would act in a united  fashion so as to maximize its credibility and effectiveness.
