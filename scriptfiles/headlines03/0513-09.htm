<p>A television commercial opposing tax cuts sought by President Bush won't be seen on Cox cable in Phoenix because it is either "in poor taste" or is "too controversial."

</table>The 30-second spot was playing Monday in 20 markets across the country, but was rejected locally by Cox Communications and by another cable provider in Tampa, its producer said.

<p>The ad is <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views03/0422-11.htm">a re-enactment of 50 parents</a> lining up a month ago in Eugene, Ore., to sell blood plasma to help pay a teacher's salary. 

<p>"George Bush's tax cuts for the rich" are to blame for shortfalls in education funding, the commercial contends. Further cuts sought by Bush to create jobs and boost the economy are being debated in the U.S. Senate.

<p>At the Zimmerman & Markman ad agency in Santa Monica, Calif., executive assistant Lanicia Shaw said the spot, produced for an online political activist group, was scheduled to air on cable systems in 23 cities about 10 times a day all week.

<p>The sponsor, <a href="http://www.MoveOn.org" target="_new">MoveOn.org</a>, paid $104,000 for the campaign, of which $8,000 would have gone to Cox in Phoenix, Shaw said.

<p>Phoenix and Tampa rejected the ad outright, saying only that it was "too controversial," Shaw said. 

<p>The Cox system in Las Vegas is wavering on what to do, she said.

<p>In Phoenix, Cox spokeswoman Andrea Katsenes said the ad was turned down because it was "in poor taste." She would not elaborate on what the company found wrong.

<p>MoveOn.org could not be reached for comment. <a href="http://www.fairtaxesforall.org/" target="_new">Fair Taxes for All</a>, another national organization fighting the tax plan, issued statements decrying the rejection as censorship of free speech.

<p>Bush proposed a $726 billion tax cut over 10 years, and the House has approved $550 billion in cuts. The Senate this week is debating a $350 billion plan.
