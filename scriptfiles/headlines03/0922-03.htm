<p>Carpinteria, Santa Barbara County  --
Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger was dogged by persistent protesters 
and hecklers Sunday, as he tried to seize the environmental mantle, proposing 
a $60 million "hydrogen highway" he said would provide a statewide chain of 
hydrogen fueling stations to help clean the air.
<P>"As governor, I will create a network of . . . clean hydrogen fueling 
stations every 20 miles," said Schwarzenegger, who provided few specifics on 
paying for such a plan.

      'HE'S A REAL HUMMER DINGER'<br>

  </table></font>"These hydrogen highways funded by private-public partnerships will allow 
car manufacturers to make good on their pledge to deliver hundreds of 
thousands of clean hydrogen cars on the California roads before the end of the 
decade," the actor said.
<P>But Schwarzenegger's speech was continually interrupted by hecklers at the 
coastal site near Santa Barbara, where demonstrators carried signs reading 
"Vote oui on no recall" -- a reference to a racy interview Schwarzenegger gave 
more than 25 years ago with Oui men's magazine -- and "He's a real hummer 
dinger," a reference to Schwarzenegger's stable of Hummer vehicles.
<P>The protesters arrived early and stationed themselves behind the stage, 
forcing the candidate's staff to hastily camouflage their presence with a 
large backdrop reading "Join Arnold."
<P><b>ONE ARREST</b>
<P>Police later made one arrest after a scuffle when one of the actor's 
supporters attempted to take a bullhorn away from Medea Benjamin, a San 
Francisco-based Green Party activist who led the protest.
<P>The event handed environmental protesters a chance to assail the record of 
the actor-turned-candidate, who arrived in a large SUV, a GMC Yukon.
<P>"You just don't wake up one morning and decide you're an 
environmentalist," said Pedro Nava of the California League of Conservation 
Voters, pointing toward Schwarzenegger's role in promoting the Hummer -- the 
behemoth military vehicle which is one of the least fuel-efficient cars on the 
road.
<P>"I say nice try, Arnold, but no cigar," said Nava, who also is a member of 
the California Coastal Commission.
<P>Polls show that year after year California voters of all political 
persuasions list environmental protection as among their most important issues.
<P>So it is no surprise that Schwarzenegger, who has cast his candidacy as 
conservative on fiscal issues but moderate on social policy, would attempt to 
court voters in the recall election against Gov. Gray Davis with environmental 
policy plans.
<P><b>'ANOTHER STAGE SET'</b>
<P>But Nava said Sunday's proposal failed to recognize that hydrogen 
technology is years, if not decades, away from widespread use.
<P>"This is another stage set for Arnold to deliver rehearsed lines," Nava 
said.
<P>Indeed, during his appearance, Schwarzenegger stuck faithfully to a draft 
copy of the speech obtained by reporters -- which also indicated specific cues 
for the actor. "Behind me (point to the offshore wells) is the past," the 
script said. "In front of us (point to cars) is the future."
<P>But longtime GOP fund-raiser Bob Grady, a managing director of the Carlyle 
Group, said that as an environmental adviser to Schwarzenegger he is convinced 
of the actor's credentials.
<P>"I want a governor, someone who will fight oil drilling and ocean pollution,
" he told the crowd. "Green Republicans have a new champion, and that man is 
Arnold Schwarzenegger."
<P>But speaking later to reporters, the actor could provide few details about 
his hydrogen fuel program -- except to say that 95 percent of the money would 
come from the federal government.
<P>Asked how he could boast of being an environmental advocate when he owns 
five Hummers, Schwarzenegger instead took credit for the vehicle's popularity.
<P>"Eleven years ago, I took the military Hummer and I wanted to prove you 
could turn it into a civilian Hummer. . . . Now, as you know, it's the most 
popular SUV."
<P>As to his new interest in hydrogen-fueled vehicles, Schwarzenegger said his 
advisers told him only four weeks ago about efforts to convert vehicles, 
including Hummers, from standard gasoline to hydrogen fuel.
<P>"The things I've learned in this last month running for office have been 
spectacular," he said.
<P><b>CRITICISM FOR DAVIS</b>
<P>Schwarzenegger criticized Davis' environmental record, saying, "Gray Davis 
has just starting talking about the environment the last few days."
<P>But asked about legislation Davis has signed, including a bill that made 
California the first state to ban greenhouse gases, Schwarzenegger responded 
"I'm not aware of all those bills he has signed."
<P>And Davis' spokesman, Gabriel Sanchez, said Schwarzenegger's environmental 
platform, as posted on the Republican candidate's Web site, mirrors the 
governor's programs in such areas as reducing energy consumption and 
protecting parks and open space.
<P>"If you look at his environmental plan, imitation is the sincerest form of 
flattery," Sanchez said.</p>
