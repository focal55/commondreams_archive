<p>RENO, Nev.  -
Nevada peace activists are marking the anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks with a plea to remember the victims of subsequent U.S. retaliatory actions as well.
<p>
About two dozen people gathered at the federal courthouse Wednesday night for a candlelight vigil organized by leaders of the Reno Anti-War Coalition in memory of both U.S. and foreign victims killed at home and abroad.
<p>
"We don't want to see anyone die, no matter what country they live in. We think all life is sacred," said Stewart Stout, a member of the coalition.
<p>
"It is just as awful when thousands of Afghans die or thousands of Iraqis die as when thousands of Americans were killed on September 11th," he said in an interview Wednesday night.
<p>
"The Afghan civilians killed were just as innocent as the civilians in New York," he said.
<p>
A few young children and a dog were in the group of two dozen that carried flashlights and candles in glass jars on a six-block walk from the courthouse just south of Reno's casino district to a brick plaza along the Truckee River about 8 p.m. Wednesday.
<p>
"I wanted to come out and pay my respects for the people who died on 9-11 and the people who have since died because of it," said Micki Lewis of Reno, who brought along her son, Hunter, 3.
<p>
"If we want to be the leaders for peace in the world, we should practice what we preach," she said.
<p>
Many of the participants were members of the coalition, but some were not.
<p>
"I'm not taking no sides," said Marie Fetterman of Reno, who showed up in a red sweater with red, white and blue beads around her neck, wearing a "God Bless America" button and clutching a small cloth and larger plastic American flag.
<p>
"I'm here for all the people of New York,' she said.
<p>
"My best friend's niece was there (in the World Trade Center) when it happened and she made it out alive. I'm here for her and everybody else," she said.
<p>
At the riverfront plaza, the participants formed a circular peace sign as an expression of solidarity with the New York-based "September 11 Families for Peaceful Tomorrows," a coalition of family members of victims of the terrorist attacks who have been critical of the U.S. military response.
<p>
Stout read from a statement the New York group posted on its Web site. It said "much about the U.S. government's approach to responding to our loved' ones deaths stands in stark contrast to the common sense words and comforting actions of ordinary people."
<p>
"On this two-year anniversary, we stop to reflect on the dangerous course of current policies and to call for a new approach to 9/11 that is focused on bringing about true security and justice," the group said.
<p>
Stout said he agrees with the group's statement. He said the U.S. "war on terrorism doesn't seem to be working.
<p>
"All I can see that has happened is more people have died and there is more hatred toward the United States," Stout said.
<p>
"We have fueled the flames of hatred and created more death and destruction," he said.
<p>
To the contrary, Rep. Jim Gibbons, R-Nev., intends to release a report on Thursday that shows the United States is "a safer place two years later," his spokeswoman Amy Spanbauer said Wednesday night.
<p>
"September 11th will be remembered for the devastating, heinous and senseless attacks on the World Trade Center and the plane that went down in Pennsylvania and the attack on the Pentagon. It's what launched the war on terrorism that we are still in," she said from Washington.
<p>
"The lives lost in the war on terrorism are in defense of those lives lost on Sept. 11, 2001," she said. "We didn't ask for the war."
<p>
The New York-based group said that a year ago at this time, President Bush used the one-year commemoration of their loved ones' deaths "to begin a marketing campaign to sell the war against Iraq. ...
<p>
"Today we pause to mourn the Iraqi dead and all the casualties of the war and to call upon our leaders to bring our troops, who have put their lives on the line, safely home from this misguided mission and to turn control of Iraq's rebuilding to the authority of the United States. ...
<p>
"As grieving family members we know that feelings of fear and anger are a natural part of the healing process. But we have learned that it is not healthy or constructive to act on these emotions."
