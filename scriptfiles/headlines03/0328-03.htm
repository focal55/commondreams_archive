<p>The United Nations will refuse to play a "subservient" role or act as

a "subcontractor" to the United States in the reconstruction of Iraq,

its development chief has warned. <P>Mark Malloch Brown, administrator of the UN development

program, told the Guardian that rebuilding contracts already

announced by the Bush administration were only "a Band-Aid on

services knocked out in the conflict".<P>Speaking before Tony Blair's trip to Camp David, Mr Malloch Brown

said the UN had a clear obligation to carry out humanitarian work in

the immediate aftermath of conflict.<P>But in the long term, "if they want the UN in there - the UN role in

civil administration, in the political processes managing the

transition", then "we can't go in there playing some subordinate role

to a US redevelopment which somehow suggests we are a

subcontractor to that US-led effort.<P>"The Geneva conventions will require that our relations with the

occupying power are not subservient ones ... We have pretty

well-developed plans, but I am not going to take them out of the

drawer until there is a security council resolution. We are not a US

or British NGO who can be asked by the government to take on a

reconstruction role."<P>Mr Malloch Brown said the UK had assured him that "it is the devout

hope of the British government that the peace will be managed by a

much broader coalition" than the war. "But were you today to ask

most people in Washington, 'Is that the way you expect things to turn

out?' I think the answer would be no. There may be many in

Washington who may think this is a war they run, and they should

run the peace. And for us, so be it."<P>USAID, the American government agency coordinating redevelopment,

has been under fire for awarding the first reconstruction contracts

to US firms, and for budgeting only $50m (£31m) so far to aid

agencies. On Wednesday, USAID announced that $1.9bn in

reconstruction contracts would go to US companies.

<P>But, Mr Malloch Brown said, "that is such a downpayment of the

total volume of resources the US and others are going to have to put

up, that I am not construing too much from it. I don't think it is a

sustainable formula for the long-term reconstruction of the

country."<P>He scoffed at the notion that a major overhaul of Iraq's

infrastructure could be achieved within a year of the end of the war

- apparently USAID's view, according to a document leaked to the

Wall Street Journal last week.

<P>"The view that nation building can be measured by the timeline of a

road building contract is misplaced," he said.</p>
