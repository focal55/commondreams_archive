<p>LONDON - President Bush may be subjected to the  humiliating sight of an effigy of himself being dragged to the  ground by anti-war protesters in London's Trafalgar Square next  week.
<p> 
			
							But if police and White House officials have their way, the  president, who had the staunch support of Britain's Prime  Minister during the Iraq war, will be spared the embarrassment  of seeing a re-run of the toppling of Saddam Hussein's statue  during the Iraq war.<p> 
			
							British police refuse comment on media reports of demands  by White House security staff for vast central London exclusion  zones for Bush's trip, which starts next Wednesday and will be  the first official visit to Britain by an American president  since that of Ronald Reagan in 1982.<p>

  </table></font>But they are well aware that at the height of the global  war on terror, the prospect of having Bush, Prime Minister Tony  Blair and Queen Elizabeth in the same place at the same time  presents a tempting target for would-be attackers.<p> 
			
							With all police leave canceled, up to 100,000 protesters  vowing to take to the streets and Blair himself trying to quash  anti-Bush rhetoric, London's Metropolitan police commissioner  admits the visit presents an "unprecedented" challenge.<p> 
			
							"It's going to be a big test for the Met in terms of what  we have to do to prevent an attack on the president, any member  of the royal family and any member of the cabinet," said a  spokeswoman for Scotland Yard police headquarters.<p> 
			
							"We have to balance preventative measures with allowing  people to demonstrate in a peaceful manner."<p> 
			
							Blair used a keynote foreign policy speech on Monday to  urge protesters to see both sides of the argument over Iraq.<p> 
			
							"Protest if you will. That is your democratic right," he  said. "Attack the decision to go to war, but have the integrity  to realize that without it, those Iraqis now tasting freedom  would still be under the lash of Saddam Hussein."<p> 
			
							"MOST UNWELCOME GUEST"<p> 
			
							But anti-Bush and anti-war campaigners are furious at what  they fear are police plans to stop their protest -- slated for  November 20 -- from marching through Whitehall and Parliament  Square, the seat of Britain's government.<p> 
			
							"It is an outrage that the most unwelcome guest this  country has ever received will be given the freedom of the  streets while a movement that represents majority opinion is  denied the right to protest in...the heart of government," said  Lindsey German, a spokeswoman for the Stop the War Coalition.<p> 
			
							"It's completely unacceptable. I don't see why the White  House should be able to determine how, where and when people  protest in this country."<p> 
			
							A poll in Tuesday's Times newspaper showed 60 percent of  British voters strongly disapprove of Bush's handling of Iraq  -- and that anti-Bush feeling is particularly high among women.<p> 
			
							The spectacle of Bush arriving with an entourage of up to  250 secret service agents, 15 sniffer dogs and handlers, 50  White House political aides, two motorcades of up to 20 armored  vehicles each, as well as at least three aircraft and even his  own personal cook, is unlikely to increase warmth toward him.<p> 
			
							Police are torn between allowing large and potentially  embarrassing protests to go ahead, and clamping down on  protestors and risking a backlash.<p> 
			
							They had to apologize for their tactics during Chinese  President Jiang Zemin's visit in 1999 when police forced back  pro-Tibet protestors and confiscated banners and flags.<p> 
			
							Media reports say officers policing the Bush visit have  been warned not to be heavy handed and allow protesters to  voice their opinion of Bush with slogans and chants if they  want to.<p> 
			
							Protesters say they are in constant dialogue with police,  but also say Blair's government must reap what it has sown.<p> 
			
							"There wouldn't be a problem if they hadn't invited George  Bush -- who must be one of the most unpopular people in this  country -- on a state visit," said German. "Now they are going  to have to face the consequences."
