<p>Veteran media mogul and legendary deal-maker Rupert Murdoch prompted laughter from senators in Washington yesterday when he said that he did not plan to take advantage of the upcoming relaxation in America media ownership laws. 
<P>The 72-year-old News Corp chief was seeking to reassure a senate committee that his deal to take control of satellite network DirecTV would not harm competition. <P>The federal communications commission votes on June 2 and is expected to approve plans to allow media giants including News Corp, AOL Time Warner and Viacom to own more TV stations in local markets and allow more combinations of local newspapers, radio stations and TV in the same market. <P>But Mr Murdoch said that, apart from the £4.1bn bid for satellite broadcaster DirecTV for which News Corp is currently seeking regulatory approval, he had no plans for further expansion. <P>"I have no plans for anything other than what I have before you today," he said, prompting laughter in the senator benches.<P>Mr Murdoch, who earlier this month appeared before the FCC committee investigating the proposed purchase of DirecTV, also used the opportunity once more to  try to convince senators to allow the deal to proceed. <P>"This acquisition has the potential to profoundly change the multi-channel video marketplace in the US to the ultimate benefit of all pay-TV customers. There will be no decrease in the number of US competitors," he said. <P>The FCC last year blocked a deal between Charlie Ergen's Echostar and DirecTV but Mr Murdoch argues that there is no comparison between the two deals because News Corp does not already own a satellite broadcaster in the US. <P>He has also promised to sign up to stringent undertakings that DirecTV will not restrict the supply of News Corp networks such as Fox News to other satellite and cable companies and will provide open access to competitors on the DirecTV line-up. <P>In the hearing last month, Mr Murdoch said he planned to model DirecTV on the success of SkyDigital in the UK. "News Corp will bring a wealth of innovation to Hughes and DirecTV from its British direct to home platform BSkyB," he said. <P>But consumer groups and bodies of musicians, film makers and writers are putting pressure on the FCC to block the deal and also resist the relaxation of ownership laws, arguing that too much media power already lies in too few hands. <P>"Mr Murdoch owns a programming juggernaut," Gene Kimmelman, the public policy director for the Consumers Union, told the committee. <P>If News Corp was able to complete the DirecTV deal, it would "threaten to seriously harm meaningful competition between media companies," he added.</p>
