<p>DEARBORN, Mich. - Democratic presidential hopeful Howard Dean  received a standing ovation from an Arab-American
audience on Saturday when he attacked leading conservatives and
figures from the religious right.

  </table></font>Dean, one of seven Democratic presidential candidates to
address the Arab American Institute's national leadership
conference in Dearborn, pointed to an American flag and named
some of the people he said it did not belong to.
<p>
 "It does not belong to General Boykin, or John Ashcroft, or
Rush Limbaugh or Jerry Falwell or Pat Robertson," the former
Vermont governor said to cheers in the packed hotel conference
room in the Detroit suburb which is home to one of the highest
concentrations of Muslims and Arabs outside the Middle East.
<p>
 "This flag belongs to every single American, including
every single American in this room, and is the hope and
aspiration for many other folks who are not yet citizens," he
said.
<p>
 The message was warmly received by the crowd of about 300
as Dean named Ashcroft, the U.S. Attorney General and a
prominent spokesmen for America's conservative or religious
right, along with Army Lt. Gen. William Boykin, the senior
Pentagon intelligence official who has told Christian
gatherings that Muslims worship an "idol."
<p>
 His speech was repeatedly interrupted by applause as he
condemned violations of civil liberties, racial profiling and
abuse of authority under the USA Patriot Act, the anti-terror
legislation championed by Ashcroft that passed after the Sept.
11 attacks.
<p>
 Hundreds of Muslims and Arabs were detained in roundups
after the attacks and Dean said the detentions and deportations
of an untold number of immigrants based on secret evidence were
unlawful and should be repealed.
<p>
 "Today we see another shameful chapter in American history.
Because John Ashcroft touts the Patriot Act around this country
does not make John Ashcroft a patriot," he said.
<p>
 "The war on terror cannot become a war on civil rights and
freedoms. We should not have to chose between securing our
homeland and securing the blessings of liberty. We can have
both, otherwise the terrorists have won and we will not permit
that."
<p>
 Dean also won applause by reiterating his recent promises
to send former President Bill Clinton  to the Middle East as his
peace broker if he is elected next year.
