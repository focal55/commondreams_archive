<p>JERUSALEM  - Israel responded defiantly on  Thursday to unusually sharp criticism by President Bush of a  barrier it is building through Palestinian areas in the West  Bank.<p> 
			
							Israeli Vice Premier Ehud Olmert said the barrier, a  measure Israel contends is necessary to stop suicide bombers  and which the Palestinians condemn as a land grab, would remain  an option.<p> 
			
							"Israel will always have the right to take unilateral steps  for separation from the Palestinians through a fence or other  means," Olmert told Israel Radio.<p>

  </table></font>In a speech in London on Wednesday, Bush toughened his  stance over the barrier, saying Israel must not prejudice final  peace negotiations "with the placement of walls and fences."<p> 
			
							Further diplomatic pressure on Israel came from the U.N.  Security Council, which voted unanimously for a Russian-drafted  resolution supporting a Middle East peace plan known as the  "road map."<p> 
			
							Israel had opposed the resolution, wanting no U.N. role in  peacemaking since it sees the world body as pro-Palestinian.<p> 
			
							"Judgment regarding the plan's implementation will be in  the hands of the United States," Israeli Prime Minister Ariel  Sharon's office said in a statement. "Israel will not accept  any other intervention in the implementation of the plan."<p> 
			
							The United States is the chief sponsor of the road map,  which lays out steps Israel and the Palestinians should take  toward setting up a Palestinian state by 2005.<p> 
			
							Underscoring Israeli rejection of the U.N. resolution,  Sharon said in a speech in Tel Aviv that Israel was committed  to the road map "that President Bush presented."<p> 
			
							"In addition to this, we do not rule out unilateral steps,"  he said in apparent reference to the West Bank barrier.<p> 
			
							GAZA TRUCE TALKS<p> 
			
							Egyptian mediators in Gaza held a second day of talks with  Palestinian militants on a truce with Israel that could shore  up the road map, which has been stalled by persistent violence.<p> 
			
							Sharon and Palestinian Prime Minister Ahmed Qurie are  expected to meet next week for the first time since the new  Palestinian government was installed on November 12.<p> 
			
							After meeting Qurie and Egyptian mediators in Gaza on  Wednesday, the main Palestinian militant factions said they had  agreed in principle to talks in Cairo early next month on a  truce with Israel.<p> 
			
							Hamas and Islamic Jihad, both committed to Israel's  destruction, said Egypt had proposed talks on December 2.  Arafat's Fatah faction would also attend.<p> 
			
							Qurie also hopes to win Israeli agreement to a truce and  move beyond a unilateral cease-fire that militants declared in  June and which collapsed in a spate of violence two months  later.<p> 
			
							Israel rules out any formal truce with Islamic militants  but has said it will suspend a campaign to capture or kill  their leaders if attacks against Israelis cease.<p>
