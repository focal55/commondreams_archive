<p>WASHINGTON -- U.S. troops in Iraq suffered through months of unnecessarily 
              poor living conditions because some civilian contractors hired by 
              the Army for logistics support failed to show up, Army officers 
              said.
<p>
              Months after American combat troops settled into occupation duty, 
              they were camped out in primitive, dust-blown shelters without windows 
              or air conditioning. The Army has invested heavily in modular barracks, 
              showers, bathroom facilities and field kitchens, but troops in Iraq 
              were using ramshackle plywood latrines and living without fresh 
              food or regular access to showers and telephones.
<p>
              Even mail delivery -- also managed by civilian contractors -- fell 
              weeks behind.
<p>
              Though conditions have improved, the problems raise new concerns 
              about the Pentagon's growing global reliance on defense contractors 
              for everything from laundry service to combat training and aircraft 
              maintenance. Civilians help operate Navy Aegis cruisers and Global 
              Hawk, the high-tech robot spy plane.
<p>
              Civilian contractors may work well enough in peacetime, critics 
              say. But what about in a crisis?
<p>
              &quot;We thought we could depend on industry to perform these kinds 
              of functions,&quot; Lt. Gen. Charles S. Mahan, the Army's logistics 
              chief, said in an interview.
<p>
              One thing became clear in Iraq. &quot;You cannot order civilians 
              into a war zone,&quot; said Linda K. Theis, an official at the Army's 
              Field Support Command, which oversees some civilian logistics contracts. 
              &quot;People can sign up to that -- but they can also back out.&quot;
<p>
              As a result, soldiers lived in the mud, then the heat and dust. 
              Back home, a group of mothers organized a drive to buy and ship 
              air conditioners to their sons. One Army captain asked a reporter 
              to send a box of nails and screws to repair his living quarters 
              and latrines.
<p>
              For almost a decade, the military has been shifting its supply and 
              support personnel into combat jobs and hiring defense contractors 
              to do the rest. This shift has accelerated under relentless pressure 
              from Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld to make the force lighter 
              and more agile.
<p>
              &quot;It's a profound change in the way the military operates,&quot; 
              said Peter W. Singer, author of a new book, &quot;Corporate Warriors,&quot; 
              a detailed study of civilian contractors. He estimates that over 
              the past decade, there has been a ten-fold increase in the number 
              of contract civilians performing work the military used to do itself.
<p>
              &quot;When you turn these services over to the private market, you 
              lose a measure of control over them,&quot; said Singer, a foreign 
              policy researcher at the Brookings Institution, a think tank in 
              Washington.
<p>
              Replacing 1,100 Marine cooks with civilians, as the Corps did two 
              years ago, might make short-term economic sense.
<p>
              But cooks might be needed as riflemen -- as they were during the 
              desperate Battle of the Bulge in December 1944. And untrained civilians 
              &quot;can walk off the job any time they want, and the only thing 
              the military can do is sue them later on,&quot; Singer said.
<p>
              Thanks to overlapping contracts and multiple contracting offices, 
              nobody in the Pentagon seems to know precisely how many contractors 
              are responsible for which jobs -- or how much it all costs.
<p>
              That's one reason the Bush administration can only estimate that 
              it is spending about $4 billion a month on troops in Iraq. White 
              House Budget Director Joshua Bolten said this week he could not 
              even estimate the cost of keeping troops in Iraq in fiscal 2004, 
              which begins Oct. 1.
<p>
              Last fall the Army hired Kellogg Brown &amp; Root, a Houston-based 
              contractor, to draw up a plan for supporting U.S. troops in Iraq, 
              covering everything from handling the dead to managing airports. 
              KBR, as it's known, eventually received contracts to perform some 
              of the jobs, and it and other contractors began assembling in Kuwait 
              for the war.
<p>
              But as the conflict approached, insurance rates for civilians skyrocketed 
              -- to 300 percent to 400 percent above normal, according to Mike 
              Klein, president of MMG Agency Inc., a New York insurance firm. 
              Soldiers are insured through the military and rates don't rise in 
              wartime.
<p>
              It got &quot;harder and harder to get (civilian contractors) to 
              go in harm's way,&quot; said Mahan, the Army logistics chief.
<p>
              The Army had $8 million in contracts for troop housing in Iraq sitting 
              idle, Mahan said. &quot;Our ability to move (away) from living in 
              the mud is based on an expectation that we would have been able 
              to go to more contractor logistical support early on,&quot; Mahan 
              said.
<p>
              Logistics support for troops in Iraq is handled by dozens of companies, 
              each hired by different commands and military agencies with little 
              apparent coordination or oversight.
<p>
              Patrice Mingo, a spokesman for KBR, declined comment. Don Trautner, 
              an Army official who manages a major logistics contract with KBR 
              for troop support in Iraq, said he knew of &quot;no hesitation or 
              lateness&quot; by KBR civilian contractors. &quot;There were no 
              delays I know of,&quot; he said, making clear that he did not speak 
              for other contractors.</p>
