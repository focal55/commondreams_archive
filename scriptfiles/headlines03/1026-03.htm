<p>BAGHDAD - Anti-American guerrillas blasted the
Baghdad hotel where U.S. Deputy Defense Secretary Paul
Wolfowitz was staying with a barrage of rockets on Sunday, but
the No. 2 Pentagon official survived unharmed, U.S. officials
said.

  </table></font>A defiant Wolfowitz vowed that the United States would not
be cowed into abandoning Iraq after the brazen attack that he
said may have killed one American.</P>
<P>
 Up to 15 people were wounded in the strike that is a
setback for the Bush administration, undermining its insistence
the United States is winning the guerrilla war in Iraq despite
escalating violence.</P>
<P>
 The blast of the rockets hitting the Rashid Hotel at about
6 a.m. (0300 GMT) echoed across the city as a clear, rapid
series of explosions. Several guests were thrown from their
beds by the impact.</P>
<P>
 Some people were carried out of the hotel on stretchers and
others walked away with blood on them after at least six
rockets slammed into the building, destroying rooms on stories
below Wolfowitz's on the 12th floor, witnesses said.</P>
<P>
 Wolfowitz, a major force behind the United States invading
Iraq, was led away by security forces. He appeared composed
after descending a stairwell past thickening smoke and blood
stains with a fire alarm blaring, witnesses said.</P>
<P>
 "These terrorist attacks will not deter us from completing
our mission, which is to help the Iraqi people free themselves
from the types of criminals who did this and protect the
American people from this kind of terrorism," Wolfowitz told
reporters hours after the attack.</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials had previously said there were no reports of
deaths. But an unshaven and tired-looking Wolfowitz, wearing a
blazer and open-necked shirt, said he had an unconfirmed report
an American had been killed.</P>
<P>
 Iraqi security guards exchanged gunfire with the attackers
and wounded two of them, Capt. Charles Steward, spokesman for
the 1st Armored Division, said. He did not know if anyone had
been detained.</P>
<P>
 Injuries were generally minor and caused by flying debris
and possible smoke inhalation, he said.</P>
<P>
 "We have unconfirmed reports of 15 wounded," another
military official said.</P>
<P>
 Wolfowitz was paying his second visit to Iraq in three
months and had stressed the need to speed up the formation of
Iraqi security forces.</P>
<P>
 Members of his traveling party, who had been dressing ahead
of a breakfast meeting, calmly walked down stairs and gathered
in the lobby before exiting the building with about 200 people,
including journalists and U.S. civilian contractors.</P>
<P>
 In one corridor, survivors waded calf-deep through water
from a burst pipe.</P>
<P>
 The 11th-floor room in which an American may have died was
destroyed, according to a journalist who saw the devastation.
Part of the ceiling collapsed, the door was blown off, a hole
was punched in the wall and smoke poured from the room.</P>
<P>
 LUCKY TO SURVIVE</P>
<P>
 Escalating guerrilla violence in Iraq has eroded President
Bush's popularity among Americans worried at the rising U.S.
death toll. This month Wolfowitz's boss, Defense Secretary
Donald Rumsfeld, warned the United States faced a "long, hard
slog" in Iraq.</P>
<P>
 Guerrilla attacks have targeted the United Nations, the
Jordanian embassy and a hotel used by U.S. media. The attack on
the Rashid was the second in a month on the hotel. Attacks on
U.S. military in Iraq have killed more than 100 troops since
Bush declared major combat over on May 1.</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, a U.S. military spokesman, Sgt. Danny Martin,
said six to eight rockets hit the west side of the hotel.</P>
<P>
 Steve Marney, a journalist with Middle East Broadcasting
based in Dubai, said the two ninth-floor rooms on either side
of his were completely destroyed by the attack.</P>
<P>
 "I was a very lucky person. The rooms on both sides of me
were hit," he said. "It threw me out of bed." He said the
hallway was full of smoke and "it was pretty hard to see."</P>
<P>
 The hotel is part of a compound on the west bank of the
Tigris river used by the U.S.-led administration. It is in a
fortified complex that includes palaces built by former leader
Saddam Hussein.</P>
<P>
 A Reuters photographer saw five impact holes on the west
side of the hotel. He said three of the rockets appeared to
have gone through the wall, the others through windows.</P>
<P>
 The whole area was sealed off and U.S. military helicopters
circled the building.</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, Iraqi guerrillas fired rocket-propelled
grenades at a Black Hawk helicopter which came down near
Tikrit, wounding one American soldier. Wolfowitz had left
Tikrit by helicopter for Kirkuk just hours earlier.</P>
<P>
 Wolfowitz said he was not changing his scheduled events
following the attack. He faces a full day of meetings in
Baghdad and a patrol of the city with a military unit, and had
planned to depart late on Sunday for Washington.</p>
