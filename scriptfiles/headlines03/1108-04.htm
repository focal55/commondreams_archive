<p>As hundreds of activists gathered in Madison for the first day of the National 
Conference of Media Reform, the message was clear: Nothing less than the future 
of democracy is at stake if the concentration of media outlets continues unchecked. 
<p>"I don't think there's a more important meeting taking place in America today," 
Michael Copps, a Federal Communications Commission member, told a packed audience 
in the Wisconsin Historical Society auditorium gathered to hear about the fight 
to overturn a recent ruling by the FCC relaxing media ownership rules. <p>Copps 
was one of two FCC members who voted against the new rules. <p>Copps later that 
night got a standing ovation as he revved up the crowd at the Orpheum Theatre 
before the kickoff for the "Tell Us the Truth" tour, a musical collaboration that 
will travel to 12 other cities to raise awareness about issues of media consolidation 
and globalization. <p>Friday night's lineup featured British singer-songwriter 
and political activist Billy Bragg; Tom Morello, guitarist for Rage Against the 
Machine and Audioslave; Lester Chambers, part of the '60s soul-rock group the 
Chambers Brothers; and Boots Riley, rapper with the Oakland hip-hop group the 
Coup. <p>More than 1,600 registrants signed up for the media reform conference, 
about 1,400 more than were anticipated when conference organizers thought up the 
idea for the gathering some 11 months ago, according to conference organizer Bob 
McChesney. <p>The crowd was so large, many could not fit in the Wisconsin Memorial 
Union's Great Hall for the opening session and welcome by Mayor Dave Cieslewicz 
and Lt. Gov. Barbara Lawton. <p>In his opening remarks, McChesney said the FCC 
ruling in June has alarmed -- and motivated -- activists across the nation. <p>"This 
issue has exploded on the national consciousness in a way no one expected," he 
said. He said the FCC ruling has become the No. 2 issue on Capitol Hill, just 
behind the war in Iraq. <p>McChesney and others throughout the day noted that 
progressives and conservatives have come together on this issue and are getting 
results. A letter, already signed by more than 200 members of the House of Representatives, 
asks that a vote be taken in Congress to overturn the FCC action of this past 
summer. <p>The rules were stayed in September by a federal appeals court, preventing 
them from going into effect. <p>In a session on media and propaganda during wartime, 
Amy Goodman, host of Democracy Now!, spoke about the Bush administration's efforts 
to control coverage of the Iraq conflict. <p>"Lies take lives," she said. "We 
must decide whether we'll be the sword or the shield." <p>At another session, 
Linda Foley, president of the Newspaper Guild, and John Sweeney, president of 
the AFL-CIO, talked about the importance of unionizing media workers so they have 
the freedom to produce unbiased stories without fear of punishment. <p>A talk 
by consumer activist and former presidential candidate Ralph Nader was rescheduled 
for 8 a.m. today in Room 3650 of the Humanities Building on the UW campus. <p>Marge 
Tully, a local social worker and self-described news junkie, said she was drawn 
to the conference because of her dissatisfaction with most mainstream news coverage, 
particularly the censored coverage on the war in Iraq. <p>She said the concentration 
of media power is alarming. <p>"It frightens me as a citizen of democracy," she 
said. "It closes off opportunities for thoughtful discussion." <p>Daithi Wolfe, 
a Madison teacher and one of the 220 volunteers for the conference, said the news 
stories produced by most mainstream news outlets reflect the interests of corporate 
America. <p>"The whole media is self-censoring," he said. "When there is money 
and power behind these decisions, you don't need a police state." <p ALIGN="CENTER">Copyright
