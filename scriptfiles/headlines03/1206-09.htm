<p>CAIRO   - Palestinian factions said they had agreed  in truce talks in Cairo on Saturday to end suicide bombings in  Israel but were divided over whether to halt attacks on Israeli  soldiers and Jewish settlers on occupied land.<p> 
			
							The factions, including the militant Muslim groups Hamas  and Islamic Jihad which have led suicide attacks against  Israelis, began drafting a final communiqué that will spell out  a unified position of 13 disparate Palestinian factions on a  cease-fire with Israel.<p> 
			
							Israel rejected the Palestinian position as an inadequate  basis for the resumption of peace talks or for a summit between  the Israeli and Palestinian prime ministers.<p> 
			
							"I would say that such a half-way measure is a non-starter.  What kind of a cease-fire is it when there is no cease-fire and  you continue to shoot?" a senior Israeli official told Reuters.<p> 
			
							Hamas and four other Damascus-based Islamic and radical  groups submitted their draft of the final statement to  delegates, leaving out any reference to a cease-fire in the  West Bank and Gaza, lands Israel occupied in 1967, officials  said.<p> 
			
							The mainstream Fatah faction, led by President Yasser  Arafat, and other moderate groups, submitted several other  drafts, with direct and indirect reference to the cease-fire.<p> 
			
							"The drafting committee should finalize a common document  later tonight and submit it to the factions for approval on  Sunday. But the differences between Fatah and Hamas over the  cease-fire issue remain," a senior Palestinian official said.<p> 
			
							Egyptian mediators, working through the night with the two  parties, failed to bridge the gaps, casting doubt on a  successful outcome of the discussions, officials said.<p> 
			
							A cease-fire is key to ending three years of tit-for-tat  Israeli-Palestinian violence and for resuming implementation of  a U.S.-backed "road map" for peace that calls for Palestinian  statehood by 2005.<p> 
			
							FLEXIBILITY<p> 
			
							A senior Hamas official said Hamas was showing flexibility  by initiating a cessation of attacks on civilians in Israel.<p> 
			
							"But we will only accept a cease-fire this time after  Israel initiates a total cease-fire. We will not fall into the  trap of the previous truce when we adhered to a truce while  Israel continued it aggression," he said.<p> 
			
							Palestinian militants declared a unilateral truce in June  which Israel rejected. It collapsed in August when violence  erupted anew.<p> 
			
							Palestinian Prime Minister Ahmed Qurie arrived in Cairo on  Saturday to join the talks but because of the differences will  not do so until Sunday when he will attend a final session with  Egypt's intelligence chief, Omar Suleiman, who is mediating the  cease-fire efforts, a senior Fatah official said.<p> 
			
							Qurie hopes to meet his Israeli counterpart, Ariel Sharon,  after the Cairo talks to try to persuade him to accept a  cease-fire agreement, though the Israeli reaction to the  Palestinians' tentative position cast doubt over such a  meeting.<p> 
			
							Asked by reporters whether Israel had offered any  guarantees it would adhere to a cease-fire, Qurie said: "There  are no guarantees because there has not been any discussion  with the Israelis about this subject.
<p> 
			
							"We want first to achieve mutual understanding between  ourselves and then we will talk with the Israelis," he said.  "There will not be a free truce but a mutual cease-fire."
