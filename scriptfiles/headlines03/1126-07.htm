<p>NAJAF, Iraq  - Iraq's top Shi'ite religious  authority has criticized U.S. plans for the transfer of power  to Iraqis as incomplete and paying too little heed to Islam, a  leading Shi'ite politician said Wednesday.
<p> 
			
							Resistance from the cleric, Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, could  lead to rejection by many of the Shi'ite Muslims who make up 60  percent of Iraq's population. But Sistani appeared to have  stopped short of any outright dismissal of the program.<p> 
			
							British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, speaking hours after  guerrillas fired rockets at the Baghdad coalition compound  where he was staying, said the plans for transfer of power by  July 2004 and polls by the end of 2005 would only improve  security.<p> 
			
							As U.S. forces keep up the search for deposed president  Saddam Hussein, a military spokesman said they had detained a  wife and daughter of Izzat Ibrahim al-Duri, the second  most-wanted man in Iraq, who has been accused of coordinating  anti-U.S. attacks.<p> 
			
							Major General Raymond Odierno, head of the 4th Infantry  Division based in Saddam's hometown of Tikrit, said he believed  the fugitive dictator was still in Iraq, and that the capture  of Ibrahim's relatives could help track down fugitives.<p> 
			
							Washington has put a $10 million price on Ibrahim's head. A  $25 million bounty has been offered for Saddam.<p> 
			
							Odierno said U.S. troops would keep Saddam on the run.<p> 
			
							"My guess is he probably has a plan to keep himself nice  and cozy during winter, while the rest of his people suffer,"  he said. "But we're going to try to keep him running so he  can't be comfortable and doesn't have enough kerosene... to  keep warm. And I hope he's lost lots of weight."<p> 
			
							Odierno said Saddam was "worried about being caught." "I  know he's moving a lot, he's not staying in one place," he  said.<p> 
			
							  <b>SHI'ITE WARNING</b>
							<p> 
			
							In the holy city of Najaf, Abdul-Aziz Hakim of the Supreme  Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, or SCIRI, said  Sistani, widely revered as Iraq's most influential Shi'ite  leader, believed the new U.S.-backed roadmap was flawed.<p> 
			
							Hakim told a news conference he had met Sistani, who rarely  makes public pronouncements on politics, to discuss the plan.<p> 
			
							"He didn't find anything that assures Islamic identity," he  said. "There should have been a stipulation which prevents  legislating anything that contradicts Islam in the new Iraq."<p> 
			
							Hakim is a member of the U.S.-appointed Iraqi Governing  Council and SCIRI has cooperated with the occupying powers in  Iraq, drawing criticism from some Shi'ites. He said Sistani had  several misgivings about the U.S. political timetable.<p> 
			
							"He expressed concern about real gaps, which must be dealt  with or the plan will lack the ability to meet the hopes of the  Iraqi people. It diminishes the role of the Iraqi people in the  process of transferring authority to Iraqis," Hakim said.<p> 
			
							Straw acknowledged that security conditions remained  difficult in Iraq, where insurgents have killed 184 U.S.  soldiers since Washington declared major combat over on May 1,  according to the latest Pentagon toll.<p> 
			
							"I'm absolutely sure that a more rapid political process  will assist the security situation," he told a news conference.<p> 
			
							  <b>ROCKET ATTACK</b>
							<p> 
			
							Straw said he had not been aware of the attack on the  compound where he was staying, which set sirens wailing.<p> 
			
							In October, guerrillas rocketed a strongly fortified hotel  inside the compound where Deputy Defense Secretary Paul  Wolfowitz was staying. One U.S. soldier was killed.<p> 
			
							A spokesman for the U.S. 1st Armored Division said at least  two rockets had been fired in Tuesday's attack in Baghdad, but  caused no casualties. Two Iraqi police were wounded in a  separate rocket-propelled grenade attack near a petrol station.<p> 
			
							Straw said he could give no date for the withdrawal of  British troops from Iraq pending negotiations with Iraqi  authorities on the future status of foreign forces.<p> 
			
							"We will stay as long as the Iraqi government and people  want us to stay and there is a job for us to do," he said.<p> 
			
							Straw, who arrived in Baghdad Tuesday night, also alluded  to a danger that Iraq could disintegrate.
							<p> 
			
"The key question is to move power from where it is now,  formally with the coalition, to the Iraqi people as quickly as  possible to ensure that the integrity of Iraq remains," he  said.
