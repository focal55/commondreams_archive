<p>The Church of England has issued a prayer for the people of Iraq for use by parishes and congregations across Britain.</p>

<p>The move looks likely to widen the growing gulf between the Church and the British government's policy over Iraq.</p>

<p>The prayer is one of a selection which have the theme of world peace and are available on a Church of England website.</p>

<p>The short piece, called "For the Peoples of Iraq", by Fleur Dorrell opens with the lines: "Lord, we pray fervently for the people of Iraq facing the horror of a full-scale war, and for those people who may be called upon to fight.</p>

<p>Help us to persuade world leaders to continue negotiations."</p>

<p>The Archbishop of York, David Hope, writing in a letter sent to parishes a week before Christmas, said: "In October the House of Bishops 'urged the British Government and the international community to pursue all available peaceful means towards resolving the crisis with Iraq' and 'that to undertake a preventative war against Iraq at this juncture would be to lower the threshold for war unacceptability'."</p>

<p>"I am writing to encourage parishes, congregations and individuals to pray for peace at Epiphany (January 6). This is an appropriate season in which so to focus our prayer," he added.</p>

<p>The Iraq prayer in full reads:</p>

<p><i>"Lord, we pray fervently for the people of Iraq</i></p>

<p><i>facing the horror of a full-scale war,</i></p>

<p><i>and for those people who may be called upon to fight.</i></p>

<p><i>Help us to persuade world leaders to continue negotiations.</i></p>

<p><i>Help all of us: individuals, nations, governments and world leaders</i></p>

<p><i>to remember --</i></p>

<p><i>the unnecessary loss of life for millions of innocent people,</i></p>

<p><i>the scale of human suffering that war brings,</i></p>

<p><i>the right of Iraqi people to determine their own future,</i></p>

<p><i>the gross violations of human rights and crimes against humanity</i></p>

<p><i>that are committed in the name of war,</i></p>

<p><i>nobody has total power over any country or its people but God alone.</i></p>

<p><i>Let us be open to God's words in our forthcoming decisions and try not to be God ourselves."</i></p>
