<p>WASHINGTON   - Republicans in Congress on Wednesday  rebuffed calls by Democrats for a full-blown investigation into  whether the Bush administration misread or inflated the threats  posed by Iraq before going to war.<P>

</table>But they agreed to hold oversight hearings and review  documents on U.S. intelligence on Iraqi weapons of mass  destruction.<P>
The Bush administration justified the invasion of Iraq  largely on the imminent threat it said such weapons posed, but  since the war none has been found.<P>
Senior Republicans dismissed as political gamesmanship  demands by some Democrats for a full-scale probe into whether  the United States was misled into going to war.<P>
"There seems to be a campaign afoot by some to criticize  the intelligence community and the president for connecting the  dots, for putting together a picture that seemed all too  obvious," said Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Pat  Roberts, of Kansas.<P>
The Republican chairmen of the House of Representatives  Intelligence Committee and the Senate Armed Services Committee  joined Roberts in rejecting calls for an investigation.<P>
Concerns have mounted in Congress and worldwide over why  the weapons of mass destruction that President Bush, British  Prime Minister Tony Blair and other countries said posed an  imminent threat have not been found.<P>
The White House has stood by its position that Iraq was  pursuing banned weapons, but officials have begun to talk of  finding weapons "programs" or "capabilities" instead of the  weapons themselves.<P>
'HYPED' INTELLIGENCE?<P>
Some Democrats say the administration appears to have  "hyped" the intelligence, drawing the most dire conclusions  from the available information in a push for war to oust  President Saddam Hussein.<P>
Democrats on the two Senate committees that oversee  intelligence operations called for a formal joint investigation  of the administration's case on Iraq's weapons and alleged  links to Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda network.<P>
"We've got to make sure that the CIA does not embellish or  distort in any way the intelligence information in order to  advance a policy of any administration," said Sen. Carl Levin  of Michigan, the top Democrat on the Armed Services Committee.<P>
Sen. Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia, the Intelligence  Committee's ranking Democrat, called the Republicans' plan for  oversight hearings "entirely inadequate and slow-paced."<P>
"I'm not sure whether they really want to get to the crux  of what really happened," he said, adding that he would keep  pressing for a broad inquiry.<P>
But Roberts said he was seeking all relevant documents from  the administration and would proceed "in a very deliberate and  bipartisan manner" starting with a closed hearing next week.<P>
With media reports of unnamed officials saying they felt  pressured to slant intelligence, Roberts said he has "yet to  hear from any intelligence official expressing such concerns"  and urged anyone in that position to tell the committee.<P>
Senate Armed Serives Committee Chairman John Warner of  Virginia said the evidence he has seen "does not rise to give  the presumption that anyone in this administration has hyped or  cooked or embellished such evidence to a particular purpose."<P>
