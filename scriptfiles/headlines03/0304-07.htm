<p>In the kaleidoscope swirl that is the intersection of Fordham Road and the Grand Concourse at noon on a Saturday — peddlers, posters, storefronts, billboards, phone booths, buses, litter and surging crowds of shoppers — it was easy to overlook the handmade signs.</p>

<P> Like the one reading "Imagine" that Brian T. Hynes's wife made with contact paper. Or the hand-lettered poster Ruth Wenger carried:</p>

<P> Peace = Life</p>

<P> War = Death</p>

<P> Let Us Choose Life</p>

</table></font>But there they were last Saturday, next to the military recruiting station, behind the guy selling Barney books, a hardy band of homegrown Bronx peaceniks, handing out fliers opposing war with Iraq.</p>

<P> Bronx Action for Justice and Peace, as it is officially called, is one of an unknown number of antiwar groups that sprang up across the country in the wake of 9/11. The dozen or so most active members of the group are not professional protesters; they include teachers, nurses, social workers, students, ministers and at least one lawyer. It is hard to say how typical they are in a movement that is sometimes dismissed as being a conglomeration of antis and ists: anarchists, Maoists, anti-Israelites, anti-globalizationites, academic feminists, radical vegans and the venerable War Resisters League, just to name a few in the mix.</p>

<P> But to spend time with the members of Bronx Action is to get a very different view of people who oppose war — and why. "Frankly, I'm really not a political person," said Arun Aguiar, 37, a freelance writer and producer who is originally from India.</p>

<P> "When people argue about things like Maoists versus Marxists, I'm completely at sea," he said. "I just think war is the worst thing that can happen to humanity."</p>

<P> Mr. Aguiar, who on Saturday had festooned his hat and scarf with an array of antiwar pins, has made organizing against military action in Iraq almost a full-time job. But that is not the case for most members of the group, who meet one evening a month in the dim basement of Epiphany Lutheran Church on 206th Street in the Norwood section of the Bronx and also get together at potluck dinners. They are mainly white, middle-class, middle-age and have full-time jobs. </p>

<P> Some describe themselves as pacifists, like Ms. Wenger, who is the pastor of a small Mennonite church and espouses what she calls "radical nonviolence." Others are more pragmatic, like Heidi Hynes, Brian's wife, an ebullient 35-year-old who runs a community center. Some of the neighborhood youths join the military because they do not have other good options, she said, adding that she hated to think "that they will kill and be killed for something they don't believe in; it's wrong."</p>

<P> Besides, she burst out later, "I have to say this, it drives me crazy in general. If terrorists are our problem, they work in cells, live in cities." Spending more money on the military, she continued, "is not a smart way to fight terrorism."</p>

<P> Many say they are both pacifists and pragmatists. "The peace movement has been right throughout all this mess," said Jack Marth, 38, the only one to wear a tie to the group's meeting last Thursday. Mr. Marth is a public-interest lawyer and a longtime member of Pax Christi, a Catholic peace group.</p>

<P> "We never supported Saddam Hussein, we've been opposed to him from way back," he said. "It really just galls me when the right-wing talk shows talk about our naïveté. We're right again. Bombing Iraq is not going to lead to more security. It is not going to wipe out these absurd terrorist groups."</p>

<P> Mr. Marth's wife, Miriam Ford, really got the group going. A nurse practitioner who runs a clinic in East Harlem, she rushed down to volunteer at St. Vincent's Hospital when she heard about the attack on the World Trade Center. </p>

<P> It was not long, Ms. Ford said, before she began to have doubts about the way the United States was going to respond to the tragedy, and fears about bombing Afghanistan. "It was very dark days," she recalled, "There were a lot of flags everywhere, and you didn't know who you could talk to and feel safe about saying, `I'm not sure about this.' "</p>

<P> She and Mr. Marth invited some friends over on a Sunday afternoon, and about 20 people arrived "to hang out, have snacks and talk." That ultimately led to attendance at marches in Manhattan and Washington, a public forum, a film series, an e-mail list of hundreds of names, a rally at Poe Park in the Bronx, Saturday vigils and finally a "feeder march" over the 145th Street Bridge to the subway down to the big rally on Feb. 15.</p>

<P> While some members of the group were already friends, others were simply drawn by its message or activities. Mark van Hollebeke, a graduate student in philosophy at Fordham University, joined the group after a bus trip to a protest in Washington last April. "I didn't have a ticket, but they let me on anyway," he said. He has since become the group's Webmaster. </p>

<P> "I came here because of the miracle of e-mail," said Anita Dutt, a high school teacher with "two draft-age sons," she said, adding that she hoped they would never have to fight.</p>

<P> Like many members of the group, she said that some people seemed to think it was anti-American to question the military efforts in Afghanistan and, now, Iraq. "The flags started showing up on every S.U.V. — those people were out front and aggressive," she said. "I felt silenced by their loud hoo-ha."</p>

<P> Members of the group said that they did not necessarily agree on much of anything except peace. "We have pragmatists, communists, Christians, capitalists and some Greens," Mr. van Hollebeke said.</p>

<P> Laughing, Ms. Hynes continued, "Some of us are Democrats and none of us are Republicans," though another member hastened to add that peaceful Republicans would be welcome, too.</p>

<P> Some members of the group, like Frank Farkas, a 57-year-old social worker, fret that it is not more racially diverse and want to find more ways to get its message out to the black and Hispanic residents of the Bronx. When he was handing out fliers on Saturday, he said "No War!" in English and Spanish.</p>

<P> And with only a few exceptions, the throngs of shoppers were willing to take the fliers, glance at them, and sometimes even agree with the protesters. "I don't like wars," said Evelyn Cruzado, 45, who lives nearby. "I think the president should think about it again. There are too many problems right now."</p>

<P> The most effective leafleteers, however, were Mr. Marth's sons, Sam, 8, and Thomas, 6, who had stopped by during their free hour between gymnastics and karate in the morning and jazz dance and pottery in the afternoon. Their baby sister sat in the stroller while Mr. Marth held up a banner reading, "No War in Iraq."</p>

<P> It was an educational experience, in more ways than one. "I know you say it uh-rack," Mr. Marth told Thomas as he looked at the banner, "but it's spelled with an I."</p>
