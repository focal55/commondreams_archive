<p>UNITED NATIONS  - A new suicide bombing at the  U.N. compound in Baghdad on Monday dramatized the dangers of  stabilizing postwar Iraq as Pakistani and French leaders dealt  a double blow to U.S. efforts to win wider military support.<P>
The bomber killed an Iraqi guard and wounded 19 people on  the eve of the annual U.N. General Assembly session, at which  President Bush will urge skeptical world leaders to provide  money and troops to pacify and rebuild Iraq.<P>

  </table></font>Even before the latest blast jolted morale at U.N.  headquarters, shattered by last month's devastating truck bomb  that killed U.N. special envoy Sergio Vieira de Mello and 21  others, the response to U.S. lobbying for allies to share the  costly burden of occupation was cagey.<P>
Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf, to whom Washington is  looking for a major contribution of peacekeepers, set  conditions in an interview with The New York Times, pointing to  widespread public opposition in his country.<P>
That would only change if "the United Nations, Muslim  countries, Arab counties and Iraqis themselves are asking for  Muslim troops," he said.<P>
The United States is working on a new U.N. resolution aimed  at attracting wider support for postwar reconstruction in Iraq,  but critics of its invasion are pressing for more concessions.<P>
French President Jacques Chirac, who spearheaded opposition  to the war, told The Times ahead of a meeting with Bush on  Tuesday that France would not send peacekeepers to Iraq and  wanted sovereignty handed over fast to an Iraqi authority.<P>
"There will be no concrete solution unless sovereignty is  transferred to Iraq as quickly as possible," Chirac said,  reaffirming a position that Secretary of State Colin Powell has  dismissed as "totally unrealistic."<P>
But he said France was not thinking of vetoing the new U.S.  resolution.<P>
AIDS AND TERRORISM<P>
World leaders debated ways to fight two other global  scourges -- AIDS and terrorism -- on Monday, but the unresolved  problems in Iraq and the Middle East formed a gloomy backdrop.<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan opened a conference on  the root causes of terrorism by declaring that only political  solutions to such problems would stop violence, and warning  states against abuses in their fight against militants.<P>
"Terrorism will only be defeated if we act to solve the  political disputes and long-standing conflicts which generate  support for it," Annan said, stressing that military means  alone would not succeed.<P>
"If we do not, we shall find ourselves acting as a  recruiting sergeant for the very terrorists we seek to  suppress," he said. He cited targeted assassinations, such as  Israel has carried out against Palestinian militants, as the  kind of government action that could sustain terrorism.<P>
Norwegian Prime Minister Kjelle Magne Bondevik co-hosted  the conference with Nobel peace laureate Elie Wiesel in a city  scarred by the Sept. 11, 2001, attack by suicide hijackers that  destroyed the World Trade Center, killing nearly 3,000 people.<P>
Chirac, widely reviled in the United States for his  diplomatic campaign against the war, used the conference as a  platform for his first speech on American soil since this  year's military action.<P>
He also met U.S. Jewish leaders, concerned by reports of a  surge in anti-Semitic attacks in France. His closest anti-war  European ally, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, will meet  Bush for ice-breaker talks on Wednesday, offering limited help  to train Iraqi soldiers and police, but no peacekeepers.<P>
White House officials said Bush would robustly defend his  decision to invade Iraq to oust Saddam Hussein and issue a  "call to action" urging the international community to commit  money and troops to help stabilize and rebuild the country.<P>
But diplomats said he would have to show humility and not  lecture other nations on their responsibilities, since the  United States unleashed the war without U.N. authority but now  wanted others to share the burden of occupation.<P>
With three more American soldiers killed on Sunday, the  huge cost and mounting casualty toll is becoming a domestic  political issue for Bush as he seeks re-election next year.
