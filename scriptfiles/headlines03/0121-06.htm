<p>Mexico has asked the International Court of Justice (ICJ) at The Hague to stop the United States from executing dozens of Mexicans held on death row.

<P>The Mexican ambassador in The Hague said the dispute was not about the US' right to execute criminals, but about alleged violation of the 1963 Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. 

<P>

Mexico wants its nationals to be retried, arguing that the US failed to inform the prisoners of their right to access to consular officials.

<P>

Along with other American allies, Mexico has repeatedly voiced its concerns over the death penalty in the US. 

<P>

The latest move comes amid renewed debate about executions, after the outgoing governor of Illinois reduced the sentences of all the state's death row inmates to life imprisonment.

<P>

The ICJ's rulings - which sometimes run over a period of years - are binding, but the court has no power to enforce them.

<P>

<b>Presidential protest</b>

<P>

At the start of the hearing, Mexican counsel Juan Manuel Gomez Robledo told the court that the rights of Mexican nationals under the Vienna Convention were systematically breached by US authorities.

<P>

"These repeated violations are particularly perturbing given that they have as a consequence the sentencing of an individual to death," he said.

<P>

In a written application, Mexico argued that communication with consular officials could "make the difference between life and death" for Mexicans facing capital punishment.

<P>

Mexican officials are seeking an injunction to stop the US from executing any Mexicans while the court considers the arguments on both sides.

<P>

Mexico had originally requested a stay of execution for 54 of its nationals, but said on Tuesday that three of them had had their sentences commuted by the governor of Illinois earlier this month.

<P>

The death penalty has been a source of tension between Mexico and the US.

<P>

Last year, Mexican President Vicente Fox cancelled his visit to the US over Washington's refusal to stop the execution of a Mexican prisoner.

<P>

<b>German precedent</b>

<P>

The latest case echoes a previous ruling by the ICJ in June 2001 involving the La Grand brothers, two German nationals who were executed in the US in 1999.  

<P>

The court found that the US had denied the brothers their right to contact the German consulate.  

<P>

It ordered the US not to go ahead with the execution of Walter La Grand, whose  brother Karl had already been put to death.

<P>

But Walter was executed nevertheless.</p>
