<p>JERUSALEM&#8212;With wounded Pride, the Holy City's gay rights advocates strode in defiance for the second time ever yesterday, unbowed by an anti-parade arson attack and a suicide bombing that claimed one of their own.
<P></P>
Originally scheduled for a week earlier, Jerusalem's second annual Love Without Borders parade was postponed after one of its organizers, Alan Beer, died in a June 11 bus bombing.
<P></P>
The additional days in which downtown Jerusalem was decorated with rainbow-striped flags proved too much for some. On Tuesday, Jerusalem police launched an investigation into the overnight destruction of an estimated 20 of the flags, some of which had been burned. Among the suspects are members of the outlawed Kach movement, an extremist group.
<P></P>
In an unsigned statement sent to the Hebrew daily Maariv, Kach condemned the Jerusalem municipality's participation in hanging the flags.
<P></P>
"It's disgraceful that gay pride flags should be flown in Jerusalem, particularly when there is an ultra-Orthodox mayor," the statement said. "We will not permit the Jewish character of the city to be undermined."
<P></P>
Mayor Uri Lupolianski, elected two weeks ago, played peacemaker, offering lukewarm support for the event, defending its right to exist but promising he would be elsewhere. "Everyone has his own parade," Lupolianski said. "I myself will be marching in another parade."
<P></P>
Despite the tumult, yesterday's march transpired in a giddy, glitch-free festival atmosphere, winding its way past the walls of ancient Jerusalem to end with a drag-queen stage show and solidarity speeches at Independence Park. An estimated 2,000 people turned out.
<P></P>
In many ways a fledgling version of the gargantuan Pride Toronto, the Jerusalem edition came with a few significant differences. Alongside the colorfully costumed participants waving requisite signage ("We're here, we're queer, get used to it"), were an estimated 200 heavily armed security officers, drawn from the army, border patrol and Jerusalem police departments.
<P></P>
Also on parade, politics: an Israeli gay and lesbian splinter group known as the Black Laundry waved triangular placards pleading "Free condoms, free Palestine."
<P></P>
Shaul Jenna, a board member with Aguda, Israel's largest gay rights organization, surveyed the scene as he described the state of his community's struggle. "It's a strange time, because we're making gains and suffering setbacks all at once. On one hand, we see burning flags, on the other, we know there are rabbis among the Orthodox and Haredi communities who are good to us, who want to work toward a tolerant Jerusalem."
<P></P>
Despite the obvious tensions in the city, Jerusalem's gay and lesbian community remains infinitely more secure than its isolated counterpart in the Palestinian territories.
<P></P>
"One of our biggest projects right now is to help rescue dozens of Palestinian gay men who are sitting in Israeli jails right now because they are here illegally," said Jenna. "If they go home, they will be killed or tortured. They are basically sexual refugees. 
<P></P>
"We've approached all the foreign embassies. If each country would take just one, it would at least solve the present problem. But everyone refused, even Canada."
<P></P>
Jenna turned aside the criticisms of Orthodox politicians this week, including that of Shas party parliamentarian Nissim Ze'ev, who called for the parade to be banned. "What he needs to remember is that this is the only pride parade in the world that begins with a traveler's prayer and ends with (Sabbath) services," he said.</p>
