<p>TAJI, Iraq - Flames shot 200 feet into the air from a burst oil pipeline north of Baghdad on Tuesday, and U.S. forces fired warning shots to keep people from the scene. A U.S. soldier was killed when roadside bombs blasted an American convoy west of the capital.
<p>
 Two M-1 Abrams tanks and three soldiers crouched in firing positions ordered a fire truck to stay back from the blaze.
 
<p>
 "They were very hostile," said fire department Lt. Hasannein Mohammed.

  </table></font>The blaze near Taji, a region of date groves, military compounds and chemical plants, was burning about three miles north of a big refinery. It erupted in a grove of date palms less than 100 yards from a highway, sending a huge black cloud drifting south over the capital for several hours Tuesday afternoon.
 
<p>
 Before the war, U.N. weapons inspectors were in the area almost daily.
 
<p>
 Military spokeswoman Nicole Thompson said there was a pipeline fire but had no further details.
 
<p>
 It could not immediately be determined if the fire was the work of saboteurs, but many pipelines throughout the oil-rich nation have been hit by guerrillas seeking to destabilize U.S. efforts to pacify Iraq.
 
<p>
 The U.S. soldier killed Tuesday morning was riding in a Humvee in Ramadi, 60 miles west of Baghdad. A military spokesman said the soldier's convoy was hit by three roadside bombs wired to exploded one after another. Two soldiers were wounded.
 
<p>
 A soldier died in his sleep at a U.S. base in Ramadi and his body was discovered in his bunk at 6:30 a.m. Tuesday. In Mosul, in the far north of the country, the military reported a soldier died when his Humvee collided with a taxi.
 
<p>
 On Monday, Iraq's interim government announced plans to reopen Basra airport by the end of the month and has already authorized planned flights by at least six foreign carriers.
 
<p>
 Elsewhere, guerrillas wounded three American soldiers in northern Iraq on Monday, and a U.S. raid on a remote village near the Iranian border failed to capture a top fugitive suspected of plotting attacks on coalition forces.
 
<p>
 Monday's raid in Ain Lalin, 60 miles northeast of Baghdad had sought a former member of Saddam Hussein's regime on the U.S. list of 55 most-wanted Iraqis, U.S. Army Lt. Col. Mark Young said. He said 70 suspects were taken into custody.
 
<p>
 International commercial flights to and from Iraq have been suspended since the 1991 Gulf War. Ibrahim al-Jaafari, current president of the U.S.-picked Governing Council, said Monday the resumption of commercial flights would be "a big step forward to opening Iraq to the world."
 
<p>
 Al-Jaafari, serving as council president during August, also said the appointment of Cabinet ministers has been postponed by three weeks. He said a 25-member committee has been formed to look into how to proceed with selecting a constitutional assembly. The members include judges, academicians and lawyers and reflects Iraq's ethnic and religious groups.
 
<p>
 During the 12 years of United Nations  sanctions, only Royal Jordanian had been flying to Baghdad with U.N. approval.
 
<p>
 U.S. administrator L. Paul Bremer had said he hoped to get both Baghdad and Basra airports reopened by mid-September, and predicted last week that Basra would be secured and operational before the Baghdad International Airport. The Baghdad airport has seen at least three failed surface-to-air missile attacks on military flights since U.S. forces took control of the capital April 9.
<p>
 In Sweden, Scandinavian Airlines System said Tuesday it hoped to resume at least two flights a week to Basra, Iraq's second largest city.
<p>
 SAS, the joint carrier of Sweden, Denmark and Norway, sought permission from the U.S.-backed civilian administration overseeing Iraq earlier this year to resume the flights. The Iraqi Governing Council said it approved the application.
<p>
Lennart Svantemark, an SAS vice president, told The Associated Press the start of service depended on "the security situation" in the southern Iraqi city.
<p>
"We have said in our application that security is a requisite for us to do start flying," he said.
<p>
Al-Jaafari said other carriers include Gulf Air &#151; owned by Bahrain, Oman and Abu Dhabi &#151; Royal Jordanian, Emirates, Qatar Airways and the Polish flag carrier LOT.
<p>
In central Baghdad, two grenades were thrown from a car at a U.S. military checkpoint; soldiers returned fire, killing one Iraqi, witnesses said.
<p>
In al-Shumayt, north of Tikrit, guerrillas fired rocket-propelled grenades and detonated at least one homemade bomb, wounding three American soldiers, U.S. military spokesman Lt. Col. Bill MacDonald said. All were in stable condition, he said.</p>
