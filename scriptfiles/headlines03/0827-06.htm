<p>WASHINGTON, Aug. 26 &#0151; The State Department has discontinued financing for a small but well-regarded AIDS program for African and Asian refugees because it contends that one of the groups involved in the project supports forced abortions and involuntary sterilization in China, officials said this week. </p>
<P>
The decision to end the financing has raised a furor among AIDS and refugee groups. Relief workers fear that officials are bowing to pressure from anti-abortion factions within the Bush administration and allowing politics to interfere with desperately needed AIDS programs, assertions that  the State Department denies.</p>
<P>
The group, <a href="http://www.mariestopes.org.uk/" target="_new">Marie Stopes International</a>,  offers abortion counseling and services. </p>
<P>
State Department officials acknowledge that they have no evidence to suggest that Marie Stopes is involved in forced abortions or involuntary sterilization, and the group itself   says it has been trying to end forced abortions in China and to expand voluntary family planning.</p>
<P>
But State Department officials say  one problem is that Marie Stopes works as a partner in China with the <a href="http://www.unfpa.org/" target="_new">United Nations Population Fund</a>, a group  that was barred from receiving aid last year after the Bush administration determined that it had violated a 1985 law  barring the financing of any international group that "supports or participates in the management" of forced abortion or sterilization.</p>
<P>
In that instance, the State Department said the United Nations was cooperating with the Chinese government, which has been repeatedly accused of relying on coercive abortions to enforce birth quotas.  The United Nations countered that it was working to change Chinese policy, and it noted that the State Department had  determined that it had not knowingly supported coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization. Nevertheless, the agency  lost $34 million in financing.</p>
<P>
State Department officials said the partnership with the United Nations, as well as with  Chinese officials, is what touched off the similar concerns about Marie Stopes, which is based in Britain.</p>
<P>
"Their objectives are to reduce the number of abortions, but the fact that they're tied in with the government management program is what triggered the concern," said a State Department official. "This wasn't an ideological decision; it was a legal decision."</p>
<P>
The official praised the AIDS program that will no longer receive State Department funds as "good work" and "very useful." The project is run by a consortium of seven groups, including Marie Stopes, and offers AIDS counseling and supports health care services for thousands of people in several countries including Angola, Congo, Rwanda and  Eritrea.</p>
<P>
The State Department gave $1 million to cover the first year of the project and offered to finance the six other relief organizations involved in the program for a second year if they agreed to end their partnership with Marie Stopes. </p>
<P>
The groups, known collectively as the <a href="http://www.rhrc.org/" target="_new">Reproductive Health for Refugees Consortium</a>, declined the government's offer, saying they would not divide the organization because of "baseless allegations." The groups include the International Rescue Committee, CARE, the American Refugee Committee, the Women's Commission for Refugee Women and Children, John Snow International and Columbia University's department of population and family health. </p>
<P>
"We were disappointed that for reasons of solidarity with Marie Stopes that they should refuse our money," said the State Department official.  "We had hoped they would show more humanitarian statesmanship than that."
