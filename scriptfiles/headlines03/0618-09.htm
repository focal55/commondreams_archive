<p>LEBANON, NH -- Democratic presidential candidate John
Kerry said Wednesday that President Bush broke his promise to build
an international coalition against Iraq's Saddam Hussein and then
waged a war based on questionable intelligence.

</table></font>''He misled every one of us,'' Kerry said. ''That's one reason
why I'm running to be president of the United States.''
<p>   Kerry said Bush made his case for war based on at least two
pieces of U.S. intelligence that now appear to be wrong   that Iraq
sought nuclear material from Africa and that Saddam's regime had
aerial weapons capable of attacking the United States with
biological material.
<p>   Still, Kerry said it is too early to conclude whether or not war
with Iraq was justified. There needs to be a congressional
investigation into U.S. intelligence on Iraq, he said.
<p>   ''I will not let him off the hook throughout this campaign with
respect to America's credibility and credibility to me because if
he lied he lied to me personally,'' he said.
<p>   Kerry fielded several questions about Iraq from a small group of
anti-war Democrats after he addressed about 250 people in a
downtown Lebanon park.
<p>   Kerry supported the war and said Wednesday, ''I'm glad Saddam
Hussein is gone.'' But the Massachusetts senator has criticized the
president's diplomatic efforts. He that concern Wednesday saying
Bush had alienated U.S. allies in the runup to war.
<p>   As for the question about U.S. intelligence, Kerry said he has
led the call for a congressional investigation and pledged, ''We
will get to the bottom of this.''
<p>   Kerry said his service in the Vietnam war and his experience as
a member of the Foreign Relations Committee and former member of
the Intelligence Committee of the Senate make him the Democrat best
suited to question Bush's efforts on foreign policy.
<p>   ''I believe I can hold President Bush accountable if they have
misled us,'' he said.
<p>   Addressing senior citizens in Hanover later in the evening,
Kerry said he supported a congressional investigation because it
was not clear whether Bush acted on poor, distorted or politicized
intelligence.
<p>   ''I don't have the answer,'' he said. ''I want the answer and
the American people deserve the answer. I will get to the bottom of
this.''</p>
