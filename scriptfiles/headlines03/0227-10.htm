<p>WASHINGTON - Anti-war protesters traded marching shoes for

phones, fax machines and computers Wednesday as part of a

"virtual march" on the nation's capital.<P>

Senators, regardless of their position on a war with Iraq,

were barraged with calls, as was the White House. Outside calls

to Democratic and Republican Senate offices could not be

completed because of busy circuits.<P>

"We will let our fingers do the marching and demand that

our voices be heard," said Tom Andrews, the national director

for Win Without War, the group that organized the protest.<P>

Andrews said about 400,000 people had registered through the

group's Web site for the call-in campaign.<P>

"Well over 1 million phone calls were made in just eight

hours by people from every state in the country" on Wednesday,

he said. "Every senator's office and the White House

switchboard received at least two and often more calls per

minute."

White House spokeswoman Ashley Snee said the switchboard

received "a lot of calls" Wednesday, though she didn't have

figures. Asked how the White House viewed the calls, she said:

"It's a useful tool for people to express their views, but

it's not objective or scientific or a way to measure public

sentiments."<P>

The office of Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., received more than

800 calls in a nearly four-hour span Wednesday morning, about

twice the number of calls it usually receives. Durbin has

opposed unilateral action in Iraq.<P>

Durbin's spokesman Joe Shoemaker also said his office had

received 18,000 e-mails since Tuesday afternoon, more than five

times the number it typically gets.<P>

"A passionate, coordinated effort from citizens speaking

out on an issue dear to their hearts can be quite moving,

Durbin said in a written statement. But he added, "If the goal

is to tie up Congressional phone lines and shut down the

Capitol switchboard, there are better ways to get the point

across."<P>

The office of Sen. Peter Fitzgerald, R-Ill., took more than

100 calls an hour from people on both sides of the issue, said

Fitzgerald's spokesman, Brian Stoller.<P>

Fitzgerald agrees with Secretary of State Colin Powell that

military force must be a last resort, though "it must be a

resort if, as it appears, all our other efforts to compel Iraqi

disarmament prove fruitless," Stoller said.<P>

An aide to Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said her office

was also flooded with calls, and some people were unable to get

through. Feinstein voted to authorize the president to use

military force to disarm Iraq if necessary.<P>

"No one expressed annoyance," said Andrews, a former

Democratic congressman from Maine. His group sent Senate

staffers gift baskets for handling the increased calls and

faxes.<P>

Though the White House was also targeted by protesters,

Andrews said many callers could not get through because the

switchboard was clogged. House members were not targeted in

Wednesday's virtual protest.<P>

Religious leaders echoed the anti-war message Wednesday,

visiting Capitol Hill to urge the Bush administration to avoid

military action in Iraq.<P>

"Nothing I understand about Jesus Christ leads me to

believe that support of war and violence are necessary or

tolerable actions for Christian people," said Jim Winkler of

the United Methodist Church.<P>

Winkler was among several church leaders from France,

Germany, Scotland and the United States participating in a

prayer service and briefing organized by the National Council

of Churches.<P>

Some of the participants have already met with German

Chancellor Gerhard Schroder and British Prime Minister Tony

Blair to voice their opposition to war. Other church leaders

met with Pope John Paul II on Wednesday. A meeting with

President Vladimir Putin of Russia is scheduled for next week.
