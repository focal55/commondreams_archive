<p>The full extent of Britain's retreat from its overseas aid commitments was 
revealed yesterday as the Department for International Development (DfID) reshuffled 
finances to pay for the reconstruction of Iraq. <p>Established programmes in South 
America and eastern Europe will suffer most under the "reallocation" exercise, 
which will divert £100m over the next two years to projects in and around Baghdad. 
<p>More than 20 countries will be affected, with bilateral aid to some, including 
Peru, Honduras, Anguilla, Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia and Macedonia, being withdrawn 
completely. <p>Spending in countries as diverse as South Africa, Russia, China, 
Sri Lanka, Bolivia, Jamaica, Albania and Kosovo will be substantially reduced. 
<p>About a quarter of the money - £25m - will be extracted from next year's budget. 
The remainder will be taken from programmes scheduled for 2005-06. <p>The severe 
cutbacks in South America and eastern Europe, revealed by the Guardian last month, 
have triggered protests from aid agencies who claim they breach undertakings given 
by Tony Blair that money would not be redirected away from other programmes to 
pay for Iraq. <p>Yesterday the charities said they were disappointed at the outcome 
of the review. <p>Phil Bloomer, head of advocacy at Oxfam, said: "The idea that 
we should be reducing funds to countries such as South Africa, which is ravaged 
by Aids, or Bolivia, which is suffering political instability and where more than 
half the population live below the poverty line, does not fit in with development 
priorities." <p>Andrew Croggon, head of Christian Aid's South America division, 
said he was "shocked" by the cuts. <p>"Although these countries fall into the 
category of 'middle income', this should not obscure the fact that many are characterised 
by severe pockets of poverty and by large and growing inequalities," he said. 
<p>"In Honduras, one of the countries which will cease to receive funding from 
DfID in the near future, 44% of the population live on less than $2 [£1.20] a 
day." <p>Judith Turbyne, the head of Christian Aid's programme in the Caribbean 
and central America, said ending direct support for Honduras represented a reversal 
of aid policy. <p>"I'm very surprised at the withdrawal from Honduras," she said. 
"It's been a very positive engagement." <p>DfID opened an office in the country 
in 2001 in the aftermath of Hurricane Mitch. Now that office will close within 
two years. <p>The department admitted the cutbacks might involve redundancies. 
A spokesman said there would be "some staff implications". <p>Overall aid spending 
will increase over the next two years, but a departmental strategy means 90% of 
future bilateral aid will be targeted at low-income countries. <p>The war in Iraq 
has accelerated and deepened the necessary cutbacks to middle income countries. 
<p>Details of the "reallocations" were released in a written statement from the 
international development secretary, Hilary Benn, in the Commons yesterday: "These 
changes... will involve withdrawal from programmes earlier that we had previously 
decided." <p>Aid to Egypt would end and the planned programme in Jordan would 
be "rephased". Other countries that would lose funding include Serbia, Montenegro 
and Bosnia. <p>Programmes for the Palestinian Authority, Montserrat, St Helena 
and Nicaragua would be retained. There would be some compensatory increase in 
the amount of money given to aid agencies working in South America and middle 
income countries, Mr Benn added. <p>Extra resources could be found for Sri Lanka, 
a department spokesman said yesterday, provided the peace process moved forward 
significantly.<p ALIGN="CENTER">&copy; Guardian Newspapers Limited 2003<p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable --></font></td></tr>
