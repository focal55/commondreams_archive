<p>In a protest aimed at shutting down the Pacific Stock Exchange, hundreds of anti-war marchers gathered in downtown San Francisco this morning, blocking streets and snarling traffic.

</table></font>The demonstrators failed to close the exchange.	"We had absolutely no disruptions to trading," said stock exchange spokesman John Werts. 

<P>About 70 protesters have been arrested. Most were held for minor 

charges but a handful allegedly resisted arrest, San Francisco police said. Among those in custody are the former president of the Pacific Stock Exchange, Warren Langley, Sister Bernie Galvan of 

the group Religious Witness for the Homeless, and Father Louis Vitale 

of St. Boniface Church.

<P>Protesters sitting in the street have also blocked San Francisco Municipal Railway busses, trolleys and street cars along Market Street between Van Ness Avenue and First Street. A Muni spokesman says to expect major delays.

<P>Demonstrators continue to stand with locked arms at the gates of 

the Mills Building, located on Montgomery Street, and according to police 

will most likely be arrested if they fail to move from the site.

<P>San Francisco police officers dressed in riot gear are monitoring 

the demonstration and about 12 motorcycle officers are diverting morning 

traffic away from the protest. Police have made an announcement that they are 

prepared to arrest demonstrators who refuse to move from the street.

<P>Langley and the protesters began gathering at the Mills Building shortly before 7 a.m.

</table></font>When asked if he is willing to be arrested, Langley said he is 

"willing to take that step,'' and will remain seated in the Montgomery-Bush 

intersection.

<P>Langley's first anti-war rally was on Jan. 18, his 60th birthday. 

After marching again in a rally in February, Langley said he asked himself 

what more he could do to support the anti-war effort, which led him to 

contact organizers of today's event, Direct Action to Stop the War, and 

offered to participate and speak at the event.

<P>Protesters also include members of a brass band called Brass 

Liberation Orchestra. Trumpet player Jeff Giaquinto, 28, a San Francisco 

resident, is one of this morning's protesters.

<P>"I am here to support this action to stop the war and we as a 

group support direct action,'' he said.

<P>San Francisco resident Nathaniel Holden, 27, is part of a group 

called ActAgainstWar.org, and said his group plans to continue to protest, 

and has already decided on a contingency plan should the federal government 

officially declare war. The group will attempt to halt business the day 

following a formal announcement so that "it won't be business as usual,'' he 

said.

<P>"The purpose of today's protest is to stop the money that's going 

to war,'' Holden said.
