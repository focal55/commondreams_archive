</table></font>Another 10 people were wounded, according to relatives who survived the Saturday night assault, which destroyed three homes in the Al-Janabiin suburb on the southeastern edge of Baghdad.

<p>They said the dead also included seven women and two men belonging to five families.

<p>The two relatives were the only residents to escape unharmed from the ruins of the homes, according to an AFP journalist on the scene.

<p>Civilian casualities in Baghdad and its outskirts have mounted since the war's outbreak on March 20.

<p>The US-led coalition has relentlessly bombed the southern rim of the city, where elite Republican Guard units are believed to be guarding the approach to President Saddam Hussein's seat of power.

 <p>The witnesses in Al-Janabiin, who showed an AFP journalist the debris from the attack, said a missile struck the farm leaving a trail of destruction over a wide area.

 <p>AFP journalists have witnessed five such incidents in which civilians were the primary victims of a coalition strike, reporting at least 70 dead and dozens of wounded.

 <p>Iraqi officials have said hundreds of civilians have been killed and wounded since the start of the war.

 <p>US and British war planners have declared their intent to minimize civilian casualities and accuse the Iraqi leadership of deliberately placing military targets such as weapons and ammunition in residential neighborhoods.

 <p>They have also suggested that some of the blasts might have been the result of misguided Iraqi anti-missile missiles.
