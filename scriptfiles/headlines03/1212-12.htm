<!--/endimage/-->As the former Vermont governor traveled the snow-covered  plains of western Iowa with Al Gore's surprise endorsement  tucked away, nobody seemed able to agree on whether he was a  dangerous liberal or a closet conservative.<p> 
			
							Republican advisers regard him as the probable Democratic  nominee, vulnerable to attack as inexperienced in national  security and running too far left in the primary campaign to  make a credible change of course to win in November.<p> 
			
							"If I may quote the president," Dean told reporters with a  smirk, "Bring it on." He was paraphrasing Bush's much  criticized "bring 'em on" challenge to insurgents in Iraq.<p> 
			
							While Republicans portray Dean as an angry, tax-raising,  civil union supporting, anti-war candidate, they also worry  about his proven ability to fire up the Democratic base and his  knack for attracting young and first-time voters.<p> 
			
							From the other end of the political spectrum, Dean has been  accused of hiding a conservative record.<p> 
			
							Civil rights activist Rev. Al Sharpton, a longshot among  the nine candidates vying for the right to challenge Bush asked  in a written statement: "Will the real Howard Dean please stand  up?"<p> 
			
							He charged that as Vermont governor for almost 12 years,  Dean had opposed affirmative action, supported the death  penalty and appointed conservative judges. Dean has sealed his  records but, under pressure of a lawsuit, has agreed to let a  judge decide which documents should be made public.<p> 
			
							"I'm very conservative about money and I'm very progressive  on social issues," Dean said at a town hall meeting in Council  Bluffs, promising to balance the budget, provide better health  insurance and pursue a defense policy "consistent with American  values."<p> 
			
							GRASS-ROOTS STRENGTH<p> 
			
							Democratic opponents, who underestimated the staying power  of Dean's insurgent Internet-driven bid and his fund-raising  prowess, are struggling to find a way to stop his campaign from  outstripping them in Iowa and New Hampshire, where the first  major contests will be held next month.<p> 
			
							A win in both would give Dean a considerable advantage  going into the first southern primaries on Feb. 3, where rivals  currently view him as more vulnerable.<p> 
			
							"I think we're on a roll to beat George Bush," Dean said,  citing his grass-roots strength and his decision to reject  public campaign financing with its mandatory spending limits.<p> 
			
							Bush already has passed the $110 million mark on his way to  a record-shattering $170 to $200 million. Dean has raised about  $31 million so far and believes he can match Bush by convincing  2 million Americans to donate $100 each.<p> 
			
							This week's endorsement by Gore, the party's nominee in  2000, is regarded as particularly valuable to Dean in Iowa, a  state the former vice president won handily and where he is  popular among Democrats, many of whom still chafe over his  controversial loss to Bush in the general election.<p> 
			
							But to pundits and analysts predicting Dean has the  nomination wrapped up, and to Gore who urged Democrats to close  ranks behind the former governor, some Iowans say not quite so  fast.<p> 
			
							Earl Ernst, 69, pointed out that Dean and Missouri Rep.  Richard Gephardt, whom he favors, were running neck-and-neck in  Iowa polls. "I haven't made my mind up, but I don't think the  Gore endorsement means anyone should throw in the towel," he  said. Ernst was still undecided after Dean's appearance.<p> 
			
							"Anybody can still win," declared Denise Lightfoot, a  teacher at Abraham Lincoln High School.
