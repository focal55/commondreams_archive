  </table></font>MIAMI   - Police used tear gas on Thursday to  disperse protesters demonstrating against an Americas-wide  free-trade pact being debated by trade ministers from the  region.<p> 
			
							Sporadic scuffles broke out as protesters jostled with  heavily armed police in the hotel area where representatives of  34 countries discussed the future of trade in a region of  almost 800 million. Police estimated the number of  demonstrators at around 1,000.<p> 
			
							There were no immediate reports of arrests or injuries.<p> 
			
							Thousands of police, many in full riot gear, patrolled the  center of Miami, where worried shop owners shuttered their  establishments in an atmosphere reminiscent of a city under  siege.<p> 
			
							Some of the protesters carried puppets or giant flowers,  some dressed as tomatoes and many chanted slogans against the  Free Trade Area of the Americas, or FTAA, and a globalized  economy. They marched from the downtown Miami government center  toward the InterContinental Hotel, where the meeting was being  held behind a fence.<p> 
			
							"We did deploy gas in one location and that was just to  remove the crowd from a situation where people were pouring a  flammable liquid on a pile of debris," said Lt. Tony Russell, a  Coast Guard spokesman.<p> 
			
							The Coast Guard is one of many law enforcement agencies  pulled in to protect Miami and the trade delegates from any  violence like what occurred in Seattle during world trade talks  in 1999.<p> 
			
							MINISTERS KEEP FTAA ALIVE<p>

  </table></font>Chairing the talks, the United States and Brazil appeared  to have papered over their disagreements on how comprehensive  the pact should be. The two countries kept alive prospects for  an FTAA pact by 2005.<p> 
			
							A draft declaration crafted in the past three days by  regional deputy trade ministers would require all countries to  agree on a common set of commitments in each of nine  negotiating areas, while allowing a second set of talks for  some countries to negotiate more ambitious obligations.<p> 
			
							Protesters opposed to the FTAA ranged from labor unionists  to environmentalists. They have converged on Miami since  pre-ministerial talks began on Monday.<p> 
			
							Authorities expected thousands of demonstrators at a march  and rally later in the day.<p> 
			
							One police officer, who declined to be identified,  estimated 8,000 law enforcement agents were on duty.<p> 
			
							John De Leon, representing the American Civil Liberties  Union, said police tactics were heavy handed. "I think these  are totalitarian-type tactics. I think there are too few people  here to justify this sort of policing," he said.<p> 
			
							Protesters chanted "Go away, FTAA." Large papier mache  puppets derided the International Monetary Fund and  privatization and equated the FTAA with war.<p> 
			
							Camilla Schneider, a 60-year-old from San Francisco who was  dressed as a tomato and traveled to Miami to support organic  food and small farmers, said it was her first activist  participation since the Vietnam War.<p> 
			
							"I see the FTAA and the WTO (World Trade Organization) as  putting democracy into the hands of a few basically unknown,  unmonitored, unelected individuals who are literally killing  people" in assembly plants and factories, she said.
