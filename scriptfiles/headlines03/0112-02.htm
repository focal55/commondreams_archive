<p>THE Prime Minister and the  Foreign Secretary Jack Straw have this weekend upgraded their view of the possibility of war with Iraq to 'likely'. This comes just days after Straw said the chances of war were 60-40 against.<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><table border=0 align=right hspace=5 cellpadding=6 width="250">

</table></font>Although both Downing Street and the Foreign Office remain hopeful that conflict with Saddam Hussein is not 'inevitable', their latest joint evaluation will put even greater pressure on Tony Blair in the coming weeks as he attempts to contain an  increasingly hawkish US administration within the authority of the United Nations. <p>Blair and Straw's pessimistic evaluation also puts the  departure yesterday of HMS Ark Royal from Portsmouth into perspective. Ark Royal, the British navy's flagship vessel, is officially heading for the Mediterranean and then to the Gulf for a training exercise accompanied by a 16-vessel naval task group. <p>Although the commander of UK Maritime Forces, Rear Admiral David Snelson, denied the task force was effectively being committed to operations in Iraq, he said: 'There is no doubt that British forces are ready if they are needed.'<p>The expected announcement this week that tanks from 1 (UK) Armored Division will begin being transferred from Germany to Kuwait is further proof that a mass UK  deployment of troops -- likely to join an estimated 150,000 US military personnel in the Gulf within a month -- is now not far off. 

<p>That conflict in Iraq now being regarded as 'likely' will also disturb the substantial anti-war ranks within Labour and opposition parties who believe Blair is taking Britain into an unnecessary and US-dominated war. <p>The Stop The War Coalition announced yesterday that about half a million protesters would gather in London on February 15.<p>Downing Street will now expect the level of anti-war debate to increase in volume if UN weapons inside Iraq fail to uncover evidence of weapons storage or development before the inspection team deliver their full report to the UN in a fortnight. Last week the UN chief inspector Hans Blix said so far inspectors had found 'no smoking gun'.<p>Under whose command British forces might find  themselves in the Gulf may be dependent on Blair's continuing ability to keep the US president George Bush away from all thoughts of  unilateral action outside the United Nations. <p>The Iraq crisis dominated private talks in Hanover,  Germany, last night between the prime minister and  Chancellor Gerhard Schroder. During last year's election in Germany, Schroder effectively wrecked political relations between his government and the Bush administration with a hardline anti-war campaign. <p>Next month Germany takes over the chair of the UN Security Council and is expected to take a dim view of the US attempting to bounce the Security Council into any quick authorization of force against Saddam's regime.

<p>With the European Union's foreign policy chief, Javier Solana, already warning the US that there can be no war in Iraq without clear proof that Saddam holds banned weapons, Blair will have urged Schroder that Bush needs to be encouraged and befriended rather than threatened or the US mood could radically change to a go-it-alone conflict, disregarding international opinion. <p>Blair had been hoping his mini-summit on Tuesday on Middle East peace would help redress the Iraqi-dominated focus of US foreign policy.  Securing even a degree of progress on the Israel- Palestinian conflict would have encouraged Iraq's Muslim neighbors.

<p>In an interview with the US edition of Reader's Digest, Blair said: 'So far as the Muslim world is concerned, the perception is we worry about Iraq, but we don't care about the Middle East peace process.'<p>However, Downing Street has now accepted that Israel's ban on Palestinian representatives traveling to London for the talks, means only modest success, at best, can be expected. 

<p>Blair is said to angry and  disappointed that Israel's prime minister, Ariel Sharon, has shown no flexibility on the ban following the double  suicide bombing in Tel Aviv last week when 22 Israelis were killed. The absence of any pressure from the White House on Sharon is also said to have disappointed Blair. <p>A Foreign Office source said: 'This will be a better-than-nothing meeting, unfortunately. It will look at the prospect of peace perhaps six months from now. And that is likely to mean a look at the Middle East after war in Iraq, not talks that will prevent it.'<p>The talks will be attended by representatives from the US, Russia, the EU and the UN, known as the Madrid Quartet. There will also be representatives from Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan. Palestinians based London will attend with  representatives from the  Palestinian Authority on the West Bank taking part via video conferencing.</p>
