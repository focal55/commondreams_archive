<p>CAMP PENDLETON, Calif. -- Eight Marine reservists stationed at Camp Pendleton have been charged in connection with the June death of an Iraqi man who was held at a detention facility in Iraq, authorities said. 
<p>Two of the men, Maj. Clark A. Paulus and Lance Cpl. Christian Hernandez, face negligent homicide charges, said staff Sgt. Bill Lisbon, a Marine spokesman at Camp Pendleton. Charges against the other six range from assault to dereliction of duty. 
<p>"I think it's surprising because this is not what Marines do," Lisbon said Friday. "They don't do what these guys are being charged with." 
<p>All eight men, who belong to the 2nd Battalion, 25th Marine Regiment, are being held at Camp Pendleton. It was not known late Friday who their lawyers were. 
<p>Lisbon acknowledged the charges stemmed from a case in which an Iraqi man died while being detained by U.S. authorities. He would not, however, say whether the case in question was that of a 52-year-old Iraqi prisoner of war, whose corpse was found June 6 at a camp run by the 1st Marine Division near Nasiriyah. The man had been held at the camp in southern Iraq since his capture May 3. 
<p>Lisbon said Paulus and Hernandez also face lesser charges, including cruelty and maltreatment, and assault. 
<p>Three others, Maj. William Vickers, Sgt. Gary Pittman and Lance Cpl. William Roy, also faced charges ranging from dereliction of duty to cruelty. 
<p>The remaining three men, Sgt. Albert Rodriquez-Martinez, Lance Cpl. Andrew Rodney and Lance Cpl. Konstantin Mikholap, are each charged with making false official statements and assault, Lisbon said. 
<p>The cases will be examined by the military equivalent of a grand jury, which will decide whether the men will be court-martialed. 
<p>Lisbon also would not say when the unit was activated for duty nor when it returned to the United States. The unit is in New York, he said. 
<p>In a separate case, four military police from a Pennsylvania-based Army Reserve unit were charged in July with punching, kicking and breaking bones of prisoners at Camp Bucca, the largest U.S.-run POW camp in Iraq. Those soldiers and their families have denied the accusations.
