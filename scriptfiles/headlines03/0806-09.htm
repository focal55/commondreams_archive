<p>WASHINGTON - The Internal Revenue Service   said Tuesday that 25,000 low-income earners will be asked to bolster their tax returns with proof that they qualify for a tax credit designed to lift the working poor out of poverty.

</table>The new forms will go to families chosen for the pilot program who have at least one child and receive the earned income tax credit. The credit is designed as an incentive for low-wage workers to keep working. The families will be asked to prove they cared for a child more than half the year, one requirement for receiving the credit.
<p>
 The forms will be mailed later this year, and taxpayers will have to submit them to the IRS when they file their 2003 returns early next year.
 
<p>
 The certification program is one part of a broader project designed to reduce billions in earned income credits paid erroneously each year. The IRS next year will also investigate at least 300,000 taxpayers suspected of underreporting their income or claiming an incorrect filing status to get a bigger credit.
 
<p>
 "We must ensure those who qualify receive the credit they are due &#151; but only those who qualify," said IRS Commissioner Mark Everson.
 
<p>
 The certification experiment scales back a more ambitious pilot program that drew critical comments from tax professionals and low-income advocates. The IRS said they took those comments into consideration and modified the program.
 
<p>
 The IRS had planned to ask 45,000 earned income tax credit recipients to submit proof this year that they qualified for the credit, months before they filed their tax returns.
 
<p>
 Critics of the program asking taxpayers to certify before the tax filing season said tax clinics and paid professionals operate seasonally, and taxpayers could not get help with the forms during the late summer and fall.
 
<p>
 The IRS has not settled other questions raised about how taxpayers could prove they qualify for the benefit and who could vouch for them. In particular, the IRS has not settled whether neighbors and relatives can testify that an earned income recipient cared for a child for more than half the tax year.
 
<p>
 "That's still an issue under discussion," said IRS spokesman Terry Lemons.
 
<p>
 Some critics said the program singled out low-income taxpayers for a higher standard of proof than high-income taxpayers, with no evidence that poor families cheat on their taxes more often. The complicated and possibly intimidating letters from IRS agents may deter eligible families from claiming the credit, others said.
 
<p>
 "The IRS must ensure that the public perception of this program is not 'guilty until proven innocent', creating an additional burden on poor communities and individuals," J. Thomas Cochran, executive director of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, said in comments to the IRS.
