<p>Labour MPs concerned about the direction of Tony Blair's second term today launched a new organisation to steer No 10's consultation exercise in a leftward direction.
<p><a href="http://www.newwavelabour.co.uk" target="_new">The New Wave</a> group's 15 founders want the government to oppose "neo-colonial US adventures", recognise that "market forces don't give us all the answers" when it comes to reforming the public services and strengthen its links with the trade union movement.
<p>The group's significance, however, lies not in its demands - which are familiar from most leftwing critics of the government - but in its membership, which is made up of traditionally loyal Labour MPs not the so-called "usual suspects" of rebel backbenchers.
<p>Its members - including Mr Blair's former deputy political secretary, Jon Cruddas, and former Home Office minister Angela Eagle - represent a broad cross-section of the parliamentary Labour party; containing both supporters and opponents of foundation hospitals and the war in Iraq; the two touchstone issues of the last parliament. 
<p>The group plans to influence No 10's consultation process, which starts this Friday, by issuing pamphlets, organising seminars and exploring the possibilities of online democracy.
<p>Ms Eagle told Guardian Unlimited: "We're very interested in what people like Howard Dean (<A href=http://www.deanforamerica.com/ target="_new">www.deanforamerica.com</A>) and websites like <A href=http://www.moveon.org/ target="_new">MoveOn</A> have been doing in the United States to increase democratic participation via the internet. 
<p>"We plan to use our website to encourage and enable people within the Labour movement to participate in the government's consultation exercise."
<p>Ms Eagle is also authoring the group's first publication, a pamphlet jointly published with the Catalyst thinktank, about the future of democratic socialism. It is expected to detail its members' reservations about the government's market-driven reform of the public services.  
<p>No 10 is, however, more likely to be concerned about the group's intention to link up with the trade unions, many of which are now led by a new generation of "awkward" leaders opposed to the government's direction.
<p>Mr Cruddas, who used to "fix" the unions' block votes for Mr Blair when he worked in Downing Street, and Kevan Jones, another of the group's founders who was a political officer for the GMB union, are formidable organisers.
<p>The <a href="http://www.newwavelabour.co.uk" target="_new">group's website</a> describes Labour's links with the trade unions as "vital" and called on the government to work more closely with forward thinking workforces.
