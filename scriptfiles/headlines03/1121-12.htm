<p>WASHINGTON  - In a setback for the Bush  administration, the U.S. Senate Friday refused to end debate on  a broad energy bill offering nearly $24 billion in tax breaks,  but the legislation may get a second chance.

</table></font>The Republican-written energy bill was overwhelmingly  passed earlier this week by the Republican-dominated House.<p> 
			
							It faced stiff opposition in the Senate from Democrats and  moderate Republicans, who complained the bill would protect  petrochemical companies from lawsuits for contaminating water  with MTBE, a gasoline fuel additive.<p> 
			
							In a close vote of 57-40, the Senate failed by three votes  to end a filibuster in a procedural vote. Republican leaders  needed 60 votes to cut off debate and proceed to a final vote.<p>

</table>Republicans control the 100-member Senate with 51 seats.<p> 
			
							To get the energy package back on the track, Senate  Democratic Leader Tom Daschle proposed stripping out the  controversial MTBE provisions and folding the rest of the  energy legislation into the massive, must-pass omnibus spending  bill that funds the government.<p> 
			
							"This (energy) bill could have been much better," said  Daschle, from South Dakota, who nonetheless voted to end the  filibuster in favor of the legislation's boost in ethanol  production.<p> 
			
							Intensive lobbying and arm-twisting continued until the  final minutes of the vote to win support from a few Midwestern  lawmakers who were still undecided. Democratic aides said  Republicans tried to woo votes by offering to insert funding  for pet projects in a separate government spending bill.<p> 
			
							The procedural vote raised doubts about the passage of the  energy bill. Still, Senate Republican Leader Bill Frist of  Tennessee said he would hold "at least one more vote," possibly  Monday, to try to end the filibuster before Congress adjourns  for the Thanksgiving holiday.<p> 
			
							The energy bill includes $23.5 billion in tax breaks, with  a total cost of about $31 billion over 10 years due to new  funding, grants and production incentives. The White House had  sought about $8 billion in energy tax breaks.<p> 
			
							But the Senate debate over the bill boiled down to a fight  over two kinds of gasoline additives.<p> 
			
							Democrats -- and some Republicans in affected states --  were incensed at a provision that would protect Texas  petrochemical makers of MTBE from product liability lawsuits,  retroactive to Sept. 5, 2003. More than 1,500 cities say they  face costly cleanups because water supplies were tainted by  MTBE, a suspected carcinogen.<p> 
			
							The bill would ban MTBE by 2015, but give makers more than  $1 billion to convert to other businesses.<p> 
			
							"Unfortunately, at a time when America demands a thoughtful  and far-reaching energy policy, this proposal instead delivered  little bags of goodies to some individuals, not others, and  says that is a substitute for policy," said Democrat Charles  Schumer of New York.<p> 
			
							The legislation would also offer benefits for a rival  additive, corn-based ethanol, by doubling U.S. use by 2012.  Ethanol use in fuel is a politically popular issue in the Corn  Belt of the Midwest as a way to increase farm income and  stretch gasoline supplies.<p> 
			
							"The oil companies hate ethanol," said Democratic Sen. Dick  Durbin of Illinois.<p> 
			
							The MTBE legal waiver was included in the bill only "to get  the oil companies to go along," he said.<p> 
			
							Durbin was among several Midwestern senators who oppose the  energy bill.<p> 
			
							Frist told lawmakers the ethanol measure would not be  brought up as a separate bill or attached to other legislation.<p> 
			
							Republican supporters of the legislation acknowledge it  offers a smorgasbord of benefits for the oil, natural gas,  coal, electricity and nuclear power industries, but say it  would also create tens of thousands of jobs.<p> 
			
							Republican Pete Domenici of New Mexico, the bill manager,  said the choice was clear for Midwestern senators.<p> 
			
							"You're choosing lawyers over farmers" by opposing the  energy bill, he said, referring to MTBE lawsuits and ethanol.<p> 
			
							If the legislation is killed, "there is nobody that can  pass another bill like this with these kinds of things in it  for a long, long time," Domenici said.<p> 
			
							Domenici would not comment directly on whether Republicans  would take Daschle's proposal to strip the MTBE liability  provisions from the energy bill.<p> 
			
							"It's a sticking point and we're going to talk to the House  (of Representatives) about it," he said. "We can't just  necessarily wave a wand and pass it."<p> 
			
							Thirteen Democrats backed the energy bill, while seven  Republicans crossed party lines to vote against it.<p> 
			
							Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham criticized the filibuster,  saying: "The American people deserve to have an up or down vote  on the bill."
