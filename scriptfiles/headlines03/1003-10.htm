<p>WASHINGTON - In a sharp reversal, Republicans who just months ago daydreamed about a 2004 election landslide now worry that President Bush is losing control of events at home and abroad and faces a real chance of leading the party to defeat.

</table>At home, anxiety about the economy is escalating and respect for Bush is sinking. His domestic agenda has stalled in Congress.
<p>	Abroad, troubles in Iraq and Afghanistan have eroded Bush's traditional Republican advantage on foreign policy. His calls for international help in Iraq have gone unanswered. And in both countries, Americans continue to die in guerrilla attacks.
<p>	There is time, of course, for both situations to improve, and with them Bush's prospects. But for now, Bush has work to do avoid his father's fate: defeat after one term.
<p>	Complicating matters for Bush is the possibility of a full-blown scandal involving allegations that someone in his White House revealed the identity of a CIA officer out of political spite at the officer's spouse. The ensuing political firestorm, not to mention the Justice Department investigation, could further hurt Bush's standing.
<p>	"It's a feeding frenzy. … They've just got to take the punches, make sure everybody is cooperating with the investigation and see where it goes," said veteran Republican strategist and informal Bush adviser Charles Black. "It's going to be a distraction for a while."
<p>	"They need to get a handle on these things," said Rep. Tom Davis, R-Va. "We have a saying around here - don't let your monkeys turn into gorillas."
<p>There are no signs of panic among Bush supporters, but their heady optimism over Republican gains in the 2002 congressional elections, Bush's previous sky-high poll numbers and the swift fall of Saddam Hussein has given way to recognition that Bush could face a tough re-election contest.
<p>	If anything, recent problems have stripped away what was left of the national unity following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. With the country again deeply divided, Republican National Committee Chairman Ed Gillespie recently said that Bush faces a 2004 election much more like 2000's than Ronald Reagan's landslide in 1984.
<p>	"I'd just as soon not have the election today," said Black, "but we don't."
<p>	Indeed, Bush might need the next year to improve his fortunes. Americans are growing more skeptical of him as they worry about the state of their country. 
<p>	The majority, 56 percent, now believes the country is going seriously down the wrong track, while 37 percent believe it is headed in the right direction, according to a new CBS-New York Times poll.
<p>	Most troubling for Bush is that Americans now rank the economy and jobs a far greater problem than terrorism. As long as Americans were more concerned about terrorism, they felt better about Bush, whose forceful leadership after Sept. 11 rallied people to his side. But only 37 percent approve of his performance on the economy, while 56 percent disapprove, according to the poll.
<p>	Bush faces problems on foreign affairs as well. Only 44 percent approve of his performance on foreign policy, while 45 percent disapprove. On Iraq, 47 percent approve while 48 percent disapprove.
<p>	Anti-tax activist Grover Norquist, another informal White House adviser, predicts dramatic changes by Election Day - robust economic growth and relative quiet in Iraq - developments that even many Democrats acknowledge would probably secure Bush's re-election.
<p>	Neither is a sure bet.
<p>Bush hailed a new report Friday that businesses added jobs in September for the first time in eight months. "Things are getting better," Bush said, speaking in Milwaukee.
<p>	But Bush knows too well that it can take time for people to feel better about the economy. On Election Day 1992, the economy was rebounding from recession, but lingering economic anxiety contributed heavily to the defeat of his father, President George H. W. Bush.
<p>	Job growth typically lags behind overall economic revival, and it has not yet become strong or sustained. Even with September's addition of 57,000 jobs, the unemployment rate remains at 6.1 percent, and the country still has nearly 3 million fewer jobs than when Bush took office.
<p>	Iraq is the other political wild card.
<p>	Bush's recent request for an additional $87 billion largely to shore up Iraq helped crystallize nagging questions many Americans had about the continuing deaths of American soldiers months after Bush flew triumphantly to an aircraft carrier to pose beneath a banner declaring "mission accomplished." A majority of Americans oppose Bush's $87 billion request.
<p>	It didn't help Bush that this week the top U.S. general in Iraq said "this is still wartime," and chief U.S. weapons inspector David Kay reported that he has found no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. "We have not found at this point actual weapons," Kay said. "It does not mean we've concluded there are no actual weapons."
<p>	Bush insisted Friday that Kay's report supports his invasion of Iraq. "Saddam Hussein," he maintained, "was a danger to the world."
