<p>LONDON  - British Prime Minister Tony Blair looks  set to suffer a huge revolt by ruling Labour Party legislators  over Iraq on Tuesday as he scrambles to keep his government  together and win over a wary public.

<p>



		The debate takes place as Blair is poised to order British  forces to join any U.S.-led war against Iraq and follows a  senior minister's resignation over a government decision to  abandon efforts to win U.N. Security Council backing for such  action. A second minister has said she may follow suit.<p>



		Labour rebels have forecast 150 or more legislators from  the ruling party could vote against Blair when he seeks backing  for possible war. Last month, 122 Labour legislators, more than  one in four, defied Blair's Iraq policy in the first sign of  serious dissent.<p>



		Support from the opposition Conservatives will deliver  parliamentary victory for Blair almost whatever the size of the  Labour rebellion, but opposition in his party could have  lasting repercussions for his premiership.<p>



		Government officials say Blair can ride out the dissent as  long as a war is short and does not kill thousands of  civilians.<p>



		His stance on Iraq has set the centrist Labour leader  against a large part of his party in the biggest crisis since  taking power in 1997. The wider public is also largely opposed  to a war without U.N. backing.<p>



		POLL OFFERS BLAIR COMFORT<p>



		A new opinion poll published on Tuesday offered some  comfort to Blair as President Bush issued an ultimatum to Iraqi  President Saddam Hussein to give up power within 48 hours or  face war.<p>



		The ICM survey for the Guardian newspaper showed opposition  to war down eight points at 44 percent and support up nine  points at 38 percent.<p>



		Many Labour rebels believe U.N. arms inspectors should be  given more time to see whether they can get Iraq to come clean  over any weapons of mass destruction.<p>



		Robin Cook, the government's leader in parliament and a  former foreign secretary, resigned from the cabinet on Monday,  saying he believed it was wrong to go to war without broad  international support.<p>



		Cook told parliament in a somber statement he had no time  for plotters who wanted to use the Iraq crisis to oust Blair,  but said he would vote against the government on Tuesday.<p>



		He said history would be "astonished at the diplomatic  miscalculation" that saw a global coalition built after the  September 11 attacks on the United States fall apart.<p>



		Some members of parliament broke with protocol to applaud  him.<p>



		International Development Secretary Clare Short said she  may also quit government. Her aides said she was reflecting on  her position overnight.<p>



		She said last week she would resign in the event of a war  without U.N. authority, calling Blair reckless.<p>



		"The cabinet has decided to ask the house to support  Britain's participation in military operations should they be  necessary," Foreign Secretary Jack Straw told a packed  parliament on Monday.<p>



		"The debate...will be the most important in the house for  many years."<p>



		Blair will open Tuesday's debate and press parliament to  vote for a motion backing "all means necessary" to disarm Iraq  -- code for war.<p>



		His opponents will float an amendment saying the case for  war has not been established.<p>
