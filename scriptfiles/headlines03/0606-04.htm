<p>SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -- Plans for an execution chamber at the Guantanamo Bay naval base in Cuba are being studied by the U.S. military as it prepares to bring suspected al-Qaida and Taliban terrorists to trial later this year.</p>
<p>The execution chamber could be part of a permanent prison at the U.S. Navy base where the military is holding about 680 detainees captured during the war in Afghanistan, according to plans being developed by the commander of the prison camp.</p>

EXECUTION CHAMBER COMING FOR DETAINEES?<br>
The Pentagon  reported on May 28, 2003 two new suicide attempts by prisoners held at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, raising further concern from human rights groups as the total number of suicide tries reached 27.

</table></font>A Pentagon spokeswoman stressed Thursday that the plans -- being put together by Maj. Gen. Geoffrey Miller -- had not yet been submitted for a decision by Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld or President Bush.<p></p>
<p>But Lt. Cmdr. Barbara Burfeind said Miller was being prudent in planning for all the eventualities tribunals could bring -- including death penalties.</p>
<p>"Now the captors are planning how to execute them," Vienna Colucci of Amnesty International said of the prisoners.</p>
<p>With courtroom rules finalized and military prosecutors and defense attorneys selected, the tribunals or "commissions" now await the go-ahead from Bush, who will make the final call on individuals to be considered for charges.</p>
<p>Air Force Maj. John Smith, a judge advocate assigned to the commissions, said it is premature to talk about executions.</p>
<p>"We don't even have a person under jurisdiction or charges filed," he said.</p>
<p>But Eugene Fidell, president of the National Institute of Military Justice, said such preparations would make sense.</p>
<p>"It certainly shouldn't surprise anyone that the necessary steps might be taken, since the death penalty is provided for in the order establishing the commissions," Fidell said.</p>
<p>Administration officials have indicated there are plans to refer a dozen detainees to the tribunals. Under rules developed by the Pentagon, the president would identify the individuals to be tried, prosecutors would draft charges, and the secretary of defense would appoint the commissions to try them.</p>
<p>Cases would be argued by military prosecutors and defense attorneys before panels of three to seven officers.</p>
<p>Defendants could retain civilian counsel, but such lawyers would have to be U.S. citizens, would be responsible for travel to and from the commission and would have to achieve at least a "secret" security clearance -- and still they could be excluded from sensitive information presented before the tribunal.</p>
<p>The panels would vote on verdicts and sentences. Cases could be appealed to a military review panel and on to the president, but no appeal is allowed through the traditional judicial system.</p>
