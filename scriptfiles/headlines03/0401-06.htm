<p>DAMASCUS&#8212;In the face of repeated warnings to distance itself from the Iraqi regime, Syria yesterday lashed out at a "short-sighted" war that reveals American ignorance of the history and culture of the Middle East.<P></P>The comments by Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk Shara, splashed across the front of the state-run Baath newspaper, capped a weekend war of words that left many fearing Syria may be headed toward open confrontation with Washington.<P></P>On Sunday, U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell singled out Syria, demanding it abandon support for "terrorist groups" and Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's "dying regime." It was the second American warning, coming on the heels of accusations by U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld that Syria is complicit in passing war supplies, including night-vision goggles, to its neighbor.

<P></P>Shara again dismissed those accusations in a speech to the Syrian parliament, saying America had squandered an opportunity to solve the Iraqi crisis by consensus and instead succumbed to the temptation of its military superiority.<P></P> "But it (the United States) was short-sighted and ignorant of the history of the region and its culture," Shara said.<P></P>In a separate statement yesterday, the Syrian foreign ministry redoubled its support for Iraq, citing the global groundswell of anti-war sentiment.<P></P>"Syria chooses to be with the international official and popular consensus that says: `No to the aggression against Iraq; No to the bombing of cities and the killing of people,'" the statement said.<P></P>"Syria also chose to side with the brotherly Iraqi people who are facing an illegitimate and unjustifiable invasion."<P></P>Syrian editorials have been even more hardline. Tishrin newspaper yesterday described U.S. expectations of "easy prey" in Iraq as "history and strategic mistakes." <P></P>The Baath vividly condemned Washington's criticism of Syria as "an attempt to cover up the U.S. failure in Iraq."<P></P>"The U.S. Defense secretary is using these accusations to expand aggression and to cover up the war crimes being perpetrated against the Iraqi people," the Baath editorial said.<P></P>In other developments, a leading Israeli intelligence officer said yesterday that Iraqi chemical and biological agents and long-range missiles might be hidden in Syria.<P></P>

Brig.-Gen. Yossi Kupperwasser told Israel's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee that the absence of banned weaponry at weapons sites in western Iraq already searched by allied forces points to the possibility that Syria is harboring Baghdad's wares.

<P></P>Kupperwasser cited Israeli intelligence reports of equipment transfers from Iraq to Syria late last year that appeared to be earmarked for the Hezbollah in Lebanon, possibly to be used in opening a northern front against Israel in the event of a U.S. offensive in Iraq.</p>
