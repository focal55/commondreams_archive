<p>NORWICH -- Standing in front of the war memorials on Chelsea Parade Saturday, 15 protesters demonstrated against the impending war with Iraq.

</table></font>Protest organizer Jill Palmer, 15, of Canterbury said she wasn't sure how many people would join her when she posted signs Friday announcing the event.

<P>Palmer was committed enough to the issue to carry on the protest with just her sister, Sarah Riccardi, 20. "I didn't want to be pessimistic, but I didn't think there would be this many people out here," Palmer said.

<P>Douglas Wray, 58, of Yantic, heard about the noon protest at 11:55 a.m., and ran out of his house to get there on time. The demonstrators were prepared to stay as long as two hours in the wind and snow to show their opposition to a U.S.-led invasion of Iraq.

<P>Holding signs proclaiming "Promote peace" and "Remember Vietnam," the protestors received signs of support from passing motorists, beeping horns and giving the thumbs-up sign.

<P>Palmer was surprised and pleased by the response.

<P>We haven't had many people flip us off yet," she said.

<P>Palmer's mother, Kally Palmer, joined her daughter at the rally.

<P>"I thought we were in the minority because of all the media attention given to the war," she said.

<P>One woman slowed her car down and yelled angrily at the protestors that her son was over there. "Where is yours?" she asked.

<P>"I'm sorry that her son is there," protester Andrew Cordeira, 49, of Norwich, said.

<P>A computer technician, Cordeira said free dialogue is what makes the U.S. a great country. He would not be convinced to change his opposition to a war.

<P>"All war produces is more memorials to dead heroes," he said, pointing to the memorials on the green that list Norwich dead.

<P>Angela Cordeira, 13, said she was against the war because there are children who will die from aerial bombardments.

<P>Angie Hart and Ben Richter, both 16 and of Norwich, joined the protest as members of Norwich Free Academy's Youth Peace Club.

<P>"I think the reason the response has been so good is because the war is more real. We are closer to war than we were six months ago," Hart said.

<P>She also said the response to anti-war protests was much more negative six months ago.

<P>"I still don't think Bush has made a convincing case," Barbara Nelson, 57, of Norwich said. Nelson said she remembers Vietnam and doesn't want to see it happen again without cause. "Since Sept. 11, I realized that I need to voice my opinion," Nelson said. She encouraged people to call Connecticut senators Dodd and Lieberman as well as President Bush.

<P>"We sing 'God Bless America'. We need to start singing 'God Bless the World'. We are all just human beings," Nelson said.
