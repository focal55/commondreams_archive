<p>NEW YORK   - ChevronTexaco  next week will  begin its defense in a multibillion dollar legal battle in  Ecuador against accusations it has polluted portions of the  country's Amazon region, the company said.<P>
The suit, which was brought by thousands of residents near  the company's former oil fields, alleges Texaco Petroleum Co, a  subsidiary of Texaco Inc. which merged with Chevron in 2001,  dumped roughly 18.5 billion gallons of oil-laden water into  unlined pits, estuaries and rivers during its operations in  Ecuador's Oriente between 1971 and 1992.<P>
Attorneys said the trial could last two years.<P>
People living near the fields, now operated by state firm  Petroecuador, claim the oil pollution destroyed sources of  drinking water, caused health problems, and led to deaths of  farm animals, lawyers for the plaintiffs said.<P>
ChevronTexaco denies the allegations, saying the "produced  water" in question, a by-product of oil drilling, was treated  before being discharged. They also say that the firm has  already completed a remediation project to eliminate any  permanent effect from its operations.<P>
After 10 years of jurisdictional disputes, the case will be  heard in court starting May 6 in Lago Agrio in Ecuador. The 2nd  U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, based in New York, ruled in 2002  that a ruling on the case in Ecuador would be enforceable in  the United States.<P>
Attorneys say damages could exceed $5 billion.<P>
POISONED LAND<P>
No one denies that the region is polluted: a stack of  photographic evidence shows dozens of oil-filled pits, some on  fire, slicked rivers and marshes, and residents' shoeless feet  covered in crude oil.<P>
Texaco entered Ecuador in 1964 along with Gulf Oil to help  Petroecuador develop oil concessions. In 1977, Gulf left the  consortium, leaving Petroecuador with a 62.5 percent interest  and Texaco Petroleum the remaining 37.5 percent.<P>
Upon leaving Ecuador, Texaco entered into a remediation  agreement with the Ecuadorean government, putting $40 million  into covering waste-water pits, replanting cleared land, and  funding local infrastructure and institutions. Petroecuador  continued to operate the fields in the area as full owner.<P>
"It is important to remember that oil operations are  ongoing in the region, so how can anyone say that TexPet is the  one responsible for any current impact," said ChevronTexaco  spokeswoman Maripat Sexton. "TexPet was committed to ensuring  that there was no lasting impact to its operations."<P>
Attorneys for the plaintiffs say several of the photos in  evidence were taken in 1992, the year Texaco left Ecuador but  also three years before the remediation project was completed.  Many were taken in 1999, after years of solo operations by  Petroecuador.<P>
The attorneys, who say they represent 30,000 residents, add  that they have a long list of testimonials from witnesses  suggesting systematic toxic dumping, including one from former  Ecuadorean Minister of Natural Resources Vargas Pazzos.<P>
"The point is that Texaco made a decision to dump these  toxins into the Amazon in order to save money and increase its  profits," said attorney Steven Donziger.<P>
The attorneys for the plaintiffs estimated Texaco Petroleum  increased its profits $4.5 billion between 1964 and 1992 by  dumping the produced water instead of re-injecting it.<P>
ONLY WATER?<P>
The principal contention in the case concerns the quality  of the waste water before it was discharged. Produced water, a  common by-product of drilling, is often re-injected back into  the reservoir if its not properly treated.<P>
Attorneys for the plaintiffs claim the water dumped by  Texaco contained up to 5,000 parts oil per million, causing  ponds and rivers to develop a layer of crude oil. The oil, they  say, was later burned or sprayed on roads.<P>
"The people there have said it sometimes rained black,"  said Donziger.<P>
ChevronTexaco officials claim the waste water was put  through a three-stage separation process in line with normal  industry practice. But the officials could not give an estimate  of the amount of oil left in the water before it was  discharged.<P>
The firm claims the final stage of separation took place in  clay-bottomed pits, and oil was frequently siphoned out and  placed into pipelines or used on roads to keep dust down.<P>
"TexPet conducted road oiling at the express direction of  Ecuador's government that it maintain and improve the roadways  of Oriente," Sexton said.<P>
The water remaining in the pits was released into "nearby  rivers and streams," the company said. ChevronTexaco denied  that Texaco Petroleum set any oil pits on fire.
