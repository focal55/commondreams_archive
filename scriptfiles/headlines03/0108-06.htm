<p> Italian media have been publishing transcripts of an inquiry into the policing of the 2001 Genoa G8 summit in which officers admit fabricating evidence against protesters.

<P>At the center of the inquiry is a police raid on a school being used as a dormitory by anti-globalization demonstrators, in which dozens of people were injured.

<P>A senior officer, Pietro Troiani, reportedly admitted under questioning that two petrol bombs allegedly found at the school were planted by police to justify the raid.

<P>In fact, they had been found elsewhere in the city, in the Corsa Italia, where protesters and police had clashed earlier in the day.

<P>Mr Troiani's lawyer later denied any involvement of his client in fabricating evidence, saying he had only handed the bombs to another police official, reports say. 

<P><b>Police disciplined</b>

<P>Out of 93 people arrested at the school in the early hours of 22 July, 72 suffered injuries, and all were later released without charge.

<P>"Now that the investigation into the G8 events is drawing to a close, suspected truths which had already emerged are being officially confirmed," reported the Italian television channel, Rai Uno.

<P>At least 77 police officers have been under investigation for alleged brutality, and three police chiefs have been moved to other jobs.

<P>Transcripts of some of their interviews have been published in Italian newspapers, including Italy's leading left-wing daily, La Repubblica, and the Genoa daily newspaper, Il Secolo XIX.

<P>Demonstrators said riot police beat them with clubs, smashed windows and wrecked computers in the raid.

<P>The BBC's Bill Hayton was among those who stood outside the Diaz school, hearing the screams coming from within, then watching bodies brought out on stretchers.

<P>

When the police left he went in and saw blood on the walls, floors and radiators of an upstairs room.

<P>

<b>'Simulated' stabbing</b>

<P>

One of the key witnesses is Michele Burgio, Mr Troiani's driver, who admits to planting petrol bombs at the school.

<P>

According to the media reports, Mr Troiani later admitted to prosecutors that fabricating evidence was a "silly thing" to do.

<P>

Attention is also focusing on a knife attack on one police officer, Massimo Nucera.

<P>

A senior police chief, Franco Gratteri, head of the Central Operations Services, is quoted as saying that the stabbing was not carried out by protesters, but was simulated.

<P>

Mr Gratteri says the "attack" could have been aimed at justifying the excessive use of violence used by some flying squads.

<P>

Hundreds of police and protesters were injured in street battles during the summit, which was attended by violent anarchists as well as peaceful protesters.

<P>

One protester died after being shot by police.</p>
