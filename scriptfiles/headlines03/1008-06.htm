<p>THE US's influential state governors are key allies in the race for the White House - so will Arnold Schwarzenegger's poll victory help fellow Republican George W. Bush's re-election bid next year?
<p> Many experts think not. In fact, prominent pollster John Zogby believes the discontent in California is a sign the "angry voter" is returning to US politics after a seven-year break - and that's a danger for anyone in power, including the President.

</table>Voters are no longer quiescent now the economic boom is over and unemployment remains high, Zogby argues. "California is now the bell weather," he says.
<p> People are demanding governments do something about their problems. "We're seeing angry voters everywhere," Zogby says. "That doesn't bode well for incumbents."
<p> But Schwarzenegger's success is still a boost for the Republicans in the nation's most populous and trend-setting state, which has become strongly Democratic over the past decade.
<p> The actor's socially liberal views on gays and abortion may attract more Californians back to the Republican Party, which in recent years has assumed the conservative moral and religious attitudes of the American South.
<p> "But I don't think it tells us a hell of a lot about California in the presidential election," Washington Post political columnist David Broder says.
<p> "There the issues are more likely to be foreign policy, the economy and Bush's record in office -- and those issues haven't been debated in this campaign."
<p> Norm Ornstein, a political analyst with the American Enterprise Institute, agrees. "The fundamental reality is that any idea this is going to give Bush a leg-up for 2004 is wrong," he says.
<p> But the Bush team may disagree. Bush spent a lot of time and money in California before the 2000 election, and has been the state at least eight times since. His political adviser, Karl Rove, wanted to run a socially liberal candidate in the governor's race in 2002. So they haven't given up.
<p> Why does California matter? Remember the US president is elected not by a majority of voters, but a majority of the 538 votes cast by the 50 states and the District of Columbia in the national Electoral College.
<p> California will have 55 votes in 2004 -- the biggest by far -- and that's more than 20 per cent of the total needed to win. The Democrats must win California to win the White House, but Bush showed last time he can scrape in without it -- just.
<p> Clearly the Golden State lives up to its name come election time. In the 1970s and 80s it backed Republicans, including two of its own, Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan.
<p> But these days, more liberal and Latino than the rest of the US, and unimpressed by the social conservatism in the Republican Party, it is perhaps the most Democratic state of the union.
<p> In 2000, Al Gore won 53 per cent of the Californian vote, and Bush managed just 42 per cent. Green candidate Ralph Nader got 4 per cent.
<p> So the first problem for Bush is that the climb to victory in California is steep, even if the muscle-bound Schwarzenegger were able to lift him.
<p> The second difficulty is that Schwarzenegger will have plenty of problems of his own. He will not only inherit Gray Davis's economic troubles but the same limited toolbox for fixing the budget deficit that now stands at $US8 billion ($11.6billion).

<p> California's troubles stem in large part from the collapse of the technology bubble, which slashed its tax revenues. But most states are in economic trouble -- about 40 have budget deficits.
<p> Broder says this means many governors have no energy to play a national political role, being absorbed by their own troubles. "And I would think that would probably be the case with Schwarzenegger as well."

<p> Ornstein says Republicans are nervous about Schwarzenegger. "The first thing he says he'll do is repeal the car tax," the analyst says. "That raises the deficit from $US8billion to $US12 billion. But 80 per cent of the budget is off-limits. And he's put more off-limits by taking education out of the mix.

<p> "That means he's going to have to cut $US12 billion from prisons and health care, or raise taxes. Either way he's going to alienate lots of voters. And I don't see it getting better in California in the course of the next year."
<p> Zogby says Bush hasn't a snowball's chance in hell of winning California, even with Schwarzenegger. He sees a potential upside for the Democrats, who will try to energize their supporters with the claim California is yet another example of the Republicans usurping democracy.
<p> "Democrats are now going to say, 'Republicans don't like it when the elections don't go their way'," Zogby says.

<p> "You impeach, you recount and go to the Supreme Court, you redistrict as in Texas, and you recall."

<p> But mostly the Democrats will be hoping they can capitalize on voter activism and anger over the economy.

<p> The Democrat front-runner for the presidential nomination, Howard Dean, set the tone last night, blaming Bush's massive tax cuts for undermining budgets in all the states.

<p> "Tonight the voters in California directed their frustration with the country's direction on their incumbent governor," Dean said.

<p> "Come next November, that anger might be directed at a different incumbent ... in the White House."
