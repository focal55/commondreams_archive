<p>President George Bush's lightning public-relations strike on Baghdad last week will have provided him with powerful television imagery with which to launch his re-election campaign next year. But the sight of the President serving Thanksgiving turkey to the troops has also served to overshadow - at least for the moment - a catalogue of potential political embarrassments created by his younger brother. Neil Bush caused trouble for their father, President Bush the first, more than a decade ago because of his role in the collapse of a savings and loan company that ended up costing American taxpayers $1.3bn (&#163;750m). Now he is in trouble again, largely as a result of the startling revelations from a highly acrimonious divorce.</p>
<p>Some have been tawdry in a strictly sexual sense. First, that Neil had run off with the female half of a couple he and his ex-wife, Sharon, both once regarded as good friends. (Sharon Bush now suspects the two-year-old son of Neil's new girlfriend might be his, although she is being sued by the girlfriend's ex-husband for saying so.)</p>
<p>Or, that he had had sex during business trips to Thailand and Hong Kong with a series of women who, according to his sworn testimony, had spontaneously appeared at his hotel door without expecting payment... Asked whether the women were prostitutes, he told his ex-wife's lawyers he didn't know, but acknowledged that the arrangement was "very unusual".</p>
<p>Potentially more damaging revelations - certainly for the Oval Office - concern business rather than pleasure, and the strong impression that Neil might have taken brazen advantage of his membership of America's most powerful political family to make a killing on business deals.</p>
<p>Exhibit A is a consultancy with Grace Semiconductor Manufacturing of Shanghai, under which Neil is due to be paid $2m over the next five years to provide occasional "expertized advices" [sic] and attend board meetings. When Sharon's lawyers confronted him with the fact that he had no background in semiconductors, he answered: "That's correct."</p>
<p>Exhibit B is a contract with a Washington-based firm that helps companies secure reconstruction work in post-war Iraq. Neil Bush said that he was providing "miscellaneous consulting services" to Crest Investment, including "answering phone calls", for about three hours a week. For this he is being paid $60,000 a year.</p>
<p>The suspicion is that Neil Bush's real role to provide access to the White House. Both companies have strong political connections - Grace via its co-founder, the son of former Chinese president Jiang Zemin, and Crest via Joe Allbaugh, George Bush's 2000 campaign director, who is in business with Crest's chief executive, Jamal Daniel.</p>
<p>Whether any of this might damage the President or not, it adds to a conviction that the Bush family has been trading off its political connections for years. In 1993, George Bush Snr took Neil, his brother Marvin and a clutch of outgoing White House officials to Kuwait where they all ended up doing lucrative business deals.</p>
<p>On that occasion, Neil sold anti-pollution equipment to Kuwaiti oil contractors. An executive with the company he was representing told The New Yorker: "There is no conflict of interest ... We're just capitalising on whatever good feelings exist."</p>
