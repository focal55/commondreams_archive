<p>A titan of American capitalism delivered a stinging critique of American capitalism in Madison on Wednesday.
<p>But John Bogle, founder of The Vanguard Group and father of the index mutual fund, also offered a plan to fix it as he spoke at the Directors&#039; Summit conference on corporate governance at UW-Madison.
<p>&#034;The fact is, in America today it is high time for bluntness,&#034; said the feisty Bogle, who showed none of the frailty that might be expected from a 74-year-old heart transplant recipient.
<p>Reciting the litany of recent corporate scandals - from Enron to Tyco to WorldCom to the New York Stock Exchange - Bogle said that &#034;in the 1990s our whole system broke down.&#034;
<p>With boards of directors failing to act in the interests of the shareholders they ostensibly represent, our system of &#034;ownership capitalism&#034; became one of &#034;management capitalism,&#034; where the profits went not to shareholders as they should but to executives receiving outrageously excessive compensation, Bogle said.
<p>From 1988-2001, he said, workers&#039; compensation increased 60 percent - just slightly above inflation - while CEO compensation soared 443 percent.
<p>&#034;Little good comes from when the CEO becomes not only boss of the business but boss of the board as well,&#034; Bogle said. &#034;Don&#039;t be surprised when the looting begins.&#034;
<p>Even worse, the excessive executive compensation did not correspond with any appreciable corporate achievements, he said.
<p>&#034;Simply no evidence possibly justifies the outrageous compensation increases bestowed on corporate leaders,&#034; Bogle roared.
<p>While a &#034;few bad apples&#034; caused immense harm, their exposure had a benefit, Bogle said.
<p>&#034;We owe a perverse kind of debt to the fallen apples for illuminating the cracks in the barrel of capitalism,&#034; he said. &#034;We&#039;re all better off now that it&#039;s out in the open.&#034;
<p>While directors may have abdicated their responsibility in overseeing companies, the owners - shareholders - have the ultimate responsibility &#034;and should have stepped in.&#034;
<p>In America today, shareholders essentially means institutional investors such as mutual funds and pension funds: The 100 largest own 56 percent of U.S. equities, Bogle said.
<p>But they did nothing during the stock market bubble, he said.
<p>&#034;The only sound we heard was the sound of silence,&#034; Bogle said.
<p>And that&#039;s because they became a part of the problem, he added, as evidenced by the scandal uncovered by New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer that has engulfed Milwaukee-based Strong Capital Management, among others.
<p>As in some of the businesses they owned shares in, &#034;the interests of the managers prevailed&#034; at the funds, rather than the interests of the investors, Bogle said.
<p>Short-term trading and portfolio turnover to produce fees won out over long-term investing in pursuit of corporate value, said Bogle, who called the change &#034;from stewardship to salesmanship.&#034;
<p>&#034;It was not always that way but it became so in the 1990s,&#034; he said. &#034;I hope the recent scandal helps this industry return to its proud past.&#034;
<p>Bogle urged a return to &#034;corporate democracy&#034; with enhanced shareholder rights.
<p>&#034;The cause is not lost,&#034; he said in laying out eight ideas for reform: Encouraging corporate citizenship; clearly separating ownership from management; returning to a long-term business focus rather than quarter-to-quarter earnings; fixing the stock option mess; letting sunlight shine on accounting; bringing back dividends; reforming the fund industry; and &#034;institutions of the world unite&#034; in pursuit of corporate governance.
<p>&#034;We have eroded the character of capitalism yet character is what we need more than ever today,&#034; Bogle said.</p>
