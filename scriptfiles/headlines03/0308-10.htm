<p>NEW YORK—While Pentagon war planners may be gunning for an attack on Iraq by mid-March, heavily armed soldiers have already quietly seized a strategic position: kids' Easter baskets.<P></P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><table border=0 align=right hspace=5 cellpadding=6 width="225">

Toy military figures, armed with assault rifles and machine guns, are replacing the traditional chocolate bunny as the centerpiece in Easter baskets in U.S. stores this year. One retailer said it was pulling the baskets after complaints. (Toronto Star/Robin Holland) <br>

</table></font></font>U.S. retailers like Kmart and Walgreens have stocked their shelves with baskets in which the traditional chocolate rabbit centerpiece has been displaced by plastic military action figures. Tri-state Rite Aid, Genovese and Wal-Mart stores promise their martial Easter baskets will arrive soon. 

<P></P>At the Astor Place Kmart in New York's Greenwich Village, the encampment is on display just inside the main entrance. A camouflaged sandy-haired soldier with an American-flag arm patch stands alert in a teal, pink and yellow basket beneath a pretty green-and-purple bow. Within a doll-arm's reach are a machine gun, rifle, hand grenade, knife, pistol and round of ammunition. In the next basket a buzz-cut blond with a snazzy dress uniform hawks over homeland security, an American eagle shield on his arm, and a machine gun, pistol, Bowie knife, grenades, truncheon and handcuffs at the ready. <P></P>One must hunt a little harder to find the Easter sniper at Walgreens, but what lies in wait among the bunnies and chicks there is perhaps even more surreal. The Super Wrriors (sic) Battle Set and Placekeepers (sic) Military Men Play Set bristle with toy assault rifles and machine guns, tanks and bomber planes.<P></P> The assortment also includes a space-age ray gun and other imaginary hardware for orbital combat. Packets of jellybeans are tossed in as if an afterthought, nestled in the cellophane underbrush like anti-personnel mines. <P></P>Not surprisingly, the merger of religious observance and jingoistic lust has sparked the ire of Christian leaders. Bishop George Packard, who oversees spiritual care for Episcopalian members of the armed services, is concerned about creating a backlash against the military. He also questions the message sent to Muslims by the melding of a Christian holiday with images of war. <P></P>The products themselves, Packard said, are "really, really bizarre. It's a crass embrace of the far end of a range of options for parents to provide their kids. Easter baskets have been deteriorating for a long time, but they've really gone over the edge. I am so disturbed, I am so confounded by this bad taste." <P></P>Other Christian groups agree. Dr. Richard Land, president of the conservative Southern Baptist Convention commission on ethics and religious liberty, said: "Well, of course, it certainly would be a jarring note for the celebration of Easter. I certainly wouldn't buy one for my children, when my children were small." <P></P>But the religious leaders noted that the eggs, bunnies, and chicks so intimately associated with the holiday are also unrelated to the narrative of Jesus. They are instead the trappings of Ostara (also known as Eostra), a Teutonic goddess of spring and fertility.
