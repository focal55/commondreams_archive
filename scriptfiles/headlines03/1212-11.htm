<p>Television networks in Italy are facing a nationwide weekend walkout - not by staff, but by unhappy viewers. 

<p>Instead of spending Friday, Saturday and Sunday glued to primetime TV, Italians are being urged to go out. 

<p>The strike's organisers, campaign group <a href="http://www.esterni.tv/" target="_new">Esterni</a>, have arranged discounts at a range of venues for people who bring their remote controls with them. 

<p>Organisers say they are expecting around 400,000 people to join the strike against what they call Trash TV. 

<p>Esterni has held Viewers' Strikes in Milan for the past seven years, but this is the first national event with which they hope to show "The power of switching off".

<p>Television is one of the principal causes of dullness and isolation, and is a drain on precious commodity of human time, according to the Esterni website, 
<p>"We want to say to people that there are better ways of spending their free time than to stay home staring at television," said spokeswoman Anna Spreafico. 
<p>Museums, restaurants, bars, theatres and galleries across Italy have signed up to entertain the striking viewers. 
<p>Other organisations are also joining in. 
<p>The Italian Environmental Fund, Italy's equivalent of the National Trust, is offering discounts or free admission to hundreds of its properties, including historic villas, museums and parks. 
<p>Italian television has come under the spotlight recently regarding who controls it. 
<p><b>Telethon clash </b>
<p>Protesters took to the streets earlier this month after the Senate backed a bill that will essentially allow Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi to strengthen his hold on the media. 

<p>The bill reversed a court ruling which would have forced his Mediaset company to sell off one of its three TV stations by 1 January. 

<p>Mr Berlusconi is Italy's richest man, and as well as his three Mediaset channels - Italia 1, Rete 4 and Canale 5 - he holds political influence at the board of state broadcaster Rai. 

<p>Esterni's strike has drawn some political criticism as it coincides with Rai's Telethon to raise cash for charities ahead of Christmas. 

<p>The former Foreign Minister Susanna Agnelli, said the timing showed a "grave lack of sensibility".
