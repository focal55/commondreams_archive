<p>JERUSALEM - An Israeli intelligence

officer who feared a planned air strike would kill innocent

Palestinians foiled the attack by holding back information

critical to the mission, the Maariv newspaper said on Monday.

<P> The officer's act of disobedience this month was the latest

in a series of actions taken by Israelis opposed to the tough

tactics Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has employed against a

Palestinian uprising for statehood.<P> Maariv said the officer, a lieutenant in an elite

intelligence unit, delayed passing on information for an air

raid planned against a Palestinian city after 22 people were

killed on January 6 in a double suicide bombing in Tel Aviv.<P> The officer, who was not identified, told a military

tribunal he acted out of conscience, saying innocent people

would have been killed and calling his orders illegal under

international law, the newspaper reported.<P> The newspaper did not specify the information he withheld.<P> The court tribunal rejected his argument and transferred him

to a less prestigious intelligence unit, Maariv said.<P> Asked about the report, the army spokesman's office

confirmed an intelligence officer was removed from his post

after disobeying a direct order and impairing a military

operation, but the spokesman declined to give details.<P> The army has refused to sanction conscientious objection,

saying Israel's security would be harmed if soldiers were

allowed to opt out of service while the country was locked in

violence with the Palestinians that shows no sign of abating.<P><P> NO &quot;SELECTIVE CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTION&quot;<P> In December, the Supreme Court said it could not back the

idea of &quot;selective conscientious objection&quot; by eight reserve

soldiers who had refused to serve in the West Bank and Gaza

Strip, occupied by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war.<P> Last week, an Israeli state prosecutor mentioned her fears

about her son's pending military service with Sharon as prime

minister as having motivated her to leak information of a

criminal probe of the Israeli leader over election funding.<P> Israelis vote in a general election on Tuesday, and Sharon's

right-wing Likud party holds a commanding lead in opinion polls.<P> Sociologist Oz Almog of Haifa University said some left-wing

Israelis, dismayed by the weakness of Israel's peace camp, were

striking out on their own against the establishment.<P> &quot;This kind of conscientious objection is important and it is

good that we have it,&quot; Almog said of the reservists who refused

to serve on occupied land.<P> &quot;Even though it is on the edge, it makes you think, and we

need it because the edges define the middle,&quot; he told Reuters.<P> But he said he believed such behaviour was &quot;the exception to

the rule&quot; and the &quot;deciding majority of the people&quot; did not

accept such dissidence.<p align="center">Copyright &copy; 2002 Reuters Ltd</p>
