<p>The guerrilla war brewing in Iraq is just one reason the American deployment there is shaping up to be larger and longer than anticipated. Another is the tepid international support for the Bush administration's military campaign to topple Saddam Hussein.



<p>Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said last week that he hoped to enlist as many as 30,000 troops from 49 nations. That is the much advertised coalition of the willing and able that administration officials are hoping can help stabilize Iraq.



<p>The problem, however, is that many of the recruits the Pentagon has tried to line up so far appear to fall into two categories: the not so willing and the not that able.



<p>India, for example, balked this week at sending peacekeeping troops to Iraq. That was a setback not only because the Indians could have sent thousands of soldiers but because the Indians were expected to provide a division, a unit with an established system of command and control that would have been assigned its own area of responsibility. The Indians were able but not willing, at least not yet.



<p>The United States is still banking on the deployment of a Polish-led division. But the key phrase here is "Polish led."



<p>This is to be a division with a Polish headquarters, a few thousand Polish troops, and bits and pieces from Spain, Ukraine and more than a dozen other nations. This is a not tried and tested NATO division. It is a pickup team being assembled from scratch and drawn largely, if not entirely, from foreign militaries with no experience in the region.



<p>It is willing, but the question is, how able. If the United States Army's battle-hardened Third Infantry Division has found itself tested in the Sunni Triangle around Baghdad, consider the challenges that await this polyglot force — even if it is deployed as planned in the tamer Shiite-dominated south.



<p>To be sure, the American forces in Iraq are not alone. The British took Basra and have been providing security for that southern Iraqi city and nearby areas. But when it comes to boots on the ground, the American military does not have a lot of company.



<p>The new chief of the United States Central Command, Gen. John P. Abizaid, said on Wednesday that American military commanders had determined that the optimal number of forces to secure Iraq in the face of a tenacious and, at least on a regional level, organized resistance was 160,000. Currently, he noted, there are about 148,000 American troops and 13,000 allied troops in Iraq.



<p>But the issue is not just one of numbers. It is also a policy issue. When the administration decided to invade Iraq to remove the Saddam Hussein regime, it adopted a new approach toward coalition-building. The administration wanted a free hand in determining when to go to war, what the plan of attack should be and what political process should be put in place in Iraq afterward to ensure that a new government was both democratic and friendly to the United States.



<p>The last thing the United States wanted was a Kosovo-style campaign in which military plans were modified in order to build consensus within an American-led alliance. The United States secured the backing of NATO nations by limiting the scope and intensity of its bombing campaign against Serbia.



<p>Nor did the United States want to assemble the sort of broad coalition for Iraq that President George Bush assembled for the 1991 Persian Gulf war, in which the war aims — in that case, evicting Iraqi forces from Kuwait but not going to Baghdad — were influenced by what the traffic would bear within the coalition.



<p>Rather, the current Bush administration would call the shots, and like-minded nations — the so-called coalition of the able and the willing — could join in. That approach had the advantage of providing the United States with the maximum flexibility in overseeing the war.



<p>But the failure to build broad international backing for the effort also meant that there were relatively few allied forces to help shoulder the military and financial burdens of enforcing the peace. There is a long list of nations that may send forces, but many of the promised foreign deployments are small and largely symbolic. Now that the United States is involved in a messy occupation in Iraq, it has discovered that it is lonely at the top.



<p>In early May, the Pentagon hoped to have less peacekeeping to do and more allies to help do it. The goal was to reduce the level of American forces to less than two divisions by September — "one division plus" in the military vernacular, or a force of perhaps 50,000 or fewer troops. But the plan assumed that resistance would be reduced and that capable allied forces would be deployed, neither of which has occurred.



<p>The United States Army is especially eager to bring home the bone-weary Third Infantry Division, which led the charge to Baghdad and still has two of its three brigades on peacekeeping duty. The Second Brigade is one of them. It was the first Army force to rumble into downtown Baghdad and is now pulling peacekeeping duty in Fallujah. Mr. Rumsfeld indicated just last week that the Second Brigade was to head south to Kuwait this month so that it could return to the United States in August.



<p>But after senior military commanders conferred with the top American administrator in Iraq, L. Paul Bremer III, they concluded that the mounting guerrilla attacks and delays in enlisting allied support made this an inopportune moment to withdraw more American forces. As General Abizaid put it to his commanders, in order for "a brigade to come out, we need to have an equivalent capability or either U.S. or coalition troops arrive."



<p>Given that this was the second time that the Second Brigade's tour in Iraq was extended, the news was a bitter pill for many troops. But given the generals' security calculus, there was really no other choice.



<p>The administration may yet succeed in securing the deployment of militarily significant allied forces. An appeal for foreign troops from Iraq's new interim Governing Council could give India and other nations the political cover they need to send forces. So might passage of a new United Nations Security Council resolution, a subject that foreign leaders have broached with Secretary of State Colin L. Powell.



<p>It is possible for the United States to set the strategy for war and receive substantial allied assistance in administering the peace. But the cause has to have broad international backing.



<p>Afghanistan was one example. The United States intervened to shut down Al Qaeda's camps and punish the Taliban for giving sanctuary to terrorists. Now that the Taliban have been toppled, Germany and the Netherlands are leading the peacekeeping force, the French have been training the Afghan Army and NATO is gearing up to take over the peacekeeping mission.



<p>The conflict in Iraq may offer an important, if painful, lesson for future military campaigns, particularly those that involve "regime change" and the arduous nation-building that is needed to cope with the power vacuum that follows. The lesson is that broad international support is not only desirable politically, it can also offer a real military advantage.
