<p>WASHINGTON --   As Iraq struggles to get back on its feet after three major wars and 35 years of as brutal dictatorship, it is being helmed by a group of American executives and government officials handpicked by the Bush administration to rout the Baathists and restore functions to the government, ministry by ministry.</p><p>
 The effort is being led by <b>L. Paul Bremer</b>, a former State Department official and ambassador to Netherlands, who took over for retired Army Lt. Gen. <b>Jay Garner</b> on May 7. Bremer came in on a wave of pink slips -- most notably for former Ambassador <b>Barbara Bodine</b>, who was assigned to run Baghdad, and for Ambassador <b>Margaret Tutwiler</b>, Garner's communications chief, the U.S. ambassador to Morocco, and a former State Department and White House staffer.</p><p>
 The "housecleaning" at the Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance, which is overseeing the so-far troubled reconstruction of Iraq, hinged on the philosophy toward allowing Baath party members to hold government post in the new organization, according to Pentagon officials. </p><p>
 On one side were the so-called realists, like Bodine, who believed it was important to first get the government ministries back up and running and then purge the Baathists. The Ministry of Industry, the Health Ministry and Baghdad University were all initially put in the hands of known Baathists.</p><p>
 On the other and ultimately prevailing side, hewed to by Bremer, were those who believed if the Iraqi government has any Baathists in charge for any period of time it would alienate the Iraqi people and make the U.S. effort to oust Saddam Hussein look hollow.</p><p>
 Twenty-five Iraq government ministries are now being run by U.S., British, Italian and Australian "advisers," charged with selecting Iraqis to head each office and given veto powers over policies and decisions.</p><p>
 Sources in ORHA caution that some ministry posts are changing, and said the following list is current as of May 24.</p><p>
 Among the ministers is former Shell Oil chief <b>Philip Carroll</b>, who also headed the Fluor Corp., one of six companies hired by the Defense Department before the war in a closed bid for Iraq reconstruction projects. Under his leadership the corporation gave $483,000 in individual, political action committee and soft money contributions to political campaigns between 1999 and 2002, 57 percent of it to Republicans. Carroll retired from Fluor last year.</p><p>
 Carroll is the senior adviser to the Ministry of Oil.</p><p>
 <b>David Nummy</b> is the senior adviser to the Ministry of Finance. Formerly, Nummy has served as senior adviser for budget policy and management in the Treasury Department's technical assistance program, as a staff member of the Senate Budget Committee, and as assistant secretary for management of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. Nummy was comptroller for the senior President George H. W. Bush's presidential campaign in 1988.</p><p>
 <b>George Mullinax</b>, a Treasury Department official, is the senior adviser to the Central Bank. He will oversee the transition to a new Iraqi currency and is known as the man who announced the Saddam Hussein family's removal of about $1 billion from the bank just prior to the war.</p><p>
 Former U.S. Ambassador to Tunisia <b>Robin Raphel</b> is senior adviser to the Ministry of Trade. She was the assistant secretary of state for South Asia under Clinton, from 1993 to 1997, and was the chief U.S. voice for building an oil pipeline across Afghanistan during the Taliban regime. The deal was later scuttled when it became clear how extreme the Taliban government was. Raphel is vice president of the National Defense University.</p><p>

Carney was quoted in Vanity Fair magazine last year criticizing the State Department and CIA's handling of Sudanese intelligence about al-Qaida head Osama bin Laden. The New York Times reported in early May Carney was among the senior advisers who would be removed.</p><p>
  The senior adviser to the Ministry of Interior is <b>Bob Gifford</b>, a policing expert from the U.S. Department of State who also served as an adviser in Afghanistan, according to the British newspaper The Independent.</p><p>
  <b>Bernard Kerrick</b>, the former chief of police in New York City who was as his post on Sept. 11, 2001, is special adviser to the police. Most recently, Kerrick has been working in former Mayor Rudy Giuliani's consulting firm.</p><p>

He served from 1988-92 in Saudi Arabia as deputy ambassador, including 15 months as acting ambassador. His other Foreign Service assignments have included director of Egyptian affairs in the Department of State in Washington, chief of the American Embassy Economic Section in Cairo  and deputy assistant U.S. trade representative in the executive office of the president.</p><p>
