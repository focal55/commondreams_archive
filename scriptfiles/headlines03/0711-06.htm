<p>WASHINGTON - Rep. Eliot Engel (D-Bronx) and other Democrats who supported the Iraq war complained yesterday that the Bush administration is mishandling the war's aftermath, and compared it to the intransigence they said America showed in the Vietnam War.
<p> Engel and Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.), who also voted for the war, separately called for more international troops to be sent to Iraq to secure the peace. Engel called for NATO to take over the operation and for getting more Iraqis involved in leading their nation.
<p> "Vietnam was much longer, but we can see the same kind of thinking that got us involved in Vietnam and refused to change course," Engel said. "It's so obvious to anyone that what we're doing in Iraq in terms of the occupation is not working."
<p> "We cannot let complacency continue to lead us into another situation like Vietnam where failed policies undermined the mission," he said.
<p> Kerry also called for more help in Iraq from other nations. "It's time for the president to tell the truth: We lack sufficient forces to do the job of reconstruction in Iraq and withdraw in a reasonable period. International support and alliances are not weakness, but strengths," he said.
<p> Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr. (D-N.J.), who joined Engel at a news conference, said the veracity of the Bush administration's word is at stake. 
<p> "We are owed an explanation, you are owed an explanation as American citizens" as to why the administration used inaccurate information regarding Iraq's alleged purchase of uranium from an African nation, he said.
<p> The criticism was among the stiffest by Democrats who voted for the war. It came just days after the Bush administration acknowledged that the president's statement in his State of the Union speech in January that Iraq tried to buy uranium from Africa was based on bad information.
<p> Kerry, a decorated Vietnam veteran, at first declined to compare the wars, but later drew an analogy to the U.S. leadership in the 1960s and 1970s when the Vietnam war was escalating.
<p> "I learned a long time ago in Vietnam what happens when pride gets in the way of making honest decisions," Kerry said. "We carried that war on for too many years because of pride."
<p> There are nearly 150,000 U.S. troops currently in Iraq. Yesterday, attacks on American troops killed at least two more Americans, bringing the total to more than 31 killed since President George W. Bush said the major fighting was over on May 1.
<p> Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who was a prisoner of war in Vietnam for 5½ years, dismissed the Vietnam analogy but called on Bush to be more forthcoming about the course of events in Iraq.
<p> McCain cited two reasons why the analogy doesn't fit.
<p> "No. 1, the overwhelming majority of the American people support what we did, and two, we won," he said. "I guess that should be No. 1, we won."
<p> McCain said Americans "were surprised when 'Mission Accomplished' was on the aircraft carrier and soldiers kept dying. That's where they've got to be given better and more precise information. But I don't buy a Vietnam analogy, really."
