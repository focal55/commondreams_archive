<p>In what must rank as a warning to all footballers with short tempers who may think of playing in Oklahoma, a man has been jailed for life for spitting at a policeman. 

<p>John Marquez, 35, was sentenced this week for spitting at the police officer, who was trying to arrest him, in Sapulpa, Oklahoma. 

<p>April Sellers White, the judge in Creek County acted on the recommendation of the jury who convicted Marquez under a law which makes it a felony to place bodily fluids on law enforcement officers. 

<p>The prosecution had asked for the milder sentence of 25 years. Marquez's lawyer, Jason Sterner, had suggested four years. Mr Sterner said that an appeal would be launched. 

<p>The law under which Marquez was sentenced was introduced in Oklahoma in 1996 and was aimed at protecting police officers from people with Aids attacking and possibly infecting them. 

<p>Marquez is a convicted rapist but it was not rape he was charged with when he appeared in court. 

<p>He had allegedly spat at police officer Charles Gadd as he was being arrested following a domestic argument in which a woman's arm was broken. He received a one-year sentence for that offence. 

<p>The court heard Marquez spat at the officer despite being warned not to and then bit the officer as he tried to stop him from spitting. 

<p>He was convicted in May but sentencing only took place this week. 

<p>Hundreds of prisoners are serving sentences of 25 years or more in California for such offences as shoplifting and drug possession. 

<p>These sentences are a result of the so-called "three strike" law which imposes a minimum of 25 years for a third felony conviction. 

<p>In a case earlier this year, the supreme court ruled that 50 years for shoplifting videos was not a "cruel and unusual punishment".
