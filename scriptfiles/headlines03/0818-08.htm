<p>REYKJAVIK, Iceland -- Three ships commissioned by Iceland's government left port yesterday to begin hunting for 38 minke whales during the next six weeks, despite the protests of conservationists and several governments.



<p>The Sigurbjorg, the Njordur, and the Halldor Sigurdsson are participating in a hunt that Iceland says is intended for scientific research, but which the United States, Britain, and several other governments have labeled unnecessary.



<p>All three ships were scheduled to set out Friday, but were delayed by bad weather.



<p>Iceland has declined to give information about the ship's routes and has sought to prevent photos -- rejecting media requests to monitor the killings and ordering captains not to fire harpoons if other vessels are near.



<p>Conservationists have said they want to draw the world's attention to the hunt. The International Fund for Animal Welfare has representatives in Reykjavik, the capital, and the Greenpeace flagship Rainbow Warrior is on its way to the country.



<p>Iceland state radio reported that the Sigurbjorg left just before 1 a.m. The Njordur left Kopavogur harbor, south of Reykjavik, about 3:30 p.m. -- trailed by a ship carrying Gill Sanders, representing the International Fund for Animal Welfare.



<p>Sanders planned to monitor the first kill to see how long it takes for a minke whale to die. "It's going to be the most distressing thing of my life," she said. "But that's why I'm here, and we need to know exactly what's going on."



<p>The Halldor Sigurdsson left Isafjordur harbor, in northwestern Iceland, at 5 p.m. No kills have been reported from any of the boats.



<p>The hunters plan to kill 38 whales during August and September. The government says the cull is needed to study the stomach contents of the mammals to measure their effect on fish stocks such as cod, which are vital to the national economy.



<p>The International Whaling Commission banned commercial whaling in 1986 to protect the endangered mammals, but approved restricted hauls for research programs. Iceland carried out research whaling for three years after the ban -- catching fin and sei whales -- but then halted the hunts altogether in 1989.



<p>Nations opposed to whaling, including the United States, say there is no scientific basis for Iceland's research. Animal welfare groups fear the hunt is intended to gauge international reaction before the resumption of commercial whaling. Whale meat not used by scientists for research will be sold to consumers in Iceland.



<p>The country's Marine Research Institute estimates there are 43,000 minke whales in Icelandic waters and says the hunts will not affect the population.
