<p>L'HOSPITALET-DU-LARZAC, France  -  Newly released from prison, French eco-warrior Jose Bove returned to the fray, taking star-billing at a rally on the Larzac plateau in southern France attended by tens of thousands of anti-globalization and other left-wing activists.

</table></font>Called to denounce next month's World Trade Organization (WTO) talks in the Mexican resort of Cancun, the three-day <a href="http://www.monde-solidaire.org/larzac-2003/uk/index.html" target="_new">Larzac 2003</a> festival includes speeches, debates, street theatre and cinema shows, as well as a rock concert featuring French singer Manu Chao and British group Asian Dub Foundation.
<p>Bove, 50, was to deliver the opening address, six days after leaving jail six weeks into a 10-month sentence for destroying genetically modified crops.
<p>The mustachioed campaigner saw part of his term amnestied by President Jacques Chirac, and a judge ruled he could serve the rest under a conditional release program.
<p>In searing heat cars and buses converged throughout the day on the chalky uplands outside the town of Millau, scene of Bove's most controversial brush with the law when he helped destroy a partially-built McDonald's restaurant in a protest against US trade sanctions in August 1999.
<p>The organizers of the Larzac rally -- a coalition of anti-globalization groups including Attac and Bove's Small Farmers' Confederation -- said the aim was to draw attention to the danger to democracy posed by the WTO, trade liberalization and multinational corporations.
<p>&quot;Matters are urgent because the WTO is preparing nothing less then the final touches for the privatization of the planet, with disastrous and irreversible consequences for the whole of humanity,&quot; the organizing committee said on the Larzac 2003 website.
<p>&quot;Cancun must be another Seattle,&quot; it said, in reference to the 1999 WTO talks in the western US city which were scuppered by protests on the street.
<p>Also attending the Larzac rally were representatives of French protest movements -- including teachers, performance artists and public sector unions -- who hope to prepare a new campaign against the country's center-right government after the summer break.

</table></font>&quot;It is a year since we decided to organize this rally against the WTO summit in Cancun. In the spring a number of social movements emerged, first against pension reform, then teachers and artists,&quot; Bove told French radio.
<p>&quot;These people came to see that they are victims of the same logic of the market, now extending into areas that have nothing to do with trade -- and that is why they are here today,&quot; he said.
<p>For 30 years the stunning Larzac plateau has been an emblematic location for the French left, after veterans of the 1968 student movement successfully joined forces with local farmers to resist government attempts to turn it into an army shooting range. Bove himself works as a sheep-farmer on the plateau.
<p>In June 2000 around 50,000 activists camped near Millau for a rally that coincided with the trial of Bove and nine others for the McDonald's incident. Bove eventually served six weeks in jail in 2002 for that offense, and in June this year returned to prison on two counts of uprooting GM crops.
