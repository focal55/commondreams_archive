<p>The deaths of at least 14 Italian troops in Iraq have sparked demands for the 3,000-strong force to be pulled out.
<p>The government insisted the mission would continue, but opposition leaders said the UN should take over.

  </table></font>"The Italian servicemen must come back home. It is the only right thing to do now," said Pietro Folena from the Democrats of the Left.
<p>"Italy should realign itself with France and Germany, withdraw its troops and start a debate with the USA and UK for them to stop their occupation.
<p>"They should give full power and full mandate to the UN to deal with the difficult situation in that country," he added.
<p>For the leader of Italian Communists, Oliviero Diliberto, the government carries responsibility for the Italian casualties in Iraq.
<p>"In the face of this huge tragedy, I will ask only one question: in whose name have they been sent to death?" he said
<p>"Had [the government] listened to us, our troops would not have been sent to die."
<p><b>'Immoral"
</b>
<p>Green leader Alfonso Pecoraro Scanio said troops should be pulled out of Iraq.
<p>"It is immoral to put the lives of thousands of young Italians at risk for Bush's pre-emptive war," he said.
<p>"We hope that everybody will agree that we need to pull out our troops immediately."

</table>Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, after consulting with Interior Minister Giuseppe Pisanu, voiced his grief over the losses, but insisted the operation should go on.
<p>"No intimidation should distract us from our will to help that country rise up again and build up self-government, security and freedom," he said.
<p>The European Commission president, Italy's Romano Prodi, on an official state visit to Senegal, has called for peacekeeping operations in Iraq to be taken over by the UN.
<p>"We must move on to a phase where the UN has a greater involvement in achieving peace, a phase in which greater weight and power must be given to the Iraqi people within the Iraqi Government, Mr Prodi said.
<p>"I had always thanked God because the Italians had been spared, but our fears were justified: this time it was our turn."
<p>Pope John Paul II has sent a telegram of condolences to President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, in which he expressed his "grief" over the "cowardly attack".
<p>Sessions in both Italian houses of parliament have been suspended, and Defence Minister Antonio Martino was expected to address parliament on the attack at 1400 GMT.
