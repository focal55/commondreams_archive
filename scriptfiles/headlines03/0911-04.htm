<p>Sweden was in a state of emotional shock after Foreign Minister Anna Lindh died from knife injuries inflicted by an unknown assailant just days before a key referendum on adopting the euro.</p>
<p>Doctors had fought for Lindh's life through the night after she was stabbed on Wednesday in the arm, abdomen and chest, but she succumbed to massive internal bleeding caused by a damaged liver, the Karolinska hospital said.</p>

</table></font>"It is with great sorrow that I received the news that Sweden's foreign minister, Anna Lindh, at 5:29 (0329 GMT) this morning died of the injuries she sustained in yesterday's attack," Prime Minister Goeran Persson told reporters.</p>
<p>"It feels unreal, it is difficult to truly understand," said Persson, his voice cracking with emotion. But he added later that the hotly-contested referendum on whether to adopt the euro as the country's currency would go ahead as planned on Sunday.</p>
<p>Lindh was one of Sweden's best-loved politicians, and as tributes poured in from across the globe, thousands of shocked and grieving Swedes gathered at sites across Stockholm, including the NK department store where Lindh, who had two children, was attacked as she was out shopping.</p>
<p>Many broke down in tears as they laid flowers, cards and small tokens of remembrance at the government's offices for one of the country's most popular and admired politicians, who had campaigned hard for a "yes" vote in the euro referendum.</p>
<p>"All of Europe is in mourning," said Italy's Foreign Minister Franco Frattini whose country holds the European Union presidency, as the EU headquarters in Brussels ordered flags to be flown at half-mast.</p>
<p>And UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, a personal friend, paid tribute to a "great foreign minister, a great Swede and a great European."</p>
<p>Swedish police stepped up their hunt for her assailant, with hundreds of police officers across the country drafted in for the manhunt.</p>
<p>A nationwide alert has been issued for the suspect, a man described as being 1.80 meters (five foot, nine inches) tall and wearing a military camouflage jacket and a baseball cap.</p>
<p>"He has a strong build and a haggard face," Leif Jennekvist, head of the Stockholm crime squad, told reporters.</p>
<p>Police said they were not ruling out any leads, including the possibility of a politically-motivated attack.</p>
<p>Jennekvist said he believed that the attacker had acted alone.</p>
<p>Lindh was a heavyweight on Sweden's political scene who had been tipped to succeed Persson as prime minister.</p>
<p>The attack on Lindh, who was without a bodyguard, brought back memories of the 1986 assassination of former prime minister Olof Palme as he was leaving a cinema in downtown Stockholm.</p>
<p>It has also re-ignited the debate on whether Sweden's top politicians are well enough protected.</p>
<p>"Our country is known for its openness, known for being a democratic society where the people and their elected representatives are and should be very close, a tolerant society unique in its closeness," Persson told the news conference.</p>
<p>Christian Democratic leader Alf Svensson said he was "at a loss for words to describe the sorrow and anger" he felt at the news of Lindh's death.</p>
<p>"What should never have happened, has just happened again," he said, referring to the Palme assassination.</p>
<p>"For the second time in a short time span, a great personality of our country is brutally murdered," he said.</p>
<p>Lindh herself, was an outspoken critic of tight security surrounding top politicians in other countries.</p>
<p>"We must defend this special little political environment we have -- that we don't have blue lights and sirens like they do in other countries," Lindh said in a recent interview, re-broadcast by Swedish television hours after her death was announced.</p>
<p>Persson meanwhile pledged his government would not let Lindh's assassination derail the referendum, although all campaigning has now been called off. "It is important that we do not in any way succumb to the violence," he said.</p>
<p>The issue of abandoning the country's krona in favour of the euro has been hotly debated, with polls suggesting the "no" vote ahead of the "yes" camp. The result will have far reaching implications for the 15-member European Union.</p>
<p>A member of Sweden's ruling Social Democratic party, Lindh became foreign minister in 1998. She was voted the fourth most admired woman in Sweden in a recent survey.</p>
<p>She leaves behind her husband, a local Swedish politician, and two children.</p>
