<p>CAIRO - Most Arab media on Tuesday blamed the  U.S. failure to provide security in Baghdad for the latest  suicide bombings in the Iraqi capital.<p> 
			
							They agreed that Washington had only itself to blame for  the chaos and said the United States had failed Iraqis by not  providing enough security to prevent the devastating attacks  that killed 35 people on Monday, the start of the Muslim holy  month of Ramadan.<p> 
			
							"Iraq, on the first day of Ramadan, was the scene of a  bloodbath and occupation forces are directly responsible for  this because of the instability they created in Iraq," wrote  the daily al-Khaleej, published in the United Arab Emirates.<p>

  </table></font>But, like others, the daily said it feared the bombings,  that included an attack on the Red Cross headquarters in  Baghdad, would only extend the U.S. occupation that many in the  region see as a thinly veiled act of colonialism.<p> 
			
							"The bombing which targeted a humanitarian organization...  serves the occupation and extends it instead of ending it," the  UAE daily said.<p> 
			
							Saudi Arabia's leading al-Riyadh newspaper said the United  States had to give up its dreams of controlling Iraq and the  whole region or face further attacks.<p> 
			
							"The political bubble has burst in Baghdad. Will it be  followed by other explosions or will the voice of reason  prevail over the American dream of hegemony?" the Arabic daily  wrote.<p> 
			
							Some were outspoken against those who carried out the  attacks that cost the lives of dozens of Iraqis and wounded 230  by targeting the Red Cross and three police stations.<p> 
			
							"What happened yesterday in Baghdad is a crime by all  measures, but it is more disgraceful than a crime: it is a  deadly political mistake," wrote Lebanon's as-Safir daily.<p> 
			
							"Such political mistakes help the occupation to justify its  horrible crimes," it added.<p> 
			
							Yemeni journalist Fares Ghanim said U.S. mistakes were  driving people to despair. "If the security situation continues  it will provide a fertile ground for Muslim extremists who want  to take revenge on Americans," he said.<p> 
			
							In non-Arab Iran, reformist parliamentarian Reza Yousefian  said: "It is unjustifiable to kill ordinary people in the name  of an anti-American campaign. On the contrary, the more  insecurity prevails in Iraq, the longer Americans will stay."<p> 
			
							Egypt's Al-Akhbar daily said the message was clear:<p> 
			
							"The only way to disentangle from this deadlock in which  the United States finds itself and to avoid becoming mired in a  swamp is to speed up the hand over of power to Iraqis."
