<p> LONDON  - 
The postwar director of U.S.-backed
Iraqi Television has quit, saying the United States is losing
the propaganda war to countries like Iran and to the fugitive Saddam Hussein.
<p>
 Three months after being flown to Baghdad on board a U.S.
plane to relaunch Iraqi television and radio, former exile
Ahmad Rikabi is disillusioned and back in London for the
foreseeable future.
 
<p>
 "Saddam Hussein is doing better at marketing himself,
through Al Jazeera and Al Arabiya Gulf channels," Rikabi said,
referring to the audio tapes believed to be from the former
Iraqi leader which have been supplied to those stations and
broadcast across the region.
 
<p>
 He said that as the United States failed to invest in Iraqi
stations or to retain local staff, channels such as Iran's Al
Alam and Qatar's Al Jazeera were gaining popularity in Iraq.
 
<p>
 "The people of Iraq, including the Sunni Muslims, are not
about to turn against their liberators, but they are being
incited to do so. These channels contribute to tension within
Iraq. You need television at their level," he told Reuters.
 
<p>
 Rikabi uttered the first words broadcast on Iraqi national
airwaves after the fall of Saddam Hussein on April 9.
 
<p>
 "Welcome to the new Iraq. Welcome to an Iraq without
Saddam, Uday or Qusay," Rikabi's emotional voice said in a
radio broadcast over a transmitter erected by U.S. soldiers at
Baghdad airport.
 
<p>
 One of the first acts of the new director was to broadcast
the Shi'ite call to prayer, along with the Sunni one -- a
symbol of equality after decades of discrimination against the
Shi'ite majority by the former ruling Baath Party.
 
<p>
 Rikabi helped recruit a team that got transmission up to 16
hours a day, operating out of a convention center in Baghdad
that included a fortified bedroom once reserved for Saddam.
 
<p>
 But many of the staff have now left, Rikabi said, adding
that locals were being paid too little.
 
<p>
 SAIC, a California-based company contracted to relaunch the
television station, said it had no comment on Rikabi's remarks.
 
<p>
 "The United States needs to listen to Iraqis more, and not
just in the media sector," Rikabi said.
 
<p>
 BRIGHT FUTURE
 
<p>
 In exile Rikabi worked with the U.S.-funded Radio Free
Iraq, dreaming of return. Of the millions of Iraqis in the
diaspora, he was among the first of only a few to have returned
to Iraq since the fall of Saddam.
 
<p>
 He had never seen his homeland before, his father and
mother having escaped from Iraq in the year he was born, 1969.
He met his brother, a colonel in the now defunct Iraqi army,
for the first time in April.
 
<p>
 "It will take us generations to repair what Saddam did.
Iraqi society runs on lies. There is virtually no independent
thinking. Sycophancy and sectarianism are rife," he said.
 
<p>
 But the broadcaster and writer said he remained optimistic
that Iraq would recover. Elections and employment, he said,
would give everyone a stake in the country.
<p>
 "People will not invest as long as you have assassinations,
military operations, curfews and checkpoints," he said.
<p>
Iraq's lot, he said, would be worse if the U.S. troops now
pulled out, as the guerrillas who attack them daily want.
<p>
"The street does not support those behind the instability.
People know that only the U.S. presence is preventing a blood
bath in the form of revenge against the Baathists," he said.typical of everything the Americans get involved in. They announce large budgets and the money is never released."
