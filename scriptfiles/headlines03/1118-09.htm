<p>MIAMI -- Civil society opponents and corporate boosters of a proposed Americas free trade deal found themselves on the same side Monday--against a last-minute proposal by Brazil and the United States. 
<p>
 The plan, revealed at Sunday night talks between trade officials that ended prematurely in failure, would let the 34 nations of the proposed Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) opt in or out of particular provisions.

</table>There is an agreement between Mercosur and the United States on this vision of the FTAA that will allow flexibility in certain areas and that countries will be allowed to be engaged in 'plurilateral' agreements, so that an FTAA will not impose on the 34 countries the same obligations, Brazilian diplomat and FTAA negotiator Luiz Filipe de Macedo Soares told IPS. 
<p>
 So, they will be able to choose. 
<p>
 The members of Mercosur are Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. While Uruguay is siding with Washington on the FTAA, South America's Chile has joined the other Mercosur nations led by Brazil, which is co-chairing the weeklong talks here with the United States. 
<p>
 The FTAA would establish the world's largest trading bloc, covering some 800 million people. 
<p>
 The U.S.-Brazil proposal appears to be a diplomatic way out of a deadlock between Washington, the main force behind the draft FTAA, and some South American countries led by Brazil, the largest economy in Latin America, over the scope of the agreement. 
<p>
 Washington refuses to cut domestic farm subsidies, which Brazil complains undercut poor farmers by pushing prices to ever-lower levels, and to change its anti-dumping laws, which the South Americans say raise tariffs and other obstacles to Brazilian exports like citrus and steel. 
<p>
 U.S. trade officials expressed optimism about the deal Monday, saying they are still working for a comprehensive agreement, but have declined to give details. 
<p>
 But civil society groups censured the new U.S.-Brazil proposal, saying it seeks to rescue the FTAA from the impasse created by the substantial difference between countries about the scope of the plan. 
<p>
 It doesn't offer a solution that will promote development and poverty reduction for the 220 million people in poverty in the hemisphere, said Phil Bloomer, who heads the trade campaign for international charity group Oxfam. 
<p>
 Instead it creates new dangers. It will open up smaller countries to new political pressures to sign bilateral agreements that go further than (World Trade Organization) WTO agreements and even the current FTAA, he said. 
<p>
 In fact, Washington is already negotiating a free trade deal with five Central American nations, and has announced it wants to include the Dominican Republic in that initiative. Earlier this month Peru and Colombia said they would soon announce the start of free trade talks with the United States. 
<p>
 U.S. business groups, meeting here under the Americas Business Forum, also voiced concerns about the proposal. 
<p>
 Larry A. Liebenow, chairman of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, told a business luncheon his group opposes the move. ''The past six months have witnessed a hemispheric debate over the basic architecture of the FTAA,'' he said. 
<p>
 Some governments participating in the negotiations have proposed to shut down a number of the FTAA's nine negotiating groups. This would be a lost opportunity of tragic proportions.'' 
<p>
 Reports are that other countries--including Canada, Mexico and Chile--are reluctant to embrace the new proposal, arguing that the FTAA should benefit all nations equally and not be transformed into a patchwork of arrangements. 
<p>
Brazilian officials told reporters Monday that the deputy trade ministers of the 34 countries meet in Miami agreed on two-thirds of the final declaration scheduled to be approved by trade ministers at week's end. Other issues are still under discussion, they said. 
<p>
Washington also used the first day of the meeting to go on the offensive against critical civil society groups. 
<p>
Literature distributed by the United States Trade Representative (USTR) came out strongly in defense of the proposed agreement, which many Latin American countries, economists and civil society groups say is an endeavor to enrich U.S. corporations and establish Washington's hegemony in the western hemisphere. 
<p>
The groups complain that the FTAA will lead to fewer jobs, weaken environmental laws, and lower labor standards. They also charge the deal will allow corporations to sue governments to overturn local laws. 
<p>
These organizations--including labor unions, student organizations and farmers' associations--say the agreement is undemocratic because talks are being held behind closed doors. 
<p>
In a booklet, the USTR called accusations from civil society myths. 
<p>
It said that Washington had worked hard to provide an unprecedented opportunity for civil society organizations to meet inside the security perimeter in Miami. That invitation was refused by some groups as an effort to "whitewash" the results. 
<p>
But while we opened the door, some protest groups refused to walk through it and are boycotting the civil society forum, added the statement.

"One of the things that killed the civil rights movement," Mr. Seiger added, "was getting what they asked for."
