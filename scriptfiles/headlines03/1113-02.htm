<p>BAGHDAD - 

If Washington doubts there is Iraqi
public support for guerrillas killing its troops, it should
consider the teenagers who happily watched American blood spill
on Wednesday.
<p>
 After a roadside bomb ripped through a military vehicle and
wounded two soldiers, Iraqi boys rushed out of their homes to
survey the damage.
<p>
 "This is good. If they ask me, I will join the resistance.
The Americans have to die," said Ali Qais, 15. "They are just
here to steal our oil."

  </table></font>The U.S. administration has long dismissed the guerrillas
as isolated "terrorists" who are Saddam Hussein loyalists or
foreign Islamic militants.
<p>
 But the scene in the Sarafiya district of Baghdad suggests
they are winning the sympathy of Iraqis, whose joy at Saddam's
fall has been overshadowed by anti-American rage.
<p>
 Teenage boys were irritated to hear that two American
soldiers were just wounded, not killed.
<p>
 "I saw them pushing their hands onto one of the Americans'
chest. They must have died. One soldier's friend was crying,"
said Abdullah Oman, 18.
<p>
 His fury has been fueled by what he says is an American
desire to humiliate all Iraqis.
<p>
 He even believes that U.S. troops plant the bombs
themselves, risking American lives to terrify and kill Iraqis.
<p>
 "They are watching us die and laughing. They humiliate us.
They handcuffed me and arrested me in front of my parents late
one night because I stood on my house porch after curfew," he
said.
<p>
 A new CIA  report on Iraq  warns of growing popular support
for insurgents combating U.S. occupation forces and says
efforts to rebuild the country could collapse without immediate
corrective action, the Philadelphia Inquirer said on Wednesday.
<p>
 The newspaper, quoting unnamed administration officials,
also said in an article that the classified document's bleak
view of the situation in Iraq has been privately endorsed by
Iraq's U.S. governor, Paul Bremer.
<p>
 Guerrillas have killed 155 American soldiers since
President Bush  declared major combat over on May 1.
<p>
 In the months after the war, Iraqis voiced frustration with
the American failure to crack down on looters and restore basic
services.
<p>
 Now talk has turned increasingly violent, especially among
teenagers. They have watched American soldiers arrest their
fathers and body-search their mothers during intrusive raids.
<p>
 Iraqis are angrier and guerrillas are carrying out more
spectacular attacks such as suicide bombings and mortar strikes
on the main U.S. compound in Saddam's former palace.
<p>
 Shortly after Wednesday's bombing teenagers in Sarafiya
picked up leaflets from a group calling itself the Army of
Mohammad.
<p>
 "Patience, patience Baghdad. The occupation army will be
destroyed," the leaflets said.
<p>
Residents of the working-class area watched as a U.S.
soldier poured water and sand over the pools of blood from his
comrades.
<p>
"I want to join these Iraqi fighters. I want to hit the
Americans, the infidels," said Ali Ahmed, 10.
