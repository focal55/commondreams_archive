<p>NEW YORK  - 

When it comes to making money from a

war in Iraq, few can match the firepower of the company once

headed by Vice President Dick Cheney.

<p>

 Houston-based Halliburton Co.  can build roads and

bridges and camps for American forces. It can transport

personnel and provide other logistics. It can fight any fires

Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein  might set. And after the war,

assuming a U.S. victory, it can help restore Iraq's

infrastructure and oil production.

<p>

 While questions remain over how much the work will boost

the company's stock price, Halliburton's KBR engineering and

construction division "is basically the 'corps of engineers' to

the U.S. military," said Jim Wicklund, an analyst at Banc of

America Securities. "It is expected that the occupying army's

infrastructure could in large part be supplied by KBR."

<p>

 At the same time, the company's oilfield services business,

which is second only to Schlumberger Ltd., is likely to

supply most of the heavy equipment to fight fires that Iraqi

forces could set to oil wells and oil fields, as they did in

Kuwait during the 1991 Persian Gulf War.

<p>

 And should the U.S. emerge victorious, Halliburton -- which

develops oil fields and drills for oil all over the world --

has the connections and businesses to play a major role in

rebuilding Iraq and ramping the nation's oil production

capacity back up to pre-1991 Persian Gulf War levels.

<p>

 "They have the businesses. They have the government

relationship already well-established, and, as we all know,

Cheney was the CEO, so it makes logical sense," said Denis

Walsh, an equity analyst who covers the energy sector for State

Street Research and Management.

<p>

 NO COMMENT ON CONTRACTS

<p>

 A Halliburton spokeswoman declined to speculate on "what

may or may not happen with regards to Iraq."

<p>

 She referred all queries to the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) and the U.S. Agency for International Development, which

both said that contracts for fighting fires and rebuilding

Iraq's infrastructure have yet to be awarded. Neither agency

would disclose whether Halliburton had submitted any bids.

<p>

Other companies that could bid for firefighting contracts

include Boots & Coots International Well Control Inc.,

Canada's Safety Boss Inc., RPC Inc.'s Cudd Pressure

Control and Superior Energy Services Inc.'s  Wild Well

Control Inc.

 <p>

 Reports earlier this month said that Halliburton won a

contract to oversee firefighting in Iraq's oilfields but that

has not been confirmed by either the company or the DOD.

 <p>

 "It is our information that a contract framework has

already been signed," said Wicklund, who rates Halliburton a

"buy" and does not own any of its shares.

 <p>

 This wouldn't be the first time Halliburton has played an

important role in a U.S. war. Years before Cheney's stint at

the helm, a predecessor company built the Corpus Christi Naval

Air Station and several warships during World War II. It also

helped build the Phan Rang Air Base in Vietnam in 1965.

 <p>

 More recently, after the Persian Gulf War, Halliburton

helped put out oil well fires and repaired damaged buildings in

Kuwait. It also provided food, laundry, transportation and

other services to U.S. peacekeeping forces in Bosnia, Croatia

and Hungary during the Balkans conflict in the 1990s.

 <p>

 Estimates of how much Halliburton and other companies could

reap from the infrastructure and restoration work vary, but

analyst Michael Urban of Deutsche Bank said it could be as much

as a total of &#36;3 billion.

 <p>

 DON'T QUIT YOUR DAY JOB

 <p>

 How much Halliburton would get is difficult to gauge,

though any contracts it wins would certainly generate revenue,

cash flow and earnings.

 <p>

 The potential contracts come at a time when Halliburton is

contending with its liability for asbestos-related personal

injury lawsuits, though the company made progress last December

with a &#36;4 billion settlement deal.

<p>

"The stock price would reflect that they have had investor

concern over the ultimate (asbestos) liability," said Pierre

Conner, an analyst with Hibernia Southcoast Capital who rates

Halliburton a "buy" and does not own any of its shares.

<p>

The contracts also may not do much for the company's stock

price, since the firefighting business is not a recurring one

and the profit margins of the construction business are not

typically high.

<p>

"While both would be positives to Halliburton, they aren't

in our opinion overriding reasons to buy the stock," Wicklund

said.

<p>

"I would think if you got any jump in the stock, it would

be short-lived and somewhat muted by history. It's like winning

a &#36;3 lottery ticket. It beats not winning, but you can't quit

your day job."

<p>

Halliburton shares were up 54 cents or about 2.6 percent to

&#36;20.36 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange on

Wednesday. The stock is up 11.7 percent this year through

Tuesday's close, outperforming Schlumberger, which is down 6.2

percent, as well as the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Oil Service

Index, which is down less than 1 percent, both in same

period.</p>
