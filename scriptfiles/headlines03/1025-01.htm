  </table></font>The chopper crash-landed near the town of Tikrit, former President Saddam Hussein's birthplace, an army spokesperson who declined to be named told AFP. 

 

<p>A doctor said one of those injured was suffering from shrapnel wounds in both the arms and legs. 

   
<p>“A helicopter did go down in Tikrit. I do not know if it was a controlled landing. Five people were wounded. It was an RPG attack,” the spokesperson said. 

 

<p>The chopper was seen by an AFP photographer trailing smoke minutes after a loud explosion. The sound of small arms fire was also heard from the direction of the emergency landing, the French news agency reported. 

 

<p>US assistant defence secretary, Paul Wolfowitz, on a tour of Iraq, visited Tikrit only hours before the attack on Saturday.

 

<p><b>Other attacks
</b>
<p>Elsewhere, The US military confirmed three soldiers were wounded in a bomb attack in Baghdad. 

 
<p>Captain Ty Wilson of the 1st Armoured Division said a makeshift bomb, possibly a mortar round detonated by remote control, exploded at dawn on Saturday, on an exit ramp off a highway in the southwest of the capital. 

<p>Wilson said the bomb, placed beside a steel guard rail under a tree, had hit a Humvee military vehicle. 

<p>In another incident, eleven members of a martial arts team were wounded, three of them seriously, when unknown gunmen opened fire on their bus near the northern oil town of Kirkuk.

<p>The Kurdish Taekwondo team was heading back to Kirkuk from a Baghdad tournament when they came under attack.

<p>Doctors said that three of the team members were in serious condition and had been operated on five times.

<p><b>Mosul
</b>
<p>Several other attacks were also carried out across Iraq in the past 24 hours, targeting either the US forces or Iraqi police, Aktham Sulaiman, Aljazeera's correspondent in Iraq, reported

<p>“An Iraqi police station came under a series of attacks in the city of Mosul,” he added. 

<p>According to Sulaima “a 20kg explosive device was found in Baghdad’s Press Association building”.
