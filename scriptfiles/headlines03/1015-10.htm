<p>WASHINGTON - Drug industry experts and a bipartisan group of legislators in the House of Representatives are charging that the Food and Drug Administration's campaign against importing prescription drugs is intended more to help the drug industry than to protect public health.

</table>They accuse the FDA of overstating the health hazards of foreign drugs to help the drug industry defeat legislation legalizing the purchase, or "reimportation," of U.S.-made drugs from Canada and 24 other countries where drugs are less expensive than they are in the United States.
<p>	FDA officials deny the allegations, saying they intend only to protect public health.
<p>	The reimportation proposal is part of Medicare legislation being crafted by House and Senate negotiators. Lawmakers hope to give final approval by year's end.
<p>	The FDA has criticized drug reimportation on these grounds before; the latest flap stems from its seizure in August of 1,019 non-FDA-approved drugs during a series of random package checks at mail facilities around the country. The drugs, presumably purchased online, had been shipped from foreign countries to customers in the United States. Most of the packages came from Canada, India, Thailand and the Philippines, countries with thriving Internet pharmacies.
<p>	Although the FDA's intent to conduct such searches was discussed at hearings this summer, many observers are skeptical because the inspections were conducted as the drug industry's trade group, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, was beginning a major advertising campaign stressing the health risks of foreign drugs.
<p>	Drug makers oppose importing drugs from other countries because they would lose billions of dollars if U.S. customers were allowed to buy drugs at discounted prices. Americans pay the highest prescription-drug costs in the world.
<p>	In addition to unapproved drugs, the FDA search found drugs with improper labeling, poor packaging and other FDA violations. The operation "illustrates the real and serious public health risks" of imported drugs, FDA Commissioner Mark McClellan said at the time. The FDA also opposes reimportation because it can't guarantee the safety of drugs that aren't manufactured, stored and distributed under its guidelines.
<p>	"Our biggest fear is that the quality of drugs people buy from this sort of importation is low already and would get much lower. And, we fear, counterfeiters would have access to our markets in a way they don't currently have," said William Hubbard, an FDA senior associate commissioner.
<p>	Hubbard said the agency wasn't in cahoots with drug makers. "There's nothing nefarious here," he said of the sting operation. "This was not in any way a planned refutation" of the reimportation proposal.
<p>	Frank Palumbo, the director of the University of Maryland Center on Drugs and Public Policy in Baltimore, agreed: "I just think there are external things that prompted these two normally disparate parties to be pushing in the same direction."
<p>	
<p>	This is the second time in recent months that the FDA has been accused of using its regulatory might on behalf of the pharmaceutical industry. Drug makers are among the most powerful lobbies in Washington and major financial contributors to President Bush and Republican congressional leaders.
<p>	In the 2004 election cycle, Republicans so far have received more than $2 million (roughly two-thirds) of nearly $3.2 million in drug industry contributions, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a watchdog group in Washington.
<p>	In July, just before the House voted 243-186 in favor of reimportation, McClellan and his staffers phoned key House members to voice concerns about the measure. Several House members, including Rep. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, complained that some of the calls from staffers - those in which members were queried about their likely votes - went too far and amounted to a joint lobbying effort between the FDA and the drug industry. At the same time, drug lobbyists were distributing FDA critiques opposing the legislation.
<p>	"There's a trend at the FDA now where they're supporting drug company efforts on a whole host of issues," Brown said. "You can see a prejudice toward the drug companies in the way they've talked, the way they position themselves, the statements (McClellan) has made."
<p>	Hubbard rejected any suggestion that the FDA acted improperly. He said that only one FDA staff member had asked House members about their votes in phone calls before the reimportation vote.
<p>	"The commissioner didn't know about it. I didn't know about it. It wasn't anything directed from above," Hubbard said of that caller's actions.
<p>	A bipartisan group of eight House members, including Reps. Bernard Sanders, a Vermont independent, Gil Gutknecht, R-Minn., and Jo Ann Emerson, R-Mo., all of whom joined in co-sponsoring the reimportation legislation, recently complained to McClellan that the drug seizures were unscientific and timed to damage the measure's chances in Congress.
<p>	"I think those are appropriate and relevant questions to ask of the FDA," said Steve Schondelmeyer, who heads the pharmaceutical care and health systems department at the University of Minnesota School of Pharmacy, "Are you a consumer protection agency or an industry protection agency?"
