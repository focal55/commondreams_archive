<p>North Korea has accused the United States of conducting more than 180 aerial spying missions this month in preparation for a "surprise attack" on the communist country.

<p>US reconnaisance planes, including U-2 and EP-3, flew "at least on 180 occasions in December" to spy on North Korea, the official Korean Central News Agency said quoting a military source.

<p>"Such aerial espionage fully shows that the US imperialists are watching for a chance to make a surprise attack on the DPRK (North Korea) in a bid to stifle it by 'strength'," the agency said.

<p>US military authorities here usually refuse to comment on allegations of aerial espionage, but maintain their operations in the region are defensive to thwart off North Korea's threats.

<p>North Korea and the United States have been locked in a stand-off since October last year when Washington accused Pyongyang of running a banned nuclear program based on enriched uranium.

<p>Six-nation talks brought toghether the two Cold-War foes along with China, Russia, Japan and South Korea in Beijing in August to ease the crisis but ended inconclusively.

<p>China, a key mediator of the crisis, is said to be pushing for a second round of six-way talks sometime next month, hopefully before the Lunar New Year festivities, which begin on January 22.

<p>Washington demands that Pyongyang verifiably and irreversibly scrap its nuclear program, while North Korea has insisted on a legally binding security guarantee from the United States in return for a nuclear climb-down. 

<p>Some 37,000 US troops are stationed in South Korea.
