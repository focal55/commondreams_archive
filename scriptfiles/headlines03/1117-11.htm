</table>An Italian member of Iraq's US-led Coalition Provisional Authority has resigned in protest at its policies. 
<p>Marco Calamai said few reconstruction projects had been implemented and warned that Iraqis were becoming angry. 

<p>Mr Calamai also told Italian newspapers the United Nations had to intervene in the country to improve a situation he described as "seriously compromised". 

<p>The criticism comes as Italy prepares to bury the 19 Italians killed in last week's bomb attack in Iraq. 

<p><b>State funeral </b>
<p>Mr Calamai told Italian newspaper La Stampa the attack, in the southern Iraqi city of Nasiriya, was the consequence of "a mistaken policy and an under-evaluation of the complexity of the social structure of Iraq". 

<p>He also warned that the US needed to make radical changes to the policies it had adopted so far in the country. 

<p>An official state funeral is due to be held on Tuesday - which has been declared a national day of mourning - for those killed in the bombing. 

<p>The bodies are lying in state in Rome's Victor Emmanuel monument, dedicated to the Unknown Soldier. 

<p>Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi and the Italian cabinet were among those who have paid their respects. 

<p><b>Worst single loss </b>
<p>On Monday crowds gathered in Rome to file past the coffins of the dead, all draped in the Italian flag. 

<p>"I am a mother who has a son in the carabinieri. I felt a really strong desire to be here. They are all my sons," said one woman, Antonella Regnon. 

<p>The last body - that of Corporal Pietro Petrucci - was returned to Italy after his parents gave permission for his life support machine to be switched off on Saturday. 

<p>His coffin was being brought to the monument to join the others. 

<p>The attack was the worst single bomb attack on international peacekeepers in Iraq, and the worst Italian military loss since World War II. 

<p>The Italian losses included 12 carabinieri, five army soldiers and two civilians. Nine Iraqis also died in the attack.
