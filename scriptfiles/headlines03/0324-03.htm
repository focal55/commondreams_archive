</table></font>WATER and electricity have been cut off in the southern Iraqi city of Basra for more than two days, threatening a humanitarian disaster, it was claimed today. 



<p>The International Committee of the Red Cross has warned that neither supply has been available since Friday, potentially crippling hospitals and services in the area. 



<p>Electricity cables powering the major Wafa al-Quaid water station - which supplies two million people and is the biggest source in the region - have been destroyed. 



<p>The ICRC said the station was under the control of the US-led forces and negotiations were on-going to try to set up emergency generators until the cables were repaired. 



<p>Florian Westphal of the ICRC said: "Sixty per cent of the local population are still without access to a regular water supply - this could develop into a humanitarian crisis. 



<p>"We are really, really going to try and gain access to the supply and do anything we can to repair it." 



<p>Mr Westphal confirmed that the situation in Basra was currently the organization’s main priority, although the humanitarian situation in Baghdad was being closely monitored. 



<p>Earlier, Roland Huguenin Benjamin, from the ICRC in Baghdad, said the lack of water in Basra was causing serious concern to medical administrators. 



<p>"There is no water running," he said. "People will very soon be without the possibility of operating in hospitals or anything else for that matter. 



<p>"It is a humanitarian emergency that they should be given access to clear water. We definitely need to be able to send our engineers in there as soon as possible."
