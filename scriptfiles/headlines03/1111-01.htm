<p>A Lake Worth warehouse is stacked to the rafters with oversized papier-mch&eacute; puppets of farmworkers. A sheet-turned-banner hangs from a wall, exhorting ''People before profits!'' and over on the right, a neon-green Statue of Liberty hangs by a noose, a sign on it declaring ``Killed by greed.''</p>
<p>About 20 people -- most of them young -- are painting anti-free-trade slogans on signs, and out back three stilt-walkers are demonstrating techniques for balancing high above a crowd.</p>
<p>Two weeks before the Free Trade Area of the Americas conference in Miami, this was protest central for the Lake Worth Global Justice Coalition.</p>
<p>''It's a great space, isn't it?'' asked Melodie Malfa, the group's designated media handler, waving a hand toward the colorful scene. ``But it's really about the issue, not the art. The art is only a vehicle for what we want to say: Stop the FTAA.''</p>

</table></font>The protesters, from as far away as Oakland and Austin, worry that their message about the perils of putting corporate profits ahead of people's needs will be lost in the drumbeat of fear stoked by police, businesses and a few violent extremists.</p>
<p>''The focus shouldn't be on us as protesters,'' Malfa said. ``It should be on the FTAA and why all these people are coming to Miami to resist it. We want the conversation to be about the environment and labor and public services and small businesses -- all the things that aren't being talked about behind those closed doors.''</p>
<p>Groups like Malfa's have issued a call to action that tens of thousands of protesters -- from the smallest grass-roots group to the largest of labor unions -- are expected to heed when they converge in downtown Miami in an unpredictable mix to demonstrate against the FTAA on Nov. 20 and 21. The conference begins Sunday.</p>
<p>And with Miami competing to be chosen for the FTAA's permanent headquarters, the city is braced for an onslaught with eight-foot security fences, 2,500 law enforcement officers and rented water cannons. No one knows how many people will turn out for the protests, but police say a march on Nov. 20, organized by the AFL-CIO, is expected to draw at least 20,000. With the specter of Seattle's 1999 World Trade Organization riots still fresh, security will be extensive.</p>

</table>With Eco Bloc protesters in green armbands, protesters from Wisconsin in cow suits and ''art in action'' demonstrators performing street pageants, the ''mobe'' -- short for mobilization in activist-speak -- is set to play out its colorful drama on the streets of Miami.</p>
<p>''They've given us no choice,'' Malfa said. ``The only place for us to speak up about the trade agreement is in the streets; we've been locked out of the conversation.''</p>
<p>The Internet offers a look at the extent of organizing in the United States and internationally. Protesters have dubbed the free-trade proposal ''NAFTA on steroids,'' a reference to the perception that the FTAA is an expansion of the policies of the North American Free Trade Agreement.</p>
<p>One e-mail, from the Anti-Capitalist Bloc of the Americas, traced the history of the FTAA to a 1994 meeting in Miami of the Organization of American States, when groundwork was laid for a vast free-trade proposal.</p>
<p>The latest meeting -- an attempt ''by the rich and powerful to establish their dominance over the entire world'' -- will not pass unnoticed, the group vowed. This time, ``we will be waiting for them. The FTAA was born in Miami and so it will be buried in Miami.''</p>
<p><b>RICH GET RICHER</b></p>
<p>The FTAA, the group argues, would pour wealth into the upper levels of capitalist society while ignoring the masses. The agreement, they say, would allow multinational corporations to overcome almost any barrier -- environmental, labor protection, the need for social services -- under the guise of free trade.</p>
<p>Proponents, including Gov. Jeb Bush, say free trade would remove barriers, standardize rules and allow industries to become more efficient, with lower prices for consumers and new stimulation for economies throughout the Western Hemisphere.</p>
<p>The Internet has added a new dimension to protest movements, serving as an electronic billboard for organizing, one expert noted.</p>
<p>''What people now call the global justice movement has been going on since at least the battle of Seattle, and some people trace it even earlier than that,'' said Mark Lichbach, professor of government and politics at the University of Maryland. ``By now it's nearly a decadelong movement, and with the availability of the Internet, people are increasingly able to produce networks of protesters.''</p>
<p>The groups planning to attend demonstrations are so varied and numerous -- and most shun corporate-owned media -- that counting them is impossible. They range from the well-known, such as Greenpeace, the AFL-CIO and Public Citizen's Global Trade Watch, to the most obscure ''affinity'' group, defined by one activist as ``you and five of your friends.''</p>
<p>''It does sometimes make for strange bedfellows, a mobilization like this,'' Malfa said. ``But pretty much every sector would be hurt by the FTAA -- labor, religious, environmental, youth, retirees. And that unites us.''</p>
<p>Their positions within the anti-FTAA framework are equally varied. Some of the more established organizations, such as the AFL-CIO, aren't anti-trade, they just want fair trade, not free trade.</p>
<p>Their motto for the FTAA: Peaceful, permitted demonstrations.</p>
<p><b>WANT TO BE HEARD</b></p>
<p>Others want a voice in the private negotiations, to be held at the Hotel Inter-Continental in Miami. They say the process is antidemocratic, allowing the few to decide what's best for the many.</p>
<p>Most protest participants, from the Latin American Solidarity Coalition to the Madison (Wis.) Fair Trade Alliance, say smashing windows and tearing down telephone poles is not in their repertoire.</p>
<p>''The FTAA is an effort to have control over the lives of everybody through trade and economic policies. We're building a people's power, a counterweight,'' said Hendrik Voss of the Latin American Solidarity Coalition.</p>
<p>And at the far left end of the spectrum are anarchists, who won't rule out property destruction as a way of making their point. ''We need to make every tactic available to us to stop the FTAA,'' said Lauren Anzaldo, 24, an anarchist from Pensacola.</p>
<p>Last month, the Ruckus Society, an Oakland, Calif.-based nonprofit protest group, held a training camp for protesters. For a week, at a riverfront campground in Arcadia, Fla., about 150 people representing 40 groups learned techniques for organizing, climbing -- to hang banners from bridges and buildings -- and mass action.</p>
<p>The protesters are setting up many of their own basic services. Volunteer medics will treat injuries, Food Not Bombs will feed people, free or low-cost housing will be available at the homes of other activists or campgrounds. Lawyers and legal observers will offer help to those arrested.</p>
<p>Sushma Sheth, policy and communications director for the Miami Workers' Center and media coordinator for Root Cause, a South Florida protest coalition, hopes education about the effects of the FTAA will be one of the chief results of the demonstrations.</p>
<p>``There's a lot of discussion that the FTAA is supposed to create all these jobs, but the reality is that there are fewer net jobs. A lot of jobs are taken away by this -- companies are relocated for cheaper labor outside our borders -- and whatever jobs are created are service sector jobs, part-time without benefits. What sort of jobs are those?''</p>
