WASHINGTON, May 16 — The Department of Homeland Security said today that it would conduct an internal investigation to see if there was misuse of federal resources when the department helped Texas law enforcement agencies in a politically inspired search for the private plane of a prominent Democratic state legislator.

<p>The department said the investigation would be conducted by the agency's acting inspector general, Clark Kent Ervin, a Houston Republican who is well known among some of the same state lawmakers in Texas who wanted the plane tracked down.

<p>Department officials said they saw no conflict of interest for Mr. Ervin in leading the inquiry, and they insisted again today that the department had done nothing wrong when it responded to a request on Monday from the Texas Department of Public Safety for help in finding the plane. 

<p>They said they believed that Texas officials had misled the department's Air and Marine Interdiction Coordination Center into believing that the plane might have been in mechanical trouble or had crashed.

<p>The Piper Cheyenne, which was owned by a member of the Texas House of Representatives, had been used to fly Democrats lawmakers to Oklahoma, part of an unusual move to block a quorum in the State House of Representatives, which was considering a Republican redistricting plan.

<p>The coordination center in Riverside, Calif., which is normally responsible for trying to block terrorists and other criminals from sneaking across the border into the United States, was ultimately unable to find the plane.

<p>Mr. Ervin, the former State Department inspector general who is awaiting Senate confirmation to the similar job at the Homeland Security Department, did not return phone calls for comment.

<p>Prominent Democrats in Congress suggested today that they would give Mr. Ervin the benefit of the doubt that he would conduct a fair investigation. But some said they would still push for a separate Congressional inquiry into how a federal agency responsible for combatting terrorism was drawn into the middle of a partisan dispute in the Texas statehouse.

<p>"It's interesting that the acting inspector general at the department was active in Republican politics in Texas, but I'm not going to prejudge him," said Representative Martin Frost of Texas, the ranking Democrat on the House Rules Committee. "If you want a full investigation, you ultimately would have to have Congress do it."

<p>Brian Roehrkasse, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security, said that the department was "affirmatively referring this matter to the department's inspector general so that there is no doubt that the treatment of this matter is completely transparent."

<p>Mr. Ervin, he said, "has served as a fair and judicious investigator while at the Department of State and there is no doubt that he will thoroughly and appropriately investigate this matter."

<p>Mr. Ervin has been the acting inspector general of the Homeland Security Department since January. From 1999 until the spring of 2001, he had been a deputy attorney general for the state of Texas, working under Attorney General John Cornyn, a Republican who is now a member of the United States Senate. Mr. Ervin has also practiced law at Vinson & Elkins, a Houston firm closely linked to the Bush administration.

<p>The Texas Department of Public Safety has been unwilling to describe what information it provided to the Department of Homeland Security in requesting help to find the plane. But the department has described the request for federal help as routine.

<p>The exodus of the Texas Democrats to Oklahoma ended today, with the Democrat returning to the statehouse in Austin in triumph. Their refusal to return earlier in the week prevented Republicans from achieving a quorum, which thwarted a vote on the redistricting plan that could have shifted several Congressional seats to Republican control.
