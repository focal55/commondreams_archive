<p>BAGHDAD, Iraq - Major Iraqi newspapers reported the space shuttle Columbia tragedy on their front pages on Sunday, but it appeared at the bottom, overshadowed by one of Saddam Hussein's almost-nightly meetings with military commanders.

  <p>

 Although no official Iraqi government statement was issued, individual Baghdad officials expressed sympathy for the American people, despite the tense confrontation between the United States and Iraq.

 <p>

 "We are people who love other people," said Bushra al-Samarai, a member of the Iraqi National Assembly. "We respect their feelings and share their sadness over this tragic incident."

 <p>

 She spoke with a reporter at a National Assembly ceremony marking the 12th-anniversary period of the 1991 Gulf War, when a U.S.-led military coalition drove Iraq's army from Kuwait and bombed targets in Baghdad and other Iraqi cities.

 <p>

 A National Assembly leader, Secretary General Ghalib Jassim, also voiced sympathy for the space shuttle tragedy, but with a reminder that Iraq feels under siege from the same stricken America.

 <p>

 The Bush administration has threatened military action against Iraq over its weapons programs.

 <p>

 "We are friends for the American people," said Jassim, a graduate of the State University of New York at Buffalo. "We don't have anything against the American people as people. The problem is between us and the American administration."

 <p>

 The news of the loss of the Columbia on Saturday appeared almost immediately over Iraq's Al-Shabab (Youth) television, a station owned by Saddam's son Odai. It switched to live coverage of the fast-developing news carried by the Qatar-based satellite news channel Al-Jazeera.

 <p>

 In the Babil newspaper &#151; also owned by Odai &#151; the story was carried at the bottom of page one Sunday with an old color photo of a U.S. space shuttle. It continued inside for almost a half-page, based on foreign news agency reports.

 <p>

 "Columbia Shuttle Crashed and the Crew Was Killed," read the headline low on the front page of Al-Thawra, newspaper of Iraq's ruling Baath Party.

 <p>

 That article noted that one of the astronauts was a "Zionist" who had flown in the Israeli bombing attack in 1981 on Iraq's Tammouz reactor, which was believed to be key to an Iraqi nuclear bomb program.

 <p>

 The astronauts who perished when the Columbia broke apart minutes before it was scheduled to land in Florida were six Americans and an Israeli.

 <p>

 Some coverage was decidedly low-key. The newspaper Al-Iraq carried just a two-paragraph, second-page brief about Columbia. In every paper, Saddam dominated news with his defiance of U.S. threats. A headline in Al-Thawra read: "The Warrior Leader Said I am Confident that Victory is Assured."
