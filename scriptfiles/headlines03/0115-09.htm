<p>Free speech can cost you if you're out there protesting in today's chilly climate, where the forecast for dissent is cloudy with a chance of consequences.</p>
<p>At a time when even counterculture Cal-Berkeley is censoring the anti-war words of the late, celebrated anarchist Emma Goldman, reactions to protest can range from dirty looks at work to arrest for civil disobedience.</p>
<p>More and more people seem to be doing it anyway.</p>
<p>Some of them are protesting the buildup to war with Iraq by marching on sidewalks and park promenades. Some rallied Monday night in Seattle's International District against INS tracking of male visitors from Muslim lands.</p>
<p>Others, like the home-care workers and teachers demonstrating in Olympia this week, are speaking out in their own self-interest, opposing cuts in pay and health care coverage.</p>
<p>Whatever the cause that may escalate you from a letter-writer to a sign-waver, it seemed a good time to sit by the fire and get some tips from Sister Maureen Newman, a nun with Seattle's Sisters of Providence.</p>
<p>You may have read that she was arrested on federal trespass charges in Columbus, Ga., Nov. 16. She'll only be home for a couple more weeks. On Jan. 27, the 57-year-old teacher and vice principal, now on sabbatical from St. Therese School, will go south again to prepare for her Feb. 10 trial and to steel herself for an expected sentence of from three to six months in a federal prison yet to be named.</p>
<p>Inform yourself well about the issue you care about. Make sure your action will be peaceful and that you won't destroy property. And, if you go for it, understand that you may lose your job, may have to post bail, and could literally cool your heels in an unheated cinder-block holding cell or even solitary confinement. That was some of what Sister Maureen said when she explained it all to me this week in the Capitol Hill house she shares with three other Sisters of Providence.</p>
<p>Sister Maureen's protest resume didn't start with this first arrest in November.  She has demonstrated against missiles at Boeing and nuclear subs at Bangor.</p>
<p>A member of Witness for Peace in the '80s, she traveled to Nicaragua as part of a delegation to protest the U.S. support of the Contras. And it was the haunting eyes of women who had been raped and who had seen their husbands and children murdered and "disappeared" that eventually lead Sister Maureen to Fort Benning, Ga., the past four Novembers on the anniversary of the killing of Jesuit priests in El Salvador.</p>
<p>The Army base is home to the recently renamed School of the Americas, which changed its sign to read Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation after previous protests pushed it to within 14 votes of extinction in Congress.</p>
<p>The school's defenders say foreign soldiers learn the ways of democracy inside.</p>
<p>Opponents, including Sister Maureen and 86 others arrested in November, say the school has trained some of Latin America's most vicious and prolific human rights abusers in the ways of torture and oppression. Among its grads: Panama's Manuel Noriega, Chile's Augusto Pinochet and 40 other Central and South American dictators.</p>
<p>While sure of her moral ground during previous protest visits, Sister Maureen had believed that, with elementary school kids counting on her to return to campus and not be in jail, she couldn't risk arrest before. But this time she was on leave when she literally crossed the line, entering the base through a break in the fence.</p>
<p>Within minutes, Sister Maureen, 42-year-old Julia Shideler of Orcas Island, retired Port Orchard teacher Vanessa Pustek and the others were in plastic handcuffs, headed for not one but three military, county and federal bookings, finger-printings, and finally, a cinder-block slammer.</p>
<p>Her Sisters of Providence T-shirt -- the one with "Close the School of the Americas" on the back -- was confiscated, along with her origami peace crane.</p>
<p>After two nights in jail -- one of those in solitary -- Sister Maureen stood before a federal judge who made fun of her by asking if she was related to Mad magazine's Alfred E. Neuman before releasing her on $5,000 bail.</p>
<p>In the past, she says, all protestors were released on their own recognizance. But this time -- even her sister and two aunts in Walla Walla had warned Sister Maureen of what she already knew -- the screws on dissent have tightened since 9/11. </p>
<p>The judge called bail "necessary in these times."</p>
<p>A teacher who protested at Fort Benning a year ago last November -- and did not trespass -- lost her job last year.</p>
<p>Sister Maureen knows her own teaching options may be limited when her sabbatical ends. She hates that because she loves kids and teaching. But, as a teacher, she says it's important to explain that you don't break laws lightly. You don't break even bad laws if they only affect you or a small group like you. But, if a bad law -- such as segregation -- oppresses, endangers or limits the right to a livelihood of a large group of people, you may feel "called" to do even more than just picket and write a few letters to Congress.</p>
<p>And she'd do it again, she said. "Knowing what I do about the school, how could I not?"
