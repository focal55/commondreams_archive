</table></font>Saddam said "jihad cells made up of Iraqi male and female fighters have been formed on a large scale" throughout Iraq to fight US-led coalition forces occupying the country. 


<p>The former Iraqi leader, whose whereabouts has been a mystery since the fall of Baghdad on April 9, said he and his aides were still in Iraq. 


<p>"Hence I salute them and salute you (the Iraqi people) and salute the Mujahedin (Islamic fighters) in Baghdad, in the battlefields, and I pay tribute to their steadfastness, jihad and sacrifices," he said. 


<p>On Thursday, the United States put up 25 million dollars for information leading to the arrest of Saddam. 


<p>Faced with daily attacks on US troops that it says are directed by former members of Saddam's Baath party regime, the US-led coalition has admitted that failing to account for the ousted leader is hindering reconstruction efforts. 


<p>In a message broadcast to the Iraqi people, top civil administrator Paul Bremer also offered a reward of 15 million dollars for information leading to the capture of Saddam's two fugitive sons, Uday and Qusay. 


<p>Former military intelligence chief Wafiq al-Samarrai told Al-Jazeera the voice on the audiotape was indeed that of Saddam and the expressions used were those of the deposed Iraqi leader. 


<p>He said this confirmed his theory that Saddam was alive and living in Iraq, moving around an area between Baghdad and Samarra, around 125 kilometers (80 miles) north of the capital.
