<p>BRUSSELS  - A European trade union organization has called on the 60 million workers it represents to stop work on Friday to protest against possible war in Iraq.



<p>Wim Bergans, spokesman for the European Trade Union Confederation, said he expected union members across Europe to stop work for a symbolic 10 or 15 minutes around 12:00 p.m. (6 a.m. EST). He said he did not know how many workers would take part.



<p>"We will walk in the streets, make some noise and explain why we are in the streets," Bergans said of plans by staff at ETUC's headquarters in Brussels.



<p>ETUC's executive committee passed a resolution last week calling for the peaceful disarmament of Iraq.



<p>Its Web site lists planned action in Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Denmark and Belgium.



<p>In a separate action, the European Transport Workers' Federation has called on railway workers to strike on Friday against possible reduction in job security by on-going liberalization of the European Union's rail network.
