<p>The city has agreed in principle to allow a group of antiwar demonstrators to march in Manhattan on March 22, although representatives of the demonstrators say they have raised questions about the Police Department's plans for the beginning of the march.</p><P> The city had refused to allow the protesters, <a href="http://www.unitedforpeace.org/" target="_new">United for Peace and Justice</a>, to march past the United Nations on Feb. 15, citing security risks. The group challenged that decision in court, but lost, with a federal judge ruling that the city was not violating the demonstrators' First Amendment rights. Hundreds of thousands of protesters gathered instead on First Avenue, although there were conflicts with the police.</p><P> Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said last week that he believed a march route could be created that would satisfy both the protesters and the city.</p><P> Leslie Cagan, a co-chairwoman of the protest group, said the planned route for the march on the 22nd leads from West 42nd Street down Broadway to Union Square, then down University Place to Washington Square Park. The plan would use barricades to direct people to the start of the march and would put latecomers at the beginning instead of at the end.</p><P> She took issue with the Police Department's plan to have people gather on Broadway south of 42nd Street. "We think there should not be barricades on any of the streets, and access should be as easy as possible," Ms. Cagan said. She called on Mayor Bloomberg to resolve the impasse.</p><P> Edward Skyler, the mayor's press secretary, responded last night, saying: "The mayor supports their right to march. But it's up to the Police Department to work out the details."</p><P> Detective Thomas Kuchma said, "We have met with their representatives and are planning on meeting again with them."
