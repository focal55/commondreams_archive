<p>UNITED NATIONS   - A U.S.-led war against Iraq  launched without United Nations authorization would be seen by  many nations and legal experts as a violation of international  law.<p>



		That is one of several reasons the United States is working  so hard to secure a new U.N. Security Council resolution  authorizing a war. However President Bush has made it clear he  would feel free to launch the war anyway if it proves  impossible to win such a vote.<p>



		"Absent a new resolution, this war will be perceived by  many states around the world as not just legally illegitimate  but also lacking in political legitimacy," said Steven Ratner,  who teaches international law at the University of Texas.<p>



		"It will cause many to say this is an illegal war and an  unjust war and it will be quite politically damaging for the  Bush administration," he said.<p>



		The administration has argued it has all the authority it  needs to wage war under previous U.N. resolutions dating back  to 1991 demanding that Iraq give up all its unconventional  weapons. More fundamentally, the United States gives primacy to  U.S. law and the Constitution, under which Congress declares  war and the president acts as commander in chief.<p>



		"The president is not subsidiary to the United Nations and  the ambassador of Cameroon does not decide what he can or  cannot do," said Danielle Pletka of the conservative American  Enterprise Institute.<p>



		In a recent discussion at the Council on Foreign Relations,  Anne-Marie Slaughter, dean of Princeton University's Woodrow  Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, said eight  out of 10 international lawyers would consider a U.S. attack  without a new resolution as a violation of international law.<p>



		"That view would also be supported by the legal advisers of  most other countries in the United Nations," she said. "There's  no question that many, many other countries -- the majority of  other countries and certainly many of our European allies --  will not see a unilateral American-led attack as explicitly  authorized by the Security Council."<p>



		RUSSIA WEIGHS IN<p>



		Russia's U.N. Ambassador Sergei Lavrov said this week that  a U.S.-led invasion of Iraq would be a clear violation of  international law. He also said that no country had the right  to send its troops into the territory of another state to  achieve "regime change" -- which Bush has stated would be one  U.S. war aim.<p>



		Going to war without a new resolution could dramatically  weaken the political position of some key U.S. allies, notably  British Prime Minister Tony Blair who is battling strong  anti-war sentiment in his own Labour Party and in the public.<p>



		Pletka said that was the sole reason Washington was working  so hard to secure a resolution. "Tony Blair really wants it and  he's been such a loyal and helpful friend," she said.<p>



		A resolution might take some of the wind out of the sails  of an international anti-war movement that is rapidly gaining  strength. Conversely, going to war without a resolution would  boost anti-war and anti-American sentiment to new heights.<p>



		Even in the United States, polls show a majority of voters  would much prefer to go to war with the authority of a new  resolution. Support for war without such a resolution falls  below 50 percent in some polls.<p>



		A war not blessed by the U.N. would also weaken the  authority of the United Nations itself and could complicate  U.S. efforts to secure international cooperation for efforts to  reconstruct Iraq after the war.<p>



		"If the U.S. abandons the U.N. and goes sailing off in its  own direction, it would be setting aside the international  framework that has governed the way wars should be fought for  half a century," said Jeffrey Laurenti of the U.N. Association  of the United States.<p>



		Under the United Nations Charter, states are only  authorized to use military force in self-defense or when  specifically approved by the world body.<p>



		Since few experts would regard a preventive attack such as  Bush is contemplating as self-defense, the administration's  best claim for international legality comes from arguing that  it is authorized to wage war under a long series of previous  U.N. resolutions on Iraq.<p>



		Resolutions passed before and after the 1991 Gulf War, and  most recently by Security Council resolution 1441 which was  unanimously adopted last November, set out a series of  disarmament demands that the Bush administration says Iraq has  failed to meet.<p>



		Resolution 1441 stipulated that Iraq was in material breach  of some 15 previous Security Council resolutions and gave the  Baghdad one last chance to give up all weapons of mass  destruction. If Iraq refused to comply completely, the United  States agreed only to consult with the Security Council but it  did not commit itself to seeking a new resolution.
