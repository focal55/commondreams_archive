<p>MOSCOW   - Russia's armed forces have obtained  information that the United States and its allies have already  decided to launch military action in Iraq from mid-February,  news agency Interfax said on Wednesday.<p>



		The agency's specialist military news wire AVN, quoting an  unnamed high-ranking source in the Russian general staff, said  U.S.-led operations would be launched once an attacking force  of 150,000 had been assembled in the Gulf.<p>



		"According to the information we have, the operation is  planned for the second half of February. The decision to launch  it has been taken but not yet been made public," the source  told the agency, which has generally authoritative contacts in  the Russian military and political establishment.<p>



		The source added that the main aim of the war would be to  secure control of Iraqi oilfields.<p>



		It was not indicated by what means the Russian military had  obtained such information -- it was not clear if it had been  acquired covertly by Russian intelligence services or by a  direct tip-off from Washington, which would be keen to avoid  any misunderstandings with Moscow if it does launch a war.<p>



		The United States says it is building up a force estimated  to reach more than 150,000 by the end of next month. Britain is  sending a further 30,000 troops. No other allies have come  forward with significant military commitments so far and some,  notably France, Germany and Russia are against rapid action.<p>



		"The military operation against Iraq will be conducted by a  combination of means -- strikes will be from the air, land and  sea. The war will be short, lasting about one month," the  Russian source was quoted as saying.<p>



		The source added that the main aim of the operation was not  so much to topple Iraqi President Saddam Hussein but to secure  U.S. control over Iraqi oilfields.<p>



		"Hussein is the pretext. The real aim of the military  action is control over Iraqi oil," he said.<p>



		Russia, together with France which is also a permanent  member of the U.N. Security Council, are cautioning against U.S  action in Iraq now while U.N. arms inspectors are continuing to  search for evidence of weapons of mass destruction there.<p>



		Russia has a major commercial interest in Iraqi oil and has  made clear its eagerness to exploit Iraq's huge reserves once  U.N. sanctions on Saddam are lifted.
