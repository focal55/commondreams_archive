<p><p>VIRGINIA BEACH, Va.  - Police in this popular  resort city recently began operating video surveillance cameras  with controversial face recognition technology that critics say  brings the United States one step closer to becoming a society  where "Big Brother is watching you."<p>



		Virginia Beach, along with Tampa, Florida, is one of only  two cities in the United States to acquire the technology,  which cost it $197,000. The system went live last September, at  the tail end of the summer vacation period when the city was  crowded with visitors.<p>



		"Before we switched it on, we went through an extensive  public education process with hearings and the involvement of  citizen groups and minority groups, who helped write the  policies we are using," said deputy police chief Greg Mullen.<p>



		As a result, the cameras may only be used for two narrowly  defined purposes: to catch some 1,500 people wanted by the city  on outstanding felony warrant, and to find runaway children or  missing persons. All the images picked up by the cameras are  immediately deleted from the system if there is no match.<p>



		A citizens' auditing committee has the right to perform  unannounced spot checks on police headquarters to make sure the  technology is not being misused.<p>



		Virginia Beach has had video surveillance cameras watching  over its beachfront area since 1993. Three of the city's 13  cameras are linked full-time to the face recognition system,  though the others can be activated as needed. The database of  wanted people is updated every day.<p>



		So far, the system has failed to produce a single arrest,  though it has generated a few false alarms. In September, it  was sending some 8,000 images a day to the computer at police  headquarters. Each camera has the capacity to generate six  pictures a minute.<p>



		It works by analyzing faces based on a series of  measurements, such as the distance from the tip of the nose to  the chin or the space between the eyes. Critics say it is  highly inaccurate and can be easily fooled.<p>



		Mullen, who sees the system eventually being linked to the  databases of other city, state and federal law enforcement  agencies to track criminals and suspected terrorists, said:  "The system doesn't look at skin color or your hair or your  gender. It takes human prejudices out of the equation."<p>



		Civil liberties groups are hardly reassured. They fear an  erosion of personal privacy and evoke the dark vision of  British author George Orwell's novel "1984," in which he  imagined a totalitarian society with a "Big Brother" who kept  all its citizens under constant surveillance.<p>



		'PEOPLE FEEL COWED'<p>



		"This technology has little or no effect on the crime rate  but it does have an effect on peoples' behavior. People feel  cowed," said Bruce Steinhardt, who directs a technology and  liberty program for the American Civil Liberties Union.<p>



		Video surveillance has mushroomed across industrialized  nations in recent years. Britain leads the world: the average  Londoner is estimated to have his or her picture recorded more  than 300 times a day, but New York is not far behind, although  its cameras are not linked to face recognition technology.<p>



		Studies have found that any reduction in crime after  surveillance cameras go in may wear off over time. But Mullen  said the cameras in Virginia Beach had provided evidence at  trials, allowed police to arrive at crime scenes much more  quickly and track criminals as they made their escape. They  have also helped police disperse crowds before they became  rowdy and freed up officers for other tasks.<p>



		In the aftermath of the attacks on the World Trade Center  and the Pentagon, Americans seem to be more willing to  sacrifice some of their personal privacy for the sake of  enhancing security.<p>



		Still, many are alarmed by concepts like the Pentagon's  proposed Total Information Awareness system, which would  collect individuals' financial, medical, communication and  travel records in a massive database in the hope of uncovering  patterns of potentially hostile activity.<p>



		Despite the fact that tests have shown face recognition  only works in around 30 percent of cases, the ACLU is alarmed  that the technology may soon spread to airports. The  organization also fears it could potentially be used to monitor  individuals' political activities to harass law-abiding  citizens.<p>



		"This kind of surveillance should be subject to the same  procedures as wiretaps. Law enforcement agencies should justify  why they need it and it should be tightly limited, otherwise it  will soon become a tool of social control," said Mihir  Kshirsagar of the Electronic Information Privacy Center.<p>



		Nor does such criticism come exclusively from the political  left. Lawyer John Whitehead, founder of the conservative  Rutherford Institute, wrote in an editorial that the technology  threatened the right of each U.S. citizen to participate in  society without the express or implied threat of coercion.<p>



		"After all, that is exactly what constant surveillance is  -- the ultimate implied threat of coercion," he wrote.<p>



		Mullen said that was nonsense. To him, the cameras are no  different in principle from a police officer standing on a  street corner with a wanted poster -- just more efficient.
