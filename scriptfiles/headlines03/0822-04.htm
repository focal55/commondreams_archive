<p>PORTLAND -- Thousands of boisterous but generally orderly protesters angered by a wide range of Bush policies jeered the presidential motorcade Thursday as it rolled into the gated University of Portland campus for a $2,000-a-plate fund-raising lunch.
<P>"How many children could $2,000 feed?" read one protester's sign.

  </table></font>March organizers estimated the crowd at about 3,500 and reported up to seven scattered arrests. The Portland Police Bureau confirmed 10 arrests.
<P>March organizers said police approached demonstrators in Columbia Park after the march, took one woman into the street and pepper-sprayed several people who tried to interfere. Portland Police Bureau spokesman Sgt. Brian Schmautz said he had no details of the incident.
<P>"I've never been to a protest before in my life," said Joel Spinhirne of Hood River, who opposes Bush. "I'm just an ordinary middle-class guy, but things are happening in an outrageous fashion. I read the paper, I watch the evening news, and I just had to be here."
<P>Protesters marched down Willamette Boulevard to the campus as police, some on horses, some on foot or on bicycles, looked on.
<P>Some wore Bush masks. One sign read: "My Apache helicopter killed your Iraqi honor student." Another said: "Somewhere in Texas a village is missing its idiot."
<P>Small groups of Bush supporters showed up as well. A man on a red pickup covered with flags shouted: "We love Bush. We support our troops. We pledge allegiance to our flag."
<P>"I'm mad, and I'm embarrassed. We just need to make clear that we're not all supportive of this regime and what it's doing," said protester Jennifer Murdock, of Portland, who was there with her 2-year-old daughter. Murdock said she opposes the war in Iraq.

  </table></font>There were no massive confrontations with the scores of black-clad police from six agencies in riot gear, a marked difference from Bush's visit to Portland last year to raise campaign money for Oregon's Republican Sen. Gordon Smith.
<P>"We're giving you the liberty to do this," shouted a man with a bullhorn. "We went to war for you, and we were proud to do it. One nation under God!"
<P>A protester confronted him with a rather explicit suggestion.
<P>"That's not a nice word to say, young man," he replied. "But we will excuse you because you are young."
<P>"It's crazy. It's a small percentage out here whooping and hollering. I think the large majority of people in Portland support Bush. They're at work today because they want to work and keep their jobs," said bystander Kevin Stepisnik, 31, of Cornelius.
<P>"I'm actually quite astounded that he (Bush) showed up," said Stella Anderson, 32, of Portland, an anti-Bush demonstrator. "I think that he would have avoided Portland altogether if we had done our job right the first time."
<P>Police, probably snipers, were atop the domed Chiles Center where the luncheon was held about 200 yards from the demonstrators.
<P>"Jump, jump!" some of the crowd chanted.
<P>Demonstrators protested Bush policies on issues ranging from Iraq to the economy, gay rights, civil rights and the environment.
<P>"Welcome to Portland. Go climb a tree," read one sign. Many Bush opponents believe his policy of thinning forests to reduce forest fire danger is a ploy to log old-growth timber.
<P>Meanwhile, several nearby residents took advantage of the protest to make a little money.
<P>Delores Carlson sold ice cream bars and Creamsicles for $1 each.
<P>University of Portland students sold water and beer from their front lawn as they watched the protest.
<P>The water sold for $2, while beer sold for $4 or $5 -- depending on whether it was an American or Canadian brand.
<P>"We've made a killing, pretty much," said Riley Shephard, 20, a business student. "I see nothing against protesting for what you believe in as long as you stay off my lawn."</p>
