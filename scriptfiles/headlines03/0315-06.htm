<p>WASHINGTON - Lawyers trying to persuade the courts to stop President Bush from launching a war against Iraq plan to bring a new challenge next week, despite a rejection two days ago in a federal appeals court.

<P>



   John C. Bonifaz of Boston, the lead lawyer for the soldiers, parents, and members of Congress pursuing the challenge, said the attempt to reopen the case may start as early as Monday, but in any event, as soon as it is clear what the United Nations will do on a second Iraq resolution.

<P>



   ''We are not going to wait until the bombs fall,'' he said. A decision Thursday by the US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, in Boston, which dismissed the challenge, ''made it clear that the door is still open for review, in light of further facts,'' he added.

<P>



   If the Appeals Court allows the case to go forward, it could set the stage for a major constitutional conflict between the president and the courts, and it could force the White House to put war plans on hold, awaiting court action. 

<P>



   This case, said Marie Ashe, professor of law at Suffolk University, ''involves a huge constitutional issue: whether there is a wrongful concentration of power in one person - the president.''

<P>



   Ashe was one of the 74 law professors who urged the appeals court to rule that Bush cannot send the nation to war against Iraq without UN approval or, failing that, without a formal declaration of war by Congress. Congress has mandated that there be no preemptive strike against Iraq without UN approval or new congressional approval, the challengers argue.

<P>



   The Appeals Court did not doom the case entirely. It turned aside a request by the Bush administration to erect a categorical bar to any such lawsuit.

<P>



   The administration had argued that the courts have no role to play in the dispute because the Constitution assigns war-making power solely to Congress and the White House.

<P>



   The Appeals Court said this is a murky area of constitutional law, so it dismissed the case instead on the ground that the legal controversy was not fully developed. Courts could not review the  dispute, it said, ''until the available facts make it possible to define the issues with clarity. ... Here, too many crucial facts are missing.''

<P>



   The court cited the daily fluctuations in diplomacy at the UN, the ongoing Security Council debate over a new resolution on Iraq, and the open question of what would happen militarily in the event of an impasse.

<P>



   ''These are tough cases,'' Bonifaz said, ''but this decision is a major step forward.''

<P>



   The legal team decided that the ruling created a premise for seeking a rehearing once the facts needed to bring the case emerge. 

<P>



   ''A couple of conditions must be met,'' the lawyer said.

<P>



   First, the UN Security Council must either vote against authorizing war against Iraq or the request for such endorsement is withdrawn by the United States, Britain, and Spain.

<P>



   Second, the president would have to indicate that the United States would go forward without UN approval. The attorneys, Bonifaz said, believe that this second condition already has been met, because the president has indicated publicly several times that he does not believe UN approval is necessary.

<P>



   Once the outcome in the Security Council is clear, Bonifaz said, ''we are prepared to go back to the court. Every indication is that we will then be marching forward toward war.''

<P>



One other uncertainty remains, he added. A plea for the Appeals Court to rehear the case must be filed within 14 days after the ruling. If action should be put off at the UN, the lawyers conceivably could run out of time.
