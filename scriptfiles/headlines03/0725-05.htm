<p>ST. PAUL - Late U.S. Sen. Paul Wellstone rode a green bus to his first U.S. Senate win. After his death the bus came to signify his legacy.

</table></font>Some are now upset over a bumper sticker message about the bus found on the state Capitol grounds, saying the political propaganda crossed the line of good taste.</p>

<p>The sticker, which says "It's time to park the bus," was found on the back of a Minnesota Senate staffer's SUV.</p>

<p>"I think it's below the belt," said state Rep. Michael Paymar, DFL-St. Paul. "I think it 's highly insensitive. It was a great tragedy when Paul died and a lot of us are still grieving."</p>

<p>DFLers are outraged. They claim there are more of these bumper stickers. Some of them think Republicans are behind them.</p>

<p>"I'm assuming he must have got it from the party or somewhere," Paymar said.</p>

<p>Republicans said they have more important things to do than print anti-Wellstone propaganda.</p>

<p>"This is a nonsensical, baseless, silly accusation," said Randy Wenke of the Republican Party of Minnesota. "For all I know Democrats put this on the car themselves in order to try to energize their base."</p>

<p>That would seem unlikely, since the SUV carrying that bumper sticker is owned by an assistant to Republican state Sen. Michael Jungbauer.</p>

<p>"The election is over," Paymar said. "Paul is dead. We want good memories of him and let's put the politics behind us."</p>

<p>Efforts by Eyewitness News to reach Jungbauer were not successful.</p>

<p>The staffer who owns the SUV refused to say where he obtained the sticker. Coincidentally, Wednesday was his last day working for Jungbauer.</p>

<p>Eyewitness News also spotted some other anti-Wellstone bumper stickers. One read, "He's dead, get over it." The owner said the sticker was made to order on the Internet.</p>
