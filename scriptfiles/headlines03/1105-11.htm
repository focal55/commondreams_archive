<p>"The Revolution Will Not Be Televised," a riveting documentary, is not the movie  that the Irish filmmakers Kim Bartley and Donnacha O'Briain envisioned  when  they traveled to Venezuela to film a portrait of Hugo Chávez, that country's left-wing president. A volatile force in Latin American politics, Mr. Chávez, who was elected  president by a landslide in 1998, was shaking up the status quo, having vowed to take control of Venezuela's  oil industry and redirect its wealth to benefit the poor. </p>

</table>But on April 11, 2002, the filmmakers were firsthand witnesses to one of the shortest presidential overthrows  in Latin American history. On that day a coalition  of military officials and business leaders engineered Mr. Chávez's removal from power.  He was arrested and held prisoner, and the national assembly was dissolved. An interim  government was installed.  </p>
<P>Two days  later a popular uprising brought more than a million protesters to the streets of Caracas and forced the new government out of office. Mr. Chávez returned in triumph. The filmmakers were lucky enough to be in the presidential palace when he  was removed, and they were there when he returned. </p>
<P>More than a scary close-up look at the raw mechanics of a power grab, the film is also a cautionary examination of the use of television to deceive and manipulate the public. The attempt to seize control never would  have gotten off the ground without the fervent  support of Venezuela's five private television stations, all politically aligned with  oil interests that had hounded Mr. Chávez from the moment he took  office. The  only television station sympathetic to Mr. Chávez was the state-run  channel, whose signal was immediately cut by the new government.  </p>
<P>Much  of the documentary replays the actual television coverage of the events, and the incident that became the excuse for deposing Mr. Chávez was deliberately misrepresented by the private channels,  the film says. Two opposing crowds faced off in front of the presidential palace, and  sniper gunfire killed at least 11 demonstrators. Mr. Chávez's supporters were  blamed. But excised film clips shown in the movie dispute that claim.</p>
<P>The documentary  hints that the C.I.A. might have been involved, but no evidence is offered.  And Mr. Chávez is portrayed uncritically as a heroic reformer and robust man of the  people.</p>
<P>Invoking the name of the South American liberator Simón Bolívar, he  campaigned for office by promising to exert more control over the state oil company and  to redirect much its wealth to the 80 percent of the Venezuelan population living in poverty.  He rewrote the constitution and reached out to the masses in a weekly television program on the state channel in which the public was invited to call  in questions.</p>
<P>From the outset the opposition to Mr. Chávez was intense.  His friendship with Fidel  Castro was offered as proof that he was a communist, and one television commentator sneered that Mr. Chávez had a "sexual fixation" on Mr. Castro.  Another declared  him  mentally ill. </p>
<P>Because of his friendship with Mr. Castro and his meetings with  other authoritarian leaders, Mr. Chávez is not viewed in Washington as a friend of the United States.  Venezuela is one of the largest exporters  of oil to the United States,  and after Mr. Chávez took office, the price of its oil began to rise, and Venezuela helped engineer higher oil prices from other countries as well.</p>
<P>As these tumultuous events play out in the film, which opens today in New York, they generate the suspense of a smaller-scale <a href="http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/movie.html?v_id=43837">"Seven Days in May."</a>  But at the end we are left with the uneasy sense that the conflict is so deep that more trouble lies ahead.</p>
