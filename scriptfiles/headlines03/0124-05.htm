<p> DAVOS, Switzerland  - Malaysian Prime

Minister Mahathir Mohamad told the United States on Thursday

that &quot;out-terrorising the terrorists will not work&quot; and forecast

a long period of war driven by hatred, revenge and greed.<P> His warning jolted the opening session of the annual World

Economic Forum of business and political leaders in Davos, at

which Switzerland's president urged Washington not to launch a

war against Iraq without United Nations authorisation.<P> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><table border=0 align=right hspace=5 cellpadding=6 width="315">

</table></font>The mood at this year's gathering of the global economic and

political elite was subdued by the triple shadow of economic

uncertainty, corporate scandals and fear of a looming war.<P> U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell is due to address the

forum on Sunday amid a deepening rift between the Bush

administration and key European and Middle Eastern allies over

the justification for using force against Baghdad.<P> Mahathir, a veteran Asian leader, accused the West of

seeking to impose its brand of capitalist democracy by force and

starving or bombing those who did not accept that model.<P> &quot;It is blasphemy to say anything against democracy. If you

do, if you resist, then you'll be considered a heretic and

starved to death or bombed out of existence,&quot; he said.<P> He suggested that suicide bombers and hijackers such as

those who attacked the United States on September 11, 2001, were

driven by poverty and despair.<P> &quot;Out-terrorising the terrorists will not work, but removing

the causes for terrorism will,&quot; he said.<P> &quot;The worm finally turned. The weak have now hit back in the

only way they can. Groping for the enemy, the strong hits out

blindly in every direction, in every part of the world. No one

is free. Fear rules the world.<P> &quot;Sanity has deserted both sides. Just as, in the stone age,

the man with the biggest club ruled, in our modern and

sophisticated global village the country with the biggest

killing power rules,&quot; Mahathir said.<P> President George W. Bush's campaign against an &quot;Axis of

Evil&quot; grouping Iraq, Iran and North Korea, was doomed to fail

because it had the wrong target, he added.<P><P> BUILDING TRUST<P> Swiss President Pascal Couchepin spelled out the majority

view in much of Western Europe when he said war in Iraq was not

inevitable and would have dangerous, destabilising consequences

for the Middle East, notably the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.<P> &quot;Force must not be used before the matter has been brought

before the United Nations Security Council,&quot; he said.<P> &quot;The use of force can only be the last resort after all

other means of persuasion have been exhausted.&quot;<P> The United States has expressed irritation at the resistance

of key European allies France and Germany to what they see as a

rush to war while U.N. inspectors are asking for more time to

try to disarm Iraq peacefully.<P> But former Australian foreign minister Gareth Evans,

president of the International Crisis Group think-tank, said he

did not believe war on Iraq was inevitable.<P> Military action might yet be averted because of Iraqi

President Saddam Hussein's survival instinct in the face of a

U.S. and British military build-up, international pressure on

Washington not to act unilaterally, and domestic unease about

war in the United States, he said.<P> &quot;I am naive enough to believe that war is avoidable,&quot; he

said.<p align="center">###</p>
