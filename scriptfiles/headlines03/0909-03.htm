<p>CHICAGO  - Politicians take note: Americans fret  more about losing their health insurance than being a victim of  a terrorist attack, according to the results of a poll released  on Tuesday.
<P>
That's among the findings of the survey showing health care  premiums climbing at their highest rate in more than a decade,  driven by steeper doctor and hospital fees and health insurers'  profit gains.<P>
Monthly premiums for employer-sponsored health care in the  United States jumped by 13.9 percent between spring 2002 and  2003, the sharpest spike since 1990, according to a report by  the <a href="http://www.kff.org/" target="_new">Kaiser Family Foundation</a>, a nonprofit research group.
<P>
"There is no let-up in the rate of increase in health care  costs," said foundation president Drew Altman. And employers  and consumers feel hopeless about it, he added. "We're stuck  without a big answer."<P>
At the same time, the poll found that 33 percent of the  insured worry that their income might not keep up with health  premiums, while only 8 percent said they fear being a victim of  a terrorist attack, the poll found.<P>
Costs paid by workers out of their own pockets for  prescription drugs and doctor visits jumped by at least 50  percent in just the last three years, the report found.<P>
Spending on health care is set to hit 17.7 percent of U.S.  gross domestic product by 2012, up from 14.1 percent in 2001,  according to government estimates.<P>
And as the baby boom generation retires, the numbers on  Medicare will swell. That's driving Congress to debate adding  coverage of prescription drugs to Medicare, the federal  insurance program for 41 million elderly and disabled.<P>
HMO PROFITS<P>
Premiums are rising a bit less rapidly at big companies  that take on the risk of health insurance themselves, so-called  self-insured employers like General Electric Co.<P>
That finding suggests "part of the rise in health care  premiums is due to insurers expanding their underwriting  gains," Altman said.<P>
Nearly every publicly traded HMO posted record profits in  recent quarters, as they keep raising premiums to cope with  underlying cost drivers -- prescription drugs, hospital and  doctor fees.<P>
But Altman cautioned against casting HMOs as villains,  noting they are just playing "catch-up" from an early period  when premiums trailed cost increases.<P>
The real culprit, not going away anytime soon, is the  forward march in pricey medical technology -- which brings with  it rapidly escalating costs, Altman said.<P>
The poll results were based on a telephone survey   conducted from January to May.<P>
