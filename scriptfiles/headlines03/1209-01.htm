<p>NEW YORK  - Former Vice President Al Gore endorsed  Democratic presidential hopeful Howard Dean on Tuesday and  called him the only candidate who could "take America back on  behalf of the people of this country."

  </table><!--/endimage/--></font>The move was expected to solidify Dean's lead among the  nine Democrats trying to unseat Republican President Bush in  the 2004 election and electrified the campaign before January's  Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary.

				<P>"Howard Dean really is the only candidate who has been able  to inspire at the grass-roots level all over this country the  kind of passion and enthusiasm for democracy and change and  transformation of America that we need," said Gore, who won the  popular vote in 2000 against Bush but lost the all-important  electoral votes after a bitter recount in Florida.

				<P>"We need to remake the Democratic Party and we need to  remake America to take it back on behalf of the people of this  country," Gore said at a campaign fund-raiser at the National  Black Theater in Harlem.

				<P>The pair will travel to Cedar Rapids, Iowa, later on  Tuesday for a joint campaign event before Dean returns to New  Hampshire for an evening Democratic debate.

				<P>"I'm very proud and honored to endorse Howard Dean to be  the next president of the United States of America," Gore said.

				<P>The endorsement from Gore, who considered another White  House run but decided against it nearly one year ago, gives  Dean the backing of one of the party's most senior  establishment figures and more credibility when criticized as a  product of the party's left-wing fringe.

				<P>The former Vermont governor, who was considered a fiscal  conservative in that office, has made his anti-Iraq war stance  a cornerstone of his presidential campaign.

				<P>Gore's backing also may feed Dean momentum, reinforced by a  wave of opinion polls showing him opening a wide lead in the  first primary state of New Hampshire and a smaller lead in the  caucus state of Iowa, where he is battling with Missouri Rep.  Richard Gephardt.

				<P>It was a harsh blow for U.S. Sen. Joseph Lieberman of  Connecticut, Gore's vice presidential running mate during the  2000 contest who had promised he would not run if Gore did.

				<P>Lieberman said on Tuesday that he was taken off guard by  Gore's endorsement of his rival for the 2004 Democratic  nomination.

				<P>"What really bothers me is that Al is supporting a  candidate who is so fundamentally opposed to the basic  transformation that Bill Clinton brought to the Democratic  Party in 1992," Lieberman said in an interview on NBC "Today"  show, referring to the partnership Gore had as vice president  to President Clinton for eight years.

				<P>"Clinton made our party once again fiscally responsible,  pro-growth, strong on values for middle class tax cuts. Howard  Dean is against all of those," Lieberman said.
