<p>President Bush has selected Jerry Thacker, a Pennsylvania marketing 

consultant who has characterized AIDS as the "gay plague" and called 

homosexuality a "deathstyle," to serve on the Presidential Advisory Commission 

on HIV and AIDS.

<P>The appointment stunned some AIDS researchers and activists, who said 

Thacker has a shaky grasp of science and outdated views on the issue despite 

being HIV-positive.

<P>They noted that Thacker had argued that religious faith could cure 

homosexuals, that condoms do not stop the spread of HIV and that people choose 

to be gay.

<P>"When you appoint someone with this social view, it is dangerous," said 

James Loyce, deputy director of health for AIDS programs with the San 

Francisco Health Department. "It sends the wrong message to the gay community 

and the wrong message to the broader community."

<P>An unnamed Bush administration official told the Washington Post that 

Thacker would be just one of 35 members on the panel.

<P><b>OTHER APPOINTEES</b>

<P>The official also noted other members who would be sworn in next week 

alongside Thacker included a member of the board of Human Rights Campaign, the 

nation's largest gay and lesbian advocacy group; an adviser on AIDS to the 

World Bank; and a state public health officer.

<P>Thacker, this official said, "has a very powerful and tragic personal story 

and an ability to reach out to an audience we couldn't reach in the process."

<P>Others have noted that Thacker, who says he contracted HIV after his wife 

was infected through a blood transfusion, has campaigned tirelessly to urge 

churches to treat those with HIV and AIDS with more compassion.

<P>Thacker's assistant said Wednesday he would not speak to reporters until 

after being sworn in next week. Health and Human Services Department spokesman 

Bill Pierce and Patricia Ware, executive director of the commission, declined 

to comment.

<P>The 35-member commission advises the White House on AIDS prevention policy.

<P><b>CRITICAL OF RESPONSE</b>

<P>It is the latest incarnation of a body created during the Reagan 

administration. Previous commissions have been highly critical of the nation's 

response to the AIDS epidemic and helped nudge the government and the 

pharmaceutical industry toward greater action.

<P>While some have questioned the efficacy of the panel, many agreed that 

Thacker's appointment would harm its credibility and that the resulting 

controversy could overshadow its work.

<P>"This individual is an extremist ideologue who persecutes and demeans an 

entire class of people impacted by this disease," said David Smith, spokesman 

for the Human Rights Campaign. "That type of person has no business advising 

the president of the United States on how the government should address the 

epidemic."

<P>In speeches and writings posted on his Web site and elsewhere, Thacker has 

described homosexuality as a "deathstyle" and said "Christ can rescue the 

homosexual."

<P>As word of his appointment spread through the gay community in recent days, 

some of the material disappeared from the Web site or was edited.

<P>Thacker has drawn fire for aggressively pushing "abstinence-until-marriage" 

education to curb HIV and AIDS.

<P><b>'BANKRUPT POLICY'</b>

<P>"Abstinence is a notoriously bankrupt policy," said Michael Lauro of 

Survive AIDS, a volunteer advocacy group. "No developed country takes it 

seriously. It politicizes what should be a public health issue."

<P>Others argued that urging abstinence until marriage does nothing to help 

gays and lesbians, who cannot legally marry.

<P>While activists condemned Thacker's social attitudes, researchers condemned 

his scientific acumen.

<P>"There's very good science supporting programs like education and condom 

use, and to have someone on the commission making statements based on morality 

and not on science is disturbing," said Tom Coates, director of the UC-San 

Francisco AIDS Research Institute. "It continues the Bush administration's 

trend toward morality-based rather than evidence-based public health and HIV 

prevention."

<P>Coates and others denounced the White House's claim that Thacker's views 

would be among many weighed by the commission.

<P>"Would you have a member of the Flat Earth Society advising the president 

on space policy?" Coates asked. "Why would you have people advising the 

president about approaches to public health who don't read the science?"

<P><b>BOB JONES UNIVERSITY GRAD</b>

<P>According to Thacker's biography on the Web site of the Scepter Institute, 

a nonprofit that sells religious-based AIDS material, Thacker is a graduate of 

Bob Jones University and was a "member of the university faculty for seven 

years."

<P>Bush caused a stir in the last campaign when he spoke at the South Carolina 

university, which until recently banned interracial dating and has been 

accused of anti-Catholic attitudes.

<P>Thacker returned to Bob Jones University in September 2001 to give two 

speeches. The speeches, summarized on the university Web site, addressed the 

"sin of homosexuality" and the Thacker family's struggle with AIDS.

<P>"When he and his wife discovered in 1986 that they had contracted HIV, the 

most horrible thought was that it was a disease connected with the sin of 

homosexuality," the summary reads. "They didn't want anyone to think they were 

homosexual because they knew what the Bible said about homosexuality."

<P>The summary of his speeches also notes that "Homosexuality is not inborn 

biologically, just as incest and bestiality are not inborn. Studies have shown 

that thousands of homosexuals have been set free from this sin."

<P><b>'REPARATIVE THERAPY'</b>

<P>Thacker's beliefs are known as "reparative therapy," which deems 

homosexuality aberrant behavior that can be modified through religious faith.

<P>The American Psychological Association and other scientific organizations 

say the approach has no medical or scientific basis.

<P>Thacker's promotional materials stress the need for compassion toward all 

AIDS patients, urging churches to think "Christianly" about people with AIDS 

and to hate the sin, but love the sinner.

<P>"Be compassionate to those caught up in this sinful deathstyle," the Bob 

Jones summary stated. "Only when homosexuals know it is a sin can they repent."

<P>Commission co-Chairman Tom Coburn said he knew little about Thacker except 

that he is HIV-positive. He said Thacker's views on homosexuality were 

irrelevant to the commission's efforts to stop the epidemic.
