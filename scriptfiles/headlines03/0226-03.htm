<p>SYDNEY, Feb 26 - An attack on Iraq by a "coalition of the willing"

would be a violation of international law that could end in the world court,

43 Australian legal experts warned here Wednesday.</P>

<P>   In an article published by the Sydney Morning Herald, the group of leading

barristers and academic lawyers argued that coalition members including

Australia had not yet presented any persuasive arguments that an invasion of

Iraq could be justified at international law.</P>

<P>   But the group says Iraq would now be justified in launching a pre-emptive

attack against the United States and its coalition partners because it is Iraq

that is now facing a direct threat.</P>

<P>   The group, which includes a former High Court judge, senior counsel and

international law professors from Australia's top universities says

international law recognizes two bases for the use of force.</P>

<P>   The first, enshrined in Article 51 of the United Nations Charter, allows

force to be used in self-defense only if the attack was actual or imminent.</P>

<P>   "The second basis is when the UN Security Council authorizes the use of

force as a collective response to the use or threat of force."</P>

<P>   But the group says the Security Council is bound by the terms of the UN

Charter and can authorize the use of force under charter seven only if there

is evidence of an actual threat which could not be averted by other means such

as negotiation and further weapons inspection.</P>

<P>   "Ironically, the same principle would justify Iraq now launching

pre-emptive attacks on members of the coalition because it could validly argue

that it feared attack."</P>

<P>   Publication of the article follows Prime Minister John Howard's strong

support Tuesday for the US-British draft resolution that could provide a

trigger for war on Iraq within two weeks.</P>

<P>   Australia and Britain are the only two countries to have committed forces

to a possible war against Iraq, although Howard maintains no decision has yet

been made to commit Australian troops to fighting.</P>

<P>   The group said even if the use of force against Iraq could be justified,

the Geneva Convention significantly limits the means and method.</P>

<P>   These include prohibitions on targeting civilian populations or civilian

infrastructure and causing extensive destruction of property not justified by

military objectives.</P>

<P>   Intentionally launching an attack knowing it would cause "incidental"

civilian casualties and which would be clearly excessive in relation to the

expected military outcome "constitutes a war crime."</P>

<P>   "The military objective of disarming Iraq could not justify widespread harm

to the Iraqi population, over half of whom are under the age of 15."</P>

<P>   The group said the creation of the International Criminal Court last year

had provided a stronger system of scrutiny and adjudication of violations of

humanitarian law.</P>

<P>   The court now has jurisdiction over war crimes and attributes criminal

responsibility to individuals responsible for planning military action that

violates international humanitarian law and those who carry it out.</P>

<P>   "It specifically extends criminal law to heads of state, leaders of

government, parliamentarians, government officials and military personnel,"

the group said.</P>

<P>   "Respect for international law must be the first concern of the Australian

government if it seeks to punish the Iraqi government for not respecting

international law."
