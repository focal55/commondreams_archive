<p>JERUSALEM - Israel’s security services arrested 47 mainly foreign
      opponents of its controversial security barrier on Tuesday as they tried
      to halt construction through a Palestinian family’s garden in the West
Bank, sources said.</p>
      <p>But despite the protests and mounting criticism of the project from the
      United States, a new poll found that public support for the project
      remained overwhelming.</p>

</table></font>Troops burst into the house of the Amar family in the village of Mashah
      as well as the garden where the protestors had erected a tent, activists
      and military sources told AFP. Authorities had declared the area “a
      closed military zone”.</p>
      <p>Those arrested included 41 members of the <a href="http://www.palsolidarity.org/" target="_new">International Solidarity
      Movement</a> (ISM) and six Israelis. It is understood that some of the foreign
      activists were from the United States, Britain, France, Italy, Germany and
      Sweden.</p>
<p>They told AFP by telephone that the troops who had arrested them put
      them on two buses which were taking them to a police post at the nearby
Jewish settlement at Ariel.</p>
      <p>A police spokesman said that the interior ministry had been informed of
their arrest with a view to their possible expulsion.</p>
      <p>The Palestinians and rights groups charge that the barrier, which
      consists either of a strong fence or a concrete wall, is an attempt by
      Israel to annex the West Bank’s “bread-basket” and unilaterally
determine the borders of a future Palestinian state.</p>
      <p>The ISM has been leading an aggressive campaign in recent weeks to
      protest against the fence as well as roadblocks hampering freedom of
movement in the West Bank.</p>
      <p>In previous protests US activist Rachel Corrie was crushed to death by
      an Israeli army bulldozer in the Gaza Strip town of Rafah in March and
      fellow ISM member Tom Hurndall from Britain was declared clinically dead
after being shot in the same area a month later.</p>
      <p>Tuesday’s arrests came as a senior US official told AFP the United
      States is considering punishing Israel for the construction of the barrier
in Palestinian areas.</p>
      <p>The plan would withhold from Israel US loan guarantees in the amount
      the Jewish state spends on the construction east of the official Green
Line division between Israel and the West Bank, the official said.</p>
      <p>Israel says the barrier is essential to prevent Palestinian militants
infiltrating from the West Bank to carry out anti-Israeli attacks.</p>
      <p>“It is something that is being looked at,” the official told AFP on
condition of anonymity.</p>
      <p>“Real questions have been raised about the fence and we’re
discussing how we should express our concerns in a concrete way.”</p>
      <p>The official said the proposal was still being debated by the White
      House and the State Department and that no decision on it would likely be
made before September.</p>
      <p>Shortly after the official spoke, Secretary of State Colin Powell
      stressed that US concerns about the construction of the barrier, which the
      Palestinians claim is an attempt to establish the boundaries of their
future state outside the negotiating process, were real.</p>
      <p>And, Powell noted with disapproval that along some stretches, the
      barrier is being built in Palestinian territory, jeopardizing the
potential success of the US-backed “roadmap” for peace.</p>
      <p>Despite the controversy, a survey by researchers at Tel Aviv University
found that support for the fence remains strong among the Israeli public.</p>
      <p>Eighty percent of respondents said that they backed the principle “of
      a fence separating Israel and the Palestinians” and only 15 percent were
against.</p>
      <p>The approval figure fell to 71 percent when asked if the project should
continue in the light of US objections.</p>
