<p>Without comment or ceremony, President Bush on Tuesday signed a bill allowing a record $984 billion increase in the amount the federal government can borrow, to a record $7.4 trillion. 

<p>The increased federal borrowing will enable the government to pay for the $350 billion economic stimulus package that the GOP-led Congress passed last week at Bush's behest. 

<p>Bush will hold a signing ceremony at the White House on Wednesday to celebrate passage of that legislation, White House spokesman Ari Fleischer announced. The package includes $330 billion in tax cuts and $20 billion in aid for states. 

<p>Passage of the bill raising the nation's debt ceiling came last Friday, only hours after the tax-cut bill was approved. Congressional Democrats had sought to spotlight the federal IOUs that have resumed piling up under President Bush. 

<p>But Republican leaders maneuvered to get the debt-ceiling measure passed quickly, and with little fanfare. 

<p>The Senate gave the bill final congressional approval by 53-44 on Friday. 

<p>Republican leaders did not bring the measure to the Senate floor until the House had left town for a weeklong Memorial Day recess. 

<p>The House had avoided a direct vote on the debt limit by reviving a rule that made its approval of a borrowing increase automatic when Congress finished its annual budget last month. 

<p>After running annual surpluses during the last four years of the Clinton administration, federal deficits have returned. This year's is expected to well exceed $300 billion, a record, and huge future shortfalls are expected with no end in sight. 

<p>Bush's signing of the bill -- announced in a statement with a single sentence -- will enable the government to borrow money until sometime next year. 

<p>The current $6.4 trillion limit was breached earlier this year. 

<p>Failure to extend the borrowing limit could have led to a first-ever federal default -- something neither party wants to explain. 

<p>The bill is H.J. Res. 51. 
e stage was set for Europe to split, with a helping hand from the US.
