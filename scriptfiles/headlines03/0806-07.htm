<p>Tyne  Daly was born a year after the first atom bomb fell on Hiroshima, but she remembers the worldwide shadows it cast: the practice air-raid drills, the duck-and-cover exercises, the generic Strangelovian foreboding.</p>
    <p>She's not so sure, however, that a younger generation really understands, particularly when phrases like "weapons of mass destruction" have been ground into cliche. "We've been spoon-fed so many images of things blowing up in the movies and on TV that it may have blunted our palate for the truly horrific," the actress says.</p>
    <p>Hence, Daly's latest project: a two-hour radio adaptation of "Hiroshima," John Hersey's landmark journalistic account of the bombing of the Japanese city on this day 58 years ago.</p>

</table></font>The former "Cagney &amp; Lacey" star (and current "Judging Amy" co-star) heads a cast that includes Ruby Dee, Roscoe Lee Browne and Daniel Benzali. It airs today on Pacifica Radio's five U.S. stations, including Washington's WPFW-FM (89.3), at 10 a.m., part of a day-long series of Hiroshima commemorative programming on the public station.</p>
    <p>The actors play -- actually, "give voice to" is more accurate, for this is less a play than a dramatic reading -- the six survivors of the Hiroshima blast on whom Hersey centered his 31,000-word account. Daly voices the experiences of a young Japanese war widow with three small children; Benzali is a German missionary; and Browne is a Japanese doctor thrown into the hellish aftermath of the American attack. Dee provides connecting narration.</p>
    <p>Hersey intentionally wrote his story -- which was published in the New Yorker in August 1946 and later became a best-selling book -- in a flat, almost dispassionate style, which emphasized the nearly unimaginable misery and devastation he recorded. This tone is reflected in the restrained, often grave reading of the actors.</p>
    <p>Benzali, for example, lowers his hoarse and cracking voice to a near-whisper when he reads the account of the priest encountering burned and desperately thirsty men: "Their eye sockets were hollow, the fluids from their melted eyes had run down their cheeks."</p>
    <p>The "Hiroshima" adaptation was the brainchild of Los Angeles actor John Valentine, Daly's brother-in-law. Valentine, 63, was playing poker with some young friends in February when the conversation turned to the prospect of a second Gulf War. When one member of the group expressed his fondness for "showing our muscle," it occurred to Valentine -- as it did to Daly later -- that young people had no real reference point for such sentiments.</p>
    <p> "I realized that evening that perhaps a generation or two had never read 'Hiroshima,' " which used to be required reading in high schools, he said. "I thought it was time for a reality check."</p>
    <p>So Valentine set to work modifying Hersey's work for radio, with the approval of Hersey's daughter Brook, who oversees her father's estate (Hersey died in 1993 at the age of 78). With Daly using her clout to round up actors (all worked without pay), Valentine pared down the narrative. He also served as another narrator.</p>
    <p>The project was first pitched to National Public Radio in Washington earlier this year, but it was rejected for what Valentine and Daly characterize as "political" reasons. NPR disputes this account, saying it was a question of timing.</p>
    <p>"It was NPR's sense that this was a pitch that clearly represented a reaction to looming events [the Iraqi war], and from a news perspective it was premature," said spokeswoman Jenny Lawhorn.</p>
    <p>Pacifica -- a public radio chain founded by Quaker antiwar activists in 1949 -- eagerly embraced the idea, providing recording and editing help through its Pacifica Radio Archives in Los Angeles.</p>
    <p>Ideally, Valentine said, the production will "start some conversations and debate." He recognizes, of course, that one of the debates might be about what some consider the perversely humanitarian nature of the bombing. In other words, the deaths of roughly 175,000 in the nuclear destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki three days later may have saved lives, given that Japan's nearly immediate surrender spared both sides a catastrophic invasion of the Japanese homeland.</p>
    <p> Hersey certainly recognized this, including in his story a letter from a Jesuit priest musing on the human tradeoffs inherent in "total war." Valentine's adaptation leaves this coda intact, preserving the chillingly murky meaning of Hiroshima, and of "Hiroshima." </p>
