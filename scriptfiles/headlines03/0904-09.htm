<p>DRESDEN, Germany  - France and Germany responded  coolly on Thursday to a U.S. move to win a United Nations  mandate for a peacekeeping force for Iraq, and the new Iraqi  foreign minister said Turkish troops would be unwelcome.

</table>"We are ready to examine the proposals but they seem quite  far from what appears to us the primary objective, namely the  transfer of political responsibility to an Iraqi government as  soon as possible," French President Jacques Chirac said.<P>
Facing almost daily casualties in Iraq, Washington has  drafted a new U.N. resolution aimed at getting more countries  to contribute soldiers and cash to its occupation. But it  insists on full U.S. military control and a dominant political  role.<P>
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder told a news conference  with Chirac that the proposals showed movement in the U.S.  position but did not go far enough. He said that while France  and Germany opposed the U.S.-led war in Iraq, they now wanted  to help bring stability and democracy to the country.<P>
"Such a perspective can only develop if the United Nations  takes over responsibility for the political process and if an  Iraqi administration is installed," Schroeder said.<P>
The proposed U.N. resolution marked a policy reversal for  the administration of President Bush, which had resisted U.N.  involvement after the Security Council's refusal to approve the  war that toppled Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.<P>
France, Russia, China and Germany were among nations on the  Security Council which opposed the war.<P>
Belgian Foreign Minister Louis Michel welcomed the U.S.  plan, but did not say if his country would provide troops.<P>

Wary of Iraqi hostility to the U.S.-led occupation, India,  Pakistan, Bangladesh, Turkey and other potential contributors  have balked at sending troops without an international mandate.<P>
Newly appointed Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari said  his government would not welcome troops from neighboring  countries because they might meddle in Iraq's affairs.<P>
Asked about a possible Turkish peacekeeping role, he told  the Arabic television channel Al Jazeera: "Our neighboring  countries have their own political agendas, which they could  bring with them to Iraq, thus causing more instability in  Iraq."<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan shrugged off Zebari's  remarks, saying Ankara would make its own decision.<P>
"The Iraqi minister's statement reflects his own opinion.  We have committees working there (in Iraq) at the moment and we  will make an assessment," he told reporters.<P>
Zebari, a Kurd who is part of a cabinet named this week by  the U.S.-appointed Iraqi Governing Council, criticized Turkey's  interventions in northern Kurdish-dominated areas of Iraq.<P>
Turkey considers northern Iraq to be an area of strategic  interest. It has kept troops there since the 1990s, fighting  Turkish Kurd rebels operating from the border mountains.<P>
Washington wants Turkey, NATO's only Muslim member, to send  troops quickly. The Turkish public has little enthusiasm for  such a mission, but Ankara knows that another refusal to commit  forces to Iraq could jeopardize much-needed U.S. loans.<P>
Iraq's neighbor, Jordan, said it welcomed an expanded U.N.  role in Iraq but had no plans to send its own troops there.<P>
"We have stated in the past that we will not send Jordanian  troops in the shadow of occupation and our position has not  changed," Information Minister Nabil al-Sharif told Reuters.
