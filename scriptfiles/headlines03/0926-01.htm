<p>WASHINGTON - The former head of U.S. Central Command said in an interview aired on Thursday that he had concerns about the credibility of intelligence used as the basis for the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq.

</table>Retired Marine Corps Gen. Anthony Zinni questioned claims that ousted Iraqi president Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and that he was an imminent threat -- President Bush's major justification for going to war.

<p>"I'm suggesting that either the intelligence was so bad and flawed -- and if that's the case, then somebody's head ought to roll for that -- or the intelligence was exaggerated or twisted in a way to make a more convenient case to the American people," Zinni said on ABC's "Nightline."

<p>"If there's a strategic decision for taking down Iraq, if it's the so-called neoconservative idea that taking apart Iraq and creating a democracy, or whatever it is, will change the equation in the Middle East, then make the case based on this," said Zinni, who as Central Command chief had military responsibility for the Middle East.

<p>The four-star general said he still does not believe that ousted Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein posed an imminent threat or that he possessed chemical, biological or nuclear weapons.

<p>"I believe that what Saddam had was the framework for a weapons of mass destruction program that could be quickly activated once sanctions were lifted," Zinni told ABC.

<p>U.S. forces have been searching for such weapons in Iraq for more than five months. None has so far been found.

<p>Zinni also expressed concern about the security situation in Iraq and said he was worried about the lack of planning for the postwar era. Guerrilla attacks have killed 79 U.S. soldiers in Iraq since Washington declared major combat over on May 1.

<p>Before his retirement in 2000, Zinni drew up invasion plans that he said called for considerably more troops than the 140,000 now in Iraq.

<p>"The plan was criticized by this Pentagon as overestimating the amount of troops. ... But actually, the plan had those troops built into it because we looked at the security requirements immediately afterwards," he said.

<p>While expressing skepticism over how the United States got into Iraq, Zinni said withdrawing was not an option.

<p>"We can't fail in Iraq. We have to live up to this commitment," he said. "But what we need now is a very detailed plan."
