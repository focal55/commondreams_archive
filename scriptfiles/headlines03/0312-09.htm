<p>HOUSTON  - Texas plans on Wednesday to carry out  its 300th execution since resuming capital punishment 21 years  ago in a case that critics say highlights nearly all of the  problems in the state's justice system.

<p>



Delma Banks, 44, would be the 300th inmate executed in the  modern era of Texas executions, which began when the state put  to death Charlie Brooks in 1982. Brooks was executed six years  after the U.S. Supreme Court lifted a nationwide death penalty  ban. Texas is the U.S. death penalty leader.<p>



		The 299th person to be executed, Bobby Glen Cook, was  executed by lethal injection at the state prison in Huntsville  on Tuesday for the 1993 robbery and shooting murder of Edwin  Holder of Buffalo, Texas.<p>



		Cook, in his last statement, apologized to the victim's  family, none of whom was present, and claimed the shooting was  in self-defense.<p>



		Cook had claimed Holder pulled a gun on him and that he  took it away and shot Holder in self-defense. But physical  evidence suggested Holder was asleep in a sleeping bag in the  bed of his pickup truck when he was shot at close range.<p>



		Banks, a black man with no prior criminal record, was  sentenced for robbing and shooting to death Richard Whitehead,  a white 16-year-old, on April 14, 1980, in the east Texas town  of Nash.<p>



		TRIAL SAID UNFAIR<p>



		Supporters of Banks say his right to a fair trial was  marred by alleged prosecutorial misconduct, bad defense  lawyering and the elimination of blacks from the jury pool.<p>



		"These are the problems that have plagued death penalty  cases for a long time," said Banks' lawyer George Kendall. "Not  just in Texas, but in many other places as well."<p>



		Death penalty opponents including the NAACP's Legal Defense  Fund, with whom Kendall works, and Amnesty International have  asked Texas to stop Banks' execution.<p>



		In a rare move, three former federal judges, including  former FBI director William Sessions, joined Banks' defense  with a friend-of-the-court brief to the U.S. Supreme Court.<p>



		Banks has filed two petitions with the court.<p>



		On Monday the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles refused to  hear Banks' request for clemency, saying it had been submitted  nearly a week past a deadline for appeal.<p>



		The two key witnesses that prosecutors brought against  Banks were drug addicts with criminal records. They have since  recanted.<p>



		One was a longtime police informant who was paid for his  services and the other was facing a Dallas arson charge that  could have led to a long prison sentence unless he performed  "well" on the witness stand.<p>



		The latter witness, Charles Cook, told jurors that Banks  confessed to "shooting a white boy." His arson case was dropped  after Banks was convicted.<p>



		EXCLUDING BLACK JURORS<p>



		After his trial Banks showed that from 1975 through 1980,  Bowie County prosecutors had accepted 80 percent of qualified  white jurors while eliminating 90 percent of black jurors in  felony cases. They also used a code, writing "b" or "n" next to  the names of black jurors on jury lists.<p>



		Prosecutors argued they had race-neutral reasons to remove  the four potential black jurors in Banks' jury pool. Banks'  lawyer never objected during the trial.<p>



		Banks' argument might sway the U.S. Supreme Court. Last  month it granted Texas death row inmate Thomas Miller-El a  chance to present similar evidence of racial bias in his jury  selection.<p>



		Texas has a long history of independence and resistance to  interference in its affairs, and its death penalty stance has  strained relations among the United States and its allies.<p>



		Most recently, Texas said it would not heed a World Court  order demanding it stay the executions of two Mexicans. Mexico  had accused U.S. police of violating an international treaty  that requires them to notify foreign criminal suspects of their  right to consular assistance.</p>
