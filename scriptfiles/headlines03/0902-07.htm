<p>Leaders of the US Muslim community hope to deliver a bloc vote in next year's presidential elections, but one that in all likelihood will go against the candidate they endorsed last time -- President George W. Bush.</p>

  </table></font>Representatives of the four leading US Muslim advocacy groups agreed this weekend to co-operate on a voter registration drive that they hope will send one million Muslims to the polls in the 2004 presidential elections.</p>
<p>The vote is likely to reflect widespread "dissatisfaction" in the Muslim American community with the Bush administration's treatment of Arab and Muslim Americans since the September 11 attacks, according to Nihad Awad, executive director of the <a href="http://www.cair-net.org/" target="_new">Council on American-Islamic Relations</a>, (CAIR).</p>
<p>"Feelings are running strongly against Bush in the community," he said."We feel that civil liberties have deteriorated in this country."</p>
<p>Among the policies that have alienated Muslims are ones that allow for the racial profiling of Arab and Muslim men, the use of secret evidence in cases said to touch on national security, and the detention and deportation of many Arab and Muslim nationals without the right to legal representation.</p>
<p>Community leaders say a rash of hate attacks on Muslims and Arabs and verbal assaults on Islam by leading evangelical preachers have increased the community's sense of isolation.</p>
<p>"Muslims are eager to vote in defense of their liberties and in defense of their future," said Awad, who heads up the best-known of the four groups. "We want equal respect and equal treatment under the law."</p>
<p>Awad declined to say which, if any, Democratic candidate the coalition would endorse.</p>
<p>"We will try to do a better job than we did in 2000," said Awad. "No decision has been made. There is a long consultation process to go through yet."</p>
<p>CAIR and the other coalition members -- the American Muslim Council, the American Muslim Alliance, and the Muslim Public Affairs Council -- have begun voter registration drives at mosques and Islamic centers across the nation in hopes of ensuring a strong turnout in the 2004 presidential elections.</p>
<p>The four groups met under the aegis of the Islamic Society of North America which held its 40th annual convention in Chicago this weekend.</p>
