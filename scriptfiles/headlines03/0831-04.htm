<p>On Labor Day, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. plans to announce a nationwide campaign that union leaders say is crucial to assuring labor's  future, a campaign that aims to change federal laws to make it easier for workers to join unions.</p>
<P>
Disclosing details of this effort, the federation's president, John J. Sweeney, said in an interview on Friday that American workers often faced huge obstacles to forming unions, saying they can rarely exercise the right to unionize without facing employer intimidation.</p>
<P>
"The right of workers to make their own free choice to join a union has been effectively canceled in a huge majority of unionization elections," Mr. Sweeney said. "Employers engage in every tactic imaginable to block workers' freedom to form a union."</p>
<P>
With union membership falling to 13 percent of the work force from 35 percent in the 1950's, union leaders bemoan labor's decline and say a major effort is needed to organize more workers and to amend the labor laws if unions are to avoid sinking into oblivion.</p>
<P>
But many business leaders assert that unions are facing problems organizing workers not because of corporate resistance but because many American workers see unions as outmoded and irrelevant.</p>
<P>
Mr. Sweeney outlined plans for the  campaign in a speech last night in Philadelphia at the annual meeting of the American Political Science Association. He plans to announce  the effort formally tomorrow in Cincinnati alongside several union presidents.</p>
<P>
In his prepared remarks for the Philadelphia speech, Mr. Sweeney cites academic studies that found that in 92 percent of organizing drives employers invoked their legal right to make employees attend anti-union meetings, and that in 78 percent of such campaigns supervisors submitted workers to one-on-one pressure sessions.</p>
<P>
"Companies illegally threaten to close up shop if workers want to unionize, and in 25 percent of unionization drives they illegally fire workers who support a union," Mr. Sweeney said. "The penalties are so weak against employer violations that they're really no deterrent at all."</p>
<P>
As part of this campaign, the labor movement will contend that the right to form unions without intimidation — a right guaranteed by international convention — is routinely violated in the United States and that the government does little to protect that right. </p>
<P>
"What we're seeing is a fundamental violation of people's human rights every single day," said Stewart Acuff, the federation's organizing director and the foremost advocate of this campaign. "Workers don't have the right to form a union. It's not a right if you have to be scared to exercise it. But many do it anyway because they are willing to exercise a tremendous amount of courage and to risk their livelihood."</p>
<P>
Randel Johnson, vice president for labor policy at the United States Chamber of Commerce, asserted that unions were looking for a scapegoat for their difficulty in  attracting members.</p>
<P>
"Unions continue to blame their continued decline on employers and weak enforcement of labor laws," Mr. Johnson  said. "The problem is they can't come up with new ideas that appeal to the workers of today. It's like a business continuing to sell a product that no one is buying but the business is blaming the customer."</p>
<P>
Under the planned union campaign, known as Voice@Work, labor leaders hope to educate union members about the obstacles nonunion workers face before unionizing and to mobilize union members to contact lawmakers. Labor unions also plan to ask immigrant groups, ethnic groups and clergy members to push for new laws and to press companies not to fight unionization. Labor unions have already lined up considerable support within Congress for this campaign, with more than a dozen House members agreeing to form a Congressional Workers Rights Caucus.</p>
<P>
Ninety-two members of the House, almost all of them Democrats, have written  Cintas, a Cincinnati corporation that is the nation's largest industrial laundry and uniform company, urging it to make it easier for its workers to form a union. Cintas is battling efforts to unionize 17,000 of its workers and labor's demands to let its workers organize by signing cards, rather than by a lengthy election process.</p>
<P>
Officials at Cintas and many other companies say that they have a First Amendment right to oppose unionization and that it is fairer to gauge pro-union sentiment through an election rather than by signing cards.</p>
<P>
To show his backing for the  A.F.L.-C.I.O. campaign, Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said he would introduce a bill this week that would require companies to recognize unions once a majority of their workers signed pro-union cards in a process known as card check.</p>
<P>
"It's become next to impossible to organize," Mr. Schumer said. "I asked union organizers what do you need to succeed, and they say card check."</p>
