<p>Misleading and incomplete reporting by major news outlets helped President 
Bush steer America into war with Iraq, speakers said Friday during the opening 
session of a three-day National Conference on Media Reform at UW-Madison. <p>"This 
war could never have taken place without the complicity of the news media," said 
John Stauber, author and founder of the Center for Media and Democracy, a group 
that seeks to expose corporate and government propaganda campaigns. "The media 
that sold this war doesn't want to examine how they did it." <p>Amy Goodman, host 
of Pacifica Radio's "Democracy Now!" program, said war would stop if media outlets 
showed images of injured and dead Iraqi civilians, including children, as often 
as they showed images such as the toppling of a large statue of Saddam Hussein 
draped with an American flag. <p>Goodman also faulted the media and U.S. government 
for failing to tally Iraqi casualties. She quoted Secretary of State Colin Powell 
as once having justified this by explaining that the military doesn't count enemy 
deaths. <p>"I don't consider a little dead Iraqi girl or boy on the ground my 
enemy," Goodman said in front of about 1,600 people in the Great Hall of the Memorial 
Union on campus. <p>The conference continues today with more speeches, films, 
music and discussions, including an 8 p.m. speech at the Orpheum Theater by Bill 
Moyers of National Public Television fame. Tickets to the Orpheum event are sold 
out. <p>Consumer advocate and former Green Party presidential candidate Ralph 
Nader has rescheduled his appearance for 8 a.m. today in Room 3650 Humanities 
on campus. His talk is free and open to the public.<p>Media reform has quickly 
become one of the top issues on Capitol Hill, said former UW-Madison professor 
Robert McChesney, a featured speaker who's now at the University of Illinois. 
Attention has peaked since June when the Federal Communications Commission voted 
3-2 to relax media ownership rules. Media companies could get bigger by owning 
newspapers and broadcast outlets in the same cities. A single company also could 
own TV stations reaching 45 percent of the nation's viewers. <p>Critics including 
many of the authors, politicians and independent journalists at this weekend's 
conference argue that the growth of media conglomerates limits and skews the diversity 
of news reports and opinions that Americans read and hear. <p>A federal appeals 
court issued an emergency stay in September, preventing the rules from going into 
effect for now. <p>Some Republicans including Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi want 
to undo the FCC changes. But this weekend's conference features mostly Democratic 
politicians and left-wing activists and commentators.<p>Stauber and Goodman acknowledged 
not all big media companies are inherently bad. After all, Stauber used a major 
publisher for his best-selling book, "Weapons of Mass Deception: The Uses of Propaganda 
in Bush's War on Iraq," and Goodman's program is carried on 170 radio stations. 
<p>Yet most people get their news from major network and cable television stations 
that are less likely to scrutinize events involving the Fortune 500 companies 
that pay for expensive TV ads, speakers said. <p>"The eyeballs are still watching 
TV, and we have to build up a mass movement" for reform, said Nancy Snow, an author 
and assistant professor at California State University. <p ALIGN="CENTER">Copyright
