<p> WASHINGTON  - President Bush's anti-abortion
policy has hit clinics in poor countries hard, forcing some to
close and leave entire communities without healthcare,
according to a report issued on Wednesday.

</table>Under the policy, known as the Mexico City rule by
supporters and the Global Gag rule by opponents, foreign family
planning agencies cannot receive U.S. funds if they provide
abortion services or lobby to make or keep abortion legal in
their own country.
 <p>
 A survey of Ethiopia, Kenya, Romania and Zambia by
Population Action International and the Planned Parenthood Federation of America showed the rule had forced clinics to
close and left many men and women without access to
contraceptives that could prevent both unwanted pregnancies and
AIDS.
 <p>
 "Health services have been scaled back and closings of
reproductive health clinics have left some communities with no
healthcare provider," the group wrote in a statement.
<p>
 The policy has also hurt AIDS prevention efforts, said the
groups, which published the findings on the Internet at
   <a href="http://www.globalgagrule.org" target="_new">www.globalgagrule.org</a>.
<p>
 As one of his first acts in office in 2001, Bush reinstated
the rule that former President Bill Clinton, a Democrat, had
lifted. The rule was originally imposed in 1984 by President
Ronald Reagan at a Mexico City conference.
<p>
 Last month Bush ordered the State Department to strengthen
the rule by withholding U.S. family planning help from overseas
groups that promote or perform abortions with their own money.
<p>
 PROTECT WOMENS' HEALTH
<p>
 Supporters say the United States should not be spending
taxpayer money to promote abortion. Opponents argue that
abortion is legal in the United States and elsewhere and that
abortion counseling is part of a wide range of advice that
women need to protect their health.
<p>
 "Our research has found that the Global Gag Rule is taking
a toll on the lives and health of women, children and families
around the world," the report reads.
Five family planning clinics run by nongovernmental
organizations have closed in Kenya because they broke the rule
and lost funding from the U.S. Agency for International
development, the report said.
<p>
 "The NGOs have also had to cut their staffing by as much as
30 percent, reduce services in remaining clinics and raise fees
in order to remain viable."
<p>
 "In Lesotho, one in four women is infected with HIV/AIDS --
one of the highest rates in southern Africa. Over a three-year
period from 1998 to 2000, the Lesotho Planned Parenthood
Association received 426,000 condoms ... all donated by USAID,"
the report added.
<p>
 "Because of their refusal to agree to the gag rule
restrictions, they no longer receive USAID contraceptives."
<p>
 In Kenya's Mathare Valley a clinic closed, leaving 300,000
people with no healthcare services. "And there is no other
family planning or reproductive health clinic nearby," the
report said.
<p>
 In Romania, women may be more likely to get abortions, not
fewer, because the rule has meant more women cannot get any
information on contraceptives that can prevent unwanted
pregnancies, the report said.
<p>
 "This is the real face of Bush's compassionate conservatism
-- a war on the world's most vulnerable women and children, who
bear the brunt of Bush's obsession with appeasing his domestic
political base," Planned Parenthood's Gloria Feldt said in a
statement.
