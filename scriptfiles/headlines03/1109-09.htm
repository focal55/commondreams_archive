<p>CAIRO, Nov. 9 - Eleven people were killed, among them four children, and more 
than 100 were wounded in an armed raid and car bomb attack on a residential compound 
in Saudi Arabia's capital, Riyadh, the Saudi Interior Ministry said today. <p>The 
huge blast from the explosives-laden car occurred just before midnight on Saturday 
in what the country's Interior Ministry described as a terrorist attack. <p>The 
ministry, in a statement carried by the official Saudi Press Agency, said that 
those killed included Saudis, Sudanese and Egyptians. It said those wounded were 
Americans and Canadians, as well as people from Africa, India, Bangladesh, Indonesia, 
the Philippines, Pakistan, Turkey, Sri Lanka and Romania. <p>The Interior Ministry 
said that most had been treated and released but that 25 remained in the hospital. 
<p>The explosion occurred on a day that the American Embassy and other United 
States diplomatic facilities were closed because of warnings about just such an 
attack, Saudi officials and Western diplomats said. <p>The Saudi Interior Ministry 
saidthe explosion was a terrorist attack on Muhaya compound in the western part 
of the city. <p>The force of the blast could be heard across the sprawling capital, 
and Riyadh residents who lived miles away said they had felt their buildings shake. 
The explosion shattered windows throughout the walled compound, which housed mostly 
Arab residents as well as some Westerners, according to officials and witnesses. 
<p>One American was hospitalized after the blast and a second remained unaccounted 
for, said Carol Kalin, a spokeswoman for the United States Embassy. She said `a 
handful' of Americans lived in the compound. <p>Ms. Kalin said that the embassy 
would remain closed until further notice and that American diplomats were staying 
within the diplomatic quarter. <p>Three suicide attacks against similar residential 
compounds in May, which Saudi Arabia said were carried out by Al Qaeda, killed 
25 residents, including 8 Americans, as well as 9 suicide bombers. <p>In their 
desire to drive all Western influence out of the Arabian peninsula, the militants 
are believed to include as targets any Arabs and Muslims who maintain the same 
kind of relaxed ways of life as their Western counterparts behind the high walls 
of such compounds. <p>Pictures broadcast from the scene showed smoke and flames 
still erupting from several shattered residences two hours after the attack, the 
flames outlining palm trees in the otherwise dark night. <p>Witnesses who live 
in the compound told Al Arabiya by telephone that there were scores of wounded 
and an unknown number of dead. The station broadcast live pictures from inside 
an unidentified hospital of a number of bloodied men, women and children being 
treated for wounds. <p>The American Embassy, situated three miles away from the 
attack site in the heavily protected diplomatic quarter, issued a warning on Friday 
about an imminent terrorist attack and was closed to the public on Saturday. The 
United States Consulates on opposite coasts in Dhahran and Jidda were also closed. 
<p>The United States and the British and Australian governments had issued travel 
advisories at the beginning of the holy month of Ramadan, two weeks ago, warning 
of a possible terrorist attack. The American Embassy's warning told American citizens 
to be on alert during a month when some might try to exploit the period of heightened 
religious awareness to strike. <p>Ms. Kalin, the embassy spokeswoman, said all 
embassy personnel were accounted for immediately after the attack. <p>``I heard 
a blast and saw a light; others were woken up by the blast,'' said Ms. Kalin, 
who was in the diplomatic quarter, a walled enclave where virtually all embassies 
are situated. <p>The spokeswoman said the embassy and consulates had been closed 
Saturday because ``there were threats that had gone beyond planning to an operational 
stage.'' <p>``They were threatening enough that we decided to close our facilities 
to the public,'' she said. ``We also warned that Americans should use extreme 
vigilance at any location perceived to be Western or American.'' <p ALIGN="CENTER">Copyright
