<p>BAGHDAD - Two Iraqis were killed on Saturday in  violent confrontations between hundreds of former soldiers in  Saddam Hussein's disbanded army and occupying troops in Baghdad  and the southern city of Basra.<P>
The British army said one of its soldiers shot dead an  armed Iraqi during an angry demonstration in Basra by men who  had gathered to collect redundancy payments after being laid  off from the Iraqi military.<P>

  </table></font>Major Simon Routledge said a British soldier heard gunfire  and then shot and killed an Iraqi holding a weapon. British  troops also fired rubber bullets to disperse the crowd.<P>
Hundreds of former Iraqi soldiers also rioted at a disused  airport in Baghdad where redundancy payments are handed out.  They hurled rocks and rushed toward U.S. soldiers who beat them  back with batons and fired shots in the air.<P>
Officials at a hospital said one Iraqi had been killed and  several wounded. The U.S. Army said two of its soldiers and  four Iraqis were wounded.<P>
Jobless men also staged a violent protest in the holy city  of Najaf. Charles Heatly, spokesman for Iraq's U.S.  administrator Paul Bremer, said there had been disturbances at  a payment center for former soldiers in the town of Hilla too.<P>
Heatly said there was no indication that the violence was  coordinated. He said the unrest was fueled by "old guard" Iraqi  officers who spread a rumor that there was not enough money to  pay all the ex-conscripts.<P>
"They decided to stir up the crowd that was waiting outside  the payment centers in Baghdad and Basra, in particular, to  create a disturbance," he told a news conference.<P>
NEW ARMY<P>
The U.S.-led administration in Iraq disbanded the country's  army in May. It later agreed to pay $40 compensation to each of  the 440,000 conscripts who had served in the army.<P>
Washington is setting up a smaller military force to take  the place of Saddam's army. On Saturday, the first recruits in  the New Iraqi Army graduated from basic training in a ceremony  near the Iranian border attended by Bremer. Heatly said news of  the ceremony may also have sparked the unrest.<P>
Late on Friday, guerrillas attacked a U.S. convoy near  Baghdad with gunfire and rocket-propelled grenades, killing a  4th Infantry Division soldier and wounding another, the U.S.  Army said. It said American troops pursued the attackers,  killing two and wounding one.<P>
Fourth Infantry Division spokeswoman Major Josslyn Aberle  said guerrillas fired mortars at a U.S. outpost about 30 miles  north of Baghdad. A 12-year-old girl was killed and two other  civilians wounded in homes near the base.<P>
At least 85 U.S. soldiers have been killed in action in  Iraq since Washington declared major combat over on May 1.<P>
DIPLOMATIC TENSIONS<P>
Washington, facing a guerrilla insurgency and mounting  financial costs, is trying to agree a new United Nations  resolution giving the world body a broader mandate in Iraq in  an effort to coax reluctant countries to provide troops and  funds.<P>
But Security Council members France and Russia say they are  unhappy with the draft U.S. resolution. The two countries,  which opposed the war in Iraq, want a faster handover of power  to Iraqis as a condition for their support.<P>
"I won't hide from you that it was a bit of a  disappointment for us...there is fairly little progress,"  French President Jacques Chirac said of the draft resolution at  a news conference at a European Union summit in Rome.<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has said the world body  could not play a proper political role in Iraq under the terms  wanted by the United States.<P>
Meanwhile, a diplomatic spat between Poland and France  which began when Polish troops in Iraq found French-made  missiles near the town of Hilla seemed to have been defused on  Saturday.<P>
Warsaw apologized to Paris for claiming that the advanced  anti-aircraft missiles had been produced in 2003, saying  Defense Minister Jerzy Szmajdzinski regretted the information  on the alleged date.<P>
