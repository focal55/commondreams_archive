<p>Now that the Bush administration has won the shooting war in Iraq, it 

has begun the far more challenging mission of transforming a brutal tyranny 

into a democracy, and then lighting the fire of political reform throughout 

the entire Middle East.

<P>Numerous experts describe the campaign as among the most ambitious 

political experiments ever attempted. Many insist it is dangerous folly.

<P>"Democracy has emerged at times where it had never existed before," said 

Larry Diamond, a senior fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution who 

has written extensively on the spread of democratic movements. "But Iraq lacks 

virtually every possible precondition for democracy. And the possibilities in 

the other Arab countries may be even lower."

<P>He said, for instance, there's not a large, entrepreneurial middle class, 

almost no experience with free elections and neither a free press nor an open 

economy practically anywhere in the region.

<P>Murhaf Jouejati, adjunct scholar at the Middle East Institute in Washington,

<P>said it was obvious that most Iraqis were thrilled at throwing off the yoke 

of oppression, but that the looting and chaos that has followed provide an 

ominous sign of the kinds of violent forces the war has unleashed, and how 

hard it will be to contain them.

<P>"There has not been a single day of democracy in Iraq in its history," he 

said. "It is still a tribal and clan-oriented society. Democracy needs a 

social infrastructure that does not exist at all in Iraq, or elsewhere in the 

region."

<P>Nevertheless, President Bush and administration officials have stated 

repeatedly that their aim was not only to disarm and depose Saddam Hussein, 

but also to leave behind a robust democratic government and an open society 

along American lines.

<P>That will be just the seed, they have argued, for a flowering of 

democracies throughout the Arab world.

<P>But the region consists of dictatorships and monarchies where -- aside from 

a brief flirtation with political pluralism in Lebanon years ago -- no 

successful democracy has ever taken root. And now it is seething with 

resentment against America for what many Arabs perceive as a colonialistic 

intervention in Iraq -- a view shared even by some friendly Arab governments.

<P><b>INTERNAL PRESSURE</b>

<P>Judith Kipper, the director of the Middle East Forum at the Council on 

Foreign Relations in New York, said that there was, in fact, growing pressure 

for change in the region, largely from the exploding numbers of frustrated 

young Arabs with few prospects of good jobs or the kind of education that 

could provide one. Experience has shown, though, that this has never 

translated into a yearning for a Jeffersonian upheaval, she said.

<P>"There is a real craving for something better -- to have jobs, 

entertainment, education," she said. "But they don't want Western-style 

democracies. Absolutely not. We should get it out of our heads that their 

societies are going to start looking like us."

<P>David Ransom, a diplomat who spent his career in the Middle East and was U.

S. ambassador to Bahrain during the Clinton administration, said that open 

elections, if they could actually be staged, might produce even grimmer 

results, because many alienated Arabs would choose fundamentalist regimes if 

given a chance.

<P>"I firmly believe that even if we could get democracies there, we aren't 

going to like the results," said Ransom, now a scholar at the Middle East 

Institute. "I spent 30 years looking for grassroots democratic movements in 

the Middle East and I didn't find any."

<P>Added Diamond, "This is going to be a long hard struggle. Nothing will go 

quickly."

<P>Even some Bush administration supporters have raised serious questions 

about the prospects for democracy, and the extent of American tolerance.

<P>"I'm a skeptic about the ability to transform Iraq into a democracy in any 

realistic period of time," Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser 

under President Bush's father, said in a recent speech to the Norwegian Nobel 

Institute. He stressed the lack of functioning civic institutions and the 

bitter divisions among Iraqi religious and ethnic groups as obstacles to any 

sort of political pluralism.

<P>"What's going to happen the first time we hold an election in Iraq and it 

turns out the radicals win?" Scowcroft asked. "What do you do? We're surely 

not going to let them take over."

<P><b>THREATENING THE STATUS QUO</b>

<P>Even some of America's staunchest Arab allies have bridled, because their 

own monopoly on power might be threatened by a push toward U.S.-style free 

elections and thriving political opposition.

<P>"The idea of imposing democracy from outside is not supported by Egypt or 

any Arab country," said Osama el Baz, a top adviser to President Hosni Mubarak 

of Egypt, one of the largest recipients of U.S. foreign aid.

<P><b>THE ASIAN EXAMPLE</b>

<P>Bush has responded to the skeptics by pointing to America's success half a 

century ago in nurturing democracy among its World War II foes, Japan, Germany 

and Italy. And one of the administration's principal ideologues, Deputy 

Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz, has compared the Middle East to East Asia,

<P>where a sort of reverse domino theory took hold after the Vietnam War, 

spreading democracy rather than communism.

<P>"It's very important for people to understand this idea that Arabs are not 

capable of democracy is nonsense," Wolfowitz said on "Meet the Press" last 

Sunday. "I remember hearing that Koreans weren't capable of democracy, and 

that was a myth you heard for a long time. The Koreans have demonstrated they 

can do it. Many people have done it in the latter part of the 20th century. 

It's time for the Arabs to do it now."

<P>But many experts say the analogy with Asia, which has grown over the past 

half-century from one of the most despotic to one of the most democratized 

regions in the world, undermines rather than supports the administration's 

arguments.

<P>Catharin Dalpino, an Asia expert at the Brookings Institution in Washington,

<P>said that before democracy took root in East Asia, a solid foundation had 

been established: there was an educated middle class in each country, 

generally open economies reliant on trade, growing prosperity, a lively press 

and some experience with free elections and pluralism, at least at a local 

level. Each country had a generally able civil service, too.

<P>Importantly, she added, the movements took years to develop.

<P>"We have this belief now in a pop-up democracy," said Dalpino. "We think 

the fall of the Berlin Wall is the model all the other countries will follow, 

that democracy is just waiting to happen once you remove all the things that 

get in the way. It requires special conditions, and even then there are 

different kinds of democracies that we may not like."

<P>Diamond said that Iraq lacked nearly all the qualities that made most Asian 

countries fertile ground for democratic development: Illiteracy among adults 

is now estimated at more than 40 percent; the Iraqi population is young, with 

some 40 percent under age 15, but joblessness, even before the war, was 

pervasive; the middle class has lost its buying power and seen its lifestyle 

eroded; the economy, which is all but closed to foreign trade, is wholly 

reliant on oil income, with no entrepreneurial class.

<P><b>A CONTROLLED ECONOMY</b>

<P>In fact, Ransom said, throughout the oil states of the Middle East, and 

especially in Iraq, the economies are even more firmly state-controlled than 

were the old Soviet-bloc nations during the Cold War, stifling investment and 

entrepreneurs.

<P>"The truth is almost anything you did in Iraq would be better than what 

they had," said Shibley Telhami, who holds the Anwar Sadat Chair in the 

department of government and politics at the University of Maryland. "But 

going from that to talking about democracy presents a lot of challenges. 

Nothing is impossible, but it doesn't seem likely to me. There is so little to 

open the way."

<P>David Shambaugh, director of the China Policy Program at George Washington 

University, in Washington, said that even in the most recent Asian success 

story, China, the economy has been transformed by capitalist innovations, 

while the government has maintained a rigid, one-party communist political 

system.

<P>The Chinese Communist Party devised a model in the 1980s that opened 

portions of the economy to foreign investment and trade, which eventually 

created an explosive boom and enormous wealth. The Beijing government has used 

prosperity as a means of staving off demands for greater political openness, 

but Bush has rejected that approach because of his insistence on democratic 

change.

<P><b>LOOKING TO IRAN</b>

<P>To some supporters of the Bush plan, if not the president himself, Iran 

demonstrates the desire for reform and change in the region. A nascent reform 

movement, led in large part by students frustrated by government oppression 

and a lack of economic opportunity, has gained momentum over the past few 

years, with occasional outbreaks of civil unrest in opposition to the ruling 

mullahs.

<P>But experts also say this is a poor model, too, in part because of the slow 

evolutionary pace of change -- in contrast to Bush's whirlwind campaign in 

Iraq. Reza Pahlavi, the son of the former Shah of Iran and a strong supporter 

of democratic reform, said there are clear signs of a grassroots movement in 

Iran, and that American intervention would probably hurt, not help.

<P>"It would backfire if it were too overt," he said. "This has to happen 

through the Iranian people themselves or it could reverse."

<P>Mostly Shiite Iran is also far more homogeneous than Iraq, which is 

bitterly divided along ethnic and religious lines. Ransom compared Iraq with 

Northern Ireland, except there are three feuding groups -- the Kurds, the 

Sunni Muslims and the Shiite Muslims -- rather than two.

<P>"In the long term, I think if despite everything you developed a model that 

inspired public confidence, then there is a possibility," said Telhami. "But 

the long term is nothing but a series of short terms. When you light a fire, 

you don't know where it will spread and whose house it will burn down."

<b>DEMOCRACY IN THE ARAB WORLD</b>

<P>ALGERIA: Multiparty state with elected parliament and president. The 

National Liberation Front, the dominant party since independence from France 

40 years ago, won the 2002 parliamentary elections, which were marred by 

violence. In 1991, fearing the fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front would be 

elected, the army aborted the final round of elections, which sparked a bloody 

insurgency. 

<P>BAHRAIN: Became a constitutional monarchy in 2002 as part of reforms that 

paved the way for the first legislative elections in 30 years. Women voted and 

ran in the October election, which secularists narrowly won. Most power still 

resides with Sheikh Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa. 

<P>EGYPT: President Hosni Mubarak's security apparatus and National Democratic 

Party have almost absolute control over the elected parliament. Mubarak 

periodically stands as the sole presidential candidate in referendums in which 

voters can choose yes or no. These always produce an overwhelming yes vote. 

<P>JORDAN: King Abdullah II has virtually absolute power. An elected 

parliament has not met since 2001, although Abdullah promises parliamentary 

elections later this year.    KUWAIT: Politics are controlled by Emir Jaber Al 

Ahmed Al Sabah and his family. Kuwait pioneered among Arabs in electing a 

parliament, in 1963, but the emir regularly dismisses national assemblies. 

Women are barred from voting or running for office. 

<P>LEBANON: Elections are regular and lively, but are circumscribed by a power-

sharing agreement meant to prevent a resurgence of the 1975-90 sectarian civil 

war. Legislative seats are apportioned equally to Christians and Muslims. The 

prime minister must be a Sunni Muslim, and the president a Christian. Syria 

wields great influence over Lebanese politics. 

<P>LIBYA: Moammar Khadafy has held absolute power since a 1969 military coup. 

<P>MOROCCO: King Mohammed VI appoints the prime minister and members of the 

government following legislative elections. He can fire any minister, dissolve 

parliament, call for new elections or rule by decree. Parliamentary elections 

held in September were praised as clean and fair. The Socialist Party won a 

majority of seats, but conservative Islamic parties did well. 

<P>OMAN: Sultan Qaboos became chief of state by overthrowing his father in 

1970. His family has ruled for about 250 years. There are no political parties 

or elected legislature. 

<P>PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY: President Yasser Arafat is under growing pressure to 

share power after four decades of sole control. The post of Palestinian prime 

minister was recently created. 

<P>QATAR: Expected to have parliamentary elections in two or three years. It 

held the first municipal elections in 1999, with women fully participating. Al-

Jazeera satellite TV station, the freest network in the Arab world, is based 

in Qatar. 

<P>SAUDI ARABIA: Crown Prince Abdullah rules on behalf of ailing King Fahd. 

There is no elected legislature. The royal family is under pressure to reform. 

The government recently allowed international rights monitors to visit for the 

first time, and Abdullah proposed that Arab states encourage broader political 

participation. 

<P>SYRIA: President Bashar Assad wields near-absolute power, disappointing 

those who had hoped the young, Western-educated physician would open up 

politics after taking over in 2000. 

<P>SUDAN: President Omar el-Bashir has been in power since a 1989 coup. 

Recently he moved to lessen the influence of fundamentalist Islamic leaders, 

but democratic reform is not on the agenda. 

<P>TUNISIA: A republic dominated by a single party, the Constitutional 

Democratic Assembly, since independence from France in 1956. Opposition 

parties have been allowed since 1981. 

<P>UNITED ARAB EMIRATES: Federation of states, each controlled by its own emir 

and family.    YEMEN: President Ali Abdullah Saleh presides over largely 

feudal society. Although it has a constitution, an elected parliament and a 

lively press, power rests with the military and tribes.
