<p>JAMES KNOX, 78, died peacefully on December 15, 2003. </p>
<p>Although born in Nebraska, he lived in Seattle for many years, enjoying all it has to offer including his favorite, live theatre. Jim indulged his curiosity for diverse cultures by traveling worldwide. He resided in both Sweden and Japan, bringing home an appreciation for topless beaches but not sushi. Jim was a man of wit, talent, and many accomplishments. He was a respected educator, historian, and journalist. He was active in politics, educational union development, and most recently, a decorated crossing guard. Jim was known as a crafty bridge player, a smooth dancer, and in his younger days, a connoisseur of fine martinis. As well as a close circle of friends, Jim shared his life with his beautiful and most patient wife Barbro, daughters Diane, Elise, Jules, granddaughters Jennifer, Morelia, and Margaret, grandson Madison, and great-granddaughters Sydney and Quinn. He will be deeply missed but fabulously remembered as the loving, compassionate, and player of wits he was. </p>
<p>In lieu of flowers, it would be Jim's wish, to donate to the campaign to Absolutely Not Re-Elect George W. Bush. </p>
