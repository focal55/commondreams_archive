<p>Hussein Kamel, the former head of Iraq's weapons programs whose 1995 defection has been portrayed by the US and Britain as evidence of Iraqi deceit and the futility of inspections, was a "consummate liar", according to the last weapons inspector to interrogate him. <P>The transcript of the interrogation, leaked this week to Newsweek magazine and seen by the Guardian, makes it clear that the defector's testimony on Iraqi weapons of mass destruction was inconclusive and often misleading.  <P>The emergence of the classified statements weakens the case the US and Britain has tried to build against Saddam Hussein, in which Kamel's defection has been used to bolster claims that Iraq still has thousands of tonnes of chemical and biological weapons for which it has not accounted.  <P>They reveal that Kamel, who was President Saddam's son-in-law, told UN inspectors that Iraq had destroyed all its chemical and biological weapons and abandoned its nuclear program after the Gulf war. But he said blueprints, documents, computer files and moulds for missile parts had been hidden.  

<P>Rolf Ekeus, the former chief UN weapons inspector who oversaw the interrogation in August 1995, said much of the chemical arsenal had been destroyed by the inspectors, not Baghdad.  <P>Mr Ekeus agreed that the Iraqi government had probably eliminated its biological arsenal but said he remained convinced that "seed stocks" of bacteria had been retained as well as growth media and fermenters so it could quickly reconstitute its arsenal.  <P>Kamel, who had been the director of Iraq's military industrial establishment, was assassinated soon after his mysterious decision to return to Iraq just weeks after his high-profile defection.  <P>The US and British governments have pointed to the defection to emphasize the extent of Iraq's weapons programs and the inherent weakness of inspections.  

<P>But Mr Ekeus pointed out that UNSCOM, the UN special commission on Iraq, had already discovered a lot about the Iraqi pre-war biological program earlier that year, forcing Baghdad's admission in July, a month before Kamel's defection, that it had pursued germ warfare.  

<P>The transcript of Kamel's interrogation reveals a far more ambiguous picture than the one portrayed in Washington and London.  <P>"Kamel was a consummate liar," Mr Ekeus said.  <P>While the transcript of the interrogation makes it clear that the defection was less than a breakthrough, it had a psychological impact on Baghdad. The Iraqi government, unsure what he was going to tell the inspectors, became much more forthcoming.  <P>Before Mr Ekeus arrived in Amman to interrogate Kamel, the Iraqis invited him to Baghdad to hand over documents and then took him to Kamel's chicken farm where several metal containers full of documents had been buried.  <P>"They wanted to blame it all on Kamel," Mr Ekeus said. "But Kamel was just carrying out the government's policy."</p>
