<p>Just a day after US President George W. Bush flew into Baghdad to feed 600 of his troops the traditional Thanksgiving turkey dinner, soldiers at the same base were offered a rare musical evening but the Bush high had failed to outlast the impromptu visit.

  </table></font>Some 200 soldiers belonging to the 1st Armored Division, which patrols the area around the Iraqi capital, gathered in one of Baghdad international airport's cold and wet hangers to listen to an hour-long concert performed by fellow troops and featuring Christmas carols and patriotic songs.
<p>But the mood was quiet, bordering on somber, inside the large corrugated-iron hall with some troops yawning the evening away or even falling asleep.
<p>Despite the deafening roar of landing choppers, performers bravely went on with their renditions of "Jingle Bells" and "Silent Night".

<p>"You have to understand that some people are not used to that kind of music," confessed Specialist Sclyna Penick, almost apologizing for her fellow troops' apathy.

<p>"It was not exactly rocking and rolling tonight. It's like, you know, this music is for older people," said the young woman.

<p>But Penick, unlike most at the concert, still had a broad smile on her face and all 50 stars and 13 stripes of the US flag in her eyes. "I helped cook and serve the dinner for President Bush," she said.
<p>Sergeant First Class Mark Wouters said he got to shake the president's hand. "I have got a picture taken with him!" he beamed.
<p>"It was so inspirational. When he walked in, everybody was so excited," he added.

<p>Wouters said the post-Bush high had failed to touch many of those who did not get to dine with him "because I think most troops in fact do not know the president was here."

<p>"We have access to TV but not every day," said Wouters.

<p>Lieutenant Shelley Walsh had yet another explanation: "I think people were sincerely and quietly listening to the music, she said.

</table>As to why the head of 1st Armored Division, Brigadier General Martin Dempsey, had failed to elicit much laughter when he went on stage and mimicked the band's conductor in a comic rendition of "Sleigh Ride", most troops here said they were simply tired and eager to go home.

<p>"We've been here for seven months. It's tough, especially with the holiday season coming. We miss our loved ones," said Walsh.

<p>Sergeant Felix St. Luce hit out at the "depressing" mood of the night's entertainment, saying it had done nothing for his or his comrades' morale.

<p>"The music was bad, the acoustics sucked, the atmosphere was depressing," said the young man who originally comes from the Caribbean.

<p>"Where I come from, we know reggae music, we know what uplifting music means."

<p>Sergeant Ted Pledger concurred. "I want to go home, most of us have been here for seven months. I need something to boost my morale and tonight did nothing for me," he said.

<p>Asked if Bush's visit had strengthened their resolve, Pledger joked: "What do you mean? It was nothing like Michael Jackson," visibly unaware of the pedophilia charges pressed against the once pop idol.

<p>"Yeah, it was just another visit," said St. Luce.

<p>"Don't get me wrong, we appreciate him coming but we still need to go home," said Pledger.
