<p>TONY Blair refused to appear in The Simpsons alongside a cartoon dog because he feared being called "America's poodle".

<p>The original script had Mr Blair, who is featured in the show on January 9, giving Homer a corgi as a gift.

<!--/endimage/-->But Downing Street insisted the scene wasn't recorded because they thought it politically sensitive.

<p>Simpsons producer Al Jean said yesterday: "There were a couple of references that had to be changed.

<p>"In the original script, there was a scene where Mr Blair presents the Simpsons with a corgi dog as they get off the plane.

<p>"This had to be cut because Downing Street felt there was a risk that he would be seen as America's poodle."

<p>The Mirror labelled the PM "George Bush's poodle" over his support for the president's war on Iraq.

<p>But the label stuck - to the fury of Downing Street spin doctors who fear it is damaging his image with voters.

<p>Mr Jean said: "When we decided to do an episode where the Simpsons head to London, Tony Blair was at the top of our wish list of the famous people we wanted on the show.

<p>"We really didn't think we stood a chance. But it seems Mr Blair genuinely loves the show.

<p>"He clearly watched a lot of the episodes and told us he felt that if he did this then maybe he'd be a bit of a hero to his children.

<p>"He made it very clear he was interested in promoting tourism in Britain. He was very conscious of the fact that the numbers of American tourists going to Britain had dropped off since September 11."

<p>But despite the PM's office insisting on certain changes they were happy for Mr Blair to be called Mr Bean.

<p>In one scene he takes off into the sky with a James Bond-style jet pack as Homer shouts: "Goodbye, Mr Bean".

<p>Mr Jean said: "It shows he's got a good sense of humour."
