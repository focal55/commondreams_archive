John Lennon's widow Yoko Ono could end up stark naked on a Paris stage on Monday as she performs her one-woman art show 'Cut Piece', in which members of the audience are to cut off pieces of her clothing.

</table></font>Ono, 70, who accompanied her Beatle husband in numerous  controversial anti-war campaigns including the "Bed-In for  Peace" against the Vietnam War, first performed her "Cut Piece"  show in 1964 in Japan as a protest for peace.<P>
At the end of the show, she stood naked before her  audience.<P>
"Come and cut a piece of my clothing wherever you like ---  the size of less than a postcard --- and send it to the one you  love," the avant-garde artist said in a statement ahead of the  performance at Paris' Ranelagh theater.<P>
"When I first performed this work, in 1964, I did it with  some anger and turbulence in my heart. This time, I do it with  love for you, for me and for the world," she added.<P>
Ono has continued to stage unusual peace campaigns after  her husband was shot dead by a deranged fan in December 1980.<P>
Last year, she rented a giant billboard space amid the  flashing neon signs of Piccadilly Circus in central London.  "Imagine all the people living life in peace," the black-and-  white poster read, alluding to Lennon's hit song, "Imagine."<P>
Ahead of the war in Iraq, Ono took out full-page  advertisements in major newspapers, conveying the message:  "Imagine Peace...Spring 2003."<P>
Peace activists around the world have come to adopt the  title track from Lennon's 1971 best-selling solo album as their  unofficial anthem.
