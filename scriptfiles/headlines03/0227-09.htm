<p>COLOGNE, Germany - Germany's carnival is

turning into a week-long peace protest this year with up to 10

million revelers set to oppose war on Iraq dressed as clowns

and Friesian cows, organizers say.

<P> Better known for its beer-guzzling crowds and symbolic

castrations, the annual carnival is a religion to many in the

Catholic Rhineland and brings large parts of Germany to a

standstill in the six days leading up to Ash Wednesday.<P> Organizers expect this year's revelry to reflect

overwhelming public support for Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's

opposition to U.S.-led military action against Iraq.

<P> &quot;It's going to be the biggest peace demonstration

imaginable,&quot; Franz Wolf, president of the federation of German

carnival associations, told Reuters. &quot;I think there's hardly

anyone in Germany who wants this war to take place.&quot;<P> Wolf expects up to 10 million people to join the processions

this year and rejects calls to have the event cancelled as it

was during the 1991 Gulf War.<P> The revelry entered its final week on Thursday and

culminates on &quot;Rose Monday&quot;, March 3, when millions are expected

to throng the streets of Cologne, Duesseldorf, Mainz and

practically every village in the Rhineland.<P> Revelers often wear costumes -- the Friesian cow being

among the most popular. Among rituals that may startle a

stranger is one in which women symbolically castrate men by

cutting off their ties.

<P><P> &quot;MAKE ALAAF NOT WAR&quot;<P> The bizarre rallying cry &quot;Alaaf&quot;, roughly equivalent to the

exclamation &quot;Ole!&quot;, echoes through ballrooms and streets. One

regional politician wanted this year's motto to be &quot;Make Alaaf

not War&quot;.<P> &quot;Given the massive threat of war against Iraq the

carnivalists should make a statement,&quot; said Michael Vesper of

the pacifist Greens who share power with Schroeder's Social

Democrats in Berlin.<P> In Cologne, a band has scored a hit with its version of the

anti-war classic &quot;Where Have All the Flowers Gone&quot; which

contrasts with usual carnival fare that has titles like &quot;My Pig

is Gone&quot; or &quot;Do You Have a Pizza, Pizza Wunderbar.&quot;<P> The carnival has its roots in a Roman spring festival and

ancient Germanic fertility rites, later adopted by Christians as

a way to usher in the Lent fasting period before Easter.<P> It also has a tradition of poking fun at authority. Brigades

of carnival &quot;soldiers&quot; in mock 18th century uniforms invade town

halls in carefully staged uprisings, usually cheered on by

revelers Beer and sausages are always at hand.

<P> The ritual storming of town halls offers a clue to a long

tradition of opposition to military occupiers in the Rhineland,

dating back to the French and Prussians in the 18th century.<P> As U.S.-German tensions rise, poking fun at U.S. President

George W. Bush has become increasingly popular with audiences at

carnival events.<P> &quot;I took a long Bush joke into my repertoire about three

weeks ago,&quot; said Guido Cantz, a Cologne comedian who performs at

major carnival balls each year.<P> &quot;At first the applause was a bit hesitant but in the last 10

days I've almost been getting standing ovations. You can really

tell that people just don't want a war.&quot;</p>
