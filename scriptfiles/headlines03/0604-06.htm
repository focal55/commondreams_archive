<p>WASHINGTON, June 3 — The House majority leader, Representative Tom DeLay, said today that the House would not consider a Democratic measure to provide an increased tax credit to 6.5 million low-income families who did not receive it in the new tax law.</p>

</table>Mr. DeLay, a Texas Republican, said the increased tax credits would be approved only if they were part of a broader tax-cut package, possibly including permanent repeal of the estate tax or making state sales taxes deductible. A package of that size would require 60 votes to pass in the Senate, and Democratic opposition to big new tax cuts would make such passage almost impossible.</p>
<P> Clearly irked at the mounting criticism of Republicans for the last-minute decision not to give the credit to minimum-wage families, Mr. DeLay said those who favored the increased credit had had their chance in the debate over the bill. </p>
<P> "There are a lot of other things that are more important than that," Mr. DeLay said in a news conference today. "To me, it's a little difficult to give tax relief to people that don't pay income tax."</p>
<P> Mr. DeLay's position puts him at odds with a growing number of Senate Republicans who have signed on to a measure that would extend the $400-per-child increase in the credit to many families making from $10,500 to $26,625. The Senate had approved the increase for those families last month, but it was removed in final negotiations with the House. Six Senate Republicans now support the measure, along with most Democrats.</p>
<P> The $3.5 billion measure, which is paid for by reducing corporate tax shelters and changing some accounting practices, was attached to an unrelated amendment to the energy bill by its chief sponsor, Senator Blanche Lincoln, Democrat of Arkansas. Republican leaders, concerned that the measure might pass before they took a position on it, pulled the energy amendment from consideration late this afternoon, preferring to debate the child credits on Wednesday or later in the week.</p>
<P> Like Mr. DeLay, many Senate Republicans would prefer to consider the child credits as part of a more expensive bill that would cut other taxes. One such bill, introduced today by the chief Senate tax writer, Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and chairman of the Finance Committee, would extend the credit to both minimum-wage families and to far wealthier married couples. While the child credit is now phased out for couples making more than $110,000, Mr. Grassley's bill would begin the phase-out at $150,000.</p>
<P> The White House, which had stayed on the sidelines since President Bush signed the tax law last week, today extended support to Mr. Grassley's bill.</p>
<P> "We want to work with Congress to address it," said Scott McClellan, a White House spokesman. "The president believes Senator Grassley's proposal is one good idea for addressing it."</p>
<P> President Bush had not proposed giving the increased child credit to minimum-wage families in his original tax-cut proposal, but the White House said last week that he would have signed the bill if Congressional negotiators had included the credit.</p>
<P> The credit was dropped in negotiations among House and Senate leaders and White House representatives that included no Democrats.</p>
<P> With six Republicans supporting Ms. Lincoln's bill to extend the credit, it is not clear that Mr. Grassley's bill can muster even a simple majority in the Senate, let alone the 60 votes that would be required for passage. The six Republicans are Senators John W. Warner of Virginia, Olympia J. Snowe and Susan Collins of Maine, Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island, Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania and George V. Voinovich of Ohio. </p>
<P> Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, is also considering sponsoring the Lincoln bill, putting the bill almost in reach of the 60 votes it may require if Republicans successfully raise budget objections. Democrats are hoping for a ruling that the bill can pass with a simple majority.</p>
<P> "We need to fix this, and fix it fast," said Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democrat of New York, who is a co-sponsor of the Lincoln bill. "How the administration and the House and Senate conferees reached their conclusion that eliminating 12 million children was good for American families, their children and our overall economy defies logic."</p>
<P> The practice of giving tax refunds to poor people who do not pay income tax has been in use since 1975, when Congress enacted the earned-income tax credit, which provides $32 billion in refunds to 19 million households. In 2001, Republicans agreed to give refunds of the child credit to people who do not owe tax, in part to offset the Social Security and Medicare taxes that all wage-earners pay.</p>
<P> In the House, Democratic leaders began a bit of legislative civil disobedience today to protest the leadership's decision not to consider extending the tax credits. The Democrats refused to agree to several routine bills and forced the House to take extra time on procedural matters. They said they would not allow the House to conduct business as usual until the bill was considered.</p>
<P> "They say leave no child behind, but whether you talk about education or tax relief, they are not there to provide this assistance," said Representative Charles E. Rangel, Democrat of New York, referring to Republican leaders. "They are driven, and they can't control themselves. They have to control even moderate Republicans by making certain that the investor group gets the protection and that the funds are just not there to provide other types of relief."</p>
<P> Beginning next month, about 25 million mostly middle-class families will begin receiving checks of $400 per child, representing the increase in the child credit to $1,000 from $600 in the new law. Mr. DeLay said that giving such checks to families who do not pay income tax amounts to a spending program. The Senate could easily have won the credits in the negotiations if it had not been so rigid about fitting the program under a $350 billion ceiling, he said.</p>
<P> "Those that are complaining the most about this being taken out in the negotiations are the ones that were against the tax cuts in the first place, and I think it's pretty shameable that they are now crying for it," he said. "Particularly those in the Senate that required that we have a $350 billion box that we had to work with."</p>
