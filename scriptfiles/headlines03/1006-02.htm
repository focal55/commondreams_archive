<p>DAMASCUS  - Syria urged the United States on  Monday not to block a U.N. Security Council resolution  condemning Israel's air strike near Damascus, saying Washington  should help prevent escalation of tensions in the Middle East.<P>
"We hope that the United States does not use the veto and  that it practices its role as a superpower in preventing  aggression and escalation," an official source at the Foreign  Ministry told Reuters.<P>

Syria said on Sunday an Israeli airstrike had targeted a civilian site near Damascus in a 'grave escalation' of tensions in the Middle East and called for an immediate Security Council session. Israel had said the raid, which came the day after a suicide bomber killed 19 people in an Israeli restaurant, was aimed at a training camp for 'terror groups.' REUTERS/ Khaled al-Hariri <br>

  </table></font>"We hope that the United States joins those who condemned  this aggressive operation and those are the vast majority in  the world community," the source said.<P>
Syria called an emergency Security Council meeting on  Sunday over Israel's attack to secure a measure that condemns  the raid, saying it threatened regional and international  peace.<P>
Syria wanted an immediate vote but Washington said the  measure had to go to the capitals of council members for study.<P>
U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations John Negropnte  accused Syria of harboring "terrorists" and steered clear from  criticizing Israel for the air strike.<P>
Israel said it did not intend to pick a fight with Syria  but wanted the air strike to serve as a warning for it to stop  Palestinian militant groups operating on Syrian territory.<P>
Syria denies links to "terrorist groups" but says there is  a difference between terrorism and legitimate resistance to  Israeli occupation. It says Palestinian militant groups only  have media offices on its territory.<P>
GRAVE ESCALATION<P>
Israel said its deepest air strike into Syria in 30 years  on Sunday targeted a training camp for Palestinian militants  and was in self-defense following a suicide bombing in Haifa by  a radical Palestinian group on Saturday that killed 19 people.<P>
Washington said it would not support the Syrian resolution  condemning Israel's raid as it made no mention of the suicide  attack.<P>
Syrian Deputy Foreign Minister Walid al-Moalem summoned the  ambassadors in Damascus of the five permanent member states of  the Security Council earlier on Monday to urge their support.<P>
He emphasized "the necessity that their countries condemn  this Israeli act of aggression and prevent Israel from carrying  out these acts that form a grave escalation," a ministry  statement said.<P>
Russia, which has a veto power on the Security Council,  said on Monday the Syrian resolution may pass if it had more  balance.<P>
"We believe it would pass if it had a more balanced nature,  particularly if it in some way reflected the idea of the  necessity of stopping acts of terror in the region," said  Deputy Foreign Minister Yuri Fedotov, Russia's most prominent  Middle East specialist.<P>
"At the same time we have no objection to raising the issue  of the vital importance of halting all actions running counter  to international law," he added.
