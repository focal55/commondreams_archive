<p>WASHINGTON  - The senior Democrat on the Senate  Intelligence Committee asked the FBI on Friday to investigate  <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/0308-06.htm">fake documents</a> the United States used as evidence to the United  Nations of alleged Iraqi efforts to acquire uranium from Niger.

<p>



		"As you know, the International Atomic Energy Agency has  recently determined that some of the intelligence documents  provided to it by the United States are forgeries," Sen. John  Rockefeller said in a letter to FBI Director Robert Mueller.<p>



		"These documents were provided to the IAEA as evidence of  Iraqi efforts to procure uranium from the Republic of Niger. I  am writing to request that the Federal Bureau of Investigation  investigate this matter," the West Virginia senator said.<p>



		The documents were among intelligence U.S. officials used  in seeking U.N. Security Council support for their assertion  that Iraq is hiding biological, chemical and nuclear weapons  programs. Iraq denies having such weapons programs.<p>



		An FBI official said the FBI would probably launch some  type of initial inquiry, but in part to determine whether it  was an FBI issue or should be handled by the CIA, which deals  with intelligence collected abroad. The CIA had no comment.<p>



		U.S. and British forces are amassed in the Gulf region for  a potential war against Iraq, which Washington says may be  necessary to disarm Baghdad.<p>



		President Bush alluded to the evidence in his State of the  Union address, saying Britain had learned Iraq had sought  "significant quantities of uranium from Africa."<p>



		FORGERIES<p>



		IAEA Director-General Mohamed ElBaradei undermined the U.S.  position on March 7 by telling the U.N. Security Council the  documents on the Iraq-Niger-uranium connection were forgeries.<p>



		U.S. officials say it was not known who forged the papers,  but they were given to the United States and Britain by a third  country which they would not identify.<p>



		The United States gave other information on the uranium  issue to the IAEA in early February, along with the documents  with caveats attached about their credibility, a U.S. official  said on condition of anonymity.<p>



		U.S. intelligence analysts "believed from the beginning the  information was questionable and I understand that they did not  factor it into their analysis of the Iraqi threat," Senate  Intelligence Committee Chairman Pat Roberts said.<p>



		"The bottom line is that the United States does not need  this one piece of evidence to make its case against Iraq," the  Kansas Republican said in a statement.<p>



		Rockefeller expressed concern that the forgeries "may be  part of a larger deception campaign aimed at manipulating  public opinion and foreign policy regarding Iraq."<p>



		"The implication of Senator Rockefeller's letter is that  the intelligence community forged these documents to somehow  bolster the case against Iraq. It just doesn't make sense that  the U.S. government would forge documents and then not use them  in its case or vouch for their authenticity," Roberts said.
