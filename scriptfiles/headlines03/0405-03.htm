<p>ANTI-WAR protesters from all over Ireland are expected to gather at Hillsborough on Monday evening to bring their message of peace directly to President George Bush.



<p>A number of buses will travel to Belfast from Dublin and other parts of the Republic as President Bush visits the province to meet with Prime Minister Tony Blair.



<p>A spokesman for the <a href="http://www.stopwar.org.uk/" target="_new">Stop the War Coalition</a> said: "This is unbelievable. The so-called peace summit at Hillsborough pauses for a council of war.



<p>"Bush is here to meet Blair where they think there is the least amount of opposition."



<p>The Schools Against the War group is also urging people to take to show their opposition to the Iraq campaign.



<p>A spokesman said: "The hypocrisy of Tony Blair is unbelievable. How can they come here with a straight face and talk about peace when they are waging an illegal and unjust war against Iraq?"



<p>"School students will take to the streets wherever George Bush goes in Ireland, Britain or Europe," he added.



<p>The Green Parties in Northern Ireland and the Republic issued a joint condemnation of Mr Bush's visit to the province. 



<p>Northern Ireland Green Party leader John Barry said: "This visit is not just hypocritical but insulting. While waging an unjust and illegal war in Iraq, President Bush is coming here to talk about peace."
