<p>CHICAGO  - U.S. corporate icons such as Starbucks  Corp., Coca-Cola Co. and McDonald's Corp. are bracing for  trouble and stepping up security ahead of a likely war in Iraq  that could stoke anti-American sentiment worldwide and unleash  violence against businesses.<p>

</table></font>U.S. multinationals, which generate substantial revenues  overseas, are boosting plant security, adding armed guards,  increasing staff training and instituting background checks on  potential employees, even rank-and-file workers like cashiers  and drivers, security experts said.<p>



		"If you hate America, it's real easy to hate Coke or  McDonald's," said Lawrence McNaughton, who heads CoreBrand, a  Connecticut-based brand consulting firm. "The two primary  criteria for determining risk," he said, would be "if you're in  business in the Middle East and you're a cultural icon."<p>



		Security experts said the most vulnerable sector may be the  fast-food industry, led by hamburger giant McDonald's Corp.,  whose 30,000 worldwide stores with their distinctive Golden  Arches are one of the most recognized symbols of American  culture. The company has a substantial presence in the Middle  East.<p>



		YANKEE GO HOME<p>



		Increased hostility toward America has already led to a few  attacks on businesses linked to the United States in the Middle  East, boycotts of American products, and security alerts at  U.S. corporate offices in the region.<p>



		Saudi Arabian youth have firebombed two McDonald's in the  kingdom since November. The home-made bombs caused only  material damage but intensified fears among Westerners, who  have been the targets of several other attacks.<p>



		At least five American-style fast-food restaurants in  Lebanon, including two Pizza Hut branches and a KFC chicken   outlet, have been rocked by bomb attacks since May.<p>



		In Cairo, Egypt, a recent telephoned bomb threat to  Citibank, part of Citigroup, led to the evacuation of a large  building off a central square where the offices of several  foreign companies are located, including Microsoft Corp. and  Hewlett-Packard Co.<p>



		Consumers in several Middle Eastern countries are shunning  American goods, and Iran has banned media advertising for all  U.S.-made goods.<p>



		The outcry against President Bush's policy toward Iraq has  extended to massive protests in Europe. In Britain, Greenpeace  volunteers recently raided Esso gas stations and shut off  electricity to send an anti-war message to Esso parent Exxon  Mobil Corp..<p>



		None of the companies contacted by Reuters would discuss  the details of their security plans, although several said they  were taking steps to cope with a possible backlash.<p>



		"The Middle East is an important region for Starbucks and  we are concerned about the tense political climate," said  Audrey Lincoff, a spokeswoman for the Seattle-based operator of  coffee shops.<p>



		Atlanta-based Coca-Cola has moved some of its regional  management team to Greece from the Gulf state of Bahrain, a  company official in the Middle East said on Sunday. While Coke  declined to link the move to heightened tensions, anger at the  United States is running high in Bahrain, where U.S. flags were  burned at demonstrations on Friday.<p>



		Michael Cherkasky, chief executive of global security  consulting firm Kroll Inc., said companies are spending  substantial amounts of money on security, including "...  putting in more cameras, narrowing the access, setting off the  approachability of cars to buildings."<p>



		SECURITY CHALLENGE FOR FAST FOOD OPERATORS<p>



		For fast-food operators, which serve hundreds of customers  daily at each store, security is even more difficult.<p>



		"A lot is being done (on security). They're...going out  with more stringent procedures," said Richard McCormick, a vice  president specializing in the food industry for Pinkerton, a  security firm and unit of UK-based Securitas.<p>



		McDonald's, suffering from a downturn in its global  business and reeling from its first-ever quarterly financial  loss, has several hundred stores in Egypt, Israel, Oman, Saudi  Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. It also operates stores in  Pakistan.<p>



		McDonald's major overseas competitor, Yum Brands Inc.,  parent of the KFC chicken chain, also has a Middle East  presence and plans to add 1,000 overseas stores in 2003.<p>



		McDonald's and other fast food companies stress that most  of their overseas outlets are owned and operated by local  franchisees who buy local food products. But consumers are  often blind to the distinction.<p>



		In a bid to boost flagging sales, the Burger King franchise  in Bahrain, a key U.S. ally, recently placed an advertisement  in several newspapers explaining that all the ingredients it  uses were purchased locally or from fellow Arab states.<p>



		In Kuwait, where U.S. marines have been targeted several  times, leading regional fast-food company Americana -- which  owns the franchise rights of U.S. restaurants such as Pizza  Hut, Hardees and KFC -- took pains to point out that it is "100  percent Arab" in a multi-million dollar media campaign.
