<p>MILAN - A U.N. conference on global warming put  off a dispute over aid to OPEC states on its last day on Friday  with the Kyoto protocol hanging by a thread amid uncertainty  over Russian ratification.
<p>Many nations reaffirmed support for the 1997 pact despite  scant progress at the 12-day Milan talks on ways to fight  rising temperatures blamed for more droughts, storms and for  melting glaciers that may raise sea levels.
<p>Organizers said delegates agreed to set up a new fund to  help poor countries adapt to the impact of warming temperatures  but shelved the thorniest issue of whether cash could go to  OPEC states if consumers shift to wind or solar power.
<p>"The Special Climate Change Fund can go ahead," said Joke  Waller-Hunter, executive secretary of the U.N. Framework  Convention on Climate Change, told a news conference. The  accord was set to be formally adopted later on Friday.
<p>She said the fund would aid developing states, giving new  technology and helping them to adapt policies in everything  from health to farming.
<p>But the conference put off debate over whether it could  also foster "economic diversification." Saudi Arabia and other  oil producers argue they should get help to diversify if  renewable energies like wind or solar power dent demand for  fossil fuels.
<p>Donors say the fund, likely to total about $50 million a  year, would be bankrupted if it went to OPEC. Countries led by  the European Union have promised about $410 million extra a  year to help developing countries facing climate change.
<p>RUSSIAN ACTION?
<p>Meanwhile, Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov, whose  country holds the key to whether Kyoto enters into force, told  Japanese media that Moscow was preparing a "special action  plan" to ratify. He gave no deadline.
<p>Supporters of Kyoto at the 180-nation talks welcomed his  remarks, which follow a string of apparently contradictory  statements from Moscow about the deal to rein in emissions from  factories, cars and power plants.
<p>Kyoto aims overall to cut rich countries' emissions of  carbon dioxide by 5.2 percent below 1990 levels by 2008-12.
<p>"The Kyoto protocol is the only game in town," German  Environment Minister Juergen Trittin said, expressing  confidence that Russia would ratify. The United States has said  Kyoto is too costly and wrongly excludes developing nations.
<p>Environmentalists accused Washington of trying to torpedo  the accord. "Kyoto is moving forward despite efforts by the  Bush administration to undermine the process," Jennifer Morgan,  director of the WWF climate change program.
<p>Steve Sawyer, climate policy chief of Greenpeace, said that  Russia's choice on Kyoto would be a test of its role in the  world after the September 11 attacks on the United States.
<p>"Russia can either be seen as a force for multilateralism  or can decide to go it alone and become a new rogue state like  the United States," he said.
<p>Trittin said that Kyoto would bring big foreign investments  to Russia and spur its economy. But Moscow told the talks on  Thursday that hopes of economic benefits were "illusory."
<p>Moscow has also said warmer weather might help extend farm  areas north. Diplomats say Russia may want membership of the  World Trade Organization as a price for ratification.
<p>Without Russia, Kyoto will collapse because it needs  backing by nations accounting for 55 percent of emissions of  carbon dioxide to start. So far it has reached 44 percent and  needs Russia's 17 in the absence of a U.S. stake of 36 percent.
