<p>WASHINGTON  — Howard Dean, a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, on Wednesday offered perhaps his most overarching critique yet of the Republican incumbent, saying, "I think what the president is doing is setting the stage for the failure of America."</p>
<P>
"If you look at what's happened to other great countries," Dr. Dean said over lunch with reporters and editors of The New York Times, "they get in trouble when they can't manage their money — and this president's certainly proven himself adept at that — and they get in trouble when they overstretch their military capabilities."</p>

  </table></font>"This country's a great country, and the reason it's an important country is not just because I'm an American and proud to be an American," he continued. "America is the beacon of hope for the rest of the world. We are the last country on earth where cynicism doesn't pervade government. Americans really hope that things are going to get better in the world and they can make things better, and Americans believe more than any other people that we can make things better by sheer will and money and hard work."</p>
<P>
Dr. Dean said he expects jobs to be  the primary issue in next year's general election, and he expects Ohio to be the critical swing state. But he spent most of the interview answering questions about foreign policy, attacking President Bush on Iraq and North Korea and promising to send former President Bill Clinton to the Middle East as a peace broker.</p>
<P>
President Bush, Dr. Dean said, is "particularly poorly suited" for foreign policy "because he has a black and white view of the world, and foreign policy depends on enormous understandings of nuances and trade-offs."</p>
<P>
As the former governor of Vermont who got a medical deferment to avoid service in Vietnam, Dr. Dean said he would combat criticism of his national security bona fides by surrounding himself with people who could inspire confidence in such issues. </p>
<P>
Though he declined to speculate on cabinet appointments or potential running mates, Dr. Dean, who has lately spent much time attacking his Democratic rivals as Washington insiders who have, collectively, spent more than a century on Capitol Hill, said he would also pick people who could navigate the Beltway.</p>
<P>
"The most important criteria for whether you're going to be any good at foreign policy or not is judgment and patience, both of which are in short supply in this presidency." Dr. Dean said. "The major mistake that governors make when they come into Washington is they think subconsciously that the relationship between the Congress and the president is somehow like the relationship between the legislature and the governor," he added, predicting that "getting someone who understands the levers of power in Washington is going to be important as well."</p>
<P>
Regarding Iraq, Dr. Dean, who opposed the American invasion this spring, promised to bring National Guard and Army reserve troops home, leaving 70,000 American troops, and to add about 110,000 international troops, mostly from Muslim and Arab nations. Some experts say that is probably unrealistic, considering the military capabilities of American  allies in the Middle East.</p>
<P>
Other than urging repeal of recent tax cuts to pay for reconstruction, Dr. Dean refused to say how he would vote, were he in Congress, on the $87 billion financing proposal. </p>
<P>
"I'm not running for Congress, I'm running for president," he said.</p>
<P>
On North Korea, Dr. Dean said Mr. Bush had bungled the situation by announcing at a news  conference with Kim Dae Jung, the former president of South Korea, that he planned to pursue a policy of isolation toward North Korea. While the news conference was not as explicit as Dr. Dean described, Mr. Bush and the South Korean leader split sharply on Korea policy at that meeting early in Mr. Bush's presidency, and their relationship never recovered.</p>
<P>
Dr. Dean said he would conduct bilateral negotiations on the principle of constructive engagement — "that in return for a verifiable ending of their nuclear program," he explained, "they would be back in the community of nations."</p>
<P>
"You will improve the behavior of rogue nations and have more leverage to do so if they're inside the tent than if they're outside the tent," he said. "The president and his neocon advisers decided they were going to teach the North Koreans a lesson, and unfortunately, North Korea has the power to inflict a fairly painful lesson on us." </p>
<P>
Dr. Dean declined to discuss the other Democratic rivals except to say "they all come from Washington, which I think, this year, is going to be a problem for them." Though he said it was too early to draw broad lessons from the California recall, he said the message is change which he painted as positive for his campaign.</p>
<P>
"My strategy is, we're better than this, we can do better than this," he added. "America's always been the country of hope and of high moral principles and ideals. Let's hope again."</p>
