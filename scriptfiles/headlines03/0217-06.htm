<p>One of the world's leading experts on climate change has predicted that rising global temperatures could destroy the Amazon rainforest, which in turn would cause a catastrophic build-up of carbon dioxide further accelerating global warming.</p>
<p>Tom Wigley, of the National Centre for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado, warned of the dangers that would occur if the world's biggest rainforest was lost &#150; most likely as the result of lower rainfall levels over the Amazon basin that would occur in a warmer world.</p>
<p>In such a scenario, not only will the Earth have lost a major storage of carbon but it will lead to a huge release of carbon dioxide and methane, which are two of the most destructive greenhouse gases.</p>
<p>Such a model is called a positive-feedback mechanism, and although climatologists think it is a likely scenario, it is hard to predict accurately.</p>
<p>"It is very uncertain. Modelling the climate is difficult. Modelling the interactions between climate and vegetation is even more difficult," said Professor Wigley.</p>
<p>He added that it was important to start moving away from fossil fuels now rather than leaving it for future generations to deal with.
