<p>WASHINGTON, Oct. 29 — Iraq is a mess, the world resents America and its debt-burdened economy is an international embarrassment. That was the Democratic perspective voiced at a conference that ended here on Wednesday, that things could hardly  be more grim.</p>
<P>
"The bad news is, we're headed in the wrong direction" said Sandy Berger,  President Clinton's last national security adviser. "The worse news is we can't afford it."</p>
<P>
So why, then, was there a smile on Mr. Berger's jowly face? Why was John Podesta, the former Clinton chief of staff, standing in the wings and shouting "Tremendous!" into a cellphone? And wasn't that the commanding Richard Holbrooke, the  former United Nations ambassador, who boldly took the podium? "I'm a liberal," he thundered, "and I'm proud of it."</p>
<P>
In the capital, the party out of power is always frustrated. But there is no better salve for being on the outs than watching on the sidelines as the party in power is struggling. </p>
<P>
That was the tone of a two-day conference of diplomatic veterans who gathered in a hotel ballroom here in a fledgling attempt to define the Democratic view of "New American Strategies for Security and Peace." The conference, sponsored by the left-leaning American Prospect magazine, the Center for American Progress and the Century Foundation, drew some Democratic heavyweights who emerged from their exile in think tanks, high finance and academia, to criticize the Bush administration for steering the nation greviously off course. </p>
<P>
The conference underscored how Democrats are finding a voice to challenge the administration on national security. They are reappropriating national symbols and insisting that their criticism is patriotic and in the best American traditions. </p>
<P>
Mr. Berger said the administration's bent for unilateral action, its doctrine of pre-emptive force and its preference for coalitions over alliances represent "a radical shift in the nature of American foreign policy," and need to be scrapped. Other speakers asserted that the administration's  decision to brand Iran and North Korea part of  the "axis of evil" prompted those nations to speed up nuclear weapons research. </p>
<P>
Joseph Cirincione, a nonproliferation expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, stood in the lobby looking pleased. "It's nice to hear progressives say: this thing is dead wrong and here's how we're going to change it," he said. "They're inviting you to be part of the process. To take back the country."</p>
<P>
The first thing Democratic strategists appear to have snatched is the Republican playbook. In the 90's, when Democrats were wrestling with intractable policy issues from Haiti to Bosnia, Republican intellectuals built a formidable phalanx of not-for-profit policy centers that were heavily financed, media savvy, and full of bold, specific recommendations. While Democrats looked for answers, centers like the Heritage Foundation, a conservative institute on Capitol Hill, churned out reams of position papers and captured some of the debate. </p>
<P>
Mr. Podesta, the president of the Center for American Progress, said his new institute is determined to seize back some of that discussion — and influence. "Our mission is to put before the American people new ideas and alternative strategies," he said in an interview.</p>
<P>
Gen. Wesley K. Clark, a Democratic contender for president, endeared himself to the crowd by accusing the administration of making the nation more insecure — not less. </p>
<P>
The gloves were off. There was a sense that the administration is at last vulnerable.</p>
<P>
Brett Lambert, a defense contractor, noticed the adjustments. Dozens of American flags — more common at Republican functions — met conference guests at every turn. </p>
<P>
"It's nice to see a flag associated with progressive causes," he said. "And it isn't upside down."
