<p>WASHINGTON - Democrat Dennis Kucinich is challenging the positions of his presidential rivals, beginning with the candidate he considers the front-runner - Howard Dean.</p>

</table></font>The Ohio congressman said Thursday that Dean has been labeled a liberal, a perception he dismisses. Both Dean and Kucinich entered the race as underdogs and have been outspoken opponents of the U.S.-led war with Iraq, but while Kucinich remains a long shot in the field of nine, Dean has become a leading contender.</p>
    <p>"His economics are anything but progressive," Kucinich said of Dean in a telephone interview. "So the question is: What constituency will he be representing in the White House?"</p>
    <p>Dean's insurgency has made him the object of increasing criticism. Moderate Joe Lieberman, a senator from Connecticut, said Monday that Dean's opposition to the war and his call to repeal President Bush's tax cuts are "a ticket to nowhere."</p>
    <p>Dean spokeswoman Tricia Enright said if Lieberman is attacking Dean from the right and Kucinich from the left, "You know what that means - the American people think he's just right."</p>
    <p>Kucinich took his first shot at Dean in Tuesday night's presidential forum hosted by the AFL-CIO. Kucinich said the age to receive full Social Security benefits should return to 65, but pointed out that Dean has suggested raising the age to 70 or 68 in the past to help balance the budget.</p>
    <p>Dean says he no longer thinks an increase is necessary. He still wants to work toward a balanced budget, but says it can be done without raising the age or cutting defense spending if the economy improves.</p>
    <p>But Kucinich said if Dean wants to balance the budget without reducing the Pentagon's funding, he must take money from social programs.</p>
    <p>"If someone wants to be a fiscal conservative, a good place to start is the Pentagon budget and he's already taken it off the table," Kucinich said. "How in the world can you be for peace when you won't touch a Pentagon budget that needs war to expand, that needs war in order to justify itself?"</p>
    <p>Kucinich also took aim at rival, Dick Gephardt, issuing a statement criticizing the Missouri congressman for refusing to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement or the World Trade Organization.</p>
    <p>"If Democratic candidates will not commit to withdrawing from the fundamentally flawed NAFTA and WTO agreements, then who will protect workers and the environment?" Kucinich said. 	Gephardt spokeswoman Kim Molstre dismissed Kucinich's criticism.</p>
    <p>"I don't think there is any doubt in anyone's mind that Dick Gephardt has always been an advocate and fighter for working families," she said.</p>
