<p>KABUL - Women in many parts of

Afghanistan continue to face discrimination and intimidation

more than a year after the fall of the Islamic fundamentalist

Taliban regime, according to a U.N. report issued on Thursday.

<P> The country's emergence from 24 years of conflict and the

Taliban's ouster in late 2001 by a U.S.-led coalition had led

to some significant progress for women.<P> But many &quot;Taliban-like&quot; restrictions on women remained in

parts of the country and a lot more still needed to be done to

ensure their full and equal participation in society, the

United Nations said in the report, issued ahead of

International Women's Day on March 8.<P> In rural areas, especially in the more conservative tribal

belt where powerful warlords hold sway, the situation of women

had not changed to any great extent since the removal of the

Taliban, it said.<P> &quot;Despite positive developments regarding women's rights,

intimidation and violence by regional and local commanders

against women continue unabated,&quot; the U.N. said.<P> &quot;Women are reported to restrict their participation in

public life to avoid being targets of violence by armed

factions and elements seeking to enforce the repressive edicts

of the previous regime.&quot;<P> Entitled &quot;The Situation of Women and Girls in Afghanistan&quot;,

the report will be presented at a U.N. session in New York

discussing the status of women worldwide lasting until March

14th, said the U.N. spokesman in Afghanistan Manoel de Almeida

e Silva.<P> Under the Taliban, women were banned from all forms of

education and most outdoor work.<P> The fundamentalist regime, which was seeking to build the

world's purest Islamic state, also forced women to wear the

burqa, a loose garment which covered the figure from head to

toe with veiled eye holes, at all times outdoors.<P> Women had moved from this complete denial of rights to

participation in several key state institutions, but many

restrictions remained, the report said.<P> &quot;The fact that women in many parts of the country continue

to face gross violations of their rights, is a matter of

concern,&quot; it said.<P> &quot;Women are primary victims of insecurity...Taliban-like

restrictions continue to be applied to women in some parts of

the country by local leaders.&quot;<P> The report urged the U.S.-backed government of President

Hamid Karzai to work harder to bring those responsible for

violence against women to justice.<P> Reformers in Karzai's government have been struggling to

introduce greater democracy and more liberal concepts since

replacing the Taliban.<P> Even though there is no longer any formal requirement, many

women still feel obliged to wear burqas, even in comparatively

liberal Kabul.<P> Nearly a dozen girls' schools have been burned down or

bombed in the past year in various parts of the country.
