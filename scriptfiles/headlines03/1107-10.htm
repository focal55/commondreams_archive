<p>In addition to wisdom, Studs Terkel can point to another benefit of his advancing 
years: loss of hearing. <p>"My bad hearing leads me to higher truths," says the 
Pulitzer Prize-winning author. <p>"For instance, terms like embedded journalist 
come through to me as in-bed with journalist. My problem with the media right 
now is that we've got too many in-bed-with-journalists and not enough of the skeptical, 
questioning, challenging journalists who will hold George Bush and his boys accountable," 
he adds. <p>At 91, Studs Terkel could well be the oldest participant in this weekend's 
National Conference on Media Reform, which starts today in downtown Madison. He 
is certainly the feistiest. <p>The author of acclaimed books such as "Working" 
and "The Good War" will participate in several events associated with this weekend's 
conference. He also will speak and sign copies of his new book, "Hope Dies Last: 
Keeping the Faith in Difficult Times," at 5 p.m. Sunday at Canterbury Booksellers, 
315 W. Gorham St. <p>For Terkel, who made his name as an incisive radio interviewer, 
the increasing consolidation of radio station ownership, and the homogenization 
that goes with it, is troubling. But Terkel is not only concerned about the sector 
of media he knows best. <p>"Information, news, ideas - that's the juice that gets 
a democracy going. When a few corporations control all the juice, they decide 
how the democracy works. Or how it won't work. I don't worry that much about people 
doing the right thing if they have the facts about what their government is up 
to. But if they don't get the facts, the whole thing falls apart," says the man 
who has spent most of his life interviewing Americans about their work, their 
ideals, their politics and, with his new book, their optimism about the prospect 
of making a better world. <p>In Terkel's view, the run-up to the war in Iraq provides 
a perfect example of how things fall apart when the media fails to do its job. 
While TV news anchors pinned on flags and conducted fawning interviews with members 
of the Bush administration, the senior member of the U.S. Senate, West Virginia 
Democrat Robert Byrd, was virtually ignored as he questioned the rush to war. 
<p>"Senator Byrd has been fantastic. He's the one guy who said 'bugger off' when 
Bush came around trying to sell the idea of this war. I think he's the one guy 
who really stood up for our kids in the military, when he said he did not want 
them going off and invading a country that was no threat to us," says Terkel. 
"But Byrd got no headlines. You hardly ever saw him on television. I think that 
if he had, we might not be in this war today. That's an example of what happens 
when the big media companies just give us the administration's version of the 
news." <p>The man who immortalized the generation of Americans who fought "the 
good war" of the 1940s terms the Iraq war "a quagmire for America." <p>"We were 
the most honored country in the world at the end of World War II," he notes. "Now 
we're the most loathed country. We need a media that asks: 'What the hell are 
we doing there?' " <p>Is it possible to transform the media? Terkel thinks so. 
Like most of the reformers who will be in Madison this weekend, he's a big backer 
of federal ownership rules that control the consolidation of media companies. 
And he wants to see more support for public radio and television. But he also 
celebrates the development of alternatives to big media. <p>In New York last week, 
Terkel's appearance to promote his new book drew an overflow crowd. The author 
credits an appearance on Amy Goodman's "Democracy Now" radio program, which airs 
on the Pacifica network and community radio stations across the country (including 
Madison's WORT-FM), with getting the crowd out. <p>"We didn't need NBC. We didn't 
need CBS. We had Amy Goodman," he says of the host, who refers to her program 
as the exception to the rulers. Goodman will also participate in this weekend's 
conference, along with keynote speaker Bill Moyers, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, humorist 
Al Franken and others. <p>Terkel says the success of Franken's new book, "Lies 
and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right," and 
of other books that dissent from Bush administration orthodoxies, such as recent 
best-sellers by filmmaker Michael Moore and columnist Molly Ivins, proves that 
Americans are not satisfied with what the administration or most of the media 
are telling them. <p>"Three of the best-selling authors in America are Franken, 
Michael Moore and Molly Ivins. That should tell you something," says Terkel. "The 
people are ahead of the politicians and the media, as usual." <p><I>John Nichols, 
editorial page editor of The Capital Times, is also one of the principal organizers 
of this weekend's National Conference on Media Reform. </I><p ALIGN="CENTER">Copyright
