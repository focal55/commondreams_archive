<p>DIYALA, IRAQ  --

Any chance that tribespeople in this rural area south of Baghdad would 

look kindly on the impending arrival of American troops may have vanished in a 

cloud of collapsing rubble and twisted steel.

A house burns following recent air strikes on Baghdad, March 26, 2003. At least 15 burned corpses lay in a popular residential area of Baghdad, apparently killed in a U.S.-led bombing or missile raid on the Iraqi capital on Wednesday, Reuters Television correspondents said. An Iraqi Information Ministry official said a strike on a busy market area had caused 'many, many casualties.' REUTERS/Goran Tomasevic <br>

</table></font>At about 4:30 p.m. Monday afternoon, two planes, which residents believed 

to be American, flew over the area, and local anti-aircraft batteries opened 

up at them. According to half a dozen witnesses at the scene, the planes fired 

several missiles in response, most of which hit empty fields planted with 

wheat and barley. But one landed squarely on Adjmi Jubouri's two-story house.

<P>Jubouri's 22-year-old daughter, Hana, was killed, along with two other 

relatives, and eight were injured, said relatives and doctors at a Baghdad 

hospital where the wounded were taken. When the missile hit, the upper floor 

pancaked down into the living room, where the extended Jubouri clan had 

huddled to wait out the air attacks that have shaken the area.

<P>On Tuesday, a visit to the site by a Chronicle reporter and an Iraqi 

government "minder" quickly turned into a raucous rally full of seemingly raw 

emotions, as more than a dozen neighbors and local tribespeople gathered at 

the site, strewn with small pieces of shrapnel.

<P><b>PINPOINT BOMBING CLAIMED</b>

<P>The U.S. military insists it is carrying out pinpoint bombing attacks and 

going to great lengths to avoid harming civilians. Independent observers have 

suggested that some civilian casualties may have been caused by anti-aircraft 

fire and by Iraqi SA-2 anti-aircraft missiles that have gone astray. But that 

was not the view on the ground, especially among those on the receiving end of 

the missiles in Diyala.

<P>"The Americans are targeting civilians, and this gives us more courage to 

defend our country," said Abdul Ahmed Adjmi, Jubouri's brother-in-law, his 

gray mustache quivering as he spoke.

<P>Other tribesmen, their heads covered with red-and-white checked kaffiyehs, 

shouted their approval and waved revolvers and old hunting rifles.

<P>The Diyala region, a sparsely populated area scattered with mud-brick 

houses and irrigated fields, is near a strategic bridge over the Diyala River, 

on one of the two highways approaching Baghdad from the south. The area has 

come under heavy attack from U.S. missiles fired to soften up the Iraqi 

military and Republican Guard before a march on the capital.

<P><b>HOSTILE ATTITUDES</b>

<P>The population is made up of Sunni and Shiite tribes that U.S. war planners 

had hoped would abandon the urban-oriented Hussein regime. But the reactions 

of Diyala residents encountered here indicate that U.S. forces may face more 

hostile attitudes than they anticipated in their long march northward.

<P>A similar turn in sentiment appears to be occurring in Baghdad. Earlier 

this month, residents repeatedly approached foreign reporters on the street to 

express their whispered hopes that the allied troops would overthrow the 

regime.

<P>But since the U.S. missile barrage began, nationalist sentiment has become 

more pronounced. While residents still seem more than willing to have the 

dictator plucked from their midst, they have become steadily more alienated by 

the realization that his removal involves some messy, intrusive military force.

<P>According to government officials, civilian losses are mounting. On Monday 

alone, 62 civilian deaths and 176 injuries were reported around the country.

<P>As missile strikes thunder across the city throughout the day and night, 

the "shock and awe" campaign appears to have produced something closer to 

shock and anger.

<P>Driving through the area around Diyala, 20 miles southeast of downtown 

Baghdad, there are other indications of missile strikes. A mile from the 

remains of the Jubouri house, buildings were reduced to rubble and a factory 

lay flattened and ripped to shreds, spewing thousands of aluminum panels 

across neighboring fields.

<P>Local military forces, however, seem to have been unaffected by the blasts 

in Diyala. Hundreds of soldiers were dispersed across fields and along 

irrigation canals, huddling in their little tents against the fierce dust 

storms that swept the region Tuesday. Armored personnel carriers were hidden 

under overpasses, fuel tanks were covered with dirt berms, and anti-aircraft 

batteries were nestled under trees.

<P><b>MOURNING HIS LOSS</b>

<P>Meanwhile, Adjmi Jubouri, who suffered cuts on his arm and head in Monday's 

attack, lies in a hospital in Baghdad, cursing the Americans and mourning his 

loss. "Hana was a good girl," he says. "Bush is an evil man."

<P>In the same hospital ward as Jubouri is his son-in-law, Khalid Abdullah. 

Khalid and Hana were married March 18, only six days before the attack. Khalid 

spends much of his time mute, sitting on the floor, sobbing by himself.

<P>Twenty miles away, scattered in the ruins of the family house, are dozens 

of left-over wedding invitations. The low-budget design features a 

stereotypical image of a tall groom and his blond bride.

<P>Along with the invitations and the other detritus of wrecked lives are 

innumerable scraps of twisted steel -- the remnants of a missile -- cold and 

hard.
