<p>GENEVA - While life expectancy increases in most  of the world, in AIDS-ravaged parts of southern Africa adult  mortality is higher than 30 years ago, the World Health  Organization said on Thursday.<p> 
			
							In 14 African countries, the U.N. agency said in its annual  World Health Report, child mortality is higher than it was in  1990, with over 300 children out of every 1,000 born in Sierre  Leone dying before the age of five.<p> 
			
							The 194-page report, which ranges from life expectancy  through road traffic deaths to the fight against polio and  AIDS, also warned of a growing gulf in health care and exposure  to disease between the poorest nations and the rest.<p> 
			
							"Today's global health situation raises urgent questions  about justice," WHO Director-General Lee Jong-wook, wrote in an  introduction.<p> 
			
							"In some parts of the world there is a continued  expectation of longer and more comfortable life, while in many  others there is despair over the failure to control disease  though the means to do so exist."<p> 
			
							Of the 57 million premature deaths in 2002, 10.5 million  were among children of less than five years of age and 98  percent of those were in developing countries.<p> 
			
							In Zimbabwe, the average life expectancy for both sexes was  37.9, in Zambia 39.7 and in Angola 39.9, while in Switzerland  it was 80.6, in Sweden 80.4 and in France 79.7.<p> 
			
							HIGH RATE IN JAPAN<p> 
			
							A baby girl born now in Japan could expect to live 85  years, while one born at the same time in Sierra Leone would  probably not survive beyond 36.<p> 
			
							"A world marked by such inequities is in very serious  trouble," wrote Lee. "We have to find ways to unite our  strengths as a global community to shape a healthier future."<p> 
			
							The report said AIDS was the leading cause of death in the  15-59 age range, reducing the life expectancy of adults in  Botswana, Lesotho, Swaziland and Zimbabwe by 20 years.<p> 
			
							Deaths from the virus and the complications it brings were  almost twice those from the next top killer -- heart disease --  and well over twice more than the third most fatal --  tuberculosis, according to the report.<p> 
			
							The WHO said diseases related to tobacco were responsible  for some five millions deaths a year.<p> 
			
							It said that in 2002, over 1.2 million people died of lung  cancer -- largely caused by smoking -- which was a 30 percent  increase on 1990. Three out of four of these deaths were among  men, the WHO said.<p> 
			
							Among men, average life expectancy is 77.9 years in  Australia and 75.9 in France. In China, the average man lives  to 69.6, in Brazil to 65.7 and Egypt to 65.3.<p> 
			
							But in Russia -- where health and other social services  have largely collapsed since the end of the Soviet system in  1991 -- a man can expect to live to only 58.4.<p> 
			
							French women have a present life expectancy of 83.5, just  ahead of Australian women who can expect to live to 83.<p> 
			
							Russian women, less prone to the ravages of heavy  vodka-drinking, can expect to outlive their men by around 14  years and die at just over the age of 72.
