</table></font>NEW YORK   - Seventeen people were arrested on  Monday during an anti-war protest outside the United Nations,  where chief arms inspector Hans Blix was addressing the U.N.  Security Council about the hunt for weapons of mass destruction  in Iraq.<p>



		At its peak, there were between 200 and 300 people at the  hour-long protest across the street from U.N. headquarters in  midtown Manhattan, police said.<p>



		The group chanted slogans and held up signs reading: "Let  the Inspectors Work" and "No to Bush's Oil War."<p>



		The 17 people placed under arrest faced charges of  disorderly conduct, police said.<p>



		Speaking at a news conference following the hour-long  protest, Michael Ratner, president of the Center for  Constitutional Rights, a New York-based non-profit legal group,  urged the United States not to go to war against Iraq.<p>



		"This war is about oil and the domination of oil in the  Middle East. This war will lead us to being less safe, not more  safe. This will lead to more terror from others who hate what  we are about to do," he said.<p>



		Phyllis Bennis of the Institute for Policy Studies in  Washington said the protest was a way to say "no to war."<p>



		"The U.S. is looking for political cover for a war that has  nothing to do with disarmament. It's for oil and for empire,  expansion of the U.S. empire," she said.
