<p>MILLAU, France  - A French judge on Monday barred high-profile 
anti-globalization campaigner Jose Bove - released from prison last month - 
from attending the upcoming World Trade Organization summit in Mexico.

  </table></font>The judge in the southern town of Millau followed a recommendation made 
last week by the public prosecutor, who requested that Bove's application to 
leave the country for the Cancun summit be rejected.
<p>"The situation of Mr Bove, like any other person placed in a conditional 
release program by prison officials, remains that of a prisoner. It's from 
this legal viewpoint that I ruled," judge Xavier Puel told AFP after the 
decision.
<p>Bove, who has called for wide-scale protests ahead of the September 10-14 
WTO summit, was released from prison a month ago after serving six weeks of a 
10-month sentence for two counts of destroying genetically modified (GM) crops.
<p>His sentence was reduced after a partial amnesty by French President 
Jacques Chirac, and a judge ruled he could serve the rest of his term under a 
conditional release program
<p>But the  sheep farmer needed legal permission to travel abroad.
Bove's attorney, Francois Roux, told AFP that he would seek to appeal the 
ruling, but conceded that his client would not be in Cancun in time for the 
start of the summit next week.
<p>"I regret that non-governmental organizations, on the eve of an extremely 
important summit, will be deprived of the presence of a man like Jose Bove, 
who is a recognized expert on the WTO," Roux said.
<p>Upon hearing the verdict, the 50-year-old campaigner quipped: "I'll be in 
Cancon, a small village of 1,200 residents" in southwestern France, in a nod 
to the opening of the WTO talks.
<p>Bove said the decision to prevent him from going to Mexico would have "very 
political consequences, as it keeps a person accredited by the WTO from 
attending the meeting in Cancun."
<p>Bove urged supporters to stage a mass anti-WTO rally in Paris on Saturday, 
kicking off a series of demonstrations ahead of the start of the WTO talks.
<p>"We must mobilize to make sure that the Cancun summit is a failure, to put 
the 146 member governments under citizen's arrest so that they can't sign an 
agreement in Cancun," he said at a rally in southern France last month.
<p>Ministers from the Geneva-based WTO's 146 member states are to meet in 
Cancun to review progress in the so-called Doha Development round of trade 
liberalization talks.
