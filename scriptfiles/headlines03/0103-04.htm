<p>Hours after the Bush administration acted to loosen labeling standards 

for "dolphin-safe" tuna, pro-dolphin groups returned to the same San Francisco 

federal court that had blocked similar government efforts in the past.

<P>In a lawsuit filed late Tuesday and made public Thursday, Earth Island 

Institute and other conservation organizations said the Commerce Department's 

announcement ignored the government's own evidence that tuna fleets are 

harming dolphins by chasing and netting them.

<P>"The administration's own scientists have shown that the fishing practice 

(newly reclassified as dolphin-safe) is a disaster for dolphins," said David 

Phillips of <a href="http://www.earthisland.org/">Earth Island Institute</a> in San Francisco. "This is no more than a 

political gift to Mexico at the expense of dolphin lives."

<P>The National Marine Fisheries Service ruled Tuesday that imported tuna 

caught with huge nets that encircle dolphins can be sold to Americans as 

"dolphin safe," as long as onboard observers certify that no dolphins were 

killed or injured.

<P>The change will primarily affect tuna from Mexico, a major exporter that 

has been kept out of the U.S. market for more than a decade because its tuna 

boats drop nets on dolphins. Dolphins swim above schools of tuna in the 

eastern Pacific and were dying in the hundreds of thousands each year before U.

S. conservation groups led a campaign to change fishing practices.

<P>Fisheries Service director Bill Hogarth said he had determined that the 

netting does not have a "significant adverse impact" on the dolphin population.

<P>"We've gone from 700,000 mortalities down to around 1,600 killed last year,

" Hogarth said Thursday. With the observer program and other safeguards, 

including a requirement that each net contain an escape route for dolphins, 

"we can assure our American consumers that they still have dolphin-safe tuna," 

he said.

<P>But the lawsuit said some depleted dolphin species are not recovering, and 

cited a report to Congress by Hogarth's agency in August that found that 

netting by tuna boats was the most likely cause. Onboard observers have 

underreported dolphin kills and have failed to account for deaths caused by 

the stress of repeated nettings and the separation of baby dolphins from their 

mothers, the suit said.

<P>The battle over dolphins and tuna dates back more than 30 years. Congress 

prohibited U.S. fishing boats in 1972 from dropping nets on dolphins to trap 

tuna, imposed the same standard for foreign tuna imports in the 1980s and in 

1990 prescribed the dolphin-safe label for tuna caught without netting 

dolphins.

<P>Major U.S. brands sell only tuna that carries that label. Conservation 

groups said, and Hogarth confirmed, that brands including StarKist, Bumble Bee 

and Chicken of the Sea have promised not to buy tuna caught by netting 

dolphins, even if the U.S. government now considers it dolphin-safe.

<P>The current dispute stems from a 1997 law that allowed the government to 

relax standards for dolphin-safe tuna based on evidence that a nation's 

fishing practices were not harming dolphins.

<P>Relying on that law, President Bill Clinton's Commerce Department was 

prepared to certify Mexican tuna as dolphin-safe in April 2000, but was 

stopped by a court order obtained by the same conservation groups.

<P>U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson of San Francisco, who is likely to be 

assigned the latest lawsuit, ruled in 2000 that the government had dragged its 

feet on studies to determine whether dolphins were harmed by being repeatedly 

captured and released.

<P>Hogarth said Thursday the studies have now been conducted but are 

inconclusive.
