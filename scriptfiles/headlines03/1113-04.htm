<p>WASHINGTON - Exercising raw political muscle and a veto threat, the Bush administration and Republican leaders in Congress have killed an effort to end the U.S. ban on travel to Cuba.
<p>	The leaders' decision, accepted at a late-night meeting Wednesday, overrode strong majority votes in the House of Representatives and the Senate this fall to end the ban. And it left foes of U.S. Cuba policy frustrated and scrambling to refashion their strategy heading into an election year.

  </table></font>Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., and key House Republicans told other members of a House-Senate conference committee late Wednesday that the provision to end the ban, part of a $90 billion spending bill, had to come out.
<p>	Given Bush's warning that he would veto any change in the embargo on Cuba, "there is no alternative other than to remove the Cuba travel provision" from the bill, Shelby said.
<p>	Staffers who worked on this issue said that House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, R-Texas, and Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, R-Tenn., supported the decision to strip the Cuba provision from the bill.
<p>	U.S. travel to Cuba is mostly limited to humanitarian and educational groups, journalists and Cuban Americans. Backers of the embargo say that any easing of restrictions would funnel more tourist dollars to a repressive government without helping average Cubans.
<p>	Opponents of the travel ban say it's anachronistic and a failure, and that more U.S. visitors to the island and contacts between Americans and Cubans will help the Cuban people.
<p>	Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Miami Republican who lobbied Frist hard to remove the Cuba language, credited DeLay with stripping it from the bill - the fourth year that such a provision was removed from legislation in back rooms.
<p>	"He has been a wizard at making sure members understood that the president would veto the hard work they put into this bill," Ros-Lehtinen said.
<p>	Several lawmakers spoke out against the decision, but the conference committee, which was evenly divided on the Cuba issue, took no formal vote. Many members were more concerned with Amtrak subsidies, highway funds and pension provisions in the massive Treasury-Transportation spending package.
<p>	Though the end result was not a surprise, the tactics used angered many opponents of the U.S. embargo.
<p>	"Even though it was anticipated, it's still a very disappointing and undemocratic maneuver," said Mavis Anderson of the Latin American Working Group, a policy organization in Washington. "It's a steal from a legitimate victory."
<p>	Some Republicans who backed a change in policy said they were bothered by the maneuver.
<p>	"There is something out of whack with how the Cuba language was removed," complained Sen. Mike Enzi, R-Wyo. "It was stripped by staffers even before members of the committee formally met. There was no vote taken. Poof, it just disappeared into the congressional ether."
<p>	When Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., offered an alternative during the conference that would help farm groups travel to Cuba to promote their products, House Republicans blocked it. They waved letters from Treasury Secretary John Snow and Secretary of State Colin Powell warning that Bush would veto any attempt to "limit or modify existing law."
<p>	Several members grumbled that on the Cuba issue, presidential politics - the need for Bush to win Cuban-American votes in Florida next year - had trumped other concerns.
<p>	"We will never have a rational Cuba policy as long as presidential campaigns are perceived to end in Florida," said Rep. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., who sponsored House efforts to end the ban.
