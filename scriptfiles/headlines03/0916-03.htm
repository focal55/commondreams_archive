<p>WASHINGTON -- Washington should cut off aid to Colombia if the country proceeds with an amnesty for leaders of right-wing paramilitary groups responsible for some of the worst massacres of the country's decades-long civil war, human rights groups insist.
<p>
 A Colombian government proposal to offer amnesty to paramilitary leaders, in exchange for their dissolution and the payment of fines or other acts of contrition, was strongly assailed by a U.S. human-rights researcher who has monitored abuses there for both Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch (HRW).
<p>
In a release issued by HRW, Robin Kirk, the author of "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=commondreams-20&path=tg/detail/-/1586481045/qid%3D1063721431/sr%3D8-1" target="_new"><i>More Terrible Than Death: Massacres, Drugs and America's War in Colombia</i></a>" called on the administration of President George W. Bush&nbsp; -- Uribe's biggest foreign booster -- to cut off aid to Colombia if the proposal is adopted. Washington currently provides more than &#36;700 million a year in mostly military aid, more than it gives any other country except Israel and Egypt.
 <p>
 "Washington's response should be unequivocal," she said Monday. "If Colombia is serious about human rights and wants to continue receiving millions in aid, it cannot allow known criminals to escape justice by, in effect, writing a check."
 <p>
 The Bush administration has not commented publicly on Uribe's proposal, but the <i>New York Times</i> reported Monday that it had provided advice to Bogota on drafting legislation to implement its main components, which Washington sees as a step toward ending South America's oldest civil war.
 <p>
 Colombian human rights activists, as well as the UN's special envoy for human rights in Colombia, Michael Fruhling, oppose the initiative. "The bill opens the door to impunity because it throws out jail time and allows those responsible not to serve a single day in prison," Fruhling said.
 <p>
 The war, which dates back to the 1960s, has pitted two major left-wing guerrilla groups against the government and the army. To complicate matters, however, Colombia's drug traffickers have also entered the fray from time to time and helped finance the right-wing paramilitaries who have also enjoyed the support of individual army commanders, according to independent experts and human rights groups.
 <p>
 In addition to receiving backing from the traffickers, the paramilitaries, who unified as the "Self-Defense Forces" (AUC) in the mid-1990s, also moved into the drug trade themselves. Indeed, Carlos Castano, a top AUC leader, has admitted publicly that much of their financing in recent years has come from trafficking.
 <p>
 Colombian intelligence sources estimate that paramilitaries control about 40 percent of the country's cocaine exports, and Castano himself, as well as two other paramilitary leaders, has been indicted for importing cocaine into the United States. Washington has charged that the two guerrilla groups are also dependent on cocaine cultivation and trafficking.
 <p>
 The State Department also considers both the AUC and the two leftist insurgencies "terrorist groups," although the paramilitaries are notorious for mass killings of rural villagers suspected of links to the guerrillas. The AUC has also been accused thousands of assassinations, particularly of union and peasant organizers, but also including judges, prosecutors, and even two presidential candidates. 
 <p>
 Many of the killings have been shockingly brutal. Kirk cited one case in which the paramilitaries, with the apparent cooperation of army units stationed nearby, carried out a massacre in the central village of Mapiripan in 1997. At dawn, they rounded up residents and took them to a slaughterhouse where they bound and tortured the captives and slit their throats. The first person killed was hung from a meat hook; at least two others were decapitated. More than 30 others were slaughtered. Castano himself claimed responsibility and promised "many more Mapiripans" in the future.
 <p>
 Castano has been sentenced by Colombian judges to 102 years in prison, but, despite frequent statements to the press and circumstantial evidence of close ties with some military commanders, he has never been arrested.
 <p>
 Since last year's election of Uribe--whose governorship of a northern province drew widespread charges of condoning paramilitary activities--Castano and other paramilitary leaders have insisted they are willing to lay down their arms and enter into peace talks with the government.
 <p>
 It appears that the proposals put forward by Uribe are an effort to strike a deal, the basic elements of which include an amnesty for past crimes on condition that paramilitary leaders admit their crimes and make symbolic acts of contrition, such as community service, compensating the victims, or paying fines. "Rather than serving time in a prison, there are alternative sentences," according to the government's peace commissioner, Luis Carlos Restrepo," and the individuals will be allowed to pay reparations." 
 <p>
 In addition, the individuals would lose their right to bear arms and to hold or run for public office.
 <p>
 The proposal would not only apply to the paramilitaries. Guerrilla leaders could also be dealt with under the proposal, according to the government. The two insurgencies, however, have rejected Uribe's peace offers.
<p>
 "This shows what we have always affirmed, that Uribe's commitment has always been with the paramilitaries," Wilson Borja, a leftist congressman who was seriously wounded in an assassination attempt apparently by paramilitaries, told the <i>New York Times</i>.
