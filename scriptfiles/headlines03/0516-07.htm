<p>BAGHDAD  - Iraqis said on Friday their patience with U.S. pledges to restore law and order in Baghdad and to improve the economy was running thin and fear of lawlessness could lead to anti-American violence.

<p>Iraqis, many hiding in their homes for fear of being robbed, are now calling for the establishment of any interim government that would end what many see as growing anarchy.

<p>Some Iraqis who had celebrated the downfall of Saddam Hussein last month in a U.S.-led invasion now say insecurity outweighs any feeling of political freedom and liberation.

<p>"Under Saddam we lived in fear, now we live in terror from crime and we live in poverty," said Othman, a taxi driver queuing to fill up his car with petrol.

<p>The absence of law and order was also disrupting the delivery of humanitarian aid.

<p>"We are concerned about the security situation," senior U.N. aid official Kenzo Oshima told a news conference in Baghdad. "Without adequate security, the delivery of humanitarian assistance will be hampered."

<p>Iraqis complain that the cost of living has more than doubled in weeks. While the Iraqi dinar's exchange rate to the dollar has appreciated, prices of food and petrol have risen.

<p>Suha Abdel-Hamid, a wealthy housewife, disappointed with the turn of events in Iraq, said she is now thinking of leaving the country in search of a safer and better life.

<p>"Saddam was brutal and cruel. He suffocated us but at least he restored electricity and normality after the 1991 war. What are the Americans waiting for?" she told Reuters. 

<p>LIVING IN FEAR

<p>Grievances against the Americans for moving slowly to curb crime and establish a government were widely growing.

<p>Wamidh Nazmi, an Iraqi political analyst questioned the logic behind keeping Baghdad almost in complete darkness and without services more than three weeks after the war ended.

<p>"This is the worst situation in Iraq's modern history. On top of this there is no sense of security whatsoever. People also want wages," Nazmi told Reuters.

<p>He stood up and pulled a pistol from his pocket and said: "I simply went to the pharmacy next door to buy medicine, but I needed this to protect myself."

<p>U.S. civil administrator in Iraq Paul Bremer told reporters on Thursday the security situation was very serious but U.S. troops were addressing it and conditions were improving.

<p>Retired Christian teacher Sabah Yusef said security at the moment was more important than freedom.

<p>"If this anarchy and unemployment continues for another month, people will rise against the Americans and bring about a more chaotic situation," he said.
<p>Many Iraqis echoed his sentiments.
<p>In Baghdad, many women live in fear. Everybody has a story to tell about the abduction of women from the streets by violent criminals Saddam freed from jails in an amnesty in October.

<p>"I don't allow my sisters outside the house. When I leave home, I'm worried the criminals will come for my sisters, and when I'm at home I'm worried they will steal my car, it's impossible to live like this," said Sa'ad Kathem, an unemployed young man sitting on the street outside his home.
