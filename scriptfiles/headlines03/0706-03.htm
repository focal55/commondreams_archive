<p>NAIROBI   - At 2 a.m., baton-wielding police kick  open the doors of a home in Kenya's Mombasa port, bludgeon its  Muslim inhabitants and seize a terror suspect. Furious Muslim  leaders complain of anti-Islamic prejudice.<P>
In Malawi, U.S. agents and police grab five foreign Muslims  suspected of plotting terror and whisk them overseas without a  court appearance, triggering days of protests by local Muslims.<P>
If President Bush expects sympathy from ordinary Africans  for his global war against Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda group  when he visits the continent this week, he will be  disappointed.<P>
Instead, anti-U.S. sentiment is deepening as governments  hunt militants at the behest of Washington and Britain, raising  fears for civil liberties, straining ties between Christians  and Muslims and hurting old friendships with the West.<P>
"Must we sing to their tune, as if we are still a colony?"  wrote Kenyan Joseph Mutua in Nairobi's The People newspaper,  referring to former colonial power Britain.<P>
"The overt coercion used by the Kenyan government and other  governments such as Malawi's is highly objectionable. They  should use more subtle means," said community leader Mohammed  Hydar of Mombasa's Muslim Civic and Education Trust.<P>
"We don't want people taken to interrogation in unknown  places where laws are abrogated. The police are shooting  themselves in the foot, because we'll help (investigators) if  the law is being followed and people are treated with dignity."<P>
In Nigeria, analysts say a tough campaign against al Qaeda  suspects could trigger a backlash in the already volatile  Islamic North, where hundreds died in sectarian riots in Kano  ignited by the start of the U.S. campaign in Afghanistan.<P>
Matters have been made worse in East Africa by Western  terror alerts and travel warnings that have hurt vital tourism.  The move has encouraged many across the continent to blame the  West more than Muslim militant bombers for exposing Africa to  political violence stemming from disputes outside the  continent.<P>
"We are a target of terrorists mainly because of the global  activities of Uncle Sam," said Kenyan columnist Mwenda Njoka,  referring to Washington's perceived pro-Israel foreign policy.<P>
"Remove the Palestinian problem and no Africans will care  about bin Laden. He'll be left to fight on his own," said  Hydar.<P>
As rich countries tighten security after the Sept. 11,  2001, attacks on the United States, Africa's chaos, graft and  poverty have made it a more congenial place for militants to  operate and hide, analysts say.<P>
"Kenya is helplessly exposed to any mediocre terrorist with  evil intent," wrote Ambrose Murunga, a former detective who  helped investigate the 1998 bombings of U.S. Embassies in east  Africa.<P>
"Our intelligence services have virtually no human  intelligence sources within the established terrorist networks  to alert us of impending strikes," he said, complaining that  the police lacked high-tech gadgetry to monitor terror  suspects.<P>
OPPORTUNISM<P>
Equally, experts say, there is no evidence that increasing  numbers of African Muslims are flocking to join Osama bin  Laden's Arab-led campaign against the West despite a deep  sympathy with the Palestinian struggle against Israel.<P>
"Terrorism in Africa by al Qaeda would be best categorized  as opportunism, because Africa is chaotic and there are easy  soft targets like hotels in Mombasa," said Alex Vines of  Britain's Royal Institute for International Affairs.<P>
Historical links to the Gulf make East Africa the main  region south of the Sahara for Middle East-related terrorism.<P>
In 1998 the bombings of the U.S. Embassies in Kenya and  Tanzania killed 224 people. Three years later a U.S. court  convicted four followers of bin Laden for the attacks.<P>
November's bombing of an Israeli-owned hotel near Mombasa  that killed 16 people was claimed by his al Qaeda group.<P>
Bin Laden lived in Sudan in the early 1990s and Somalia may  be a similar refuge for militants, although foreigners are  likely to find it difficult to blend into its tightly knit clan  system.<P>
But Arabs lead al Qaeda and Africans, when they have been  involved, have tended to be the foot soldiers, experts say.<P>
"I don't see (a distinctive) African readiness to get  involved in terrorism," said Jerrold Post, a former U.S.  Central Intelligence Agency expert on the psychology of  terrorism who testified at the trial of the men convicted of  the 1998 blasts.
<P>
Militant Islam has found it difficult to penetrate West  Africa, despite deep poverty and disaffection in mainly Muslim  Senegal or Gambia. And any al Qaeda presence in West Africa is  more to do with smuggling precious stones than finding  recruits.
