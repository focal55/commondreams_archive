<p>US forces are waging a "guerrilla war" in Iraq where elements of the former regime inflict casualties almost daily,  Paul Wolfowitz, deputy defense secretary said on Wednesday. 
<p>However his boss, Donald Rumsfeld, said the the American public was prepared to accept the mounting death toll.
<p>Their comments came as US Central Command reported American forces in Iraq had captured Abdel Hamid al-Tikriti, Saddam Hussein's personal secretary, senior bodyguard and national security adviser.
<p>The capture of Mr al-Tikriti, the ace of diamonds in the US military's deck of cards representing wanted Iraqi officials, is the highest-level arrest by US troops since the war began.
<p>He is the fourth most wanted on the US list after the former president himself and his sons Qusay and Uday.

<p>In Washington the Bush administration and military commanders differ publicly over the degree of resistance to US occupation in Iraq, but Mr Wolfowitz told Congress: "There's a guerrilla war there but we can win it.
<p>"We have made great progress in some areas of the country, but we continue to face an adaptive and determined enemy which, while defeated on the conventional battlefield, is nonetheless intent on killing Americans and Iraqis," he told the House Armed Services Committee.
<p>Mr Wolfowitz, who insisted the enemy did not have broad popular support, spoke after a US soldier was killed in a drive-by shooting at a Baghdad petrol station - the 52nd soldier to die in Iraq since President George W. Bush announced the end of major combat on May 1.
<p>Speaking from Iraq to reporters in Washington, General Ray Ordierno of the 4th Infantry Division said he would not describe the resistance as being of a "guerrilla" nature, dismissing it as "militarily insignificant".
<p>The comments by the Pentagon's top two officials reflect efforts by the White House to prepare the nation for a longer and more hazardous enterprise in Iraq than had been anticipated.
<p>Despite the casualties, Mr Rumsfeld said he believed the US public felt the effort was “worthwhile” and that people “recognize the difficulty of the task”. 
<p>The defense secretary also revealed that the US was considering plea bargains with captured members of the regime in exchange for information. This follows reports that the UK government was pressing the US to make deals in order to trace Mr Hussein and weapons of mass destruction.</p>
