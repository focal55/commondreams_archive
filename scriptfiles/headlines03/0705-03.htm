RAMADI, Iraq  - Seven recruits to a U.S.-backed  Iraqi police force were killed and dozens wounded on Saturday  in an explosion outside a police station in a town west of  Baghdad, police officers said.
<P>
They said the attack happened as about 80 recruits gathered  outside a police station on a main street in Ramadi, 100 km (60  miles) west of the capital, after a training session.<P>
Police arrested several suspects and were interrogating  them, Shihan said. A gunfight erupted near the police station  between officers and one man angered over the arrest of a  relative. The man fled after police returned fire.<P>
"Seven police recruits died and 20 are critically wounded,"  deputy chief of the town's police Abdullah Shihan told Reuters.  He blamed "mercenaries who aim at destabilizing the security of  this city."<P>
Dozens more were lightly to moderately wounded, Shihan  said.<P>
Ramadi is in a mainly Sunni Muslim region north and west of  Baghdad which was long a bastion of support for Saddam Hussein,  himself a Sunni. It has been the scene of many recent attacks.<P>
Some residents and police said the blast was a result of a  roadside bomb while others said it was a rocket-propelled  grenade or an artillery shell.<P>
Pools of blood on the street and on the pavement could  still be seen in Ramadi hours after Saturday's late morning  attack.<P>
Torn shoes were strewn in the street.<P>
SADDAM LOYALISTS BLAMED<P>
Jaadan Mohammad, the chief of police, said he believed  Saddam Hussein loyalists were behind the attack.<P>
"We are here to serve our people and to restore security in  Ramadi," he said. "We were told by the Americans that if we  restored law and order to Ramadi, they would leave the city."<P>
A U.S. military spokesman in Baghdad said "initial reports"  reaching the military was that there had been seven dead and up  to 40 wounded in the blast.<P>
Anti-American sentiment runs high in Ramadi.<P>
"We are going to fight the Americans until they leave our  country... We will fight until the last drop of our blood,"  Jabbar al-Dulaimy said.<P>
Other residents said the recruits and police were acting  "as spies for the Americans."<P>
The attack came a day after al Jazeera television broadcast  an audio tape purporting to be Saddam speaking from hiding in  Iraq and urging his countrymen not to help the "infidel  invaders" who overthrew him three months ago.<P>
U.S. occupation forces have been recruiting and training  local police forces in an attempt to end nearly three months of  lawlessness since the fall of Saddam Hussein in April.<P>
Twenty-six U.S. and six British soldiers have been killed  since President Bush declared major combat over in Iraq on May  1 after the war that ousted Saddam.
<P>
U.S. officials blame isolated Saddam loyalists for the  guerrilla attacks. But some Iraqis say the violence reflects  more widespread discontent with their U.S.-led occupiers.
