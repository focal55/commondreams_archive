<p><p>Friends, family and red, white, and blue balloons welcomed Blaise Blastos home to Ann Arbor from Iraq on Saturday evening. But the rah-rah spirit was dampened by sober reality.
</P>
<P> Yes, the U.S. Army reservist is home. But it's only for two weeks.
</P>
<P> Yes, he is serving his country. But he says what's going on over there is not only discouraging and demoralizing, but a waste of time for a whole lot of homesick American soldiers.

</table>Yes, he is happy to finally be reunited with Joanna, his wife of less than a year who is now in her seventh month of pregnancy. But he'll be back in Iraq when his son is born in early December.
</P>
<P> While the U.S. involvement in Iraq is no longer given as much attention by most Americans as it was during and shortly after the invasion, the military operation is the central theme of the Blatoses' short time as husband and wife.
</P>
<P> Blaise Blastos, 36, tries to keep things in perspective, but it's difficult given all that has happened to him and his wife since the first of the year. He looks forward to the day next spring when he'll be sent home for good, but then he thinks of the best man at his March wedding who was killed by a grenade in Iraq in July.
</P>
<P> "They already had their homecoming," he said of the man's family. "But they brought a coffin home."
</P>
<P> Joanna Blastos barely knows where to begin when someone asks, "What's new?"
</P>
<P> A year ago, the lifelong Ann Arborite had just met the man of her dreams.
</P>
<P> On February 6, Blaise, who was enlisted in the Ann Arbor Army Reserve, learned his skills were needed in the Middle East.
</P>
<P> On Feb. 8, he left Ann Arbor for training in Wisconsin.
</P>
<P> On March 12, Joanna Kokkales and Blaise Blastos were married at a bed and breakfast in Wisconsin.
</P>
<P> On a weekend visit two weeks later, she got pregnant.
</P>
<P> And in April, he left for active duty in the Middle East.
</P>
<P> His return this weekend gave Joanna a respite from spending every waking minute worried something will happen to him. He arrived home on his leave coincidentally on the day Joanna's family and friends were having a baby shower for her, so the guests from around the country were able to greet the returning reservist.
</P>
<P> "It's good to see him alive," said his mother, Joan Blastos, of Pittsburg, where he grew up. She said her husband turns on the radio at 5 a.m. every day to hear whether there were any American casualties in Iraq overnight.
</P>
<P> Blastos, a supply sergeant who quickly replaced his Army fatigues with blue jeans and a white oxford shirt when he got home Saturday, shakes his head when asked to describe the military duties in Iraq. He sums it up in a word: terrible.
</P>
<P> "Every day we ask ourselves what we're doing there," he said. "We can't come up with a good answer."
</P>
<P> Back in May, he and other reservists helped build two pontoon bridges. Since then, he and about 175 others have had far less to do in their station in Ba'qubah near Baghdad. At most, they work three hours a day, which leaves a lot of free time to commiserate among themselves. Nobody feels proud of what they're doing there, he said.
</P>
<P> At first, the Iraqis were happy the Americans were there, but that sentiment has changed to resentment, he said.
</P>
<P> Although he voted for George Bush, he says he won't do so again.
</P>
<P> "All the reasons for going to war were based on miscalculations, errors and plain untruths," he said. "I can't justify all these people spending a year of their lives based on politicians' untruths." Blastos said he would have felt differently had he served in World War II, where there was a clearly defined goal, threat and outcome.
</P>
<P> "Everything's muddled now, nothing is clear-cut," he said, as his chocolate Labrador, LaLa, paced through the house of relatives, a red, white and blue ribbon round his neck.
</P>
<P> Blastos said those in active duty don't support the reserve units, which are provided little money for basics. "We get what they don't want, or what's left over," he said, noting that he has to wake up at 4:30 a.m. to make a phone call home because there's just one phone for 175 people. They were issued two uniforms eight months ago, but nothing since. Some reservists have no boots. His wife mailed him gloves to use when he was sent on a mission to pick up trash on the streets.
</P>
<P> Joanna Blastos is also no fan of Bush, who recently extended the service of all the reservists another six to nine months. While her husband should have been coming home for good this month, he'll likely still be there until sometime next spring.
</P>
<P> "I try not to watch the news much anymore because it was throwing me into quite a depression, and my blood pressure wasn't too hot for a while there," she said. "Every day, you wait for that knock on the door."
</P>
<P> Blaise Blastos moved to Ann Arbor to attend graduate school at the University of Michigan in 1996. He has been in the reserves since 1988, which required one weekend of service a month. He will return to his job as an environmental chemist in Plymouth at the end of his reservist duties.
</P>
<P> Asked what he misses most about the life he left behind in February, Blastos said he misses getting up and going to work every day. He misses Ann Arbor's quiet neighborhoods, and most of all, his wife.
</P>
<P> He knows several people who were killed or injured in the past few months and says he is constantly scared.
</P>
<P> "To some extent, we're all traumatized for life," he said. "I get the feeling people in America don't know what's going on over there. It's dangerous." He said he'll always remember the sound of mortars at night, and the trauma of learning his good friend and best man had been killed in an ambush on a convoy in July.
</P>
<P> Joanna Blastos must look forward to giving birth to their son in early December without her husband present.
</P>
<P> "I think emotionally it's going to be very difficult," said Joanna, who will name the baby after his father. "When you're a little girl, you dream of having a baby. The person you want to look up at when that baby comes out is your husband. I'm not going to be able to do that."
</P>
<P> She's grateful that this week he'll go to a doctor's appointment for an ultrasound, attend her last infant care class and go on a hospital tour to see where she'll deliver their baby. He caught a few minutes of her baby shower when he first arrived Saturday, and a second shower is scheduled for the day he goes back to Iraq.
</P>
<P> Blastos said he feels they've been robbed of their first year of marriage, but at the same time, is grateful that circumstances prompted their wedding and subsequent pregnancy. Otherwise, they figure they would have waited another six months to a year to get married and may have not been able to conceive so quickly.
</P>
<P> Sitting beside him on the couch, her hands on her bulging belly, Joanna could barely take her eyes off her husband Saturday evening in the first hours after he arrived home.
</P>
<P> "The whole thing is like a dream," she said. "It's been a journey, that's for sure. It's the greatest challenge my life has ever known. But it's been worth every moment."
</P>
<P> Her husband said he tries not to think of what he's missed this past year, or that he won't be there for the birth of his first child. His focus is on returning to Iraq, following the routine, and then returning home safely to his wife and baby.
</P>
<P> "That's my motivation over there for staying alive: She and the baby need me."
