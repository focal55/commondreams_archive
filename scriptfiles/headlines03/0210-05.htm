<p>The U.S. embassy in Israel said on Monday it would start evacuating non-essential personnel and diplomats' families later in the week, with a U.S.-led war against Iraq looming.

<P>Paul Patin, an embassy spokesman in Tel Aviv, told <i>Haaretz</i> that the non-essential staff and diplomats' families have been on "authorized departure status" since Friday, when the State Department advised all but essential diplomats, along with family members, to leave Israel, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.

<P>Patin confirmed that several people have said they intend to leave Israel, with the first group flying out later this week. The spokesman said that some individuals had already left Saturday.

<P>"All non-essential staff and their families are on authorized departure status," said Patin," which means that they are allowed to leave if they want to. Those who do leave will be leaving on regular commercial flights."

<P>Patin said that he did not have any information on the number of people who would be leaving in the first group.

<P>The embassy would remain open for normal operations despite the evacuations, the official said.

<P><b>Security concerns</b>

<br>Citing "increased security concerns", the U.S. State Department said on Friday it had decided to offer embassy dependants and non-emergency staff in Israel, Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon free flights home - known as an "authorized departure".

<P>But it said the move did not mean that war with Iraq was imminent or inevitable. However, the United States took similar steps before the 1991 Gulf War against Iraq.

<P>On January 30, the State Department announced an authorized departure for U.S. diplomats and dependants in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.

<P>Several Asian countries have begun to pull diplomatic personnel out of Baghdad as the Iraq crisis deepens.

<P>Israeli officials estimate the United States will launch an assault on Iraq in late February or early March, shortly after the United Nations Security Council hears a report by chief UN weapons inspector Hans Blix.

<P>Israel, which was attacked by Iraqi Scuds during the 1991 Gulf War, is preparing its armed forces for a possible strike by Iraqi missiles armed with chemical and biological warheads.

<P>But Israeli officials have said they believe the likelihood of such any attack against Israel by Iraq is low. </p>
