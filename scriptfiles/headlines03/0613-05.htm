<p>A fuel-efficiency evangelist will wheel into town today with a challenge for Charlotte's Christians: <a href="http://www.whatwouldjesusdrive.org" target="_new">What would Jesus drive?</a></p>
<p>The Rev. Jim Ball is driving his gas-electric hybrid Toyota Prius through the Bible Belt, from Austin, Texas, to Washington, with a message that fuel economy and automobile pollution are moral issues. The American Baptist minister speaks tonight at St. Mark's Lutheran Church.</p>
<p>"A vehicle choice, how we get around, is part of loving your neighbor," Ball said during a stop in Atlanta.</p>
<p>U.S. vehicle emissions are key sources of the pollutants believed to cause global warming. The brunt of climate change is projected to fall disproportionately on the world's poor, Ball notes, through disease outbreaks and flooding.</p>
<p>Fuel economy is important because each gallon of gas a vehicle burns releases 20 pounds of carbon dioxide. But average fuel economy in the United States has declined for the past 15 years.</p>
<p>In North Carolina, eight out of 10 commuters drive alone to work, according to the 2000 Census. N.C. drivers are increasingly turning to heavy sport utility vehicles, vans and pickups that gulp more gas and belch more pollution than lighter cars.</p>
<p>SUVs make up 8.6 percent of the state's registered vehicles. In affluent Mecklenburg County, it's 11.7 percent.</p>
<p>But Ball, executive director of what he calls the "biblically orthodox" Evangelical Environmental Network, which partners with 23 other groups, insists the tour isn't an anti-SUV campaign.</p>
<p>"It's just a more serious version of the question, `What would Jesus do?' " he said.</p>
<p>"My answer is, what would Jesus have us drive? We think that Jesus wants us to purchase the most fuel-efficient, least-polluting vehicle that truly meets our needs."</p>
<p>Charlotteans Ron and Nancy Bryant drive an electric motor scooter, the second they've owned. They also own a Honda Insight, a gas-electric car.</p>
<p>"As a Christian, if I believe that God is a creator of the Earth, I am called to be a steward of all that is. And that would include all of nature, all of the Earth," said Nancy Bryant, a St. Mark's member who organized Ball's visit there.</p>
<p>A longtime environmental advocate, Bryant explores alternative energy and other climate-change solutions as part of the N.C. Council of Churches' Interfaith EcoJustice Network.</p>
<p>That initiative is a part of the growing connections between faith communities and environmental groups.</p>
<p>"It's something that's happening," said Jeff Meyer, a UNC Charlotte religion professor who will speak at tonight's event. "I think the real future of it is how far people like Jim Ball can take it."</p>
<p><b>Want to Go?</b></p>
<p>7:30 p.m. today, St. Mark's Lutheran Church, 1001 Queens Road, Charlotte. Also speaking: Superior Court Judge Jesse Caldwell.<br>
