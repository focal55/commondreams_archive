<p> Revisiting one of the most effective television commercials in the annals of U.S. politics, a grassroots anti-war group has produced a remake of the "Daisy" ad, warning that a war against Iraq could spark nuclear Armageddon.

</table></font>The provocative 30-second commercial -- released to the media Wednesday and appearing in 13 major U.S. cities on Thursday at a cost of $400,000, was prepared with the help of thousands of donations to the Internet-based group MoveOn.org.
<P>The original Daisy ad aired only once, during the 1964 presidential race. Produced by the campaign of incumbent Lyndon B. Johnson, it depicted a 6-year-old girl plucking petals from a daisy -- along with a missile launch countdown and then a nuclear mushroom cloud. The suggestion was that if elected president, Republican Barry Goldwater might lead the United States to a nuclear war with the Soviet Union. Goldwater lost by a wide margin.
<P>The 2003 version follows the same format, with an added montage of scenes of military escalation: burning oil wells, tanks in the battlefield, wounded soldiers, chaotic protests in a foreign city and an ambulance racing through U.S. streets. Then, a similar mushroom cloud, and the screen goes to black, with a dire warning: "War with Iraq. Maybe it will end quickly. Maybe not. Maybe it will spread. Maybe extremists will take over countries with nuclear weapons. Maybe the unthinkable."
<P>Then, another "10... 9... 8...," countdown, and a final message: "Maybe that's why the overwhelming majority of Americans say to President Bush: let the inspections work."
<P>MoveOn.org's leaders hope the ad will enliven the debate on the specter of war -- and persuade Americans to oppose a military solution in Iraq.
<P>"We're playing with matches in a tinderbox," Eli Pariser, MoveOn.org's international campaign director said. "We wanted to run an ad that would highlight that very real possibility and help encourage a national discussion about the consequences of war."
<P>But some experts on the media questioned whether the spot, created by Zimmerman & Markman, a political consulting and advertising firm based in Santa Monica, will be effective.
<P>"It's more of a news ad designed to get media attention," said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, the dean of the Annenberg School of Communication at the University of Pennsylvania.
<P>But she said the ad sends a mixed message, by both suggesting that Iraq already has nuclear weapons, and urging more inspections to find them.
<P>"If they are trying to persuade opinions, the ad is flawed," she said.
<P>Likewise, Barbara O'Connor, the director of California State University's Institute for the Study of Politics and the Media warned that viewers may tune out rather than engage with such horrific images.
<P>But both Jamieson and O'Connor noted that the original Daisy ad received huge news coverage after it aired 40 years ago -- and has since become an icon of negative political advertising.
<P>The new ad was scheduled to be shown in Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, Los Angeles, Miami, Minneapolis, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Portland, Oregon, San Francisco and Seattle.
<P>MoveOn.org also organized an online signature campaign against the war, and spent more than $300,000 on newspaper ads in December that also called on President Bush to "Let the Inspections Work."
<P>The group was founded in San Francisco by several Silicon Valley entrepreneurs in 1998 to lobby against the impeachment of President Clinton, and has a related political action committee that funneled campaign donations to the few members of Congress who voted against authorizing military force against Iraq. Its name comes from its original message: "Censure and move on."
