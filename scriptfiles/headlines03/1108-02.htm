<p> Former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, already considered the front-runner in the 
Democratic presidential race, will dramatically widen his advantage with a series 
of moves expected over the next few days. <p>Today, Dean is likely to announce 
that he will become the first Democratic candidate ever to opt out of the public 
financing system, a decision that could expand the financial advantage he already 
enjoys over his rivals. <p>On Wednesday, he's expected to receive an unprecedented 
joint endorsement from two of the nation's largest and most politically sophisticated 
unions: the Service Employees International Union and the American Federation 
of State, County and Municipal Employees. <p>Together, these developments would 
create an imposing organizational and financial challenge for Dean's rivals — 
whose best hope of overcoming his lead at this point may be Dean's tendency to 
wound himself with controversial remarks, like his recent comments about the Confederate 
flag. <p>"He was the front-runner before; he now becomes the big gorilla," Tony 
Coelho, a campaign chairman for Al Gore in the 2000 presidential race, said Friday. 
"I don't see anybody in the whole scheme of things who can beat him now. The question 
will be whether Dean can stop Dean." <p>Such comments underscore the remarkable 
evolution of Dean's campaign. <p>He began his candidacy as a classic political 
insurgent who had little money or name awareness but hoped to excite grass-roots 
enthusiasm through relentless campaigning in Iowa and New Hampshire — site of 
the first contests in the nomination process — with a message that criticized 
the party establishment. <p>Since then, Dean has become a hybrid candidate for 
whom there is no exact precedent. While he continues to stir excitement with the 
fervent anti-establishment message, he's also accumulating the financial and organizational 
resources that usually flow only to a candidate favored by the party establishment. 
<p>For Dean, the gains are reinforcing each other. One reason he is getting labor 
support is that he has demonstrated enough fund-raising clout to consider leaving 
the public financing system — which, if he wins the nomination, would put him 
in better position to compete with President Bush. <p>"For a lot of people, the 
possibility of [opting out of the system] puts an extra check mark next to our 
name," said Joe Trippi, Dean's campaign manager. <p>What makes this movement toward 
Dean more remarkable is that it is occurring while many Democrats still fear that 
his liberal views on the Iraq war and gay rights, and his sometimes volcanic temperament, 
would make him an easy general election opponent for Bush. <p>A senior strategist 
for one of Dean's rivals said that by aligning behind Dean, the SEIU and AFSCME 
are repeating the mistake that an array of labor leaders made in 1984, when they 
helped power former Vice President Walter Mondale to the Democratic nomination 
— only to see him crushed by President Reagan in the general election. <p>"I know 
from having traveled in the South and Southwest you are going to end up with a 
candidate [in Dean] who is virtually unelectable in the general election," the 
strategist insisted. <p>But while many centrist Democrats still share those fears, 
others have reassessed Dean. In particular, he's turned heads by his ability to 
raise money in small donations, largely through the Internet, and his success 
at exciting his party's core supporters — which many strategists, both Democrats 
and Republicans, are coming to view as more central to winning in 2004 than converting 
swing voters. <p>For Dean, the expected endorsement next week from the 1.4-million-member 
AFSCME may be invaluable in quashing questions about his electability. <p>In some 
respects, his support from the 1.6-million-member SEIU is not that surprising, 
since the union's main focus is expanding access to health care — Dean's top domestic 
priority — and its president, Andrew Stern, is considered one of the nation's 
most liberal labor leaders. <p>But AFSCME President Gerald W. McEntee is regarded 
as one of labor's most politically pragmatic and savvy leaders. His focus on finding 
the strongest general election candidate earlier led him to flirt with endorsements 
of Sen. John F. Kerry of Massachusetts or retired Gen. Wesley K. Clark. <p>For 
McEntee to join Stern behind Dean would send a powerful signal to other Democrats 
that key parts of the party establishment have grown more comfortable with Dean's 
prospects against Bush. <p>Although the AFSCME will not make its decision official 
until a meeting of its international board on Wednesday, sources say McEntee has 
already notified other Democratic contenders that the union will join the SEIU 
in endorsing Dean. <p>"Dean has run the best campaign … but at the same time, 
he's dogged by a persistent critique that does not burden the other first-tier 
candidates — which is that he can't win," said one AFSCME official who asked not 
to be identified. "So the imprimatur of the two most politically active, most 
politically sophisticated unions … sort of handles that problem." <p>Rep. Richard 
A. Gephardt of Missouri still has the most support from organized labor. He's 
received endorsements from 20 unions with a total of roughly 5 million members. 
<p>But his aides acknowledge that the joint support from Stern and McEntee could 
inspire other unions to back Dean. These could include unions representing teachers, 
communications workers and electricians, Democratic and labor sources say. <p>"SEIU 
broke the dam, but as soon as AFSCME joins, because of [McEntee's] credibility, 
that all of a sudden puts the crown on Dean and someone is going to have to knock 
it off," said Coelho, who is neutral in the race. "You are going to see elected 
officials join, you are going to see other unions join; it is going to start a 
groundswell." <p>Regardless of whether other unions follow, the dual endorsements 
should boost Dean in the key early states. In Iowa, where polls have shown Dean 
locked in a close race with Gephardt, the AFSCME is one of the largest unions, 
with 28,000 members. In New Hampshire, where labor is weaker, the SEIU is perhaps 
the best-organized union. <p>The unions can do less for Dean in the next round 
of contests on Feb. 3, which occur mostly in nonunion Southern and Southwestern 
states, such as South Carolina, Oklahoma and Arizona. <p>But even if Dean stumbles 
in those contests, the union endorsements significantly improve his odds of reestablishing 
an advantage in mid-February showdowns in Michigan and Wisconsin, two states where 
labor is critical. <p>In Michigan, which will vote in a caucus that magnifies 
the importance of organization, the SEIU counts 45,000 members and the AFSCME 
60,000. They number a combined 70,000 members in Wisconsin. <p>Dean's expected 
decision to abandon the public financing system could also provide him an edge 
in the early contests. Under the system, candidates agree to spending limits in 
return for federal funds that match the first $250 of every contribution they 
receive. <p>Dean and his advisors have framed his expected withdrawal as a way 
to compete with Bush, who has already opted out of the system and aims to spend 
at least $175 million through the Republican convention in September. <p>Democrats 
who remain in the public financing system will be allowed to spend only $49 million 
through their convention in July. In all likelihood, the eventual winner will 
have to spend almost all that money to secure the nomination by March, leaving 
the candidate unable to raise or spend virtually anything from then until the 
convention. That's the prospect Dean has raised to justify leaving the system. 
<p>But opting out would also allow Dean to break the caps that limit how much 
candidates can spend during the primaries in individual states, such as Iowa and 
New Hampshire. That would mean Dean could spend more in those states than his 
rivals who stay within the system. <p>Given that prospect, several campaign finance 
reform advocates this week urged Dean to voluntarily abide by the spending limits 
for the primaries, even if he opts out of the public finance system. <p>Sen. Russell 
D. Feingold (D-Wis.) said Friday that by voluntarily accepting the limits, Dean 
could maintain a level playing field with the Democrats participating in the public 
system during the primaries but would preserve his ability to compete financially 
with Bush through the spring and summer if he wins the nomination. <p>"This would 
at least demonstrate that the decision to opt out is prompted by the president's 
unprecedented fund-raising and not a desire to overwhelm" other Democratic candidates. 
<p>On Friday, Kerry said that if he opted out of the system, he would not spend 
more than the total allowed during the primaries "until a nominee is effectively 
chosen." <p>Dean's camp said it is only beginning to consider those requests. 
<p>But with so many dominos falling his way, most observers consider it unlikely 
that Dean would accept any self-imposed limits that would inhibit his ability 
to strike a quick knockout blow. <p>A top advisor to one of his rivals said that 
given the financial and organizational resources flowing to Dean, "The truth is 
you are looking at a situation where if Dean wins Iowa and New Hampshire, everyone 
else is toast." <p ALIGN="CENTER">Copyright 2003 Los Angeles Times<p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable --></font></td></tr>
