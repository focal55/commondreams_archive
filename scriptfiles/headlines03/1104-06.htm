<p>BAGHDAD  - Insurgents fired at least three mortars  or rockets at the heart of the U.S.-led administration in the  Iraqi capital Baghdad on Tuesday, wounding four people in the  second brazen attack on the compound in as many nights.
<p> 
			
							The explosions shook the city, with the concussion felt by  reporters at a hotel on the opposite side of the river Tigris.<p> 
			
							American military combat casualties also climbed on Tuesday  to 252 since the invasion when a roadside bomb killed one  soldier and wounded two troops in Baghdad. British combat  deaths rose to 52 with the report of a Royal Marine killed by  hostile fire during a military operation last Friday.<p> 
			
							And in a setback to American hopes of stabilizing Iraq, key  political ally Spain said it was recalling some embassy and  other staff following last week's bombing of the Red Cross  headquarters and three police stations in Baghdad in which 35  people were killed.<p> 
			
							A U.S. army spokesman in Baghdad said there were three  blasts on Tuesday evening. He said the wounded were from  U.S.-occupation forces, although it was not known if they were  military.<p> 
			
							"Three were taken to hospital inside the green zone and one  was treated at the scene," said the spokesman.<p> 
			
							The blasts occurred inside the U.S.-controlled "green  zone," a sprawling area formerly home to one of Saddam  Hussein's palaces and which includes U.S. military bases and  the headquarters of the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA)  ruling Iraq, guards said.<p> 
			
							U.S.-led forces ousted Saddam in April.<p> 
			
							"There were a lot of soldiers running around, there was a  lot of panic," said Mohammad Shikri, the Iraqi guard at the  complex. Journalists were prevented from entering the area.<p> 
			
							Insurgents have shown increasing audacity in their attacks.<p> 
			
							On Monday, an explosion echoed across the city after dark,  followed by three mortar blasts near the CPA headquarters. No  casualties were reported in that attack.<p> 
			
							Guerrillas also fired rockets at a hotel inside the U.S.  complex on October 26 while Deputy Defense Secretary Paul  Wolfowitz was staying there, killing a U.S. soldier.<p> 
			
							The spokesman said he had no details on the precise  location of Tuesday's blasts. He said the CPA headquarters had  not been hit.<p> 
			
							Pentagon officials said initial reports suggested the  blasts might have been caused by missile or mortar fire.<p> 
			
							AID AGENCIES WITHDRAW STAFF<p> 
			
							The violence has forced aid agencies to withdraw foreign  staff.<p> 
			
							Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar said Spaniards being  withdrawn included some embassy staff and Spaniards working for  the governing body.<p> 
			
							"It's obviously because of security concerns," embassy  First Secretary Pablo Ruperez told Reuters. "This is Baghdad,  after all." He said the staff had already left for Jordan.<p> 
			
							A Spanish sergeant working at the embassy for his country's  National Intelligence Center, was shot dead near his Baghdad  home last month.<p> 
			
							In Iraq's northern city of Mosul, five rocket-propelled  grenades were fired at a hotel used as a U.S. military compound  but no one was hurt. Also in Mosul, gunmen on Tuesday killed a  second Iraqi judge in two days, police said. The first was in  southern Iraq.<p> 
			
							The Spanish action followed a promise by President Bush on  Monday that the United States would not run from what he called  its vital mission in Iraq.<p> 
			
							As Bush spoke, a powerful car bomb exploded outside a hotel  in the restive Shi'ite city of Kerbala, southwest of Baghdad,  killing at least two people. Angry residents blamed U.S. forces  for not doing enough to bring about peace and security.<p> 
			
							"The devil Saddam Hussein is gone. Now another devil is  back terrorizing us," said Idris Abed, a former army officer.<p> 
			
							"We are scared to walk the streets and we are not safe in  our homes. If security does not improve, there will be more  explosions and death in Kerbala."<p> 
			
							Bush's comments were his first since 15 soldiers were  killed when guerrillas shot down a CH-47 Chinook helicopter on  Sunday in the worst single attack against coalition forces  since the U.S. invasion.<p> 
			
							Bush on Monday gained U.S. Senate approval for his request  for $87.5 billion to finance U.S. occupation forces in Iraq and  Afghanistan and the rebuilding of Iraq through much of 2004.
