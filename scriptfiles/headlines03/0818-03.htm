<p>First they tried to bomb him, then they tried the offer of a reward. They even released images of what he might look like with no hair. 

<p>But now the US army would appear to be getting desperate with its latest ploy to catch Saddam Hussein: pictures of the elusive dictator as Hollywood sex goddess. 



<p>In a scheme likely to raise as many laughs among Iraq's hardline Islamic clerics as Salman Rushdie's The Satanic Verses, troops of the 4th Infantry brigade in Tikrit are planning to put up pictures around the town of Saddam's face superimposed on the bodies of a busty Veronica Lake, a slinky Zsa Zsa Gabor, a grooving Elvis and British-born rocker Billy Idol. 



<p>The aim, apparently, is to so enrage Saddam's followers that they will draw themselves out. 



<p>"We're going to do something devious with these," Lieutenant-Colonel Steve Russell told Reuters, referring to a range of spoof Saddam pictures taken from the internet site <a href="http://www.worth1000.com%20target=/" target="_new">www.worth1000.com</a>. 



<p>"Most of the locals will love 'em and they'll be laughing. But the bad guys are going to be upset, which will just make it easier for us to know who they are." 



<p>Col Russell, of the 1st Battalion, 22nd Regiment of the 4th Infantry Division, told the news agency he hoped to have the posters slapped up on walls around Tikrit from today. 



<p>However his plans might be thwarted by superiors in Baghdad. 



<p>"I think a lot of local people might find that offensive," a spokeswoman in Baghdad said. "I'm going to call them [the 4th ID] now and try and find out what's going on."
