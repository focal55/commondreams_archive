</table></font>Hundreds of thousands of well wishers are expected in the capital, Brasilia, for a day of celebration at the inauguration of Luis Inacio Lula da Silva; or Lula, as he is known.  

<P>It will be the first time for more than 40 years that an elected president has handed power to another in Latin America's largest country.  <P>After a year in which political crises in neighboring Venezuela and Argentina have been marked by violence, Brazil has become a beacon of moderation and peaceful social change for the continent.  

<P>Lula, a former lathe worker and union militant, will be the country's first working class president, heading the first leftwing government since before the 1964-85 military dictatorship.  <P>"One should not underestimate the change," Kenneth Maxwell of the Council on Foreign Relations in New York said. "Lula is someone from the 50% of the population that was always deprived. In a country of incredible inequality, this has to make his election a revolution."  <P>Since winning the election run-off in October Lula has used the two-month transition to assemble a socially diverse cabinet that includes several icons of political resistance and counter-culture.  <P>Marina Silva, a renowned environmentalist, the singer Gilberto Gil ,and Jose Dirceu, a Cuba-trained guerrilla, all have prominent positions.  <P>Benedita da Silva, a former Rio governor, is the first black woman to take charge of a ministry.  <P>"It is a very moving time. We are living a new experience," said Sergio Haddad, president of the Brazilian Association of NGOs. "The real Brazil is starting to appear - the people who built this country with sweat and blood. The government is national; it represents the diversity of Brazil."  <P>Lula's victory reflected a feeling that the free-market reforms of his predecessor, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, had failed to bring prosperity. More than a quarter of Brazilians live in poverty.  <P>He has said his priority will be to combat hunger, and that politics should be about improving social conditions rather than kowtowing to financial markets.  <P>Despite the variety of backgrounds in the cabinet, 23 of the 37 ministers come from Lula's Workers' party.  <P>Ministries have not been doled as bargaining chips to other parties, the way they usually are in Brazil.  <P>Jose Dirceu, Lula's chief of staff, said the new government represented Brazil's 1968 generation finally reaching power. Unlike in Europe, where 1968 ushered in an era of cultural freedom, in Brazil it led to the most austere years of the dictatorship. Gil, one of the musical voices of the resistance, was exiled in England.  <P>The Workers' party is 20 years old, born out of the anti-dictatorship militancy of the unions in the 70s. But it has softened its tone.  <P>Lula's secretary for development, trade and industry is Luiz Fernando Forlan, president of Brazil's biggest food company, Sadia. The agriculture secretary is Roberto Rodrigues, president of the Association of Agribusinesses.  <P>Lula inherits a country almost paralyzed by debt and with its currency under pressure from speculators. His main challenge in the first few months will be to avoid a potentially devastating crash.  

<P>But Riordan Roett, director of the Western Hemisphere Program at Johns Hopkins University in Washington, said the government was unlikely to make any rash changes.  

<P>"I see it as the soul of moderation. Fiscal surplus will be maintained. The IMF package is sacrosanct. Lula made balanced cabinet appointments. He said no to the request of the governors to renegotiate state debt. So far so good."<P><B><U>Who's who</U></B><P><B> Jose Dirceu, Chief of Staff</B><BR>Exiled in 1969 in exchange for the freedom of the US ambassador Charles Elbrick, who had been kidnapped.
