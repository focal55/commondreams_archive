<p>US troops yesterday unleashed their most furious attack in Iraq since the official 
end of the war. The attacks, which happened in Saddam Hussein's home town of Tikrit, 
were carried out in response to the killing of six soldiers whose Black Hawk helicopter 
was shot down near the town on Friday. <p>As F16s jets dropped 500lb bombs on 
the area where the helicopter was shot down, US troops launched a massive sweep 
operation, designed as a show of force against resistance fighters based in the 
Sunni Triangle, which saw the arrest of several dozen alleged fighters and the 
death of five more. <p>Last night a loud explosion echoed across Baghdad. The 
sound came from the West bank of the Tigris River, where the coaltion has its 
headquarters. It follows mortar attacks on the complex earlier in the week. <p>The 
US assault follows a sharp escalation in attacks by the Iraqi guerrillas on US 
targets, which have claimed 34 American lives in the first seven days of November, 
equivalent to the total fatalities in all of October. <p>But any hope that the 
sweep - named Operation Ivy Cyclone - would steady nerves in Iraq was almost immediately 
demolished by the news that the International Committee of the Red Cross was taking 
the drastic step of closing its offices in Baghdad and Basra because of the rapidly 
worsening security situation. <p>The organisation had already announced that it 
was reducing the number of its international staff after the bombing of its headquarters 
in Baghdad on 27 October in which 12 people died. <p>The decision to close its 
offices in Baghdad and Basra, however, is a blow to an organisation that prides 
itself on being able to continue working in the worst of conflict situations. 
'We are discussing what to do with our foreign staff. The situation is dangerous 
and volatile,' ICRC spokesman Florian Westphal said. <p>Despite the US military 
operation, however, lethal attacks on US forces continued yesterday with two US 
paratroopers killed in the Sunni Triangle town of Falluja when a roadside bomb 
exploded under their vehicle. <p>Amid suspicions that the bombing raids were designed 
as much for domestic US consumption as out of operational necessity, a coalition 
spokesman announced that it had also captured 12 people suspected of involvement 
in a deadly attack on a Baghdad hotel where US Deputy Defence Secretary Paul Wolfowitz 
was staying. <p>Military officers said the operation involved raids on several 
locations. They said they believed they had broken up a cell of former regime 
figures which included a financier, a supplier and operatives. <p>The arrests 
and the launch of Operation Ivy Cyclone came, however, amid more bad news for 
the Bush administration over its handling of post-war Iraq. <p>An official US 
army review leaked to the US NGO globalsecurity.org has revealed that the army 
had no plan for the occupation of Baghdad. <p>Officially titled the Third Infantry 
Division (Mechanised) After Action Report, Operation Iraqi Freedom, the study 
provides the first formal internal view of the Iraq war from the point of view 
of the soldiers who brought down Saddam Hussein. <p>The report provides official 
confirmation of a complete absence of high-level military and political planning 
to manage the aftermath of victory and indicates some key problems that continue 
to hamper US army effectiveness to this day. <p>Some of the lack of planning first 
became apparent at Baghdad International Airport (BIA): 'Multiple military and 
inter-agency organisations vied to set up operations at BIA, but the (3rd Infantry) 
Brigade Combat Team controlling BIA was too engaged in continu ing combat operations 
to coordinate this adequately.' <p>The report continues that the 3rd Infantry 
Division itself, which had been engaged in some of the heaviest fighting on the 
outskirts of Baghdad, 'lacked guidance' on how to deal with the different competing 
Iraqis they encountered. 'Ongoing struggles for power, establishing security without 
the benefit of a functioning police system, and re-establishing a pay system for 
government workers continue to plague the restoration of "normalcy" to Baghdad,' 
it said. <p>The report comes amid mounting criticism of the way the Bush administration 
has handled the aftermath of the invasion. US hopes that up to 10,000 Turkish 
troops would be deployed to bolster the US effort were dashed on Friday when Turkey 
decided not to send troops into Iraq. <p ALIGN="CENTER">&copy; Guardian Newspapers
