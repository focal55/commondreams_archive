<p>Guasimas, Mexico -- Mike McGettigan, an American sportfisherman and diver, 
has been drawn to the rugged beauty and marine-rich waters of the Gulf of California 
for 30 years. <p>"I've watched it go from the richest sea I've ever swam in to 
the deadest sea I've ever swam in," said McGettigan, who founded the environmental 
watchdog group Sea Watch in 1994 to help focus attention on the waters, also known 
as the Sea of Cortez. <p>Destructive fishing practices, poor resource management, 
unclear regulations and official corruption have turned him into a born-again 
conservationist. <p>The sea, which has long enchanted such writers as John Steinbeck 
and Edward Abbey, is home to 875 fish species and 30 species of marine mammals. 
Nearly half the world's cetaceans, including whales and porpoises, migrate to 
the gulf to give birth in its warm, plankton-rich waters. Baja California towns 
such as Cabo San Lucas, La Paz and Loreto thrive on tourists, many of whom are 
Californians. <p>But in recent years, Mexican commercial fishermen searching for 
sailfish, tuna, marlin, billfish and dorado (mahi-mahi) have decimated marine 
life with "longlines" that can stretch up to 50 miles and hold thousands of baited 
hooks. <p>And smaller boats use gill nets -- large nylon webs that are banned 
by the European Union and the United States. Gill nets are legal in Mexico with 
a special permit, and longlines are legal to buy, sell and own but illegal to 
use. <p>Overfishing has affected not only the marine environment but the local 
economy -- an estimated 150,000 families earn their livelihood from the Sea of 
Cortez. "If it weren't for the (maquiladora export) factories, there would be 
no work for young people because there aren't any fish," said 79-year-old Hilario 
Amarillas, founder of a Yaqui Indian fishing cooperative in Guasimas, a village 
on the gulf's northeastern coast. <p>Some critics blame former President Carlos 
Salinas, who deregulated Mexican commercial fishing in 1992 without creating an 
effective system of licensing and permits. At least 12,000 unregulated fishing 
boats ply the Sea of Cortez, according to federal officials. <p>Faced with the 
prospect of a dying sea, an unlikely alliance of American conservationists, Mexican 
marine biologists, local residents and sport fishermen have pressured the Mexican 
government to enforce the nation's law against unlicensed boats and longlines 
that entrap sharks, sea turtles, sea lions, manta rays and porpoises along with 
the legal catch. There is no penalty for an "incidental" catch in Mexican law. 
<p>John Brakey, executive director of the U.S.-Mexico Friends of the Sea of Cortez, 
estimates that 6,000 shrimp fishermen use 13,000 gill nets. Most use small, flat-bottomed 
boats called pangas, and only one-third are legally registered, he says. <p>Carlos 
Villavicencia, a marine biologist at the Autonomous University of Southern Baja 
California in La Paz, estimates that the shark population in the Sea of Cortez 
has declined between 70 and 80 percent in the past two decades. <p>Wallace J. 
Nichols, a turtle researcher and co-director of WILDCOAST, a California-based 
conservation team, says some 40,000 turtles are killed annually by nets or poachers. 
Moreover, the Vaquita porpoise, which is endemic to the Gulf of California, has 
dwindled to less than 600, according to Lorenzo Rojas, coordinator of Mexico's 
Conservation Program at the National Ecology Institute. The world's smallest porpoise, 
it is on the World Conservation Union's most critically endangered list. <p>Between 
July and September, gill nets captured international headlines after five whales 
were found trapped at different locations in the Sea of Cortez. Among them were 
a mother sperm whale found by sport fishermen 30 miles from the tourist town of 
San Carlos entangled in a net near her dead calf, which had died from hunger after 
being unable to nurse. <p>American fisherman Mark Ward heard the cries of the 
mother whale and jumped in with just a mask, snorkel and knife to free her. When 
he also became entangled in the net underwater, he tried to saw his leg off until 
the netting suddenly unraveled. He swam to safety and saved his leg. The whale 
swam off trailing the net. <p>Jose Alfredo Bahena, an official for Sonora's National 
Commission of Aquaculture and Fishing, says his state is so strapped for resources 
that it monitors fishermen by borrowing their boats. And Luis Fueyo, Mexico's 
top official for protection of the marine environment, says he has only 120 inspectors 
to patrol Mexico's 6,835 miles of coastline and more than one million square miles 
of ocean. <p>"The Sea of Cortez is like the wild, wild West," said Vince Redence, 
owner of the Sonoran Sport Center in San Carlos. "You can do anything you want 
and the odds that someone will stop you are one in a hundred." <p>Environmentalists 
say corruption makes it difficult to regulate the fishing industry. They point 
to official waivers to catch shark called "experimental permits" that allow longlines 
inside Mexico's 50-mile noncommercial fishing zone. They say it is a ploy to catch 
dorado and billfish and fill the pockets of corrupt officials, who solicit bribes 
in exchange for the permits. <p>Jose Carlos Jimenez, secretary for the Senate 
Commission on Environment, Natural Resources and Fishing, said enforcement of 
Mexican law is a question of "political will," adding that "personal economic 
interests by some officials make chaos and loose regulation a desirable situation." 
<p>"The fishing fleet places and removes governors," said Villavicencia. <p>Nevertheless, 
U.S. and Mexican conservation groups say their political allies are increasing. 
The governor of Baja California Sur, Leonel Cota, has agreed to create a joint 
commission with the federal government to improve management of Baja's waters. 
Cota has also offered subsidized gasoline to fishermen who register their boats. 
<p>And in another move that has delighted conservationists, Jeronimo Ramos, the 
director of the National Commission of Marine Culture and Fishing (CONAPESCA), 
was removed from his post in September. Critics had accused Ramos of kowtowing 
to the fishing lobby. <p>The Sea of Cortez "has been beaten to death," said Donald 
Thomson, professor emeritus at the University of Arizona Ecological and Evolutionary 
Biology Department. "It's still kicking, but it needs a lot of help." <p ALIGN="CENTER">©2003
