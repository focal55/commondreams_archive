<p>BOSTON - Peace vigils and rallies against

war in Iraq are taking place out in U.S. towns and cities,

drawing hundreds of thousands of participants.<p></p> Student strikes are disrupting college campuses, where old

protest anthems like &quot;We Shall Overcome&quot; mix with the tinny

sound of speeches belted out over load hailers.<p></p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><table border=0 align=right hspace=5 cellpadding=6 width="350">

</table></font>The scene may resemble the Vietnam-era U.S. student

movement. But scratch the surface and it soon becomes clear that

this peace push is strikingly different from that of the 1960s

when it was a movement of the young, of university students and

of those on the political left.<p></p> Participants in current anti-war protests cut across the

spectrum of ages, races and backgrounds and include many who

would consider themselves mainstream Americans. They are joining

more predictable crowds of college students, environmentalists,

socialists, anarchists and other activists.<p></p> John Llewellyn, a 45-year-old computer industry worker from

Knoxville, Tennessee, is among the tens of thousands of people

who turned up at a recent anti-war protest in Boston -- the

city's biggest demonstration in at least 30 years.<p></p> A former &quot;long-time Republican,&quot; Llewellyn said he had never

protested against anything in his life and admitted he did not

fit the mould of an anti-war activist, but said President George

W. Bush's policies had gone too far.<p></p> &quot;It's gotten to the point that it's scary,&quot; said Llewellyn,

who was visiting Boston with his family.<p></p> NOT THE 'USUAL SUSPECTS'<p></p> Although turnout at anti-war rallies has been strong, polls

show that most Americans support the war in Iraq.<p></p> Still, many of Llewellyn's fellow protesters said the war

has stirred something within them that had lain dormant for

decades and, in some cases, their entire lives.<p></p> &quot;This is the first time I have ever done something like

this,&quot; said 66-year-old Jung Ming Wu of Acton, Massachusetts, as

he gathered with thousands of other protesters gathered in a

park in Boston. &quot;It's very emotional.&quot;<p></p> Victoria Carter a 46-year-old actuary, said her appearance

at the Boston rally was her first since taking part in an

anti-apartheid protest decades ago.<p></p> &quot;I usually trust the government, but this time it's

different,&quot; said Carter, who lives in the Boston area.<p></p> Eli Pariser, the international campaigns director of

MoveOn.org (http://moveon.org), an online political network that

claims more than 1.3 million U.S. members and another 700,000

around the world, said many of those involved are not &quot;the usual

suspects.&quot;<p></p> &quot;They're ordinary folks who often have never been

politically involved before and consider themselves patriots,&quot;

said Pariser, who is based in New York. &quot;But they feel so

alarmed by the direction the country is going and possible

consequences of war that they feel like they have to get

involved.&quot;<p></p> The participation of many middle of the road Americans is no

accident. Some anti-war groups have consciously reached out to

the mainstream by avoiding some of the more strident rhetoric

and confrontational tactics of recent left-wing campaigns such

as the anti-globalisation protests at the Seattle World Trade

Organisation talks four years ago.<p></p> Some anti-war strategists have strived to cast their cause

as a patriotic one that loyal Americans can embrace as part of

the country's moral conscience.<p></p> TECHNOLOGICAL BOOST<p></p> Technology also aids their cause.<p></p> Armed with e-mails and the power of the Internet, anti-war

activists organise protests in hours, not the days or weeks it

took their predecessors. One of their tactics before the war

began involved bombarding the White House and Congress with

electronic mail and faxes in a bid to block telephone lines.<p></p> Joseph Gerson, a 56-year-old Boston-based pacifist, marvels

at the speed at which rallies are put together, and he envies

the breadth of information available to protesters online.<p></p> &quot;I spent a big part of the Vietnam War era organising

anti-war protests in Arizona. We were pretty isolated. There was

a right-wing monopoly newspaper, and we were dependent on what

outside speakers would bring in or what we got in the mail. That

was slow,&quot; said Gerson, a former classmate of Bill Clinton at

Georgetown University in the 1960s.<p></p> Gerson said he is stunned by how quickly the anti-war

movement has grown, noting that it took years to reach a

critical mass of people opposed to the conflict in Vietnam.<p></p> New York has already seen two demonstrations within five

weeks numbering in the hundreds of thousands -- a broad

coalition of 200 groups under the umbrella of United for Peace

and Justice.<p></p> RE-ENERGISED STUDENTS<p></p> Part of the movement's strength, Gerson said, comes from a

newly energised student base -- a big shift from the

economically booming '90s that generally kept a lid on campus

activism.<p></p> &quot;The students who are coming out to demonstrations...are

rediscovering their political power,&quot; he said. &quot;They are

learning lessons about American society and about democracy that

have been submerged for the last decade.&quot;<p></p> Further distinguishing the present peace drive is the

absence of a draft that sucked a generation of American men into

military service and served as a major catalyst for the peace

movement of the late '60s.<p></p> In place of the draft, Gerson said, is a sense of &quot;straight

altruism&quot; shared by people who are simply concerned about their

country's future.<p></p> Stephen Nathanson, a philosophy professor at Northeastern

University and a former Vietnam-era peace activist, said many

current demonstrators are also more comfortable with their sense

of patriotism.<p></p> &quot;In the '60s, people just accepted that if they were against

the war, they were going to be anti-patriotic,&quot; Nathanson said.

&quot;Now, people seem to understand that you can oppose the war

because you're patriotic. People who oppose the war actually

think it's bad for the country, that it will make the country

unsafe.&quot;<p></p> Joshua Jackson, an anti-war organiser at Hampshire College

in western Massachusetts, said activism is not confined to

&quot;lefty&quot; college towns like Madison, Wisconsin, or Berkeley,

California, -- and it goes beyond the free-love, drug-happy

flower power of the late '60s.<p></p> &quot;Sure there are punk rockers and hippies taking part,&quot; he

said. &quot;But this is not a counter-cultural movement: You're

seeing a lot of 'normal' people involved with this.&quot;</P>
