<p>LOS ANGELES   - This is the way the world might  end: A genetically engineered pathogen is released, debris from  an erupting "supervolcano" blocks the sun or scientists in the  biggest "bioerror" of them all accidentally trigger a  matter-squeezing "big bang."<P>
The demise of civilization has been predicted since it  began, but the odds of keeping Planet Earth alive and well are  getting worse amid a breakneck pace of scientific advances,  according to Martin Rees, Britain's honorary astronomer royal.<P>
Rees calculates that the odds of an apocalyptic disaster  striking Earth have risen to about 50 percent from 20 percent a  hundred years ago.<P>
The 60-year-old scientist, author of the recently published  "Our Final Hour," says science is advancing in a far more  unpredictable and potentially dangerous pattern than ever  before.<P>
He lists as mankind's biggest threats: nuclear terrorism,  deadly engineered viruses, rogue machines and genetic  engineering that could alter human character. All of those  could result from innocent error or the action of a single  malevolent individual.<P>
By 2020, an instance of bioterror or bioerror will have  killed a million people, Rees contends.<P>
"There is a growing gap between doors that are open and  doors that should be open," Rees, a professor at Britain's  Cambridge University, said in a recent interview.<P>
The cosmologist concedes that natural disasters have always  loomed -- so-called supervolanoes could explode at any time and  asteroids could slam into the planet, causing massive climate  changes -- but says the most frightening risks are probably  man-made.<P>
"A hundred years ago, the nuclear threat wasn't even  predicted ... but that threat still hasn't gone away," he said.<P>
The arms race, after all, was fueled by science, and the  field has a responsibility to inform a wide public of the risks  in deciding how to apply scientific breakthroughs, he added.<P>
BIOTECHNOLOGY COULD CHANGE HUMAN NATURE<P>
"For the first time ever, human nature itself isn't fixed.  Biotech drugs and genetic engineering are empowering  individuals more than ever before," Rees said.<P>
With rapidly advancing DNA technology, "even a single  person could cause a disaster," Rees warned, noting that the  United States, after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and anthrax  scare, is well aware of this threat.<P>
Thousands of people have the ability to engineer viruses  and bacteria to cause deadly plagues. Even if one such "weirdo"  didn't kill many people, that type of biological terrorism  would profoundly change daily life, the scientist warned.<P>
Nanotechnology -- the subject of a recent Michael Crichton  thriller about the havoc caused by runaway microscopic machines  -- are also a potent threat, he said.<P>
If the field advances far enough, rogue self-replicating  nanotechnology machines -- feeding on organic material and  spreading like pollen -- could devastate a continent within a  few days, Rees said.<P>
The dangers of global warming are also addressed in the  book, subtitled "A scientist's warning: How terror, error, and  environmental disaster threaten humankind's future in this  century -- on Earth and beyond."
<P>
Rees does not discount the possibility of disaster caused  by scientific experiments involving particle accelerators.  "Perhaps a black hole could form, and then suck in everything  around it," he cautions.
<P>
So what's to be done?<P>
The British scientist calls for better regulation and  inspection of sensitive data and experiments.<P>
"We need to keep track of those who have potentially lethal  knowledge," Rees said.<P>
He also suggested better efforts to "reduce the number of  people who feel excluded or otherwise motivated to cause harm."
