<p>JERUSALEM—A secret peace pact few have actually seen caused a furor among Israelis and Palestinians yesterday, with reaction ranging from fury to ecstasy.<P></P>The so-called Geneva Accord was completed late yesterday by a team of left-wing Israelis and a group of Palestinian political leaders in Amman, Jordan, after more than two years of backtrack negotiations shepherded by Swiss diplomats.<P></P>The 50-page document, said to detail point-by-point agreement on every political obstacle, carries no official weight. <P></P>
Yet its impact was immediate, triggering a furor on all fronts of the Israeli political establishment and prompting some careful backpedaling in the Palestinian media.
<P></P>Prime Minister Ariel Sharon called the gambit "the greatest historical mistake since Oslo," referring to the 1993 Oslo accords.<P></P>Former prime minister Ehud Barak, the Israeli partner in the failed peace negotiations that led to the outbreak of violent intifada, dismissed the plan as "delusional."<P></P>Much of the Israeli criticism focused on Yossi Beilin, the former Israeli cabinet minister and avowed left-wing activist who led the Israeli side of negotiations. Beilin's influence in the Israeli political sphere is peripheral, at best, with much of the country's right-wing electorate holding him personally responsible for leading Israel into the failed Oslo process.<P></P>Beilin and his Palestinian counterpart, former Palestinian Authority cabinet minister Yasser Abed Rabbo, who were in Cairo yesterday to brief Egyptian officials on the draft agreement, defended their efforts during a briefing for reporters.<P></P>"The Palestinian Authority supports our initiative," Rabbo told reporters, without elaborating.<P></P>Beilin predicted the document will "make a big revolution" in the Middle East by garnering popular support sufficient to end the three-year cycle of violence and force both parties back to formal negotiations.<P></P>It remains to be seen how the Israeli and Palestinian public will respond to the document.<P></P>Israeli media reports said the main thrust of the plan, as yet unpublished, runs as follows:
<P>
  <ul>
  <li>Palestinian refugees will concede the right of return to Israel in exchange for financial compensation.<br>
  </li>
    <li> The Palestinians will recognize Israel as the state of the Jewish people.<br>
    </li>
    <li></img>Israel will withdraw to the borders of 1967, with certain territorial exchanges in which several major Jewish settlement blocks in the West Bank will become part of Israel, while Israel will cede equivalent territories in its southern Negev desert.<br>
    </li>
    <li></img>Jerusalem will be divided by nationality, with Arab neighborhoods becoming part of the Palestinian state and Jewish neighborhoods remaining part of Israel.<br>
    </li>
    <li></img>The Western Wall will remain under Israeli sovereignty, while the Temple Mount above it, known to Muslims as Haram al-Sharif, will be under Palestinian sovereignty. An international force will ensure freedom of worship for all faiths.<br>
    </li>
    <li></img>The Palestinians will pledge to prevent terror and incitement and disarm all militias. An international force will supervise the demilitarized state, including border crossings.
        </li>
</ul>  <P></P>
    Mohamed Sid Ahmed, commentator with the Egyptian government daily Al-Ahram, hailed the plan as a possible last hope for peace.
      <P></P>
"    The situation is so catastrophic that the choice now is between terrorism and this kind of agreement, because the `road map' does not work," he told AFP.
      <P></P>
    Meanwhile, dozens of Israeli tanks entered the Rafah refugee camp before dawn today, just days after another incursion into the Gaza site left eight dead and hundreds homeless.
      <P></P>
    There were no immediate reports of casualties in today's operation.
      <P></P>
    In Gaza City yesterday, Palestinian President Yasser Arafat delivered yet another blow to his new prime minister yesterday, appointing an acting security chief in the face of Ahmed Qureia's intense opposition.
      <P></P>
    Hakam Balawi, a senior member of Arafat's Fatah Central Committee, will take on the interior ministry.
