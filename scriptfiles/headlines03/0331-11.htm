</table></font>The shooting occurred at a checkpoint manned by soldiers from the US Army's Third Infantry Division at Najaf, 150 kilometers (95 miles) south of Baghad on Monday afternoon, Navy Lieutenant Commander Charles Owens said here.



<p>He said the victims, women and children, were in a vehicle that failed to stop despite repeated warning shots fired by US troops. Four people in the vehicle escaped unharmed.



<p>"As a last resort, they (US troops) fired into the passenger compartment of the vehicle," Owens said at US Central Command's forward planning base here.



<p>"When soldiers opened the vehicle they found 13 women and children inside. Seven of the occupants were dead, two were wounded and four were unharmed."



<p>Owens said an investigation had been opened.
