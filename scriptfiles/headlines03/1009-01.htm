<p>A <a href="http://www.controlarms.org/index.htm">campaign against the world arms trade</a> is being launched by the charities Oxfam and Amnesty International. 
<p>They argue the trade is out of control and that Britain and America have, if anything, relaxed their control since 11 September as they seek allies in the war on terror. 
<p>The charities' campaign for much stricter controls follows protests against Europe's largest arms fair, held in London's Docklands last month. 

<p>The government says Britain has a good track record on arms sales and will introduce new legislation later this month to control technology transfers and the activities of arms brokers.

  </table></font>Governments collectively spend more than £442bn ($700bn) on their armed forces every year and official annual arms sales are valued at up to £18.9bn ($30bn). 


<p>Oxfam and Amnesty International claim the proliferation of arms is unacceptable and are launching a hugely ambitious campaign, says BBC defense correspondent Paul Adams. 

<p><b>Stricter controls </b>
<p>At its heart is a call for a legally binding arms trade treaty within three years. 

<p>It is not a move to ban the trade, but to adopt stricter controls, across regions and in local communities. 

<p>The charities claim that national arms export controls are riddled with loopholes. 


<p>They say: "The easy availability of arms increases the incidence of armed violence, acts as a trigger for conflicts, and prolongs wars once they break out." 

<p><b>'Awash with guns' </b>
<p>As part of the campaign, organizers aim to create a "<a href="http://www.controlarms.org/million_faces/index.php/register?language=en" target="_new">Million Faces</a>" petition. 

<p>Campaigner Richard Stanforth from Oxfam said: "From Birmingham to Bogota the global arms trade is out of control. 

<p>"There are more regulations on the music industry than on arms traders." 

<p>Campaign supporter James Omunson said: "The village I grew up in Sudan is now completely awash with guns, even children as young as nine carry weapons in Torit. 

<p>"I urge all governments to sign up to an Arms Trade Treaty to control weapons sales in Torit and Birmingham alike." 

<p><b>'Stifling development' </b>
<p>Government officials say they applaud the campaign's intentions, but argue it is only likely to succeed if all the major players including Britain, the United States and Russia sign up. 

<p>The Bush administration on recent showing, seems an unlikely supporter, says Adams. 

<p>He says the world is awash with arms, with hundreds of millions of weapons scattering the globe and killing, stifling development, spreading poverty and disease. 

<p>Despite UN programs, regional codes of conduct and domestic legislation far too many weapons end up in places where for reasons of embargos or human rights, they should not, he adds. 


<p>The major companies making weapons include USA firms Lockheed Martin, Boeing and Raytheon, BAE Systems in the UK and French company Thales.
