<p>A band of Iraqi army officers took to the streets of Baghdad to protest their plight since the dissolution of the army by the US-led administration in Iraq, warning of further protests and even suicide bombings if their situation was not reconciled.

<p>"We demand the speedy establishment of a government, the return of security, the rehabilitation of public institutions and the payment of wages to all soldiers," former general Saheb al-Mussawi said in an address to around 100 former officers in central Baghdad.

</table></font>"If our demands are not respected, next Monday will mark the date of the break between the Iraqi army and people on one side and the occupiers on the other," he said in reference to US-led coalition troops.

<p>"All soldiers and their families will protest peacefully in Baghdad and other towns on Monday from 10 am (0600 GMT)."

<p>The protesting band of officers carried banners saying "Better to have the throat slit than revenues confiscated. The Iraqi army demands its rights!", and "The Iraqi army is the army of the people and the nation!"

<p>"Death, death so Iraq can live!" they chanted.

<p>Former colonel Ahmed Abdullah told AFP: "If our position is not settled, we threaten to take up arms."

<p>"We are soldiers used to combat and we have volunteers for martyrdom," warned former lieutenant colonel Ziad Khalaf in reference to suicide bombers.

<p>"We will take back by force what we have lost by force," Khalaf said.

<p>The civilian occupation administration headed by Paul Bremer announced Friday that Saddam's former army and vast security apparatus, along with the defense and information ministries, had all been abolished.

<p>A "non-political" army is to be created in its place.

<p>Tensions between US-led occupation authorities and Iraqis also came to the fore on the political front as the government in the country's second-largest city was dismissed amid rising popular discontent.

<p>British forces announced they would replace a Basra city council that had been hailed as a model of post-war cooperation with a committee of technocrats chaired by a British military commander in order to make it non-political.

<p>The decision provoked an angry reaction from the 30-member council, which is headed by a local tribal chief and has labored to re-establish civic order in the southern metropolis.

<p>And in the northern city of Kirkuk, a US commander risked raising local Arab hackles when he swore in six members of the local council whose nominations had been contested on grounds they were mostly from the majority Kurdish community.

<p>Former Iraqi regime officials, meanwhile, said the sudden fall of Baghdad on April 9 was the result of acts of betrayal by three of president Saddam Hussein's cousins, senior military officers, and a former cabinet minister.

<p>According to the officials, Saddam's cousins ordered troops not to fight against the US-led coalition and issued reports saying that the Iraqi leader was dead.
<p>"The head of the Republican Guard Maher Sufian al-Tikriti, who was considered the shadow of Saddam, told the troops not to fight when US forces entered Baghdad on April 8," one of the sources said on condition of anonymity.

<p>At the same time a rumor that Saddam was killed in the bombing of the Baghdad neighborhood of Al-Mansur on April 7 began to spread among government members.

<p>The information was spread by a cabinet minister, the source said, refusing to identify him. "This minister was then evacuated by American troops along with his family and now lives in a European country."

<p>And since the war, Saddam's elder son Uday has tried to contact US occupation officials in Baghdad through an intermediary to negotiate a safe surrender, Time magazine reported in its latest edition.

<p>The International Committee of the Red Cross, meanwhile, paid its first visit to prisoners held by the coalition in the Baghdad region, including many from the most-wanted list of 55 former Iraqi leaders.

<p>The US military said Sunday it had captured a suspected ringleader behind attacks on coalition troops in the flashpoint Iraqi city of Fallujah, west of Baghdad, and nabbed 17 others.

<p>In the campaign to make post-war Baghdad a safer place, the US military said it had hauled another 58 tons of ammunition out of the capital.

<p>But a US soldier was killed and a second injured in an explosion Sunday at a site in the southern city of Diwaniyah where Iraqi ammunition had been stored, the military said.
