<p>WASHINGTON, Sept. 26 — After working hand-in-hand with President Bush on education and health programs, Senator Edward M. Kennedy is digging in for a fight over Iraq, calling it the "defining issue" of this congressional session.</p>
<P>
Mr. Kennedy, to many the personification of the liberal Democrat, has rendered a harsh judgment against the Bush administration with caustic statements that began last week and continued today. At every turn, and with rising passion, he has blistered the White House for its calculation to go to war and for failing to adequately plan for the occupation.</p>
<P>
Today, at an event sponsored by the Congressional Black Caucus, Mr. Kennedy ridiculed a 28-page planning document on Iraq produced by the administration, calling it an insult and tossing it into the air. </p>
<P>
Later, on the Senate floor, he said, "The tragedy is that our troops are paying with their lives because the administration failed to prepare a plan to win the peace."</p>
<P>
Those comments were only slightly toned down from remarks Mr. Kennedy made last week when he called the rationale for the war a "fraud" and said taxpayer money was being used to bribe foreign leaders to send troops to Iraq. </p>
<P>
Taken together, the senator's remarks have cooled what had been a surprisingly good working relationship with Mr. Bush.</p>
<P>
President Bush and Senator Kennedy produced an education program in the president's first year, and in recent months they had worked together to advance a prescription drug plan. Only a few weeks ago, Mr. Kennedy attended a private bill-signing at the White House and the two members of America's leading political families had a cordial meeting, aides said. </p>
<P>
But Mr. Bush has characterized Mr. Kennedy's remarks on Iraq  as "uncivil." </p>
<P>
Senator Robert F. Bennett, Republican of Utah, said of Mr. Kennedy, "He is flat wrong.</p>
<P>
"To accuse the president of what is essentially an impeachable offense, to use those words, demonstrates a willingness to recklessness that is very disturbing," he said.</p>
<P>
But today Mr. Kennedy received unequivocal support when he lashed out at the administration during his appearance at the Congressional Black Caucus. Those attending embraced Mr. Kennedy and applauded his stand. "You have nothing to apologize for because you are telling the truth," said the Rev. Al Sharpton, who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination.</p>
<P>
Republicans say the  criticism of the administration shows Mr. Kennedy at his worst, grabbing the spotlight to promote outdated liberal ideals. </p>
<P>
"The debate comes down to one question," said Stuart Roy, a spokesman for House Majority Leader Tom DeLay. "Are we a nation at war with terror or are we longing for a return to the weak and indecisive foreign policy of the past?" </p>
<P>
Some Democrats say privately that Mr. Kennedy probably went too far when he talked of bribes and fraud. But his allies say these are not spur-of-the-moment statements. His aides say he has been consulting  a variety of experts, including former Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and the United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan. </p>
<P>
Mr. Kennedy, who  with Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia unsuccessfully led Democratic opposition to the resolution authorizing the invasion of Iraq, said that he has been consistent in his position and that more Americans are coming to his view.</p>
<P>
"There is an increasing kind of awareness and understanding among the American people that we need a plan that brings in other countries and the U.N., and provides full disclosure with regards to contracts,"  Mr. Kennedy said. "And we need to pay for it without harming the priorities at home."</p>
<P>
His colleagues say Mr. Kennedy, with more than 40 years in the Senate and national image, can easily shrug off criticism that could deter others. </p>
<P>
"It is somebody who is leading the way, standing up in a difficult situation, speaking bluntly and forcefully," said Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island. "It sort of reaffirms the positions we took last fall.</p>
<P>
"Also, he tends to get a little more attention than we do."</p>
