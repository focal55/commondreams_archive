<p>WASHINGTON  - British Airways said on Monday that
none of its pilots made contact with President Bush's plane
during its secret flight to Baghdad, contradicting White House
reports of a mid-air exchange that nearly prompted Bush to call
off his trip.

<p>
 Honor Verrier, a spokeswoman for British Airways in North
America, said two BA aircraft were in the area at the time and
neither radioed the president's plane to ask if it was Air
Force One.
<p>
 "We have spoken to the British Airways captains who were in
the area at the time and neither made comments to Air Force One
nor did they hear any other aircraft make the statement over
the radio," Verrier said in response to a question from
Reuters.
<p>
 The White House had no immediate comment on the
discrepancy.
<p>
 Bush aides recounted with excitement last week the moment
during the flight to Baghdad when they said a BA pilot thought
he spotted the president's blue and white Boeing 747 from his
cockpit.
<p>
 "Did I just see Air Force One?" the pilot radioed,
according to the White House.
<p>
 There was a pause. Then came the response from Air Force
One: "Gulfstream 5" -- a much smaller aircraft.
<p>
 As one of Bush's aides recounted, the BA pilot seemed to
sense that he was in on a secret, and replied: "Oh."
<p>
 The exchange was one of the most suspenseful moments during
Bush's secret flight to Baghdad, according to the White House.
<p>
 With three hours to go, Bush had the Secret Service check
if his mission was still secret.
<p>
 "They assured me that there was still a tight hold on the
information, that conditions on the ground were as positive as
positive could be," he said afterward.
