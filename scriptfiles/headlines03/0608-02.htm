<p>In Iraq, a country ringed by desert and often seared by 110-degree heat, 
no commodity matters more than water.
<P>Its delivery to homes, businesses and fields used to be the province of 
Saddam Hussein's government. Now, as U.S. forces rebuild the country, debate 
is growing over who should control the tap.
<P>Should Iraq's water system remain in public hands as a state-run utility? 
Or should private companies -- Iraqi or foreign -- run it?

</table>The same questions hang over Iraq's other basic utilities -- its power grid 
and sewage system. Although San Francisco's Bechtel Corp. is now working to 
repair them, all will need serious long-term investment for the country to 
thrive. Some experts see private management as a way to pump money into those 
utilities.
<P>And yet the thought of privatizing such basic human needs raises fears that 
the people of Iraq will lose control over their own resources. Much like the 
debate over oil, arguments about utility privatization reflect fears that 
Iraq's reconstruction will turn into a great grab -- with a few people or 
corporations seizing the country's key assets.
<P>Federal officials, aware of the emotions this issue stokes, say a decision 
on Iraq's utilities must wait until an interim Iraqi government takes charge.
<P>"That question speaks to the very heart of how we deal with the Iraqi 
people," said Ellen Yount, spokeswoman for the U.S. Agency for Overseas 
Development. "Obviously, the goal with all of these things is not to have top-
down decisions, but decisions made by the Iraqi people."
<P>Battered by war and stripped by looters, Iraq's utilities are in desperate 
need of repair.
<P>Power plants still in operation supply a fraction of the electricity the 
country needs. A Bechtel spokesman who recently toured southern Iraq described 
electrical systems kept running only through the skill of Iraqi engineers 
forced to improvise without needed spare parts. Families have been storing 
water in old barrels rather than rely on water systems that sometimes don't 
work.
<P>Bechtel's $680 million reconstruction contract covers repairs to the 
country's electrical grid, water works and sewers. But what happens after 
those immediate repairs?
<P>Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld has already said he wants to see some of 
Iraq's state-run businesses sold off, although he did not specifically mention 
the utilities. Conservatives see privatization as a way to dismantle the 
vestiges of Baath Party power in Iraq, because Hussein's government controlled 
most every aspect of the economy before the war.
<P>Planners also view private utility companies as a way to make water and 
power systems more efficient and encourage investment in their repair.
<P>"The point of privatization is it creates a strong incentive for the people 
operating these systems to get it right," said David Dowall, a professor of 
city and regional planning at UC Berkeley who has consulted with several 
Middle Eastern governments on their utility systems.
<P>"The downside," he said, "is that people don't like to pay higher prices."
<P>State-run utility systems typically rely on heavy public subsidies, meaning 
citizens don't directly pay the full cost of the water and power they use. 
That is particularly true in the Middle East, where oil revenue long has 
funded many government services. Switching to private utility systems often 
means an increase in rates.
<P>That can be a hardship for the poor. A recent report by the International 
Consortium of Investigative Journalists, for example, claims efforts to 
privatize water systems in South Africa during the late 1990s led to a cholera 
outbreak, as people unable to pay higher rates started drinking from polluted 
streams, ponds and lakes. The outbreak killed nearly 300 people.
<P>Higher rates for water also led to a legal dispute for Bechtel in Bolivia.
<P>Hired to run the water system in Cochabamba, Bolivia, a Bechtel joint 
venture saw its contract canceled by the government after protests against 
price increases turned violent. Bechtel says the hikes averaged 35 percent. 
Some Cochabamba residents complained their bills doubled before the fee 
increases were revoked.
<P>Bechtel and the Bolivian government are now locked in arbitration 
proceedings before an international financial panel, with the company seeking 
compensation for the canceled contract.
<P>That case has raised suspicions among activists about Bechtel's intentions 
in Iraq.
<P>"Their record depicts that trend -- they privatize the service, they raise 
the price, and only those who can afford it get it," said Antonia Juhasz, a 
project director at the International Forum on Globalization think tank in San 
Francisco.
<P>Bechtel insists it has no preference for whether Iraq's utilities stay 
public or turn private. Company spokesman Jonathan Marshall said protesters 
have oversimplified a complex situation in Bolivia, a situation he says has 
nothing to do with Bechtel's job in Iraq.
<P>"Iraqi children are swimming in and drinking raw sewage, and we're trying 
to fix that," he said.
<P>The debate about water privatization efforts even surfaced at last week's 
summit of the Group of Eight major industrial nations in Evian, France. 
Protesters urged government officials in attendance to back off water 
privatization projects in developing countries.
<P>Dowall noted, however, that the strict public and private models for water 
and other utilities aren't the only choices. Governments can set up 
competitions among private companies bidding to run utilities at the lowest 
possible subsidy. They can hire companies to work with specific rates. They 
can turn utilities into quasi-public organizations whose core assets are still 
owned by the state.
<P>"I don't think you have to lurch from one extreme to another," he said. 
"There are models in the middle that work."
<P>That choice, many observers insist, must be left to the Iraqis.
<P>"If one were to define a core democratic decision a people could make, the 
treatment of things like water and power and media would be it," said Benjamin 
Barber, author of the impending book "Fear's Empire: War, Terrorism and 
Democracy." "It's a pretty basic part of government."
