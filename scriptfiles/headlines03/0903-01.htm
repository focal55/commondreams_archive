<p>JAKARTA  - Indonesian Vice President Hamzah Haz  branded America the "terrorist king" Wednesday in remarks at  odds with Jakarta's support for the war on terror.<P>
"Actually, who is the terrorist, who is against human  rights? The answer is the United States because they attacked  Iraq. Moreover, it is the terrorist king, waging war," the  official Antara news agency quoted Haz as saying.<P>

  </table></font>It was unclear what prompted Haz to make his remarks in a  speech to heads of Muslim boarding schools in Central Java.<P>
The comments are likely to anger Washington and harm  Jakarta's desire to get their hands on key terror suspect  Hambali, who is in U.S. custody.<P>
The conservative Muslim politician is known for strong  statements that appear out of step with the government.<P>
He once showed no hesitation visiting leading militants,  including Abu Bakar Bashir, whom regional governments accuse of  being spiritual leader of the Jemaah Islamiah militant network,  blamed for attacks in Southeast Asia including the Bali blasts.<P>
A court in Jakarta sentenced Bashir Tuesday to four years  in jail for participating in acts of treason, but ruled  prosecutors failed to prove he led Jemaah Islamiah.<P>
Haz said that verdict should be respected, and told foreign  governments to stop meddling in the affairs of the world's most  populous Muslim nation by commenting on the decision.<P>
When later asked by reporters to elaborate on his remark  the United States was the "terrorist king," Haz said the  country was carrying out international terror, Antara added.<P>
Haz was not more specific.<P>
The United States has praised Indonesia for its cooperation  in the war on terror, particularly since last October's Bali  bomb attacks, which killed 202 people.<P>
Indonesia wants access to Hambali and would like him  brought home for trial over a series of bombings, including  Bali.<P>
The radical Indonesian preacher, believed by some  governments to be a senior al Qaeda operative and key figure in  Jemaah Islamiah, was captured in Thailand last month. He is  being held by the United States at a secret location.<P>
The vice president said Indonesia was still being accused  of being a terrorist's nest.<P>
"Moreover, I am always perceived as protecting terrorists,"  he told the Islamic school leaders.
<P>
Indonesia's Muslim boarding schools, or pesantren, have  come under the spotlight over charges a few are incubators for  militants.
