<p> The Stop the War Coalition has been told that protesters can march through the capital on February 15 but will be banned from gathering in Hyde Park afterwards.</p> 

                

            

                

                    <p>Labour MP George Galloway said Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell had informed the Coalition of the rally ban.</p> 

                

            

                

                    <p>&quot;This is an extraordinary turn of events. It would amount to an absolute crime against civil liberties in Britain,&quot; said Mr Galloway, MP for Glasgow Kelvin and a vehement critic of war in Iraq.</p> 

                

            

                

                    <p>&quot;If what is expected to be half-a-million people come to London to register their opposition to war, they will be allowed to march through the streets of London but they are not allowed to have a rally at the end of it. &quot;</p> 

                

            

                

                    <p>The Stop The War Coalition, estimates that more than 500,000 people will join next month's march.</p> 

                

            

                

                    <p>&quot;I would want to warn Mrs Jowell, she can either choose between half-a-million people at the rally or half-a-million people in a riot, because that is what will surely happen if we tell them that thanks to the British Government they are not allowed to attend a meeting at the end of the march,&quot; said Mr Galloway.</p> 

                

            

                

                    <p>The Department of Culture, Media and Sport said the Stop the War Coalition had been refused permission to stage a rally in Hyde Park for safety reasons and the risk of adverse weather would jeopardise the condition of the park.</p> 

                

            

                

                    <p>A spokeswoman said protesters would be allowed to rally elsewhere if they wanted to.</p> 

                

            

                

                    <p>&quot;This is not unusual for this time of year,&quot; she added.</p> 

                

            

                

                    <p>&quot;It would not matter who had applied, they would not have been given permission to do it.&quot;</p>
