<p>WASHINGTON  -- Reacting to the Federal Communications Commission's decision to relax media ownership restrictions, some House lawmakers said Thursday they plan to introduce legislation to bring back regulations preventing additional media consolidation.</p>
		<p>The announcement by Rep. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and several Democrats came a day after Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said that panel would consider similar legislation.</p>
		<p>On Monday, the FCC voted 3-2 to allow a company to own both a newspaper and TV station in the same community and to reach 45 percent of TV households nationwide.</p>
		<p>Critics believe that allowing further media consolidation along the lines of the FCC's vote will further limit the diversity of viewpoints that audiences receive, whether in print, over radio waves or on television.</p>
		<p>FCC Chairman Michael Powell has said the change in regulations was necessary to update obsolete restrictions and to make the regulations enforceable.</p>
		<p>The lawmakers proposed amending the appropriations bill to keep the FCC from getting the money needed to implement the new rules, rescinding the changes it made this week and adding a few more regulations.</p>
		<p>Sanders said the decision by the commission's three Republican members came despite what he called widespread opposition, including comments from 750,000 people who contacted the FCC to criticize the change in regulations.</p>
		<p>"The American people are outraged," Sanders said. "We must rescind the FCC decision, and that's what we intend to do."</p>
		<p>Rep. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) said the new regulations fail to protect the interest of the public.</p>
		<p>"Since the FCC won't do its job, it's up to Congress to do its job," Brown said.</p>
		<p>Rep. Maurice Hinchey (D-N.Y.) said he is drafting a bill that would include restoring the Fairness Doctrine, which would require TV and radio stations to provide discussion of conflicting views on some public issues.</p>
		<p>It would also cap radio ownership and bring the limit on TV households back to 35 percent.</p>
		<p>In the Senate, there has been bipartisan support for a bill to set a 35 percent cap on how many TV households a single company can reach.</p>
		<p>But for the House to generate a rollback of the FCC rules, it would have to go through the Energy and Commerce Committee. That committee's chairman, Rep. Billy Tauzin (R-La.), has said he supports the FCC's new rules.</p>
