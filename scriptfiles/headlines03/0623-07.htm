</table>And while you still may not be able to fight City Hall, in some instances you can rent it for an event.<p></p>
<P> The trend reflects cities' search for revenue alternatives to taxes as well as marketers' quest for alternatives to traditional advertising. The blue-chip companies using public spaces for private purposes — like the Bronx Zoo, the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago, the Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center in Dallas and City Hall in Beverly Hills, Calif. — include AOL Time Warner, Advance Publications, American Express, DaimlerChrysler, Morgan Stanley, Pfizer, Unilever and Volkswagen.</p>
<P> But as the practice grows in popularity, it is coming under scrutiny from critics who decry what they see as the intensifying commercialization of everyday life.</p>
<P> "We call it the city-for-sale phenomenon," said Gary Ruskin, the executive director at Commercial Alert in Portland, Ore., an organization dedicated to fighting what he terms ad creep. "Every one of these is a victory of crass commercialism over local values."</p>
<P> "Places like parks are intended to be sanctuaries from the more noxious aspects of our commercial culture, refuges from the hustle and bustle of marketing," he added. "Instead, they're now degraded into huckstering, up for bid to the corporations with the deepest pockets."</p>
<P>The fees paid by marketers, agencies and other private, profit-making companies to rent public spaces can vary from a few hundred dollars to a few hundred thousand. Factors include the prominence of the location, how often it is used for such events, the duration of the event and the nature of the promotion.</p>
<P> For instance, while the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in New York City charges $20,000 to rent Vanderbilt Hall in Grand Central Terminal for an evening, the fee was $75,000 for a two-week exhibit of photographs, "Faces of Ground Zero," presented by Time magazine and sponsored by Morgan Stanley four months after Sept. 11.</p>

</table></font>"This is money put back into the system," said Tom Kelly, chief spokesman for the authority. "That point should never be lost." The authority expects to raise $1.3 million this year from renting Vanderbilt Hall for such purposes, up from $1.26 million in 2002 and $1.2 million in 2001.<p></p>
<P> Marketers must follow guidelines, Mr. Kelly said, that limit the advertising aspects of their tenancy by governing the size and number of banners and signs as well as the contents.</p>
<P> "The standards in effect are what would be tasteful," he added, "given the setting."</p>
<P> Advertisers say they are willing to adhere to strictures they would not otherwise consider in exchange for the chance to appear in prestigious public spaces.</p>
<P> "We put up some banners, in a tasteful, tactful way — no `sale' signs, nothing tacky," said Dale Persons, a vice president at the Viking Range Corporation in Greenwood, Miss., a sponsor with Bon Appétit magazine of a six-city promotional tour, Wine and Spirits Focus, that stops at public sites like Navy Pier in Chicago.</p>
<P> "These types of venues are lots of times more exciting and interesting than convention halls," Mr. Persons said. "There's an appeal, a natural connection that touches the upscale consumers who buy our upscale major appliances, cookware and cutlery."</p>
<P> Mary Ann Wilson, the national advertising manager at Audi of America in Auburn Hills, Mich., agreed. Audi, which is part of Volkswagen, is sponsoring, with Bon Appétit and 14 other magazines published by Advance, a campaign to introduce the 2004 Audi A8 L that includes the projection of images by Lucette de Rugy, an artistic light producer, onto such buildings as the Meyerson Center and the Beverly Hills City Hall in five cities.</p>
<P> "We don't see it as being commercialized," Ms. Wilson said. "It certainly is not a sell message. It's an artistic gift to a city."</p>
<P> Just as the cities help Audi by making the public spaces available, Ms. Wilson said, Audi helps the cities by sponsoring events that are "revitalizing downtown districts that could use it."</p>
<P> "The Arts District in Dallas is not exactly a hustling, bustling place," she added.</p>
<P> San Diego may be hustling more than any American city to solicit corporate marketing partners, raising more than $5 million since 2000 from companies like Global Safety Products, which supplies plastic gloves for dog walkers in city parks, and  PepsiCo, which supplies all the soft-drink vending machines on city property.</p>
<P> "Oh, almost every day I get a call from a city that wants to know what we're doing," said Mary Braunwarth, the development director for the City of San Diego. "I wouldn't say that in a perfect world we wouldn't do this, and it's not a panacea," she said. "But if done correctly and appropriately, it can bring in revenue to pay for existing activities or for new programs that would be difficult to fund."</p>
<P> "I personally feel commercial advertising in public spaces is not appropriate, and that is the sense of the community we live in," she added. "But there are ways to involve the corporate sector by being creative, without having to cross the line into exploitation."</p>
<P> One city that needs no help from marketers to hustle and bustle is New York, which is reassessing its policies toward the use of public spaces for private purposes as part of a review of all municipal efforts to raise money through sponsorships, licensing, merchandising and marketing.</p>
<P> "New York City has one of the great brands of the world," said Daniel L. Doctoroff, the deputy mayor for economic development and rebuilding. "But how do you effectively use it to generate revenue?"</p>
<P> "A classic case, where we wrestled with all the issues, was the National Football League Kickoff in Times Square," Mr. Doctoroff said, referring to an event last September commemorating the start of the 2002-2003 football season. While "it's hard to overly commercialize Times Square," he added, laughing, it did require closing the area for the first time in the afternoon and evening of a day that was not New Year's Eve.</p>
<P> "The N.F.L. paid a lot of money — $10 million worth of advertising time to promote New York City and $5 million in contributions to 9/11-related activities," Mr. Doctoroff said. "But it clearly was disruptive to Broadway and the restaurants."</p>
<P> "It made a lot of sense to do last year, because it was an important watershed in terms of people's images of New York shifting from looking back at Sept. 11 to looking ahead," he added. "That said, we won't do it again this year if Times Square and Broadway do not agree."</p>
