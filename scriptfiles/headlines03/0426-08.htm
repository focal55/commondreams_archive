<p>AMERICAN soldiers guarding an arms dump in Baghdad stripped four suspected Iraqi thieves, burnt their clothes and forced them on to the streets naked, witnesses said early this morning.

“Ali Baba. Haram” = “sinful thieves”<br>

</table></font>A Muslim member of the Delta Squadron 10 Engineer Corps is alleged to have written “Ali Baba. Haram” in Arabic across the men’s chests before they were evicted at gunpoint from an amusement park in the city. 

<p>Reports of the incident provoked outrage from human rights organisations. Treating prisoners in such a way would be a clear breach of the Geneva Convention. 

<p>“We suddenly saw four naked Iraqi guys with four American soldiers,” Line Fransson, a journalist for <a href="http://www.dagbladet.no/nyheter/2003/04/25/367175.html" target="_new">Dagbladet</a>, the Norwegian newspaper, said. “We thought they were going to the bathroom. They went into a building and a minute later (the soldiers) pushed them out into the main street.” 

<p>The soldiers’ commanding officer, First Lieutenant Eric Canaday, confirmed that his men had stripped the Iraqis. “We took their clothes and burnt them and then we pushed them out with thief written on them,” he was quoted as telling the journalist. 

<p>Lieutenant Canaday said that local residents had suggested stripping would-be thieves as a deterrent. 

<p>He claimed that young men had been trying to steal light weapons that the Iraqi Army had stockpiled at the Zawra amusement park. He said that his soldiers had meted out a similar punishment on a previous occasion. 

<p>The phrase scrawled across the mens’ chests in black marker pen is a reference to the tale of Ali Baba and the 40 Thieves and can be roughly translated as the vernacular for “sinful thieves”.

</table></font><p><a href="http://web.amnesty.org/library/index/engmde140972003" target="_new">Amnesty International condemned</a> the incident. “Such degrading treatment is a clear violation of the responsibilities of the occupying powers. The US authorities must investigate this incident and publicly release their findings,” the organisation said last night. 

<p>One of the four men, whose pictures appeared in the Norwegian press, gave his name as Ziad, aged 20. “Ziad said he was so angry being humiliated by the soldiers that the only thing he wanted to do was find a grenade and throw it at the American soldiers and all the other ones in the city,” Ms Fransson said. 

<p>A spokesman for US forces in Iraq said: “It certainly does not sound like the type of incident we have seen during this operation.” He did not say if there would an investigation.
