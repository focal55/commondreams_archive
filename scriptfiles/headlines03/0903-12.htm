      Changed views of the United States two years after the September 11 horrors may haunt Washington's quest for help in grappling with the bloody aftermath of the Iraq invasion. The suicide hijack attacks on New York and Washington in 2001 produced a remarkable outpouring of sympathy for America, but sympathy soured as Bush declared a vague 'war on terror' that he took to Afghanistan and then, far more controversially, to Iraq.

  </table></font>Nations briefly set aside their quarrels with U.S. foreign  policy and President Bush's go-it-alone approach, but sympathy  soured as Bush declared a vague "war on terror" that he took to  Afghanistan and then, far more controversially, to Iraq.<P>
Emad Shahin, a political science professor in Cairo, said  Egyptians questioned whether the human suffering of September  11 justified the deaths of thousands of Afghans and Iraqis.<P>
"After the war in Iraq, the United States looks to many  like an occupying power in the region, which revives memories  of European occupation in the early 20th century and further  erodes any sympathy among people in the region," he said.<P>
Disquiet among U.S. allies in Europe centers on  Washington's preference for pre-emptive action, its claim to  military and economic primacy and its scorn for multilateral  initiatives in areas including global warming and international  justice.<P>
Britain and some other countries backed the Iraq war  despite domestic critics who doubted the gravity of the threat  from Saddam Hussein's still-unfound weapons of mass  destruction.<P>
Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi may give Bush  unstinting support, but American use of force has dissipated  the post-September 11 solidarity felt by almost all Italians.<P>
"Today every war is possible, at a moment's notice and  everywhere, and the political objectives behind the wars are  getting more and more confused and difficult to grasp," said a  recent editorial in Rome's independent La Stampa daily.<P>
TOOL OR PARTNER?  The United States had made clear it would  act alone on Iraq if need be, putting the onus on the U.N.  Security Council to "prove its relevance" by endorsing war. The  council declined.<P>
Iraq's postwar travail has refocused debate on the limits  of U.S. solo power, especially after last month's bombings of  the Jordanian embassy, U.N. headquarters and a Shiite shrine.  The Bush administration has now for the first time signaled  interest in a U.N.-mandated multinational force.<P>
But it will be loath to let despised opponents of the Iraq  war, notably France, claim vindication for their views. French  Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin said Paris wanted a  genuine change of policy in Iraq before the U.S. "logic of  force" triggered a spiral of confrontation and collapse.<P>
"We must end the ambiguity, transfer responsibilities and  allow the Iraqis to play the role they deserve as soon as  possible," he said last week.<P>
Bush may win public approval at home by painting the fight  with Iraqi insurgents, now said to include foreign militants,  as part of the "war on terror," but many in the Middle East see  the U.S.-led occupation itself as the problem.<P>
"There are grave concerns it will encourage the activities  of fundamentalists in the region who blame Gulf countries for  supporting the invasion," said a government official in Oman.<P>
ROOTS OF TERROR<P>
Long before the war, many Arabs and Muslims viewed U.S.  foreign policy as an extension of Israel's. Even pro-Western  Arab leaders such as Egypt's Hosni Mubarak have argued that the  U.S. role in Iraq will fuel terrorism, not dampen it.<P>
Arabs fume at what they see as America's unstinting support  for Israel, even as it occupies and settles Palestinian land.  They resent U.S. attitudes that conflate the Palestinian  struggle against occupation with global terrorism and perceived  double standards toward Israeli and Palestinian violence.<P>
"It is not Osama bin Laden, but America's arrogance and  anti-Muslim policy which have given birth to terrorism," said  Ahmed Suleiti, a civil engineer in Qatar, in remarks echoed  widely in the region.<P>
Yemeni political analyst Sami Ghaleb said the United States  was "threatening the collective security of the world" with its  support for Israeli policies and its threats to Syria and Iran.  "Generally, there's admiration for the American people and the  country's technological edge," said Ahmad Baghdadi, a political  science professor in pro-U.S. Kuwait.<P>
"The problem lies in U.S. policy in the Middle East and its  role in the war on terrorism, which started militarily and is  ending ideologically," he said, referring to U.S. pressure for  political and social change in countries such as Saudi Arabia  where Washington had long backed the autocratic status quo.<P>
The United States also wins scant support in countries like  Kenya and Indonesia, both targeted by terror attacks blamed on  bin Laden's al Qaeda network, but which feel doubly penalized  by U.S. and British advice to tourists to stay away.<P>
"They (Americans) have to be a little more humble and  realize that the world doesn't revolve around Washington D.C.,"  said Macharia Gaitho, an editor at Kenya's Daily Nation.<P>
Indonesian President Megawati Sukarnoputri, who had backed  the U.S. "war on terror," condemned the Iraq invasion, as did  many in an 85 percent Muslim country where militant Islam and  anger at U.S. policies in the Middle East are on the rise.<P>
The September 11 attacks, in which 15 of the 19 hijackers  were Saudis, created havoc in once-cozy ties between the United  States and Saudi Arabia, inflaming feelings on both sides.<P>
"I don't like America because America doesn't like the  world," said Ahmed Sultan Ghanem, a 25-year-old Saudi student.
