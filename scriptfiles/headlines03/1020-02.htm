<p>LOS ANGELES  - Sexual identity is wired into the  genes, which discounts the concept that homosexuality and  transgender sexuality are a choice, California researchers  reported on Monday.<P>
"Our findings may help answer an important question -- why  do we feel male or female?" Dr. Eric Vilain, a genetics  professor at the University of California, Los Angeles School  of Medicine, said in a statement. "Sexual identity is rooted in  every person's biology before birth and springs from a  variation in our individual genome."<P>
His team has identified 54 genes in mice that may explain  why male and female brains look and function differently.<P>
Since the 1970s, scientists have believed that estrogen and  testosterone were wholly responsible for sexually organizing  the brain. Recent evidence, however, indicates that hormones  cannot explain everything about the sexual differences between  male and female brains.<P>
Published in the latest edition of the journal Molecular  Brain Research, the UCLA discovery may also offer physicians an  improved tool for gender assignment of babies born with  ambiguous genitalia.<P>
Mild cases of malformed genitalia occur in 1 percent of all  births -- about 3 million cases. More severe cases -- where  doctors can't inform parents whether they had a boy or girl --  occur in one in 3,000 births.<P>
"If physicians could predict the gender of newborns with  ambiguous genitalia at birth, we would make less mistakes in  gender assignment," Vilain said.<P>
Using two genetic testing methods, the researchers compared  the production of genes in male and female brains in embryonic  mice -- long before the animals developed sex organs.<P>
They found 54 genes produced in different amounts in male  and female mouse brains, prior to hormonal influence. Eighteen  of the genes were produced at higher levels in the male brains;  36 were produced at higher levels in the female brains.<P>
"We discovered that the male and female brains differed in  many measurable ways, including anatomy and function." Vilain  said.<P>
For example, the two hemispheres of the brain appeared more  symmetrical in females than in males. According to Vilain, the  symmetry may improve communication between both sides of the  brain, leading to enhanced verbal expressiveness in females.<P>
"This anatomical difference may explain why women can  sometimes articulate their feelings more easily than men," he  said.<P>
The scientists plan to conduct further studies to determine  the specific role for each of the 54 genes they identified.<P>
"Our findings may explain why we feel male or female,  regardless of our actual anatomy," said Vilain. "These  discoveries lend credence to the idea that being transgender  --- feeling that one has been born into the body of the wrong  sex -- is a state of mind.
