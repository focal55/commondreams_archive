</table></font>Dr Osama Sakhari, speaking at Baghdad's Al Noor Hospital  after a day of heavy raids across the capital, said he had  counted 55 people killed and more than 47 wounded from the  market in the city's Shula neighborhood.<p>



		This Reuters correspondent personally counted five bodies  in one of the hospital's morgue units, after an incident which  could further undermine U.S. efforts to win Iraqi hearts and  minds.<p>



		Iraqi Information Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahaf said at  least 58 people had been killed.<p>



		"The number of the casualties...is 58 martyrs and I believe  there will be more and the number of people injured is very  big," he told the al-Hayat-LBC Arabic television channel,  denouncing the U.S.-led invasion force.<p>



		"My explanation for their increasing crimes against  civilians is that they are feeling the weight of the series of  defeats which we inflicted on them on the outskirts of the  cities and in the desert."<p>



		Arabic language television stations al-Jazeera and  al-Arabiya said rescuers were looking for more victims, and  showed pictures of people carrying coffins out of the hospital.<p>



		Al-Jazeera's correspondent said: "An Iraqi official told us  that the search is still going on for those trapped under the  rubble." The television showed pictures of bodies, including  those of two children.<p>



		ARAB ANGER<p>



		Television pictures of bodies and damage in Iraq have  fueled Arab anger against the U.S.-led invasion which  Washington says is not aimed at ordinary Iraqis.<p>



		It says that the nine-day-old war is aimed at removing  President Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi leadership and ridding  the country of weapons of mass destruction. Baghdad denies it  has any such weapons.<p>



		Abu Dhabi television said U.S. cruise missiles may have hit  the market and showed a gaping hole on one street and damaged  cars.<p>



		The U.S. military blamed an earlier explosion in a Baghdad  residential area on an errant Iraqi missile.<p>



		Jazeera showed pictures of bodies at the scene and in the  hospital. It also showed an Iraqi woman hitting herself in the  face repeatedly as she stared through a window at a wounded  young man lying in a hospital bed. A group of men shouted  "There is no God but God," as they stood beside an ambulance.<p>

</table></font>Explosions shook the outskirts of the city before midnight  on Friday, in the latest of a series of air raids. U.S. and  British bombs and missiles pounded the capital repeatedly on  Friday in the heaviest day of raids since the war began.<p>



		Residents said eight people had died in a raid earlier on  Friday on a Baath party office.<p>



		U.S. defense officials said a radar-avoiding B-2 stealth  bomber had dropped two 4,600-pound bombs -- known as  "bunker-busters" -- on a communications center in downtown  Baghdad. Iraqi satellite television went off the air.<p>



		A large fire blazed on the west bank of the Tigris river  and thick, billowing smoke rose on the horizon after dozens of  blasts in the eastern and southern fringes of the capital.<p>



		Iraqi defense positions spat anti-aircraft fire above the  rooftops as U.S. missiles hit government offices, including the  ministries of information, planning and foreign affairs.<p>



		The raids knocked out many telephone lines -- some of the  first bombing damage to civilian infrastructure.<p>
