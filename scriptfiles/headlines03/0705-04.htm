LONDON - Amnesty International has denounced the  planned U.S. military trials for six prisoners at "Camp X-Ray"  in Guantanamo Bay as a "travesty of justice."
<P>
"We deeply regret that the President has taken his country  one step closer to running trials that will flout basic  standards of justice," the human rights group said in a  statement late on Friday.<P>
President Bush has designated six foreign captives in what  he calls the war on terrorism as eligible to be tried for U.S.  military commissions.<P>
Britain's Foreign Office announced on Friday that two  Britons -- Moazzam Begg, 35, and Feroz Abbasi, 23, -- would be  among the six suspects, whose names and nationalities U.S.  defense officials have refused to reveal.<P>
Charges set out in the Pentagon's instructions for the  trials could bring the death penalty.<P>
"Any trial before these military commissions would be a  travesty of justice," Amnesty said.<P>
"We urge the U.S. administration to rethink its strategy  before it causes any further affront to international fair  trial norms and any more damage to its own reputation.<P>
Amnesty criticized the commissions, citing the use of a  lower standard of evidence that would be admissible in an  ordinary court, including hearsay evidence.<P>
It also drew attention to Pentagon guidelines which do not  expressly exclude statements extracted under coercive methods.<P>
Officials said there was evidence the six had attended  "terrorist" training camps and may have been involved in  financing Saudi-born Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda network --  blamed by Washington for the September 11 attacks against the  United States.<P>
Military officials have had preliminary discussions about  building an execution chamber at the Guantanamo Bay U.S. navy  base, where about 600 prisoners are being held, but say talk of  execution is premature.<P>
The Foreign Office said on Friday they were opposed to the  death penalty in all circumstances and had made this view clear  to Washington.<P>
The U.S. chief defense lawyer for Guantanamo Bay, Colonel  Will Gunn, told the BBC's Newsnight program late on Friday that  he faced many challenges.<P>
"We will have a cultural divide which will take us time to  overcome, if we're ever able to overcome it. So I see that as a  fundamental challenge," he said.<P>
But he said he had faith in his staff who would work to  provide the "very best possible defense."
<P>
"This country has long said we're about justice being  done," he added. "That's what the principle of Americanism  means to many people."
