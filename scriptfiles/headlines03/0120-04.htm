<p>LONDON  --Late punk icon Joe Strummer's efforts to counter global warming will live on as a forest in his honor. 

<P>

<a href="http://www.futureforests.com/" target="_new">Future Forests</a>, a group the Clash singer-songwriter helped found in the 1990s, asked fans to donate to help create the living memorial on the Isle of Skye in Scotland. 

<P>

``Joe said `Bands must be contributing to global warming by their buses, equipment trucks and the diesel used to power the stages,''' the group's spokesman said. ``'Can you imagine how much carbon dioxide the pressing and the distribution of a CD creates? What shall we do about it?''' 

<P>

Strummer decided to plant trees to offset the carbon dioxide created by his work. 

<P>

Many scientists believe that the burning of fossil fuels is causing an increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide, triggering what is called the greenhouse effect. A higher concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere traps more of the sun's heat, possibly causing temperatures to rise. 

<P>

The spokesman said the forest would eventually be a home to hundreds of wildlife species, including otters, red deer and foxes. 

<P>

Strummer, a diplomat's son, died Dec. 22 at age 50. 

<P>

The Clash will be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in March. The band emerged from the 1970s London punk explosion, and was commercially successful by punk standards.
