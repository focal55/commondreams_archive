<p>BRUSSELS - Over half of Europeans think that Israel now presents the biggest threat to world peace according to a controversial poll requested by the European Commission.

<p>According to the same survey, Europeans believe the United States contributes the most to world instability along with Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq and North Korea. 

<p>The specially commissioned poll which asked citizens 15 questions on "the reconstruction of Iraq, the conflict in the Middle East and World peace", has caused controversy in Brussels.

<p>The European Commission is coming under fire for publishing the results of a number of questions - relating to Iraqi reconstruction - while failing to publish the results which revealed the extent of mistrust of Israel and the United States in Europe.

<p>A Commission spokesperson today (30 October) denied that the decision to withhold some of the results until next Monday was politically motivated, adding that some of the results not yet published are still "unstable".

<p>He did, however, add that a decision was made to publish a preview of the questions pertaining to the reconstruction of Iraq, to coincide with the Iraqi donors conference in Madrid, which took place at the end of last week.

<p>This admission has raised questions about whether the Commission sought to suppress the results which would have came at a particularly sensitive moment. 

<p>One pollster involved in the survey told the EUobserver that some questions being raised about the poll were unfounded.

<p>"The questions were decided upon by both the polling organizations and the European Commission", the source said.

<p>Israeli officials dismissed the results of the poll as propaganda. 

<p>According to El Pais, a massive 59 percent of Europeans said they believed that Israel is the biggest obstacle to world peace. 

<p>The poll, conducted by Taylor Nelson Sofres/ EOS Gallup Europe, was conducted between 8 and 16 of October.
