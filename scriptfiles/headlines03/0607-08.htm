<p> STOCKHOLM, June 6 — Sweden's Foreign Minister Anna Lindh said on Friday that U.S. President George W. Bush had acted like a ''lone ranger'' on Iraq and warned that other countries could be tempted to follow America's example. 
<p>Sweden has harshly criticised the U.S.-led war on Iraq, saying it did not have United Nations' approval. Lindh reiterated that position ahead of her visit to Washington next week for talks with U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell. 
<p>''Today's broad security agenda demands new thinking and multilateral solutions,'' Lindh told a Stockholm conference on Women and Security. 
<p>''This is not the time for the lone ranger, this is the time for common action, multilateral action.'' 
<p>After the speech, Lindh told reporters that her ''lone ranger'' remark did not refer only to Bush. 
<p>''We can also see, I'm afraid, lone rangers in other countries, countries thinking that they can deal with all these very difficult issues by themselves and not having to work with others,'' she said, declining to give any names. 
<p>''Nobody should try to be the lone ranger... That is a threat today that you can see in several countries, and the fear is that the U.S. action (in Iraq) will increase the idea that other countries can act militarily without involving the U.N.,'' Lindh said. 
<p>U.S.-led forces toppled Iraqi president Saddam Hussein in April but are yet to find any weapons of mass destruction, given by Washington as the main justification for the war.
