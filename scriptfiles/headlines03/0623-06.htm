<p>The Supreme Court on Monday upheld a university law school admissions policy that gives minorities an edge, ruling that race can be one of many factors that colleges consider when selecting their students.</p>
    <p> The ruling in the law-school case preserves the concept of affirmative action for minorities who might otherwise be underrepresented on top campuses, but makes clear that racial preferences must be used sparingly.</p>
    <p> The 5-4 ruling endorsed a program at the University of Michigan law school meant to ensure a "critical mass" of minorities on campus. The program is not an illegal quota, the high court said.</p>
    <p> A companion ruling testing the constitutionality of another, more overtly preferential affirmative action program for minority applicants was also expected Monday.</p>
    <p> Government has a compelling interest in promoting racial diversity on campus, and the law school plan is narrowly focused on that goal, the court majority said.</p>
    <p> The ruling allows tax-supported schools, and by extension private schools and other institutions, to continue searching for ways to boost minority enrollment without violating the Constitution's guarantee against discrimination.</p>
    <p> The University of Michigan cases are the most significant test of affirmative action to reach the court in a generation. At issue was whether racial preference programs unconstitutionally discriminate against white students.</p>
    <p> "The Equal Protection Clause does not prohibit the law school's narrowly tailored use of race in admissions decisions to further a compelling interest in obtaining the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body," Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote.</p>
    <p> The law school ruling follows the path the court set a generation ago, when it outlawed quotas but still left room for schools to improve the odds for minority applicants.</p>
