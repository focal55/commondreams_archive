<p>UNITED NATIONS   - Secretary-General Kofi Annan  warned President Bush that his doctrine of preemptive military  intervention posed a fundamental challenge to the United  Nations and could lead to a global free-for-all.<P>
In a speech to be delivered shortly before Bush addresses  the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday, Annan declared that the  Iraq crisis had brought the United Nations to a "fork in the  road" as decisive as 1945 when the world body was founded.<P>

  </table></font>Without mentioning the United States by name, Annan spoke  as states in the 191-member world body were struggling to heal  deep rifts caused by the war on Iraq, in which the United  States acted without U.N. Security Council approval.<P>
Annan questioned U.S. arguments that nations have the  "right and obligation to use force preemptively" against  unconventional weapons systems even while they were still being  developed.<P>
"My concern is that, if it were to be adopted, it could set  precedents that resulted in a proliferation of the unilateral  and lawless use of force, with or without credible  justification," Annan warned in a text of his speech released  in advance.<P>
He said the U.N. Charter allowed military action for the  purpose of self defense.<P>
"But until now it has been understood that when states go  beyond that and decide to use force to deal with broader  threats to international peace and security, they need the  unique legitimacy provided by the United Nations," he said.<P>
"Now some say this understanding is no longer tenable since  an 'armed attack' with weapons of mass destruction could be  launched at any time," Annan said.<P>
"This logic represents a fundamental challenge to the  principles, on which, however imperfectly, world peace and  stability have rested for the last 58 years," Annan said.<P>
NEW RULES ON WAR?<P>
However, Annan said the 15-member Security Council, in  charge of war and peace, might need to consider rewriting the  rule book for the use of force.<P>
"Its members may need to begin a discussion on the criteria  for an early authorization of coercive measures to address  certain types of threats -- for instance, terrorist groups  armed with weapons of mass destruction," Annan said.<P>
He said he was establishing a "high-level panel of eminent  personalities" to examine current challenges to peace and  security and recommend ways the United Nations could reform its  institutions.<P>
"Excellencies, we have come to a fork in the road," Annan  said. "This may be a moment no less decisive than 1945 itself,  when the United Nations was founded."<P>
Annan again berated U.N. members for not being able to  agree on an expansion of the Security Council, which has  remained nearly the same for 58 years.<P>
"I would respectfully suggest to you, excellencies, that in  the eyes of your peoples the difficulties of reaching agreement  does not excuse your failure to do so," Annan said.<P>
Jan Kavan, the outgoing assembly president from the Czech  Republic said earlier that U.N. ambassadors alone could not  resolve Security Council reform after a decade of trying.<P>
"For that, you would need a major political breakthrough in  the capitals of certain key member states," he said.
