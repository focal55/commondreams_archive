<p>WASHINGTON   - Thousands of U.S. parents are being forced to give up their mentally ill children to foster care or even the juvenile justice system because they cannot otherwise pay for treatment, a report said on Monday.



<p>The report by the General Accounting Office has probably found only the tip of the iceberg, mental health groups said, as only a few states cooperated with the investigation.



<p>But they said the implications are clear. "Families across America are being ripped apart because they can't find the help their children with mental and emotional disorders need," Laurel Stine of the nonprofit Bazelton Center for Mental Health Law said in a statement.



<p>The GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, was asked to write the report by U.S. Senator Susan Collins, a Maine Republican, and Democratic House of Representatives members Pete Stark of California and Patrick Kennedy of Rhode Island after a series of media reports on the issue.



<p>Child welfare directors in 19 states, and juvenile justice officials in 19 counties answered survey questions for the report. They said more than 12,700 children were placed into some kind of care so they could get needed treatment.



<p>"Nationwide, this number is likely higher because many state child welfare directors did not provide data," the GAO report said.



<p>"Although no agency tracks these children or maintains data on their characteristics, officials said most are male, adolescent, often have multiple problems and many exhibit behaviors that threaten the safety of themselves and others."



<p>But the children had not committed crimes, nor had they been abused or neglected, said Elizabeth Adams, a spokeswoman for the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill.



<p>"When children have mental health problems, they are often demanding on the family and family structure," Adams said in a telephone interview. "Sometimes they have outbursts and rage and behavior that is destructive to the child and others."



<p>This requires care -- expensive care that can include intensive counseling for the patient and the family, respite care to give parents a break, and drug treatment.



<p>But many insurance plans will only pay for such treatment for a limited time, said Ralph Ibson of the National Mental Health Association.



<p>And states cannot pay unless the child is in their physical custody.



<p>"In extreme cases, as this report documents, they literally give up custody to meet the requirements as a last-chance opportunity for their children, give up custody to a system that will place the kids in mental health services. That's how desperate they are," Ibson said.



<p>"You have to ask yourself why they can supply money for child mental health services in a foster care home and you won't give the same money to a parent?" asked Adams.
