<p>Wearing little more than foamed milk in the new issue of Playboy, the Women 
of Starbucks have come to a newsstand near you.
<P>Yes, the Seattle coffee retailer is ubiquitous, having ballooned like a 
silicone implant from fewer than 100 stores in 1990 to more than 6,500 outlets 
worldwide today. For better or worse, the humble daily ritual of grabbing a 
cup of coffee has become near-synonymous with the retail chain with the 
evergreen motif. And that's a fact that really grinds the beans of more than a 
few protesters in this age of pervasive corporate branding.

</table></font>After last week's vandalizing of several Starbucks franchises in downtown 
San Francisco, the question comes up again: Why, exactly, does this company 
inspire so much ire? More than just about any other big-name brand, Starbucks 
is the brand a good many people love to hate.
<P>The reasons seem to range from the sentimental (new Starbucks storefronts 
tend to squeeze out independents) to the practical (they contribute to 
increased parking and litter problems) and the political: The activist 
organization Global Exchange claims that Starbucks has been less than 
cooperative in the effort to implement Fair Trade policies in the struggling 
coffee market.
<P>Perhaps more to the point, the company has come to represent an insidious 
sort of big-business inexorability and a particular brand of "lifestyle" 
marketing epitomized by the company's own chief product. They're not selling 
coffee so much as the "Starbucks Experience."
<P>It's a company philosophy that has proved particularly susceptible to 
criticism. McDonald's often faces resistance overseas, where it represents 
Westernization. The arrival of a Gap store in a previously "funky" 
neighborhood can be interpreted as an irreversible slide toward homogeneity. 
But few retail businesses have roused such an arsenal of resentment as the 
Seattle-cloned coffee bar.
<P>"I don't think Starbucks makes it easy to like them," says Kieron Dwyer, 
the San Francisco cartoon artist who was hit with a cease-and-desist order a 
few years ago for his parody of the Starbucks logo (featuring the words 
"Consumer Whore" encircling the familiar mermaid mascot).
<P>There's a petition circulating in Dwyer's neighborhood, the Outer Sunset 
along the N-Judah line, to try to keep a proposed Starbucks from opening. It's 
not the first time Starbucks has faced organized opposition in the city. 
Residents and shopkeepers in Hayes Valley, Cole Valley and North Beach have 
successfully lobbied to keep out the green monster.
<P>As for Global Exchange, Fair Trade Organizer Valerie Orth says the group 
coerced Starbucks into carrying Fair Trade-certified coffee in many of its 
cafes, paying farmers a competitive price. But she claims the company has 
committed to carrying less than 1 percent non-"sweatshop" coffee, a far 
smaller figure than the 5 percent Global Exchange thought it had agreed to.
<P>"We felt they negotiated in bad faith," says Orth.
<P>Still, the fast-growing company will not be deterred. "We have very visible 
real estate," says spokeswoman Audrey Lincoff. "We garner a lot of attention. 
Because of that, people feel very comfortable using Starbucks as a backdrop.
<P>"Some of the activists have said they (target us) because we are a company 
that cares. We do have a good track record of social responsibility. Perhaps 
it can never be enough for some groups."

</table></font>She takes pains to make it clear that the baristas who posed for Playboy 
will suffer no consequences from their decision.
<P>"We don't support it or endorse it," Lincoff says. "We have a very diverse 
workforce, and we embrace that diversity. We don't tell our partners" -- 
Starbucks franchises and their hires are "partners" -- "what they can and 
can't do in their personal time."
<P>It's amusing to note that the headline just below the cover teaser for the 
Starbucks girls au naturel ("Warning: Contents REALLY Hot!") calls attention 
to a Playboy investigative piece on SARS. The Starbucks phenomenon has been 
described as a kind of "virus," most notably in Naomi Klein's "No Logo," the 
bible of anti-corporate advocacy.
<P>Starbucks, the author writes, seems "to understand brand names at a level 
even deeper than Madison Avenue, incorporating marketing into every fiber of 
its corporate concept -- from the chain's strategic association with books, 
blues and jazz to its Euro-latte lingo."
<P>For some, that premeditated packaging is evil personified. The anti-
Starbucks bumper sticker ("Friends Don't Let Friends Go to Starbucks") is 
almost as widespread as the stores themselves. There's an "I Hate Starbucks" 
Web site (www.ihatestarbucks.
<P>com) run by a reclusive Virginian who goes by the initial B. ("I don't want 
to get sued," he e-mails). The chain's "evil" reputation was even parodied in 
the "Austin Powers" film series.
<P>"No matter how much they try and portray themselves as a place to kick back 
and have your triple latte," says Dwyer, the cartoonist, "they definitely have 
that viral thread running through."
<P>The company's go-go self-portrait feeds the dismaying perception that there 
is no slowing down our accelerated culture. "It's a grab-and-go sort of thing,
" says Dwyer. "They really do draw people who seem completely self-oriented. 
They're mostly single people going in, double-parking, being irritable that 
their order isn't exactly what they asked for.
<P>"And it's partly a fashion thing. It's an accessory." Special prosecutor 
Kenneth Starr, Dwyer recalls, couldn't begin his press conferences during the 
Clinton sex scandal without his morning grande.
<P>It should be noted that Dwyer readily admits to a long-standing addiction 
to Starbucks Frappuccinos -- which ended, of course, the day the lawsuit 
arrived.
<P>"I was hooked, and it was a costly way to get unhooked . . . I was making 
fun of myself and people like me when I made that parody logo."
<P>Out near Ocean Beach, local cafes such as the Corner Cup and Seabiscuit are 
concerned that an influx of Starbucks will erode their business faster than 
the California coastline.
<P>"There's a whole sociological set that happens around these locations," 
says Barb Reusch, a worker-owner at Other Avenues Food Store, one of several 
businesses circulating the petition to keep Starbucks out of the area. The 
proposed coffeehouse will attract smokers on the sidewalk, she says. It will 
cause serious parking logjams. And, from the perspective of a health food 
store, the chain's syrup-flavored, whipped-cream-topped concoctions are bad 
news: "For us, even though coffee is not especially good for you, all that 
synthetic junk is even worse."
<P>But those are all specific, debatable concerns. The real issue is one of 
aesthetics. A new Starbucks on the block will "spoil the flavor," Reusch says.
<P>"We have a real nice, old-fashioned neighborhood feel here. It's sweet, 
comfortable, inviting, not very slick. It's how a lot of neighborhood places 
used to be in San Francisco."
<P>One customer who signed the petition, Reusch recalls, suggested they tell 
the Starbucks people to "put it in the mall. That's what malls are for."
<P>Dwyer, the cartoonist, tells the story of how Starbucks became the official 
kiosk vendor of the comic book industry's biggest annual convention the very 
year his face-off with the company occurred. Fellow cartoonists would walk by 
his booth on the way back from the espresso bar, holding their Starbucks cups 
aloft.
<P>"Fight the power, dude!," they'd holler. Sympathetic to the plight of the 
little guy, they still needed that second cuppa joe to get through the 
afternoon.
<P>Whatever small victories the anti-Starbucks faction can take solace in, it 
would appear the larger battle has already been won.
<P>"We continue to be a community gathering spot wherever we are around the 
world," says Lincoff, the company spokeswoman "And we continue to find a way 
to enrich people's daily lives."
