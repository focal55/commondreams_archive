<p>The father of a British Greenpeace activist who died after falling overboard in Brazil’s Amazon rainforests today paid tribute to his “extraordinary” daughter.
<p>
Emily Craddock, 27, was working as a radio officer on the Greenpeace ship <a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international_en/ships/ship-detail?ship_id=6721" target="_new">Arctic Sunrise</a> when she vanished on December 12 as it sailed on the Xingu River, 1,500 miles north of Rio de Janeiro.
<p>
A massive sea, land and air rescue was launched but her body was found three days later.<p>

<!--/endimage/-->Today, her father Malcolm, a television executive, released a joint statement on behalf of the family and Greenpeace.<p>
It said: “Emily was a bright, shiny person who brought love and happiness into anyone’s life that she touched.<p>
“Passionate, strong and determined, with a healthy and well developed sense of natural justice, and a desire to stand up for those who have no voice, or cannot defend themselves.<p>
Ms Craddock, from Primrose Hill, north-west London, was a passionate environmentalist who joined Greenpeace at the age of nine and worked with the organisation for four years after graduating from Loughborough University.<p>
The family told of her shared love for football with her father and how she played for Tottenham Ladies.<p>
“Her sporting prowess was matched by her intellect. Aware of the power of politicians and appalled by war, her dissertation for her politics degree was on the major actors in the Arab-Israeli conflict.<p>
“The late King Hussein helped her with her research. He kindly remembered how, in Indonesia, this blonde child had introduced herself to tell him his bodyguards’ trousers were too long and made them look undignified.”<p>
Miss Craddock, who once worked as a nursery school teacher in London, was described as having “an extraordinary ability to communicate with people of all ages and walks of life”.<p>
Her body was found near Ilha Capim, close to where the Arctic Sunrise was sailing when she vanished.<p>
The ship had been sailing from Porto de Moz on the Xingu River to the Para state capital Belem.<p>
Ms Craddock had been with Arctic Sunrise on a tour of the Amazon, campaigning against logging in the area.<p>
Arrangements were being made for her body to be flown back to England as local police concluded their investigation into her death.<p>
The results will be delivered in the New Year. The circumstances are not believed to be suspicious.
