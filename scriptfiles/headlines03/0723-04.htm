<p>WASHINGTON --  It started as a one-man protest on the House
floor by a hawkish Democrat disgruntled with his president's
strategy in Iraq.
<p>   But the weekly ''Iraq Watch,'' spearheaded by Rep. Joseph
Hoeffel, has since found strength in numbers. A half-dozen
Democrats now take the floor regularly to lambaste the White House
at the start of Congress' legislative week.
<p>   ''I was frustrated,'' said Hoeffel, D-Pa. ''I thought my own
party's leadership was timid on Iraq. And I just wanted to start
talking about it   I thought we needed to be more vocal.
<p>   ''So I started on my own and found, when I started, other guys
were interested,'' Hoeffel said. ''We're gaining speed.''
<p>   The vitriol remains constant during the hourlong discussion as
the Democrats hone in on Bush administration policy, from the
search for weapons of mass destruction to sending in NATO and
United Nations peacekeepers. Some of the back-and-forth
conversation is tinged with humor, other parts with sarcasm.
<p>   Earlier this month, Rep. Rahm Emanuel, D-Ill., used the Iraq
Watch to lambaste White House finger-pointing in the State of the
Union furor over claims that Iraq was seeking uranium from Africa
for a nuclear weapons program.
<p>   The blame for that claim, which was based on a British report
and has since been challenged by U.S. intelligence officials, was
initially shouldered by CIA Director George Tenet, who said he
should have raised objections to that sentence in an advance copy
of the president's speech. On Tuesday, Stephen Hadley, President
Bush's deputy national security adviser, apologized for allowing
the report into the address.
<p>   Emanuel's beef, after Tenet apologized?
<p>   ''How one person is responsible ... as we would say back in
Chicago, that dog just will not hunt,'' railed the former Clinton
administration aide.
<p>   Quipped Rep. William Delahunt, D-Mass., one of the Iraq Watch
regulars: ''Do they really say that in Chicago?''
<p>   ''Periodically, on the northwest side, we have a couple of dogs
that hunt,'' Emanuel said.
<p>   For the most part, however, the debate seems to have fallen on
deaf ears.
<p>   Iraq Watch is held during floor time designated specifically for
Democrats, meaning that Republicans generally don't bother wading
in. Moreover, the debate usually begins in the evening, after most
lawmakers have left for the night.
<p>   Representatives of the White House and in the office of House
Majority Whip Roy Blunt, a Missouri Republican who is generally
responsible for managing the House floor, said they were unaware
Iraq Watch even existed when asked for comment.
<p>   Iraq Watch did pique the interest this week of Rep. Katherine
Harris, R-Fla., who was presiding over the chamber during the
debate on Monday.
<p>   ''A vigorous, healthy debate over the reconstruction of Iraq can
play a vital role in the long-term success of our nation's policy
in the Middle East,'' Harris said in a statement when asked about
her impressions of the debate.
<p>   She added: ''We must all ensure that such debate does not
degenerate into attacks designed to score cheap political points,
however.''
<p>   At its roots, Iraq Watch follows a well-worn path on the House
floor of lawmakers looking to shake things up, said Heritage
Foundation political analyst Michael Franc. But the most prominent
debates generally have been led by conservative Republicans   such
as former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who planted the seeds for
his 1994 Contract With America in similar floor speeches in the
mid- to late 1980s.
<p>   ''They went down every night and absolutely hammered the
policies of the then-Democratic (led) Congress,'' Franc said. Such
a tactic ''has been used more effectively by conservatives,'' he
said. ''But that's not to say there's a monopoly.''
<p>   For Hoeffel, Iraq Watch also provides a televised spotlight on
the national C-SPAN cable channel as he runs for the U.S. Senate in
Pennsylvania next year. But he insists his rhetoric is not aimed at
scoring political points, maintaining that he is unaware where his
potential Republican opponents stand on some of the debate's finer
points.
<p>   Hoeffel voted last fall to authorize the use of U.S. force in
Iraq, but has since accused the Bush administration of straining
relationships with international allies through ''cowboy
diplomacy.'' As a Senate candidate, Hoeffel will face the winner of
a Republican primary next year between incumbent Sen. Arlen
Specter, R-Pa., and Rep. Pat Toomey, R-Pa.,   both of whom also
voted to approve force in Iraq.
<p>   ''Hopefully, it's interesting for people to listen to,'' Hoeffel
said. ''They may not agree with it, but hopefully it's a discussion
that helps to educate people and bring up stuff. And we're going to
stick with it.''
