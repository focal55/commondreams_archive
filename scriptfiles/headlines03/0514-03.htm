<p>BAGHDAD -- The US-sponsored Iraqi television station began broadcasts yesterday after complaining of American censorship, including efforts to stop it from airing passages from the Koran, the Muslim holy book. 

<p>At the start of what is being trumpeted as a new broadcasting era in a nation fed on a diet of state propaganda, Baghdad residents with electricity saw the Iraqi flag appear on their screens as a pan-Arab nationalist anthem played. 

<p>Deprived of any locally produced television since US troops ousted Saddam Hussein, Iraqis watched canned interviews and decades-old music shows. 

<p>But the Iraqi Media Network postponed plans to air a half-hour live news program because of disputes over editorial control. 

<p>''As journalists we will not submit to censorship,'' said Dan North, a Canadian documentary maker advising Iraqis at the station, which plans two hours of programming a night for viewers. 

<p>''This whole idea was about starting the genesis of an open media, so we will not accept an outside source scrutinizing what we produce.'' 

<p>The allegations of censorship could reaffirm for many Iraqis the perception that Washington is not allowing them a free hand in building democratic institutions. 

<p>''All my neighbors say this TV is controlled by the Americans to get out their point of view,'' said Abbas Mohammed, a cakemaker. ''But I don't care there was no news. In Iraq the news is always bad.'' 

<p>US officials made no comment on the censorship allegations. They had earlier said the station would be a welcome change from the Hussein era. 

<p>''This is not American propaganda. This is the first time in 25 years Iraqis are getting TV that is not propaganda,'' said Robert Teasdale, a US adviser to the network. 

<p>But North said the US-led administration's Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance had requested the station's news programs be reviewed by the wife of Jalal Talabani, a Kurdish leader and a major figure in the postwar politics of Iraq. ''Could you imagine a political leader being able to check the content of any Western media?'' North said. 

<p>The news program would be postponed for a week because of the wrangling, said North, himself hired by the Office of Reconstruction. 

<p>The network did air verses from the Koran, a tradition in Middle Eastern countries. Iraqi workers had threatened to walk out if the verses were dropped at the behest of the Office of Reconstruction. 

<p>An eleventh-hour programming change yesterday cut an address by Jay Garner, who was replaced as US administrator in Iraq. 

<p>The station broadcast canned packages, including an interview with an electricity official and soundbites from Iraqis outside a hospital complaining of a lack of medicine.
