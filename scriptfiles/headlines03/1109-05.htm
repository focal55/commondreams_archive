<p>SAO PAULO, Brazil -- While visiting families who've staked out cramped rooms 
as homes in an abandoned office building, grassroots organizer Luiz "Gege" Gonzaga 
da Silva explains why he's campaigning for Brazil to exit free-trade talks with 
the United States. <p>"If the whole country is pushed down, the one on the bottom 
gets pushed down further," said the housing activist. <p>In a conference room 
overlooking Manhattan-like canyons of skyscrapers, Sao Paulo Federation of Industries 
manager Romao Luiz Parolin braces for tough U.S. rivals under free-trade, touting 
new services to help Brazilian companies. <p>"They're an elephant compared to 
us," Parolin said of the U.S. economy, 10 times the size of Brazil's and with 
almost 20 times the trade. <p>When trade ministers from 34 countries gather next 
week in Miami to debate details for free trade across the Americas, talks will 
revolve around the region's two largest countries -- the United States and Brazil. 
<p>But Brazilians from the slums to the boardrooms share similar concerns: How 
can their nation, an emerging middleweight, find ways to compete and negotiate 
with the world's economic superpower on a level playing field? <p>Brazil has substantial 
clout. It ranks as the world's fifth-largest nation in land and people, among 
the top 10 economies worldwide, and it ranks as a powerhouse in soy, citrus, steel, 
small jets and other products. <p>But that weight still pales against U.S. might. 
<p><B>Farming powerhouse </B><p>The challenge for Brasilia is persuading Washington 
to craft a "balanced" Free Trade Area of the Americas pact, or FTAA, that reflects 
more than the U.S. agenda. The pact would slash import duties, loosen investment 
rules and cut other trade barriers among all countries in the Americas, except 
Cuba, by 2005. <p>Brazil has been forceful in setting its own priorities, playing 
tit-for-tat when Washington rejects its requests. <p>U.S.-Brazil tensions over 
FTAA now run so high that many analysts expect only a watered-down pact. Meetings 
between their top trade officials produced no new breakthroughs in Washington 
this weekend. <p>"We're not going to run away from the negotiating table," Brazil's 
President Luiz Inancio Lula da Silva told reporters in late October. "The question 
isn't `yes' or `no' to FTAA, but to define which FTAA interests us." <p>Brazil's 
key interest is agriculture. As a farming powerhouse, it sees the pact as a way 
to sell more crops to the United States, the world's largest consumer market. 
Those sales are limited today by hefty U.S. government farm supports, including 
$180 billion over 10 years in the latest farm bill. Brazil wants those subsidies 
cut. <p>But Washington claims subsidies must be discussed in worldwide trade talks, 
not in FTAA negotiations, since Europe and Japan also heavily subsidize their 
crops. Global trade talks broke down in Mexico over the issue. <p>Brazilians worry 
they'll be sold those subsidized crops, as Mexico has been under North American 
Free Trade Agreement, NAFTA. Those U.S. grain sales have been blamed for undercutting 
Mexican farmers and forcing them off their land. <p>"I watch TV, and I see what 
happened in Mexico," said slum dweller Rosemeire Ferreira Leite, 36, who shares 
a single room with her husband and three children, a sheet of clear plastic serving 
as a window pane. "I see how Mexican farmers are protesting, how food prices were 
up. I don't want that for Brazil." <p><B>Call for `clearer rules' </B><p>Separately, 
Brazil wants assurances that if it boosts sales of products, like steel, to the 
United States, it won't be unjustly penalized. Brazilians say the U.S. system 
that now handles complaints against foreign companies for "dumping" goods at unfair 
prices tends to favor U.S. producers, <p>"The United States adopts many arbitrary 
ways to define things in dumping cases," such as dismissing information supplied 
by Brazilian companies as irrelevant, said Sandra Rios, an economist at the Brazil's 
National Industry Council. "We want to have clearer rules." <p>But Washington 
rejects that request too, leaving it for world trade talks and outside FTAA. <p>On 
imports, Brazil also wants to protect some of its more sheltered industries from 
a potential flood of goods, services and investment from larger, more efficient 
and better financed U.S. companies. <p>Unlike other Latin American nations with 
small domestic markets, Brazil developed a significant manufacturing base -- from 
consumer electronics to cars to software -- by offering incentives for companies 
to produce for the local market, now 182 million residents. Many of those firms 
are not ready to compete unshielded, nor can they swiftly adapt to start selling 
abroad. <p>"We still have a culture to supply the internal market, not to export," 
said Brazil-born Jair Almeida, president of Miami-based PHN Group, which specializes 
in trade with Brazil. <p><B>`Don't dominate us' </B><p>Yet negotiating with a 
superpower remains tough. <p>Playing divide-and-conquer, Washington has started 
to forge separate free-trade accords with some Latin nations. That means that 
rivals from other countries might get duty-free access to the United States, while 
Brazil still pays taxes. <p>"If we don't participate in this process, we will 
lose preferences to other countries," said economist Rios. <p>The Bush administration's 
"with-us or against-us" style also extends to trade talks, with U.S. officials 
at tense moments calling Brazil a "won't do" nation and suggesting it trade with 
Antarctica. <p>"Woo us, don't dominate us," said Brazilian lawyer Paulo Miranda 
with Akerman Senterfitt law firm in Miami. <p>Plus, Brazil lacks other pressing 
issues with Washington -- like Mexico has on immigration or Colombia on drugs 
-- that could command U.S. attention and wring out more concessions. <p>To counter 
and boost its clout, Brazil is looking beyond the Americas too, seeking a free-trade 
accord with Europe and deals with other nations. <p>Within the FTAA, it's also 
teaming up with neighbors including Argentina to push its agenda. <p>Plus, it's 
suggested tit-for-tat that certain U.S. requests be taken out of FTAA talks and 
moved to global talks, including action to open its government bids to more U.S. 
firms. <p>Still, with the odds so uneven, some labor and grassroots groups say 
Brazil should pull out. <p>In the fall of 2002, about 150,000 volunteers collected 
10 million "votes" against FTAA. This year, they submitted petitions with 2 million 
signatures to Brazil's Congress seeking a referendum on whether to proceed with 
the FTAA. <p><B>Strong vs. weak </B> <p>The campaign organizers gathered recently 
in an austere Catholic community center in Sao Paulo to plan new strategies against 
FTAA, including rallies to coincide with talks in Miami next week. The opponents 
see little hope for balance in free trade. <p>"The free market by itself has never 
closed gaps. Instead it increases the strength of force of the strong and reduces 
the strength of the weak, " said Jesuit priest Bernardo Lestienne, 57, a Frenchman 
living 15 years in Brazil who runs a cultural center in Brasilia. "There's no 
equality in this relationship with the United States." <p>Instead, Lestienne suggested 
a different model for linking markets in the Americas along European lines, with 
richer countries giving massive funds directly to poorer ones to help bring fellow 
members up to more equal levels. <p>All the talk means little for now, however, 
to many in the slums of a nation with the worst income distribution in the Americas. 
<p>"Free trade in 2005?" said Daniela Ferreira da Silva, a 22-year-old mother 
of three who never finished junior high and cleans homes when she can find jobs.
