<p>A key committee of the US Congress is preparing to issue a damning criticism of the quality of intelligence on Iraq before the war. 
 
<p>According to the Washington Post newspaper, the Senate Intelligence Committee will focus its criticism on the CIA and its director, George Tenet. 

<p>But the report is already being seen as an attempt by the Republicans in Congress to deflect blame from the White House.

  </table></font>According to the Washington Post, the Senate Intelligence Committee will be highly critical of intelligence it believes over-stated the case against Saddam Hussein. 

<p>The committee will attack the quality of evidence on Iraq weapons of mass destruction and its alleged links with terrorism. 

<p>Members of the committee were, apparently, surprised by the amount of circumstantial evidence, and the quantity of information that was disputed or had only one source. 

<p>"The executive was ill-served by the intelligence community," the chairman of the committee, Republican Senator Pat Roberts, told the Washington Post. 

<p>"I worry about the credibility of the intelligence community," he added. 

<p><b>'Holdover'
</b>
<p>But Democrats are deeply unhappy with the draft report. They are trying to hear more evidence from members of the Bush administration, and want publication of the report delayed. 

<p>For the Republicans, Mr Tenet is a particularly useful target for criticism . He's one of the few so-called "holdovers" - a Clinton appointee who survived the change of president. 

<p>As that might suggest, he is a particularly astute political player, and has shown himself willing to take the blame in previous rows over the intelligence against Iraq. 

<p>It also makes him a useful scapegoat for the administration. 

<p>The Republicans would like this argument closed as soon as possible, well before the election season is into full swing. 

<p>But what is likely to happen now is some complicated procedural manoeuvring. But the Democrats have the necessary votes to retaliate by opening a new inquiry, looking more directly at the failings of the administration. 

<p>In any case, intelligence committees in Congress have traditionally acted in a more bi-partisan fashion. 

<p><b>Blame game
</b>
<p>For its part, the CIA is also now defending its corner. 

<p>This is one of the few intelligence agencies to have a press office and a spokesman. 

<p>The spokesman, Bill Harlow, said the committee still hadn't fully heard the CIA's side of the case or taken up an offer from George Tenet to appear. 

<p>So as the election approaches, the blame game can only intensify. 

<p>The stakes are different from Britain, where the issue has sometimes threatened the very position of the Prime Minister, Tony Blair. 

<p>Most Americans still support the original decision to go to war with Iraq, and were less concerned about the details of its weapons of mass destruction. 

<p>What they are more interested in now, is the continued cost of occupying Iraq. 

<p>But the case for war is still a hot political issue that refuses to go away.
