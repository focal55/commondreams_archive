<p>A week today more than half a million people are expected to converge on the center of London in a huge demonstration of opposition to war in Iraq. Organizers are predicting it will dwarf last September's Countryside Alliance march. Guardian reporters spent an evening with anti-war campaigners to produce a vivid snapshot of grassroots opposition to the war across Britain.

</table></font>Owen McMillan, 36, a council housing officer in a monk's outfit, was enjoying his first outing as the angel of death. He is normally to be found lobbying his MP outside the House of Commons. His plastic scythe had disappeared into the crowd of solicitors, doctors, artists and Iraqi exiles here to witness the maiden voyage of Birmingham Stop the War coalition's new investment, a &#163;1,000 mini-airship with banner attached.  <P>Support is growing so fast for the Birmingham coalition, with so many people signing standing orders, it can hardly cope with logistics. City center petitions average 1,000 signatures an hour. There are group meetings in every Birmingham ward: one attracted 500 people last Saturday night. The coalition is an unexpected mix of tens of thousands of socialists and raging rightwingers, Muslims, Sikhs, devoted Christians and atheists. At least 12,000 people are booked on 200 coaches to London for next Saturday's rally. The group is considering hiring trains to meet demand.  

<P>At the center of the campaign is Salma Jaqoob, 31, a Muslim psychotherapist from Birmingham who was spat on in the street after September 11. She formed the coalition in protest at belligerence after the New York attacks. Her three small children are with her at protests. "The size of support is unprecedented," she said.  

<P>Echoing another Birmingham campaign group, Artists Against the War, Luke Perry, 19, an art student from Stourbridge, had heaved his vast sculpture into Victoria Square to sit beneath the balloon. It was a reworking of Michelangelo's Piet&#224;, substituting Christ with a woman in a burqa. It was called Bella Detesta Matribus - War, the Horror of Mothers. "I thought if I gave it a Latin title, people would take it more seriously," he said.  <P>Brenda Burrell, 50, who had been stitching almost all of Birmingham's CND banners, said: "I was at Greenham Common where we were terrified of nuclear war. I'm more scared today. There is no sense of social justice in this war against Iraq."  <P>A lone dissenting voice came from a 60-year-old, Finnish ex-UN official. "You have been manipulated," she muttered at the leafleting students, then swiftly wove her way out of the crowd.

Apolo Murciano scooped a dollop of black paint from a plastic tub and spread it thickly across the flat framed screen in front of him. With a broad wooden scraper, he coaxed the paint back and forward before lifting the screen to survey his handiwork.  <P>The white T-shirt underneath now bore the dark imprint of a student, capped and gowned, holding aloft a degree certificate as a faceless soldier aimed a rifle at him. Student's (sic) Against War, said the logo.  <P>It was early evening in the textile print lab of Edinburgh College of Art. Most of the undergraduates were long gone, but Apolo, 28, a third-year student of sculpture; Jim Hayton, 24, the president of the college students' union; and Bridget Farmer, 24, a postgraduate student of jewelery, had stayed behind to put their skills to political use. There were 50 T-shirts to be printed and handed out before February 15.  

<P>"I think it's totally shameful," said Apolo. "I have been watching the news, reading the papers. The evidence is not enough; even with evidence it does not justify a bombing of Iraq, ever. Even if they found mass destruction arms, it does not justify a war."  <P>It was Apolo and Jim who came up with the design for the shirts. Jim was flustered. He had been trying to coordinate a week of anti-war campaigning on campus and had just wiped inky fingers across one of the pristine T-shirts. Down in the canteen, the anti-war petition had just 17 signatures. Jim, an architecture student, said they had another one that was completely filled.  <P>"Next week we're having this campaign, calling it Make Love not War. I know it's been said before but the point is to raise the debate about the whole issue, there is a kind of college-wide disquiet opposed to military action."  <P>"This is a kind of crucial moment for this country," said Apolo. "The US will not go to war if the UK don't support them. Us, these institutions, we have a voice and we want that voice to be heard."

A rainbow-colored banner hangs over the Stop the War stall in the entrance to the students' union building at the University of Manchester. In the middle is printed the word 'pace' and below that is a hand-written note: "This is the Italian for peace!!!"  

<P>"The banner was given to us by an Italian lecturer," said anti-war campaigner and drama student Kate Kirkpatrick. She apologized that on flyers advertising the big demo in London February is spelt Febraury and then sprinted out on to Oxford Road to dish them out so fast that the paper became a blur.  

<P>"The majority of people in this country don't want this war," she added, with a passion you thought students had forgotten. "Tony Blair has not even discussed it in parliament.  <P>"The war won't be stopped if people don't get on their feet to protest. I'll be in London on February 15 and so will my granddad who's a vicar."  

<P>She and colleagues aim to fill 10 buses and three minibuses with 550 (or more) students ferrying them down the M6, and are selling bus tickets coded pink, blue, green or yellow to cover different pick-up points.  <P>The operation is masterminded by James Thorne, 28, a postgraduate student of Roman history and a former tank commander and UN peacekeeper.  <P>"There has been no change in my ethos since I left the army," he said. "Then I wanted to serve my country and protect democracy and that's why I am involved in this now."  <P>Mr Thorne, who describes himself as a communitarian and socialist, said his job in promoting the cause of peace on the biggest student campus in Europe had been greatly helped by the backing of the students' union. He is hoping for a huge turnout next week.  <P>"If numbers reach the million mark and Blair still goes ahead &#91;with the war&#93;, we will have done everything we can and will have gained a licence for civil disobedience."  <P>That could involve blocking traffic, targeting military infrastructure or even trespassing on bases.

A mild turn in the weather had thawed the snow and smudged out Mike Barrett's vast CND symbol, trampled out in a field high above Hebden Bridge. But the warm(ish) evening also brought out twice the usual crowd who gather for the town's weekly "traffic light vigil" calling for a peaceful solution in Iraq.  <P>Commuters from Halifax, Leeds and Manchester tooted impressively frequent support, only one small Fiat 500 packed with large youths yelling out: "Nuke the bastards." Candles flickered as the sun dipped over the narrow defile in Calderdale, a perfect place to catch busy drivers and the protesters' own neighbors, clambering off the buses and chatting outside the Trades Club.  

<P>"We've had tremendous abuse in the past," said retired French teacher Barbara Green, 76, who is bombarding President Jacques Chirac with postcards of support from her cottage in the   hilltop Methodist stronghold of Heptonstall. "During the Gulf war and the occupation of Palestine, we had small vigils and there was plenty of hostility and apathy. But the mood's different now. Just listen to all those hoots."  <P>A few yards down the pavement, beyond a banner showing a startlingly long list of countries bombed by the US since 1945, Josh Fenton voiced the skepticism about George Bush that has broadened the peace movement's support.  

<P>"He's really struggling over these tenuous links between the Iraqi regime and al-Qaida," he said. "I don't have any time for either of them, obviously, but one's very secular and the other's very fundamentalist and it doesn't add up."  <P>Halfway through a gap year, Josh, 19, left the local Calder High school last summer and starts a politics course at Liverpool in the autumn. His political assessment of the crisis is that the UN must be resolute - but against US bullying as much as Iraqi subterfuge.  <P>Another knot of banner-holders included Juliette Taylor, a local advice bureau worker who has helped to get a loose local alliance called Calderdale Against the War off the ground. Word spreads rapidly through a telephone tree, she said, which has galvanized activists in the West Yorkshire valley and already filled six Calderdale buses for next Saturday's London demonstration.  

<P>As traffic tailed off at 6.15pm, the next Hebden Bridge vigil was agreed for Monday evening, before Barbara Green nipped off to buy some more postcards to send to Mr Chirac, using her immaculately accurate French. Josh meanwhile passed on his favorite Gandhi quote to a couple of evening shoppers: "You may never know the result that comes from your actions, but if you do nothing, there will be no result."

Lumbering estate cars honked, gleaming BMWs tooted and a black cab gave a prolonged blast. Even a white van man leant on his horn as he passed.  <P>If the response to their "hoot for peace" sign was typical, Bristol is firmly on the side of its Stop the War campaigners. The coalition has held vigils in the center every night of the week except Sundays since September 14 2001. Their persistence is paying off.  

<P>"Mostly, people have been supportive, and they've been becoming more supportive, especially in the last week and a half," said Heidi Walter, 37. "People come up and admit they've ignored us for months but now realize why we are here and want to know what they can do."  

<P>Their numbers fell to one or two protesters a night at their lowest ebb, early last year, and rose to 500 when Tony Benn came to speak. On Thursday night there were just over 20 of them, waving placards which neatly summarized their diverse concerns: Welfare not Warfare; Go to Hell - We Won't Fight for Shell; No War - Think of Other Solutions, and Justice for Palestine.  

<P>"I was an aid worker in Bosnia; I know some wars are worth fighting. This isn't one of them," said Martin Summers, 43.  <P>Lois Atherden, 84, who grew up "in the shadow of the first world war", disagreed. "Weaponry has developed to a state where any war for any reason makes no sense at all. We have to find another answer," she said.  <P>There were anarchists and pacifists there; Quakers and Catholics; students and pensioners. The latter have formed the backbone of the vigils; this week, ages ranged from 21 to 84, but most were over 40. They say that students, families and young Asian men and women tend to attend weekend vigils and local protests.  <P>The group is one of the most active in the country and is sending more than 30 coachloads of marchers to the demonstration in London. Members have protested outside the US air force base at Fairford, Gloucestershire, and will join a big demonstration there on March 22 when, as they point out, the war may well have begun.  <P>"We will have stopped it by then," one campaigner joked, to cynical laughter. They are convinced they have right and the public on their side. But they also appear convinced that war is now inevitable.

At first sight, it seemed they could be dismissed by Tony Blair as a group of the "usual suspects" - peace campaigners and CND activists opposed to UK involvement in any war. But while the prime minister was facing a largely hostile audience high above in the Baltic contemporary arts center, a small demonstration below on the Gateshead millennium bridge was attracting considerable interest.  

<P>Megaphones blaring and whistles blowing, the Tyneside Stop the War Coalition was soon joined by an assortment of other groups from Geordie Kids Say No to War, to a few lawyers and office workers keen to register their disgust. Departing visitors from the Baltic, a tourist attraction, even volunteered for small posters proclaiming, above a symbol of a dove overlaid on the new bridge: No War on Iraq - Not in my name.  <P>"I feel more strongly about this than any other issue for many years," said a middle-aged floating voter who confessed to being largely uninterested in politics. "I haven't met anyone in favor of going to war. Where is it going to end?"  

<P>Buoyed by the prime minister's rough ride in front of hostile and skeptical Geordies on the BBC's Newsnight, the Tyneside protesters insisted their website was getting inquiries from a broad range of opinions and backgrounds. "We had a public meeting last weekend and a huge variety were there, people from professional backgrounds, the churches and ordinary folk," said Safina Siddique, one of the Organizers"Whole family groups are coming," added Lottie Hann, a university administrator.  

<P>They are people like Roberta Allen, whose children Annalisa, 13, and Danielle, 15, made the Geordie Kids Say No to War banner. "The children are very worried," said Roberta.  <P>As the chorus outside the Baltic intensified - "George Bush, Blair and Straw, we don't want your bloody war" - lawyer George Vickers, another organizer, insisted they could have mobilized many more with longer notice. Not surprisingly, the venue for the Blair debate was deliberately kept secret, with news only filtering out at the last minute.  

<P>Over the past few weeks, small rallies have been held in central Newcastle and other nearby towns while four days ago a group of protesters leafleted local petrol stations with "BP - Blair's Petroleum" posters. "We are coming across people who have never demonstrated before, appalled and frightened and saying they have to do something," said Nova Brockbank, a teacher.  <P>Deborah Still, another lawyer, said her parents, in their 70s - "Labour voters, quite rightwing on issues like asylum seekers" - were typical of many. "They are against the war and say they haven't spoken to anyone in favor of it."  

<P>For next weekend, the Tyneside coalition alone has managed to fill seven buses for the London demonstration, although they expect that many more protesters will make their way independently. "Opinion is definitely hardening," said George Vickers.

The last hymn sung in the Bloomsbury central baptist church in Shaftesbury Avenue was, suitably, no 572: Heal Your Children's Warring Madness, but tonight four short sermons by minor trade unionists were billed, to be followed by a discussion and a drink.  <P>There was no sense of a nation rising against its masters, however. Twenty minutes after the Euston coalition against the war's evening meeting should have started, only three speakers had arrived and there were just five in the congregation. Outside, a few people leafleted the public and chewed over Colin Powell's theatricals in the UN.  <P>But the Organizers were chipper, reporting unprecedented grassroots disillusion, even anger, at Mr Blair's pro-war stance. "All the years I've been building for protests, I've never known anything like this," said Sandy, a Unison worker at the School of African and Oriental studies. "The interest is far greater than the poll tax. Anecdotally, everyone, not just the usual suspects, is saying they will march on the 15th. People are just not convinced of the justness or need for war. They don't need to come to meetings any more. They've weighed up the arguments and know where they stand."  

<P>"Even the anti-poll tax opposition didn't resonate as deeply as this in the public," said Andrew Baisley. "I've had senior surgeons, old people, students all asking how they can get involved. People are asking for wads of leaflets they can distribute themselves. I've never known anything on this scale in London. There's a degree of real anger out there."  <P>When the meeting started there were 25 in the hall. The speakers called for a war against poverty rather than a war against Iraq, and questioned how Britain could spend billions torching Iraq but deny its firefighters &#163;8 an hour. One man predicted a major split in the Labour party. "There's a deep understanding that there's something rotten about this war," said one man in the audience, to cheers.  <P>"It's nice being in the majority for once," said Megan, an IT worker in a big publishing house. "People really feel this is undemocratic and that the only way they can have a say is to take to the streets. I've never ever had a political discussion in my workplace and now I find three out of five people in my section are going to march next week. I'm amazed at what is happening."<br>
