<p>KAMCHATKA PENINSULA, Russia — There are parts of the world so wild, so distant 
from places inhabited by men, that when things happen, they happen without witnesses. 
The traces slowly disappear; they melt with the snow in spring, get washed away 
by rain, carried off by ravens. Eventually, it becomes unclear whether they happened 
at all. <p>Such a thing happened here. <p>Charlie Russell closed up his cabin 
at Kambalnoye Lake, on the remote tip of the Kamchatka Peninsula in Russia's Far 
East, and said goodbye for the winter to the bears he had studied for seven years. 
<p>There were 20 in all. Among them: Brandy, who often left her three cubs with 
Russell for baby-sitting while she went fishing. Walnut, a young male. Biscuit, 
whom Russell had raised as a cub and who, pregnant with her own offspring, would 
sometimes come bounding to greet him when he landed his plane, brushing against 
his leg or nibbling his boot. <p>Russell left last November for his home in Canada, 
confident that the bears would soon be safe in their snow-shrouded slumber. He 
returned, as usual, in spring. But instead of finding Biscuit emerging with blinking 
cubs from her den, all he found was stillness. <p>Biscuit did not appear. Nor 
did Walnut or Brandy or any of the bears. Russell searched for two months without 
finding a trace of any of them. What he did find, when he opened his cabin, was 
a bear's gallbladder, hung from a nail on the wall. <p>What had happened during 
those weeks before impenetrable drifts of snow settled over the valley, before 
the bears would have lumbered off to the safety of their dens? Who left the gruesome 
artifact on the wall, and was it an oversight or a message? And the question that 
haunts Russell most of all: Did Biscuit walk up to greet her killers? <p>Kamchatka 
prosecutor Alexander Voitovich is investigating the case as a poaching. The "mass 
killing" of an estimated 20 bears, he said, appears to have been the result of 
a search for gallbladders, whose contents are valued in Asia for use in folk medicines. 
"There is a strong possibility that we will solve this ugly crime very soon," 
he said. <p>But Russell and others who work around Kamchatka's famous brown bears 
aren't so sure. For one, it is not clear why someone who wanted gallbladders would 
have wasted one on Russell's cabin wall. For another, a lot of people had reason 
to resent Russell. <p>In fact, singling out someone who might have wanted to send 
a warning to the Alberta rancher — who helped uncover corruption in the Kamchatka 
government, warred with the local scientific establishment and organized measures 
to thwart the region's billion-dollar poaching industry — is like trying to find 
the bad bean in a pot of chili. <p>"This was obviously an action to prevent Charlie 
from doing his work. And it achieved its result," said Alexei Maslov, a scientist 
who has worked frequently in the South Kamchatka Wildlife Reserve, where Russell's 
project was based. <p>"It was a demonstration of power," added Maslov's wife, 
Ekaterina Lepskaya, also a scientist. "They demonstrated that they own the lake, 
not Charlie." <p>A strategic Soviet military region that was closed to outsiders 
through most of the last century, the Kamchatka Peninsula has remained one of 
the world's most vital stretches of wilderness, a primeval landscape of steaming, 
snow-covered volcanoes and black-sand beaches. Up to a quarter of all wild salmon 
in the Pacific spawn in its cold rivers. Brown bears up to 10 feet tall roam in 
untouched birch forests and tundra berry meadows. <p>Now international conservation 
organizations regard it as one of the most threatened of the world's natural treasures. 
The United Nations has placed parts of Kamchatka on its list of World Heritage 
sites, which are eligible for international protection because of their universal 
value. The U.N., with other organizations, will spend more than $13 million over 
the next several years to protect Kamchatka from the hazards of rural Russia's 
post-perestroika meltdown. <p>The poaching to which Russell's bears probably fell 
victim has become a potent economic engine on the 1,000-mile peninsula. Riverbanks 
this summer and fall were littered with dead salmon cast aside by villagers who 
had stripped them of eggs to be sold as red caviar. Fishermen in the Okhotsk Sea 
off Kamchatka routinely ignore their fishing quotas, and bears — already shot 
at the rate of up to 1,000 a year, both legally and illegally — will face critical 
food shortages if the salmon poaching isn't stopped, biologists say. <p>"The federal 
government is so preoccupied with macroeconomic problems, it doesn't even occur 
to them what is really happening on the outskirts of Russia," said Robert S. Moiseyev, 
a Kamchatka economist. "In Moscow, they give us directives to manage the Okhotsk 
Sea. But in reality, the Okhotsk Sea is being pillaged by everybody." <p>As a 
Soviet military outpost, Kamchatka had a robust fish-processing industry and state 
farms that produced milk, meat and vegetables for markets all over Russia. But 
the post-Soviet economic collapse hit here hard. Even as military forces drew 
down, the economic transition led to the closure of most state farms and fish 
plants. <p>Now there are entire villages without a single job, and the regional 
government, officially bankrupt, announced recently that it couldn't afford to 
buy sufficient fuel for the coming winter. Many apartment buildings and most schools 
are without heat. It is perhaps not surprising that most Kamchatkans are losing 
little sleep over poached fish or dead bears. <p>"In summer, everybody's fishing. 
And if you get enough caviar, you sell it. We have to survive, and that's the 
only way," said Yuri Slobodchikov, who once worked as a cattle breeder at a state 
farm in the village of Sokoch. Now the farm is a mass of crumbling, abandoned 
barns, and Slobodchikov is unemployed. <p>Wildlife managers say bears — harvested 
legally at the rate of 500 a year — often die at the hands of American and European 
hunters, who pay $8,000 or more to hunt a big male trophy bear. "American hunters 
would come, they were 70 or 80 years old. They were hunters with poor eyesight," 
said one former hunting guide, who said he quit because the abuses "made me sick." 
<p>An industry has grown up around guiding foreign hunters to their targets, but 
critics say even the legal hunts are often conducted using illegal tactics. <p>Helicopters, 
the former guide said, were routinely used to drive bears into killing zones. 
The illegal practice is particularly controversial in Kamchatka because it allows 
trophy hunters to eliminate the biggest bears and poachers to kill large numbers. 
<p>"It happened often. Very often," he said. "You could ask American clients. 
They don't admit it. But 90% had their bear shot with a helicopter, and of course, 
I took part in this kind of thing many times. We shot them even directly from 
the helicopters. It was not very pleasant." <p>Moiseyev says an entire generation 
in Kamchatka is being raised with a new indifference to the region's resources. 
<p>"For 12 years now, children have been growing up in families in which their 
parents have no other job but illegally catching fish. How are we going to get 
them back to a normal economy? It has become not an economic problem but a moral 
problem," he said. "God save us from living in an epoch when an entire country 
is stolen from you. Because it steals human souls." <p>Side by Side With Bears 
<p>Russell and his partner, artist Maureen Enns, were not unaware of the dangers 
facing Kamchatka wildlife when they arrived for their first summer in 1996. But 
it was only here that they could realize their dream of living side by side with 
wild brown bears and raising orphaned cubs — which would not have been sanctioned 
in North America. <p>Russell, 61, grew up on a ranch at the border of Alberta 
and Montana. He had spent 18 years studying North American grizzlies, seen their 
habitat diminishing and wanted to find ways to enable humans and bears to live 
in harmony. <p>Even in Kamchatka, the endeavor was difficult. The couple won reluctant 
permission from local officials to launch their study, and when they began to 
succeed, they attracted funding from a variety of foundations in the U.S. and 
Canada. <p>Russell wanted to prove that brown bears — Kamchatka's are larger but 
otherwise identical to the widely feared North American grizzly — could coexist 
peaceably with humans, so long as people adhered to a protocol of respect and 
caution. <p>Russell rejected the conventional wisdom that bears need to maintain 
a healthy fear of people and that those who become too accustomed to humans will 
inevitably display aggression and end up being shot. <p>"Bears tend to like to 
be around people. A lot of them do, anyway," he said. "So these bears often come 
toward people when they meet them on a trail … and that makes people uncomfortable." 
<p>Russell hoped his work in Kamchatka would answer two questions: Are brown bears 
as unpredictable as most biologists believe? And are bears that lose their fear 
of people invariably dangerous? <p>Russell and Enns chose one of two federally 
managed wildlife reserves in Kamchatka as their base, built a cabin and began 
quiet interactions with bears. Over the vehement objections of local scientists, 
they adopted three orphaned cubs and raised them as essentially wild, encouraging 
them as they grew to feed themselves and roam the surrounding hills. <p>Biscuit 
and the other orphans, Chico and Rosie, would disappear for days at a time, then 
reappear to seek out Russell's company for walks or play. Several other bears 
seemed to grow comfortable around the couple, allowing them to walk the trails 
with them or watch them fish. <p>"Some of the bears would come and sort of invite 
us on a walk. They'd come to the cabin, and if we made a move to get our pack 
ready, they would kind of wait for us," said Russell, who wrote about his project 
in a popular book, "Grizzly Heart." <p>Rosie was killed by a large male bear early 
on, and Chico disappeared in 2000, possibly to strike out for new territory. Biscuit, 
Russell hoped, was going to present him with her first cubs last spring. <p>As 
his friendships with the bears progressed, Russell racked up enemies as well. 
In his plane, he frequently spotted large-scale fish poaching along the rivers, 
and one of his reports resulted in charges against a prominent local official. 
He reported poachers trapping a large male bear in a snare, then leaving it to 
storm and bleat for days to increase the volume of valuable bile in its gallbladder. 
<p>Russell managed to raise more than $25,000 a year from North American contributors 
to support new rangers in the southern reserve, supplementing their salaries — 
most earn about $83 a month — and building new cabins to house them. But he also 
managed to alienate potential allies in the Russian scientific community, who 
had opposed his petition to raise the cubs and saw him as a foolhardy amateur. 
<p>One of Russell's main adversaries was the man with whom he probably had more 
in common than anyone in Kamchatka: Vitaly Nikolayenko, a ranger and amateur scientist 
who had spent 25 years living with bears on the 2.8 million-acre Kronotsky state 
reserve, 110 miles north of Petropavlovsk. The reserve is one of two managed by 
the federal government in Kamchatka. The south Kamchatka reserve, where Russell 
operated, is more remote. <p>Nikolayenko had made a life's work of harassing poachers 
and monitoring bears, naming them and chronicling their habits. For 22 years, 
Nikolayenko followed an enormous male he named Dobrynya, forming such an easy 
bond that the bear would often curl up for a nap just a few feet from him. <p>Russell 
and Nikolayenko clashed when the Russian ranger was called in to review Russell's 
project. <p>Nikolayenko strongly objected to feeding the half-grown cubs, arguing 
that it rendered the research meaningless and had the potential to make the cubs 
dangerously eager for human handouts. <p>Russell felt the cubs needed the kind 
of nourishment they would have received from their mother to make them strong 
enough to fend off predators. The men argued bitterly throughout their acquaintance. 
<p>But they perhaps also wound up having something tragically in common. Dobrynya 
disappeared in 2001, sometime after Nikolayenko saw the bear to its den and stood 
by as it fell into deep sleep. <p>Dobrynya was not seen in the spring, nor during 
all of 2002. When Nikolayenko returned to his cabin this spring, he found large 
tufts of hair and bones — obviously the remains of an enormous male bear — less 
than two feet from his window. <p>It could have been a bear injured in a fight, 
but why so close to his cabin? <p>"I think it was my old Dobrynya who came and 
died near my hut, early in spring, when I was not there," Nikolayenko said. <p>"I 
try not to think about it, but sometimes I can't help but see him injured and 
bleeding, running to my hut for help when I am not there." <p>The bear, he said, 
"was the main thing in my life…. I just can't bear the thought that he was killed 
like this, by poachers or somebody who doesn't like what I am doing here and doesn't 
want me to be here anymore." <p>Painful Solitude <p>Nikolayenko's cabin is stuffed 
with notebooks, the record of his daily journeys around the reserve. He is 65, 
and his leg is deeply scarred from a poacher's shot several years ago. Still, 
he walks six miles a day — across the meadow, over the river, up to the spring-fed 
lake from which the river flows. He counts the number of chum salmon in the lake, 
scuffs at the abundant piles of fresh scat to see what the bears have been eating. 
He meets bears — often half a dozen times a day — and quietly watches from the 
reeds as they leap and splash in the river 30 feet away. <p>Nikolayenko's notebooks 
fill three walls, and though they constitute a remarkable documentary of bear 
behavior, it is unlikely, given budget cutbacks at the reserve over the past decade, 
that they will ever be widely published. <p>"It is sad for me to realize that 
what I am doing here, I am largely doing just for myself," he said. <p>The solitude, 
in fact, has usually been the undoing of those appointed to watch over the reserves, 
Nikolayenko notes. "One inspector hanged himself. Three drank themselves to death. 
People can't stand being lonely. <p>"It gets to the point that they can't even 
stand themselves. There have been moments when I began to read aloud because I 
was afraid I would forget how to speak. And when the bears are asleep, who do 
I talk to?" <p>Unlike Russell, who never even fired his pepper spray, Nikolayenko 
has fallen down bluffs to avoid charging bears and been chased up trees. He helped 
conduct an inquiry after Michio Hoshino, the renowned Japanese American bear photographer, 
was pulled out of his tent and eaten by a bear in 1996 in the southern reserve. 
<p>Nikolayenko never underestimates the bear's potential for ferocity and resists 
the urge to ascribe human emotions to the animals. Even Dobrynya, he says, probably 
only tolerated his presence. <p>"A bear thinks only of himself, his own needs. 
He never thought about me," Nikolayenko said. "I thought about him." <p>'I Think 
We've Lost' <p>At the reserves' headquarters in the town of Yelizovo, near the 
town of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy, manager Valery Komarov sat in his dark, chilly 
office. The building is in a thicket of high weeds, its paint peeling and concrete 
crumbling. It looks, a Russian translator observed, "like the last building standing 
in Stalingrad." <p>Nonetheless, it is the bureaucratic fortress from which the 
fight to protect Kamchatka's wildlife is fought. Although the reserves were relatively 
well funded during the Soviet era, Komarov said, his staff now includes only 30 
rangers and six scientific researchers. Once there were twice that many. <p>"No 
one wants to work for a miserable salary," he lamented. <p>The poachers, he said, 
"are very powerful people, and all our legislative system is available to be bought 
and sold. There is no real protection." <p>Russell hired former soldiers who had 
fought in Chechnya and were unafraid to chase poachers into remote corners of 
the peninsula. But there were never enough of them, he said. <p>Although he initially 
thought about leaving Russia forever after the horrors of the spring, he is considering 
returning again next summer to help expand the ranger program. <p>Arnold Zaslavsky, 
chief ranger for the Yelizovo district, said the upper reaches of some rivers 
are now devoid of fish because poachers have depleted the spawning grounds. Bears, 
he said, must travel farther and farther downriver to find food. <p>This spring, 
he added, rangers found the remains of eight bears in south Kamchatka, all shot 
in the back of the head — clearly from a helicopter — two days before hunting 
season opened. <p>"I think we've lost," Zaslavsky said, his eyes brimming with 
tears. "I can't sit and do nothing. I would like to do something useful for nature, 
but I don't have possibilities." <p>Komarov believes there is little doubt about 
what happened to Russell's bears. <p>"Russell's activities were in the way of 
this criminal structure, and he crossed their path. <p>"Maybe they just did it 
for revenge," he said. "It was a very cruel revenge." <p ALIGN="CENTER">Copyright
