<p>LONDON, April 3  - Britain's official poet has  taken the highly unusual step of writing a poem condemning the  war in Iraq.

<p></p> 

Andrew Motion said that from Eden to Babylon, death was cutting a swathe through one of the cradles of civilization.

<p></p> But the poet laureate insisted he was not unpatriotic,  saying that he &quot;wished well&quot; for the British troops fighting to  topple Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.<p></p> The poem, entitled &quot;Regime Change&quot;, was a break from  tradition for the poet laureate, who is appointed by Queen  Elizabeth's household and traditionally writes non-political  poems to commemorate major national and royal occasions.<p></p> After reading the poem out on BBC Radio on Thursday, Motion  said: &quot;I wouldn't say this poem is precisely unpatriotic but I  would say it is violently opposed to the war.<p></p> &quot;Even though my opposition to the war is very vehement,   like many other people who are opposed to it, I do nothing but  wish well to the troops themselves.&quot;<p></p> It is Motion's second anti-war poem. He wrote a 30-word poem  Causa Belli questioning the motives of war in January.<p></p> His work followed a rich tradition of British protest poets  -- Siegfried Sassoon and Wilfred Owen were famed for graphic  imagery bringing home the horrors of World War One trenches.<p></p> 

Those protest poets buried the romantic view of war  epitomized by Shakespeare's &quot;Henry V&quot; as the young monarch urged  his troops to &quot;stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood&quot;.

<p></p> Britain has had a poet laureate since the mid-17th century  and the famous roll-call ranges from John Dryden to William  Wordsworth and Lord Tennyson.<p></p> Tennyson sparked controversy after the Crimean War when he  wrote of the brave but foolhardy Charge of the Light Brigade  with the line &quot;The soldier knew someone had blundered&quot;.<p></p> Motion wrote a ceremonial poem to mark the death of  Britain's Queen Mother last year but has also written about  Nelson Mandela, homelessness, national identity and bullying.<p></p> &quot;My underlying feeling is that poetry ought to be part of  general life rather than being ghettoized,&quot; he said.

<p></p> 

So on Thursday, he pitched into a fierce national debate  about the war which has polarized opinion in Britain.

<p></p> Reflecting on the irony of war being fought amid names famed  in different cultures, he read the poem on BBC radio:<p></p><p></p> 

<i>&quot;Advancing down the road from Nineveh</i>

<p></p> 

<i>Death paused a while and said, Now listen here</i>

<p></p> 

<i>You see the names of places round about</i>

<p></p> 

<i>They are mine now and I have turned them inside out.</i>

<p></p> 

<i>Take Eden further South</i>

<p></p> 

<i>At dawn today I ordered up my troops to tear away</i>

<p></p> 

<i>its walls and gates so everyone can see that gorgeous</i>

<p></p> 

<i>fruit which dangles from its tree.</i>

<p></p> 

<i>You want it don't you? Go and eat it then and lick your</i>

<p></p> 

<i>lips and pick the same again.</i>

<p></p> 

<i>Take Tigris and Euphrates.</i>

<p></p> 

<i>Once they ran through childhood-colored slabs of sand and</i>

<p></p> 

<i>sun. Not any more they don't. I have filled them up with</i>

<p></p> 

<i>countless different kinds of human crap.</i>

<p></p> 

<i>Take Babylon</i>

<p></p> 

<i>The palace sprouting flowers which sweetened empires in</i>

<p></p> 

<i>their peaceful hours.</i>

<p></p> 

<i>I have found a different way to scent the air. Already it's</i>

<p></p> 

<i>a by-word for despair.</i>

<p></p> 

<i>Which leaves Baghdad, the star-tipped minarets, the marble</i>

<p></p> 

<i>courts and halls, the mirage heat.</i>

<p></p> 

<i>These places and the ancient things you know you won't know</i>

<p></p> 

<i>soon. I am working on it now.&quot; </i>

<p></p>
