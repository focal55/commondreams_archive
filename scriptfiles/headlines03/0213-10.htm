<p>Three hundred law school students from across California took out a 

full-page ad in today's New York Times charging that the Bush administration 

has undermined constitutional and civil rights law with its war on terrorism.

<P>The advertisement, which is running in the Times' western edition, lists 

the names of students from eight law schools across the state, including UC 

Berkeley's Boalt Hall School of Law, UC's Hastings College of the Law in San 

Francisco and Stanford Law School.

<P>"Tomorrow's lawmakers shouldn't have to answer for today's misdeeds," the 

ad reads. "As students of the law, we cannot stand behind a boundless 'War on 

Terrorism' that has eroded civil liberties, undermined international 

institutions, blurred the separation of governmental powers, and caused havoc 

in the communities we serve both here and abroad."

<P>Abby Reyes, 29, a Boalt Hall student who co-founded the effort, said that 

students had begun working last fall to draft the ad and an accompanying 

policy statement, which is posted on the Internet.

<P>"What we are learning in the classroom is very different from what is 

happening in Washington," Reyes said. "As law students, we have a role and 

responsibility in offering a wake-up call to our own profession."

<P>All of the students paid at least $25 to be in the ad, while donations from 

faculty and other students covered the $18,000 tab to run it.

<P>Mazen Basrawi, a 23-year-old Boalt Hall student who is Muslim and Arab 

American, said he had signed it because of the impact Bush administration 

policies such as racial profiling had had on his community.

<P>"They are stripping noncitizens of what is left of their existing rights, 

and engaging in illegal foreign policy," he said. "It's those sorts of things 

that have affected our communities."

<P>White House spokesman Ken Lisaius said he had not been aware of the ad 

before being contacted last night.

<P>"People in the U.S. are free to peacefully protest and make their opinions 

known," Lisaius said. "It is a strength of our democracy."

<P>But he added, "There are large numbers of people that very much support the 

president's fighting a war on terror and understand that a Saddam Hussein 

armed with biological, chemical or nuclear weapons would threaten not only his 

region, but the entire world."

<P>Signing the ad in addition to the UC and Stanford students were those from 

UC Davis, Thomas Jefferson School of Law in San Diego, the University of San 

Diego, Golden Gate University and New College of California in San Francisco.

<P>The edition of the paper carrying the ad is delivered to 200,000 

subscribers in 13 states, according to the student group.

<P>"The amount of time and effort that the students put into writing the ad, 

raising the money and collecting all the signatures from all over the state 

really demonstrates a depth of commitment and a level of concern that reflects 

an ever increasing opposition to the Bush administration's attack on civil 

liberties," said Lucas Guttentag, a Boalt Hall professor and director of the 

Immigrant Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union.

<P>California students said they had heard from other law school students -- 

including a group from several Boston-area schools -- who might pursue a 

similar effort.

<P>"By the different schools in California coming together, it sends a 

stronger message," said Forest Wilkerson, a third-year law student at the 

University of San Diego. "We're hoping it catches on."
