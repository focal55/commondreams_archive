<p>As the drama mounts over Iraq, San Francisco's Civic Center will once 

again become a theater of war protest on Sunday.

<P>Singers, actors, poets and street performers will be on hand, adding color, 

melody, movement and humor to the serious business of anti-war demonstration.

<P>Joan Baez and Bonnie Raitt are among the artists reprising their 

appearances at last month's anti-war rally in the Civic Center. Actor Danny 

Glover will serve as an emcee, with readings and speeches by the writer Alice 

Walker, Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Oakland), British Member of Parliament Jeremy 

Corbin and many others.

</table></font>If the growing anti-war movement is drawing people from all walks of life, 

Sunday's organizers have made a concerted effort to ensure that the speakers 

and performers represent the broadest possible ethnic and cultural spectrum. 

Musicians of Latino, Native American, African American and Arabic descent will 

share the stage, as well as members of the Gay Men's Chorus and the Raging 

Grannies, a feisty group of senior-age Peninsula women who put anti-war lyrics 

to familiar songs.

<P>They're not even all pacifists. "There are good things to fight for," said 

Boots Riley of the radical, Black Panther-style Oakland hip-hop group the Coup.

<P>"Unfortunately, I don't think the United States government fights in the name 

of the people."

<P>The right to protest, said San Francisco native Glover, star of such films 

as "The Color Purple" and "Lethal Weapon," "is the most important legacy of 

democracy. What good is it if you can't dissent?"

<P>Despite his fame as an actor, Glover said he will attend this weekend's 

rallies (he also plans to appear at today's protest in New York) as a citizen 

like any other.

<P>"We are expressing our will as 'we the people,' " he said, "not just a 

small, elite group. We the people demand accountability. We demand that our 

voice be heard."

<P>Still, organizers are well aware that celebrity appearances help spread the 

message from the strictly political realm into the social.

<P>"We try to infuse as much art and culture into the day as possible," said 

Maya Jones, a delegate to the rally's programming committee from Not In Our 

Name, which held a benefit concert last month at the Berkeley Community 

Theater with Ani DiFranco, Chuck D, Michael Franti and others.

<P>"There's a burgeoning new section of people stepping forward because they 

relate to the artists and musicians," she said. "People respond to that, 

particularly young people."

<P>Hari Dillon is president of the Vanguard Public Foundation, the activist 

organization that brought together the four co-sponsors of Sunday's event: Not 

In Our Name, Bay Area United Against War, United for Peace and Justice, and 

International ANSWER. For him, the cultural aspect of the rally is crucial, 

and not just as a distraction.

<P>"Culture is much more than just entertainment," he said. "It speaks to the 

soul and the spirit. I don't think the artists see this as an entertainment 

role."

<P>In addition to the artists confirmed for the main stage, the Civic Center 

and march route will feature dozens of street theater groups. Dancers bearing 

giant peace birds, drummers from the San Francisco Mime Troupe and dozens of 

coordinated poster images by the activist group Art and Revolution will give 

the parade a distinctive San Francisco temperment and flair.

<P>"We want to bring a little noise, some energy and fun," said the Mime 

Troupe's Ed Holmes, who might wear his Dick Cheney costume. "Nobody feels 

we're actually going to stop the war doing this. But we've got to put our 

bodies out there."

<P>Alan Moore, an organizer of the 500-member Musicians and Fine Artists for 

World Peace, plans to carry the 6-foot-wide Mylar butterly that fluttered over 

Market Street in last month's march. Historically, Moore said, the butterfly 

"is a powerful, archetypal healing logo. I don't believe in anti-war 

demonstrations. I believe in pro-peace demonstrations."

<P>On a break from poster-making at the Mission District's Redstone Building, 

Art and Revolution's Alli Starr discussed the moves dancers and volunteers use 

to animate their painted quetzal birds (a peace emblem from Central America). 

As they turn, jump and twist, they create the illusion of flight.

<P>The group hopes to have 50 or more images of Iraqi families, fashioned from 

bicycle boxes, deployed through the parade. "We Are Not Saddam," "We Are Not 

Al Qaeda," "War Destroys Families," some of the posters say.

<P>"There's something really powerful about a unified image that is not 

machine-made," Starr said.

<P>Randall Stuart, who is producing a 100-character reading of the ancient 

Greek anti-war play "Lysistrata" at the Berkeley Repertory Theatre on March 3, 

plans to march Sunday. For him, performers are naturals at such events: They 

have the art of persuasion.

<P>"Artists are used to creating magic from nothing at all," he said, "then 

making it live and breathe to affect an audience." Stuart compared the 

impending war with the themes Aristophanes addressed: "This crisis is no less 

heart-rending than the one those women on the beach at Troy faced."

<P>Laughter, in the face of warfare, may be just as essential. One of the Mime 

Troupe's pet parade chants is "No More Chanting."</p>
