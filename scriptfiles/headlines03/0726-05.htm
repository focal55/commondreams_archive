<p>BAQUBA, Iraq  - A grenade attack killed three U.S.  soldiers guarding a children's hospital north of Baghdad on  Saturday, the latest ambush in a guerrilla war that the killing  of Saddam Hussein's sons has failed to check.<P>
A military spokesman said four soldiers from the 4th  Infantry Division were wounded in the attack in Baquba, 30  miles north of Baghdad, in the "Sunni triangle" where American  troops have come under frequent attack.<P>

</table></font>The fatalities brought to 47 the number of U.S. soldiers  killed at enemy hands since Washington declared an end to major  combat in Iraq on May 1. Eight have died since U.S. forces  killed Saddam Hussein's sons Uday and Qusay on Tuesday.<P>
U.S. officers have warned of a risk of revenge attacks  after the deaths of the brothers, though it is not clear  whether vengeance is the motive for the assaults of the last  few days.<P>
U.S. commanders hope the fate of Uday, 39, and his  37-year-old brother Qusay will in time demoralize guerrillas,  whatever the short-term response.<P>
In Saddam's hometown of Tikrit, U.S. troops braced for more  bloodshed as Iraqis fighters amplified their campaign.<P>
Soldiers from the 4th Infantry Division in Tikrit said they  were now facing attacks during the day as well as at night, and  that guerrillas were increasingly bold and confident.<P>
"Things are worse now," said Staff Sergeant Kenneth  Maxwell, from Hartford, Connecticut, admitting to nerves as he  held the trigger of his machinegun atop an armored vehicle.<P>
"They used to just attack us, mostly at night. But now they  are attacking us during the day with AK-47s and RPGs (rocket-  propelled grenades), at any American soldiers they can find,"  Maxwell said, eyes alert under the baking sun.<P>
ATTACK IN BROAD DAYLIGHT<P>
The attack on soldiers in Baquba illustrated the danger.  Residents said an attacker had thrown a grenade from the roof  of the hospital in broad daylight on Saturday morning.<P>
U.S. troops sealed off the building after the attack and  barred people from leaving. Everybody inside was being  photographed as part of the investigation into the assault.<P>
Dozens of worried Iraqis with relatives in the hospital  gathered outside the hospital gates.<P>
"My wife and my baby boy are inside. I have a one-year-old  daughter at home who needs her mother. We want the Americans to  let them out," said one man, Mohammed Abdul Sattar.<P>
Ali Abbas, whose sister is a nurse in the hospital, said he  hated the Americans but did not support this attack. "We all  agree that we need to fight the Americans," he said. "But did  they really have to hit them in a children's hospital?"<P>
U.S. officials blame Saddam loyalists for the attacks on  American troops, mainly in Baghdad and the Sunni heartland to  the north and west. Arab television networks have broadcast  pictures of masked men with grenades and assault rifles vowing  to strike back for the deaths of Uday and Qusay.<P>
But many Iraqis resent the U.S. occupation and link the  violence to anger over the way U.S. troops behave. Between  6,000 and 7,800 Iraqi civilians are believed to have been  killed since the war began on March 20, though no precise toll  is available. U.S. troops with bulldozers began demolishing the  villa in the northern city of Mosul where the brothers were  killed, after scouring it for clues on the whereabouts of their  father.<P>
The villa was wrecked when U.S. troops attacked it with  machineguns, grenades and anti-tank missiles in a fierce battle  that killed the pair and two others, believed to be a bodyguard  and Qusay's teenage son.<P>
The house belonged to a businessman with links to Saddam's  family. U.S. officials have declined comment on speculation  that it was he who betrayed Uday and Qusay in return for $30  million in reward money. Washington says it will pay, no doubt  to encourage others to claim the $25 million on offer for  Saddam.<P>
After the deaths of his sons, the net might be closing,  U.S. commanders say. Acting on a tip-off, they rounded up 13  men near Tikrit on Thursday night. Some were suspected of being  bodyguards of Saddam, though officers said it was not certain.<P>
"We continue to tighten the noose," 4th Infantry Division  commander Major General Ray Odierno said.<P>
Iraq's biggest selling newspaper, Azzaman, splashed color  photographs of Uday and Qusay's corpses on its front page on  Saturday, under a headline proclaiming the brothers were dead.<P>
U.S. officials hope the pictures and television images of  the bodies will convince skeptical Iraqis that Uday and Qusay  are dead and staunch the wave of guerrilla attacks.
<P>
One issue is what will happen to the bodies. Muslim  tradition demands they be buried quickly, but few in Iraq will  want to see their graves become a shrine. They could be  discreetly handed to clan elders in Tikrit.
