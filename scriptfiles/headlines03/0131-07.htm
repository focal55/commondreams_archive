<p> LONDON  - The United States is highly likely to  lead an invasion of Iraq in the next two months and the war  should be over by the end of June, according to a Reuters  survey of experts.

<p>



		Thursday's poll of 20 defense and Middle East experts also  showed that Washington had a good chance of securing a new U.N.  resolution explicitly endorsing an invasion, despite the  reservations of France, Germany, Russia and China.<p>



		Two-thirds of the experts said Iraq probably still  possessed significant stocks of chemical and biological  weapons, despite more than a decade of U.N. demands for  disarmament.<p>



		They saw little likelihood that Iraqi President Saddam  Hussein would give up office peacefully or that he could be  deposed or assassinated without a U.S. invasion.<p>



		"The horse is already out of the barn," said Sarah Emerson  at Boston-based Energy Security Analysis. "The invasion will  take place and if the U.S. feels that it can...then they will  definitely go for a (second) resolution that gives more  credibility nationally.<p>



		"If they don't feel they can get that, then they won't  ask...There is more of a coalition than public statements  imply. When push comes to shove, countries will get on the  bandwagon because they want to be part of the peace."<p>



		All but one of the experts said the United States, backed  by British troops, would invade by the end of March.<p>



		But they were split on how soon troops would be fully  prepared for Washington to unleash the air bombardment that  would be followed, possibly within days, by a land invasion.<p>



		Ten thought the force wouldn't be fully in place, briefed  and acclimatized until well into March. Nine thought they would  be ready to fight by late February.<p>



		Most thought the conflict would then last up to three  months, though one said it could take longer and eight thought  it would be over in a month.<p>



		Estimates of how long U.S. troops would then stay on in  Iraq while a new administration was established ranged widely,  from six months to 10 years.<p>



		CONSENSUS HARDENS<p>



		Many of the experts, in the United States, Europe, the  Middle East and Asia, had been unsure until recently that the  United States would press ahead with an invasion.<p>



		In the last Reuters poll, carried out in December, a narrow  majority of 10 out of 18 experts said war was likely or very  likely. But in Thursday's poll, 14 said war was very likely,  five said likely and one said the chances were 50:50.<p>



		The consensus has hardened after the United States stepped  up its war of words this week and after U.N. weapons inspectors  presented an unexpectedly critical report on Monday on how far  Iraq was complying with demands to prove it has disarmed.<p>



		"The report was, diplomatically speaking, rather outspoken  in many respects," said Frank Umbach at the German Council on  Foreign Relations in Berlin.<p>



		Half of the experts also thought the United Nations would  endorse military action, while eight put the chances at 50:50.<p>



		Magnus Ranstorp at St Andrew's University in Scotland said  Washington would try to win world opinion by presenting next  week what it says is new evidence of links between Iraqi  officials and al Qaeda network blamed for the September 11  attacks in 2001.<p>



		"There are linkages between certain individuals within al  Qaeda and the Iraqi regime, particularly (Abu Musab) Zarqawi,  who is a senior operational commander of al Qaeda," he said,  adding that Zarqawi could not be directly linked to September  11.<p>



		Washington "will complete the circle, Iraq and weapons of  mass destruction on one side, on the other side Iraq and al  Qaeda," he said.<p>



		Some experts thought France, in particular, would come  round to endorsing an invasion, even providing some military  support.<p>



		The experts saw little alternative to an invasion to  achieve the U.S. goal of deposing Saddam. None thought he would  quit peacefully. Three said his army might overthrow him, but  two of them said that would happen only after U.S. attacks  start.<p>



		But some experts worry that military victory won't assuage  growing cynicism about the role of the United Nations in many  Asian and Muslim countries.<p>



		"This is seen not as a choice between Bush and Saddam, but  between Bush and the U.N. system and international law," said  Ingolf Kiesow at the Swedish Defense Research Agency.<p>
