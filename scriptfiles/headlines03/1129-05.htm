<p>Normally, during Thanksgiving week, Vons supermarket in Santa Monica would be packed with shoppers waiting in long lines at the checkout counters. This week, however, the only lines are the picket lines outside the store as one of the largest and what is described as one of the most critical strikes in modern American labor history enters its eighth week. 
<p>More than 70,000 workers at 859 locations across central and southern California have been on strike in protest against plans by supermarket chains to cut their health and pension benefits. This week, the strike, called by the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) union, intensified as Teamsters union drivers refused to cross picket lines at depots. The strike's most significant backers, however, are the shoppers who are also refusing to cross picket lines, reducing turnover in some stores to a third of the normal volume.  
<p>The stakes are high. Victory for the strikers would accelerate attempts to unionize other big service companies, say union organizers; defeat could have a chilling effect on recruitment. Union leaders say the strike could be the first round in a fight in which major companies seek to reduce traditional benefits because they claim they are being undercut by vast non-union firms, such as Wal-Mart.  
<p>The strike started after talks broke down over the employers' intention to cut health and pension benefits by stopping paying their employees' insurance premium. First the staff at Vons and Pavilions, two chains owned by Safeway Inc, walked out. The following day, two other chains, Ralphs and Albertsons, which are owned by Kroger, which bargains jointly with Safeway, locked out their staff.  
<p>The strike is different from the traditional disputes because many shoppers have personal relationships with checkout staff, whom they often know by name. As a result, backing has been heavy, with the sound of honking car horns, as drivers signal their support, now part of the rhythm of life around striking stores. As a result, the companies are losing $40m (&#163;23m) a week in sales to rival stores.  
<p>"Support has been very strong," said Ralph Venegas, 50, who has been with Vons for 14 years and was standing outside the store's main entrance. A customer had just dropped off a large Thanksgiving pie for the picketers, others had come by with tacos and sandwiches.  
<p>"A lot of unions are starting to realize that this is much bigger than just a retail clerks' strike. If we go down, others will go down."    
<p><B>Support</B>
<p>Linda, who has been working for Vons for 17 years and preferred to give only her first name, said most members of the public supported the strike. "A few are rude and say 'It's a free country, I'll shop where I like', but most support us." She said people knew the supermarkets were highly profitable. "After Enron, that term 'corporate greed' came up and people understand that."  
<p>Ellen Andreder, the UFCW spokeswoman in southern California, said other unions were watching closely and support was coming from unions across the US. "I've never seen anything like this in 19 years," Ms Andreder said. "This is probably the biggest strike - in terms of numbers and locations - in the history of the labor movement. The Teamsters and other unions see a direct link: no industry would be immune &#91;from cuts in benefits&#93; if they get away with it here.  
<p>"Our feeling is that we have come too far as a society to lower the bar and go back to the days of Carnegie and Rockefeller when the more you exploited your workers, the more successful you were." Ms Andreder said the companies had enjoyed a 91% increase in profits in the past five years and could well afford to continue paying benefits. Safeway has an annual turnover of $30bn (&#163;17bn).  
<p>"This strike should send a message," said Greg Denier, the UFCW communications director. "Healthcare is a major issue now and people understand and are sympathetic." He said the dispute would have a major effect on the union movement: "This experience will shape a whole new generation of trade unionists. We're getting more and more members and support from other unions.  
<p>"But the most important support we have had is from the grocery shopper, and the fact that they have not been crossing picket lines is a sign of our success."  
<p>The local Teamsters president, Jim Santangelo, declared on announcing that the drivers would respect picket lines at depots: "We either end this thing together or we die together."  
<p>The companies have started to place whole-page advertisements in the newspapers headlined Read Between the Picket Lines and subheaded We care about our employees, too. The ad concludes: "We're united in our goal of reaching a contract settlement that addresses the very real competitive threats and skyrocketing healthcare costs we face."  
<p>They argue that their employees continue to enjoy better health benefits than "the vast majority of our customers". Around 43 million Americans have no health insurance at all.  
<p>The supermarket chains claim they are being undercut by non-union firms, like Wal-Mart, which pay minimum wages. Wal-Mart, now the world's largest grocery store, is able to pay low wages - $9.64 (&#163;5.59) an hour, compared with an average of $15.98 (&#163;9.27) for a union store worker - because of the vast reservoir of immigrant labor in the US who will work cheaply and will heed company warnings not to join a union for fear of losing their jobs.    
<p><B>Conditions</B>
<p>The length of the strike and the level of support it has attracted is an indication of the times, according to David Koff of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees International union, which this year helped to organize a Freedom Ride of immigrant workers in buses across the country to draw attention to their conditions. "There is a growing awareness that living conditions are being driven relentlessly downwards and that concentrates the mind," Mr Koff said. "Union leaders realize that they have to support each other.  
<p>"The slogan 'united we stand' is often hollow but now content is being poured into it. This is a critical fight. A lot of the union leaders came of age in the 60s and 70s and they were inspired by people like Cesar Chavez &#91;the farmworkers' leader&#93; and Martin Luther King and they understand the importance of solidarity."  
<p>He said union membership in the private sector had slipped below 10%, with membership overall around 13% of the workforce. One of the reasons for the unions prospering in the service sector of supermarkets, catering and cleaning is that it is one of the few industries which cannot move its operations abroad.  
<p>A new book, Insurrection, Citizen Challenges to Corporate Power, by Kevin Danaher and Jason Mark, suggests that a growing number of people are becoming politically active, spurred on by revelations of corporate malpractice. Danaher, a co-founder of the San Francisco-based Global Exchange, said yesterday of the strike: "If they can win, it would be a significant boost. It would say to people if you persevere, you can achieve anything."
