</table>Under the intellectual property deal, poor countries, can now issue a compulsory licence to import low-cost copies of expensive branded drugs owned by powerful pharmaceutical firms. But according to trade analysts, the deal will be unable to provide the quantities of drugs needed to combat the world's growing deadly infections.  <P>'&#91;The&#93; deal was designed to offer comfort to the US and Western pharmaceutical industry,' said Ellen 't Hoen of <a href="http://www.msf.org/" target="_new">M&#233;decins Sans Fronti&#232;res</a>. 'Unfortunately, it offers little comfort for poor patients. Global patent rules will continue to drive up the price of medicines.'  
<P>The principal concern is that it will be uneconomic for manufacturers of cheap copies of expensive drugs to export them to countries that need it. Pharmaceutical firms, whose collective profits run into tens of billions of pounds, have largely failed to reduce the price of their products, making them unaffordable to developing countries.  <P>A deal has been held up for two years over concerns by pharmaceutical companies, led by American giant Pfizer, that generic drug companies, who copy patented products, will make huge profits from health crises. The major firms also fear medicines meant for the poor will 'leak' into the West. Campaigners dismiss that as exaggeration.  
<P>'This is a historic agreement for the World Trade Organization,' said its director general Supachai Panitchpakdi. 'It proves the Organization can handle humanitarian as well as trade concerns.'  
<P>There has been immense pressure for poor countries to adopt the deal. Had it collapsed yesterday it would have derailed next week's trade talks in Mexico. The agreement comes as a new study reveals a massive outbreak of hepatitis C in Africa.  
<P>Oxfam reveals that 170 million globally are infected, with 150 million of them living in poor countries. The disease is labeled 'Africa's silent killer'. Cases progress slowly resulting in chronic liver diseases, cirrhosis and cancer. But the overwhelming number of sufferers have no access to medicines to combat the disease  
<P>Hepatitis C is most prevalent in Egypt where up to a fifth of its 70 million population suffer from it, according to the campaign group.  <P>Two pharmaceutical companies produce drugs to combat the disease - Hoffman-La Roche and Schering-Plough. A Hoffman La Roche spokesman was unaware of any discount schemes by his firm to poor countries.  <P>Mohga Kamal Smith of <a href="http://www.oxfam.org/" target="_new">Oxfam</a>, who wrote the report, said: 'The world is focused on HIV, TB and malaria but hepatitis C affects tens of millions. The medicines are unaffordable. Yesterday's agreement may be seen as a breakthrough, but the reality is the drugs will not be affordable for the millions who need them. The tragedy is this is a missed opportunity.'</p>
