<p>Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has said an international plan for Middle East peace should not be taken seriously.

<P>

In an interview with Newsweek magazine,  he said he was only ready to accept the concept of a Palestinian state provided that Israel controlled its external borders.

<P>

	

Mr Sharon again stressed that he wanted Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat removed from any position of influence.

<P>

Israel has a general election scheduled for 28 January, when Mr Sharon's Likud will be challenged by Labour, whose leader Amram Mitzna favours immediate talks with the Palestinians.

<P>

Mr Sharon has adopted a hard line, demanding a full cessation of violence before any moves towards peace with the Palestinians.

<P><b>Plan is 'nothing'</b>

<P>

He told Newsweek magazine that he discounted a "road map" resolution envisaging  the creation of a Palestinian state within three years.

<P>



That plan has been pushed by the so-called Quartet of the United Nations, European Union, United States and Russia.

<P>

But Mr Sharon said: "The Quartet is nothing! Don't take it seriously."

<P>

There was another plan that might work, but it had to start with the removal of Mr Arafat, he told the magazine.

<P>

If that happened and was followed by other changes, Mr Sharon said he would consider moves towards a Palestinian state.

<P>

He told Newsweek: "I am ready, if they have taken steps against terror, to recognise a fully demilitarised Palestinian state without final borders - having only police equipped with light weapons.

<P>

"Israel will control the external borders and will have the right to fly over the territory."

<P>

Then, if there was "no terror whatsoever", a final decision on borders could be taken, he said.

<P>

Mr Mitzna told the same magazine that polls indicated that most Israelis backed his initiative for talks or a unilateral separation - such as a border fence - by Israel if negotiations failed.

<P>

But he accepted the same polls showed that voters still backed Likud.</p>
