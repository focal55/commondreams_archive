<p>US church leaders are to ask Prime Minister Tony Blair to work for the non-violent replacement of President Saddam Hussein.
<p>
They challenge Mr Blair's claim that there is a strong moral case for toppling the Iraqi leader by force.
<p>They say the US is barely using its powers to support opposition groups within Iraq.
<p>
The leaders are due to meet Mr Blair on 18 February.
<p>
The delegation is headed by the Reverend Jim Wallis of the Sojourners' Community, a Christian justice and peace group based in Washington DC.
<p>
It will tell Mr Blair a non-violent strategy for removing Saddam Hussein could work if it had Western backing.
<p>



Civilians, they say, could cause disruption around Iraq, dispersed enough to avoid offering convenient targets for repression.
<p>
The realization that open opposition had begun would embolden other Iraqis to take part in "more systematic acts of resistance".
<p>
This growing opposition would offer dissidents within the regime a place to which they could defect.
<p>
The US delegation says non-violent resistance has historically relied on weapons like strikes, boycotts, civil disobedience and even non-violent sabotage. 
<p>
<b>Widespread hatred</b>
<p>
Its hopes of success rest partly on the assumption that an authoritarian ruler requires services from the population, which he cannot indefinitely compel them to supply.
<p>
The church leaders say the Iraqi regime is particularly vulnerable over oil - if a limited number of civilian oil workers downed tools they could create a crisis by themselves.
<p>



They believe Iraq is ripe for non-violent change because millions of Iraqis detest Saddam Hussein, whose hold on power in any case relies on personal loyalties and repression.
<p>
A few years ago, in the city of Karbala, they say, civilians effectively encircled troops sent to control them, and similar uprisings on a national scale could stretch the regime's machinery of repression to breaking point.
<p>
Crucially, the US delegation will tell Mr Blair the West is failing to give Iraqi dissidents the support they need - the other condition they need for success.
<p>
Under the Iraq Liberation Act of 1998, they say, the US administration can give opposition groups goods and services - including training - worth up to $97 million. So far it has used $1m of that total.
<p>
<b>Glaring omission</b>
<p>
It will tell Mr Blair the choice is not between leaving Saddam Hussein in power and removing him through war, but that there is a third way.
<p>
Dan Plesch, of the UK's Royal United Services Institute, told BBC News Online: "What the delegation is pointing out is something very embarrassing, that the US is not interested in trying for peaceful change, but only in something more squalid and traditional.
<p>
"It's quite remarkable that despite all the rhetoric President Bush and Mr Blair have refrained from indicting Saddam Hussein for war crimes.
<p>
"The delegation's approach is certainly worth trying."
