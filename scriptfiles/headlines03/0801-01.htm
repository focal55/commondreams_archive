<p>VILLENEUVE-LES-MAGUELONE, France - A judge in southern France ordered the conditional release of jailed anti-globalization activist  Jose Bov&eacute;, his lawyer Francois Roux told AFP.

</table></font>The ruling calls for Jose Bov&eacute;, who gained worldwide notoriety for demolishing a half-built McDonald's restaurant in 1999, to be allowed to return home and work for a local agricultural association that has offered him a job, Roux said Friday. 


<p>Prosecutors can appeal the judge's decision, a move that would keep it from going into effect, but Roux said Jose Bov&eacute; could walk out of prison by Saturday. 


<p>The 50-year-old Jose Bov&eacute;, who heads a radical farmers' union, has so far spent a month behind bars at the Villeneuve-les-Maguelone prison in southern France for having destroyed genetically modified crops. 


<p>He was taken into custody on June 22 in a spectacular police raid on his home to serve a sentence of 10 months, but the traditional Bastille Day pardons meted out by President Jacques Chirac on July 14 cut that to six months. 


<p>The jail time represented the accumulation of two sentences -- six months for the destruction of genetically modified rice in Montpellier in 1999 and four months for a similar raid in 1998. 


<p>Ten days ago, Jose Bov&eacute; lodged a request for his conditional release under a provision that allows prisoners sentenced to less than one year in jail to pursue employment without being under constant watch by guards. 


<p>Last year, he spent a month and a half behind bars for destroying the McDonald's franchise in the southern town of Millau.
