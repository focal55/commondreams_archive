<p>President George Bush called last night for Saddam Hussein to face the death penalty, as fresh violence across Iraq signaled that his capture has by no means stifled the anti-US insurgency. 
<p>Mr Bush told ABC news: "I think he ought to receive the ultimate penalty ... for what he has done to his people."  
<p>He added: "He is a torturer, a murderer, and they had rape rooms, and this is a disgusting tyrant who deserves justice, the ultimate justice."  
<p>The remarks threaten to provoke a row with European countries which have warned against executing the former Iraqi dictator. But Mr Bush stressed that it would be up to Iraqi justice to decide his fate.  
<p>Saddam remains at an undisclosed location, with the CIA now tasked with interrogation. Donald Rumsfeld, the US defense secretary, characterized his mood as "resigned". In the ABC interview, Mr Bush said it was too early too say whether the former Iraqi leader was behind the insurgents.  
<p>But two guerrillas told the Guardian in a rare encounter near Samarra, 60 miles north of Baghdad, that they were not fighting on behalf of Saddam and were undaunted by his capture. "The operations that have happened here against the Americans are not by people outside Samarra," said the first man from the seat of a white BMW, where he sat with a Kalashnikov assault rifle on his lap and a hand grenade resting on a shelf by the gear   lever. "We are the tribes of Samarra and we are responsible for the attacks. We are fighting a war against the Americans. We are fighting because they arrested a lot of people, because they attacked a lot of houses in the night; they humiliated our sisters."  
<p>The second guerrilla, the driver, said he had deserted from the Iraqi army 11 years earlier. But since the Americans had arrived in Samarra one of his brothers had been killed and four had been arrested and were still in detention. "How do they expect us not to take revenge for this and not to lead operations against them?" he said. "As long as &#91;US forces&#93; remain inside our city we will continue to seek revenge."  
<p>He was speaking after US forces were caught in a "complex" ambush at Samarra, in a combination of mortar, grenade and roadside bomb attacks. In response, the US military said it killed 11 insurgents. Witnesses disputed their account, however, saying one civilian was killed in Monday's clash. After the ambush, the US military rounded up around 80 guerrillas, including one suspected leader of the insurgency, Qais Hattam.  
<p>In other unrest yesterday, three Iraqis were shot dead by US troops during a pro-Saddam protest in Ramadi, while in Mosul an Iraqi policeman was killed during a similar demonstration. A roadside bomb in Tikrit, Saddam's hometown, injured three soldiers.
