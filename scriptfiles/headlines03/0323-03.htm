<p>A senior church figure has called US forces' use of depleted uranium shells in the Iraq conflict a war crime. 



<p>Anglican Bishop of Auckland Richard Randerson said it ranked alongside nuclear destruction. 



<p>It was blasphemous for President Bush to seek the blessing of God for such activities, said Bishop Randerson. 



<p>His remarks came at a rally in Auckland's Myers Park on Saturday after a protest march up Queen St. 



<p>A crowd, which police estimated at close to 10,000, called on the Government to withdraw the frigate HMNZS Te Mana from patrol duty in the Gulf of Oman. 



<p>Another speaker, Green Party MP Keith Locke, said Te Mana was escorting US warships entering the Persian Gulf war zone and must be brought home. He also demanded the closure of the Waihopai spy base in Marlborough to stop it assisting the US war effort. 



<p>Anti-war protests were also made on Saturday afternoon in Wellington, Nelson and Christchurch. 



<p>Three people were arrested for throwing objects at the US embassy in Wellington and would appear in Wellington District Court today.
