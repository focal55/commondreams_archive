<p>ANCHORAGE, Alaska  - Across the western Arctic
sprawls an Indiana-sized land mass dotted with lakes, populated
by migratory birds and other wildlife, and packed with
potential oil riches.
<p>The National Petroleum Reserve of Alaska (NPR-A), wedged
between the foothills of the rugged Brooks Range and the icy
Arctic coastline, is about 120 miles from the better-known
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR).

</font><!--/endimage/-->The NPR-A was set aside 80 years ago as an energy
storehouse for the U.S. military, but the reserve has yet to
send a barrel of oil to market.
 <p>
 The Bush administration hopes to change that and is pushing
an ambitious strategy for oil development in the NPR-A as
Congress refuses to open drilling in ANWR.
 
<p>
 Plans recently drafted by the U.S. Bureau of Land
Management (BLM) would open vast stretches of the 23
million-acre NPR-A to new oil drilling and relax environmental
restrictions in other areas where leases already exist.
 <p>
 With oil development expanding west from Prudhoe Bay, the
focus on the petroleum reserve makes sense, said Henri Bisson,
the BLM's Alaska director. "It's just a natural progression.
The time is right for exploration in the NPR-A," he said.
 <p>
 The BLM wants to open 8.8 million acres in the reserve's
northwestern third to oil development. That plan would replace
specific regulations -- like those limiting truck travel over
the delicate tundra and restrictions on drilling in rivers and
streams -- with more general guidelines.
 <p>
 The proposal is cheered by industry backers. They have high
hopes for the reserve, which could hold 5.9 billion to 13.2
billion barrels of oil, according to government estimates.
 <p>
 "The future of our industry and the future of our state
will really lie in the development of the NPR-A," Mark Huber,
vice president of the oil field service company Doyon Universal
Services, said at a recent Anchorage public hearing.
 <p>
 But environmentalists have a different view.
 <p>
 A 'LEASE EVERYTHING' STRATEGY
 <p>
 "I don't know whether there is a strategy, other than
"lease everything'," said Stan Senner, director of Alaska
Audubon.
 <p>
 Senner's remark comes as the BLM is proposing to change
environmental safeguards in the reserve's northeast section to
match the more general ones proposed for the northwest. The
northeast section is where companies have leased nearly 1.5
million acres for exploration during the past four years.
 <p>
 The BLM may also allow drilling in and around the vast
Teskekpuk Lake, which sits near the Arctic coastline and is
currently off-limits to development. Until now, its shores were
considered too important to birds, caribou and wildlife to
allow oil rigs.
 <p>
 Critics say the BLM is caving to companies pushing to cut
costs. They point to the specifics of the new rules for the
northwest section, such as the allowance for gravel roads and
airstrips if they are "necessary to carry out exploration more
economically" and drilling in rivers or streams if "it is
determined that there is no feasible or prudent alternative."
 <p>
 "Every single thing can be waived for economic reasons,
which makes it all meaningless," said Eleanor Huffines of The
Wilderness Society.
 <p>

 Geology justifies the proposals, BLM's Bisson said.
<p>
 Beneath Teshekpuk Lake there may be as much as 2.2 billion
barrels of oil, he said. It lies within the same geologic
formation that produced most North Slope oil discoveries.
<p>
A strict interpretation of existing rules, including
mandatory buffers around streams, would make it difficult to
extract some of the oil, he said.
<p>
"We have more than sufficient protections to steer away
from sensitive areas," Bisson said. "But we also have the
ability to make an exception if there's no reasonable
alternative. I think it's a mistake to go into a place and just
absolutely say, "no exceptions'."
<p>
Industry supporters like the proposed changes.
<p>
Clinton-era leasing restrictions were too extreme, said
Larry Houle, executive director of the Alaska Support Industry
Alliance, an oil field service association. "There was a
political agenda being pushed by the stipulations, and it was
an anti-development agenda," he said.
<p>
Houle, who served on a BLM advisory panel, cited some
examples. One rule bars tundra travel unless there is 12 inches
of frozen ground and six inches of snow cover. Another requires
three-mile buffers for waterways. Instead of such prescriptive
mandates, he said, rules should emphasize performance goals.
<p>
Companies could abide by existing rules by using such
techniques as directional drilling, but choose not to, said
Anchorage environmental consultant Pamela Miller.
<p>
"If they felt the government was going to hold them to the
stipulations, they probably could figure out a way to do it.
But why should they? It's going to cost them more money,"
Miller said.
<p>
Inupiat Eskimos of the North Slope also are concerned.
<p>
If the BLM decides to drop environmental protections, "I
don't think that Nuiqsut or any other village will support
development in NPR-A," said Thomas Napageak, an elder from
Nuiqsut, the Inupiat village on the reserve's eastern border.</p>
