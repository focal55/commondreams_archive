<p>NESRIN ALOGLU, a bank clerk, is delighted that Turkey&#146;s parliament has thrown Washington&#146;s plans for an attack on Iraq into disarray by blocking the deployment of US troops. &#147;Serves them right. Now they can apologise.&#148; </P>

<P>Apologise, she said, for the way in which the United States so rudely took Turkey for granted and issued threats, insults and ultimatums when it did not get what it wanted. 

<P>In rejecting Washington&#146;s demands, the recession-hit country is turning its back on US aid worth more than $20 billion (&#163;13 billion). 

<P>But Turks still support the parliament&#146;s decision. &#147;At least it&#146;s cleared Turkey&#146;s name and dispelled the image abroad that Turkey can be bought,&#148; Zafer Dorttas, a 27-year-old customs official, said. 

<P>Ordinary Turks were incensed by US media references to haggling in a carpet shop and by what they saw as insulting American behaviour. 

<P>The final straw came when a series of American newspaper cartoons were broadcast. They depicted Turkey as a money-grabbing belly dancer, or a prostitute bargaining for the price of its favours. 

<P>&#147;I can&#146;t tell you how awful I felt when I saw the cartoons,&#148; Ayse Akin, a student, said. &#147;They were so deeply insulting. America can stick its money and its troops up its backside.&#148;</p>
