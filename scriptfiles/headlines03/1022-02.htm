<p>JERUSALEM   - Israel vowed Wednesday to press on  with construction of its vast barrier cutting into Palestinian  territory in the West Bank despite a U.N. resolution demanding  it be torn down.<P>
"The fence will continue being built and we will go on  taking care of the security of Israel's citizens," Deputy Prime  Minister Ehud Olmert told Israel Radio, reaffirming the  position of Israel's right-leaning government.<P>

  </table></font>Late Tuesday, the U.N. General Assembly overwhelmingly  passed a resolution calling the sprawling network of fences and  walls a "contradiction to international law" and ordering  Israel to "stop and reverse" its construction on Palestinian  lands.<P>
Olmert said the Israeli government would defy what he  called "the dictates of an automatic, hostile, inconsiderate  and misguided (U.N.) majority that always acts against Israel."<P>
Israel says it is a security fence to keep out suicide  bombers. Palestinians call it a new "Berlin Wall" that cuts  deep into territory they want for a state. The United States,  Israel's chief ally, has expressed misgivings about the  project.<P>
The U.N. resolution said the barrier could imperil efforts  to reach a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian  conflict, as called for in a U.S.-backed peace plan, which has  been stalled by persistent tit-for-tat violence.<P>
Two days after deadly air strikes in Gaza, Israeli forces  killed three militants in the West Bank Wednesday, including a  local leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation of  Palestine (PFLP). It vowed a "painful response with bombs and  bullets."<P>
Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat told Reuters: "The  Israeli statement reflects an Israeli determination to continue  violating international law and continue the path of occupation  and settlement rather than peace and reconciliation."<P>
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said in an interview last week  that Israel would complete the barrier -- which will eventually  run 350 km (210 miles) -- despite a U.S. threat to reduce $9  billion in loan guarantees to the Jewish state.<P>
Washington is concerned the project prejudges borders that  should be decided in negotiations.<P>
U.N. VOTE<P>
Arab states took the dispute to an emergency session of the  191-nation General Assembly after the United States last week  vetoed a similar measure in the 15-nation Security Council.<P>
Tuesday's vote on the resolution was 144-4 with 12  abstentions. The United States and Israel voted "no."<P>
Unlike the U.N. Security Council, the General Assembly is  not empowered to pass resolutions that are legally binding and  acts more as a bellwether of world opinion.<P>
The vote capped six hours of haggling between European  Union and Arab governments over the text of the measure, which  initially had been drafted by Palestinian U.N. envoy Nasser  al-Kidwa and took a harsher line against Israeli actions.<P>
U.S. Ambassador John Negroponte said last week the measure  he vetoed was biased against Israel.<P>
EU diplomats said Tuesday's resolution was far more  balanced since it condemned a suicide bombing that killed 21  people in the Israeli city of Haifa on October 4. It also  criticized Israeli settlement building and land confiscation.<P>
Wednesday, Israeli forces focused on the West Bank after  air strikes in the Gaza Strip Monday in which hospital  officials said 10 Palestinians were killed, most of them  civilians. The Gaza attacks drew international criticism.<P>
Soldiers shot dead a PFLP member in Hebron and another  militant in Qalqilya, the army and Palestinian sources said.  Military sources said troops later shot dead a gunman after he  wounded two Jewish settlers in an ambush in Hebron.
<P>
Israeli tanks and troops also rolled into the West Bank  city of Ramallah overnight, encircling a mosque and firing at  stone-throwers before withdrawing several hours later. Medical  officials said 16 Palestinians were wounded.
