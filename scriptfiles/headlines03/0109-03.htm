<p> Train drivers yesterday refused to move a freight train carrying ammunition believed to be destined for British forces being deployed in the Gulf. <P>Railway managers cancelled the Ministry of Defense service after the crewmen, described as "conscientious objectors" by a supporter, said they opposed Tony Blair's threat to attack Iraq.  

<P>The anti-war revolt is the first such industrial action by workers for decades.

</table></font>The two Motherwell-based drivers declined to operate the train between the Glasgow area and the Glen Douglas base on Scotland's west coast, Europe's largest NATO weapons store.  

<P>English Welsh and Scottish Railway (EWS), which transports munitions for the MoD as well as commercial goods, yesterday attempted to persuade the drivers to move the disputed load by tomorrow.  <P>Leaders of the Aslef rail union were pressed at a meeting with EWS executives to ask the drivers to relent. But the officials of a union opposed to any attack on Iraq are unlikely to comply.  <P>The two drivers are understood to be the only pair at the Motherwell freight depot trained on the route of the West Highland Line.  <P>An EWS spokesman declined to confirm the train had been halted, although he insisted no drivers had refused to take out the trains.  <P>"We don't discuss commercial issues," he said.  <P>"The point about the two drivers is untrue and we don't discuss issues about meetings we have."  <P>Yet his claim was flatly contradicted by a well-placed rail industry source who supplied the Guardian with the train's reference number.  <P>The MoD later said it had been informed by EWS that mechanical problems, caused by the cold winter weather, had resulted in the train's cancellation.  <P>One solution under discussion yesterday between the MoD and EWS was to transport the shipment by road to avoid what rail managers hoped would be an isolated confrontation.  <P>Dockers went on strike rather than load British-made arms on to ships destined for Chile after the assassination of leftwing leader Salvador Allende in 1973.  <P>In 1920 stevedores on London's East India Docks refused to move guns on to the Jolly George, a ship chartered to take weapons to anti-Bolsheviks after the Russian revolution.  <P>Trade unions supporting workers who refuse to handle weapons could risk legal action and possible fines for contempt of court.  <P>Lindsey German, convener of the <a href="http://www.stopwar.org.uk/" target="_new">Stop the War Coalition</a>, said: "We fully support the action that has been taken to impede an unjust and aggressive war. We hope that other people around the country will be able to do likewise."  

<P>The anti-war group is organizing a second national demonstration in central London on Saturday February 15. Organizers claimed more than 400,000 people attended a protest in September.
