<p>COLORADO SPRINGS - The city could land in court for denying protesters access to the delegates and reporters at the NATO defense ministers meeting here.
<p>The <a href="http://www.aclu-co.org/index.html" target="_new">American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado</a> is considering whether to file the lawsuit on behalf of six members of Citizens for Peace in Space, a Colorado Springs group. "Their First Amendment rights have been violated, in my view," ACLU legal director Mark Silverstein said Wednesday.

<p>"Of course the police have a legitimate interest in assuring the security of the NATO conference," he said. "The question is whether they're banning too much expression over too wide a geographical area."

<p>Police on Wednesday blocked the six from entering a "security zone," a two-block perimeter around the Broadmoor Hotel, where the ministers have been holding their two-day meeting that ends today.

<p>"We'd like to chitchat with some of the delegates and the international press," said group spokesman Bill Sulzman. "We want to give them a different point of view than they're getting from (U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald) Rumsfeld."

<p>Sulzman said the United States is violating international weapons nonproliferation treaties.

<p>City litigation attorney Lori Miskel told Sulzman on Wednesday that his group wouldn't be allowed inside the perimeter because of security issues. "It's within a security zone that we believe is necessary for the safety of the delegates," she said.

<p>She added that to allow one group access would open the way for others. "I could not have denied other groups access within the security perimeter if I had allowed your group in," she said.

<p>Silverstein said even residents living within the perimeter have been banned from posting protest signs in their yards. "It's not a security zone. It's a no-protest zone," he said.
