<p>WASHINGTON — When Dennis J. Kucinich was the enfant terrible of Cleveland politics back in the 1970's and at 31 became the youngest person ever elected mayor of a major American city, it was not far-fetched to think that he would someday be a presidential contender. Beyond his proven ability as an electoral winner, he had plenty of time remaining to reach for higher office.</p>

</table></font>"At the time he was mayor, Dennis had everything in the world going for him," said Louis Stokes, who represented Cleveland for 30 years as a congressman and backed Mr. Kucinich for mayor. "He was destined to climb high."<p></p>
<P> But it all came crashing quickly down when Mr. Kucinich presided over the city's plunge into default in 1978. The collapse attracted international ridicule and, except for a brief sojourn on the City Council in the early 80's, left the obstreperous boy wonder in political exile for 15 years before he revived his career with election first to the Ohio Senate, then to Congress.</p>
<P> Now, in his fourth term in the House, his face creased with age and experience, the 56-year-old Mr. Kucinich is again seeking to defy the doubters by running for president, offering himself as a liberal's liberal.</p>
<P> His candidacy's immediate problem is that in selling himself as an antiwar activist, he has railed against a popular president and a war that has found strong public support. Worse still, perhaps, his cash-poor campaign barely has an organization.</p>
<P> But if his candidacy does seem far-fetched after all, Mr. Kucinich does not appear to mind that few people give him much chance of winning the Democratic nomination, let alone the presidency.</p>

</table>"I'm used to fighting for lost causes," he said in an interview. "I am used to doing things that other people say are impossible. I have learned throughout my whole life that you can turn it around."<p></p>
<P> Mr. Kucinich, known to some colleagues as Dennis the Menace for his energetic doggedness and somewhat impish looks, is co-chairman of the Progressive Caucus, which represents the left-most reaches of the House Democratic membership. He is a champion of universal health care, wants to return the retirement age for full Social Security benefits to 65 and would repeal the North American Free Trade Agreement, which he says has sapped the nation of millions of jobs.</p>
<P> Some who know him say his chief reason for running is to cement a role as national leader of the left. But he insists that he is serious about being president, and says the driving force behind his candidacy is his outrage at the war against Iraq and the prospect of future wars he fears President Bush will wage.</p>
<P> "The administration's illegal attack on Iraq is not just about Iraq," he said. "It is about Iran, it is about North Korea, it is about Libya, perhaps it is about Syria." </p>
<P> Mr. Kucinich credits himself for helping inspire a majority of House Democrats, 126, to vote last fall against the resolution authorizing Mr. Bush to use force in Iraq. Unlike many of his colleagues, he continued to voice opposition once the conflict began. "It is not logical to say you oppose the war and once the war started, you support it," he said.</p>
<P> He is also re-emphasizing his argument that the nation's military buildup, coupled with the president's push for tax cuts, is draining money that could be used for critical domestic programs. And this month he reintroduced his proposal to create a cabinet-level Department of Peace.</p>
<P> Mr. Kucinich began his improbable political career while still in college, after a childhood in which his struggling family moved almost constantly. He was out on his own at 17, and in 1967 lost a race for the Cleveland City Council. Having quickly learned how to tap into a populist vein of ethnic politics, he was back two years later, elected to the Council at age 23. He lost Congressional races in 1972 and 1974 but remained a force in local politics, was elected mayor in 1977 and governed the city with a tight circle of friends. </p>
<P> But Cleveland's finances, already troubled, spiraled out of control. The climactic moment came in December 1978, when the city was unable to meet $14.5 million in bond obligations. Despite pressure from the business community, Mayor Kucinich refused to sell the municipal electric system to cover the debt. Cleveland went bust, as did his career.</p>
<P> Shattered by the loss of the mayor's office the next year to George V. Voinovich, a Republican who is now Ohio's junior senator, Mr. Kucinich taught college courses, worked in radio and television, and started a broadcast production company. (He still carries his membership card from the cinematographers' union.) </p>
<P> His return to politics was spurred by a phone call in 1993 from a reporter for Cleveland's daily, The Plain Dealer. The reporter was pursuing a story about how local officials had now concluded that Mr. Kucinich had been right in refusing to sell the utility. Once the article appeared, "people started coming up to me and said, `Why don't you come back?' " he recalled. The slogan for his subsequent race for the State Senate was "Because he was right," with a light-bulb logo. </p>
<P> In 1996, two years after his state legislative victory, Mr. Kucinich ran for the House and unseated a Republican incumbent, Martin R. Hoke. He made a well-received entry to the capital, stealing the show at a Washington press dinner where, in lampooning Speaker Newt Gingrich's view of civilization, he introduced his own cornerstones: "polka, bowling and kielbasa" (though he is in fact a longtime vegetarian).</p>
<P> Mr. Kucinich's knack for self-promotion sometimes irritates colleagues, but few doubt his conviction. When he offered a proposal this month to cut the emergency wartime spending bill by a third in an effort to end the Iraq conflict, the House's senior military appropriator, Representative Jerry Lewis, Republican of California, took the floor and said he knew that Mr. Kucinich was sincere. "I happen to think he is absolutely wrong," Mr. Lewis said, "but I have risen in part to support his right to express that position."</p>
<P> Mr. Kucinich's fervent antiwar position is drawing him some notice in Iowa, whose presidential caucuses are an important grass-roots test in which activists can have considerable influence.</p>
<P> "I think he is the kind of candidate who could benefit from the Iowa caucuses," said Al Sturgeon, the Democratic chairman there in Woodbury County, a place of strong antiwar sentiment. "I think he could establish himself as the candidate who tells it like it is."</p>
<P> But Mr. Sturgeon said he had yet to see much organization on Mr. Kucinich's behalf. The congressman, who formally entered the race in February, had raised barely $173,000 by April 15, had hired just five people for his campaign staff and had opened offices only in Cleveland, Northern California and Iowa.</p>
<P> David Axelrod, a newspaper reporter turned Democratic political consultant, once covered Mr. Kucinich in Cleveland. "Even accounting for the fact that he has pulled off some of the biggest upsets in Ohio political history, it is hard to envision him pulling off the biggest upset in American political history," said Mr. Axelrod, who recently joined the campaign of a Kucinich rival for the nomination, Senator John Edwards of North Carolina.</p>
<P> Mr. Kucinich could also run into trouble because of the abortion issue. A longtime opponent of abortion, he began softening his stand last year and says he he now supports a woman's right to choose and would not appoint judges unless they pledged to support Roe v. Wade. David Loesback, a political science professor at Cornell College in Mount Vernon, Iowa, said that kind of shifting could be viewed by liberals as an election-year conversion. </p>
<P> But Professor Loesback said he could also see Mr. Kucinich making gains in Iowa, and the candidate himself says he will catch on with Americans who want the country to be taken in a "different direction." His doing so would be a remarkable step in what has already been a remarkable political resurrection.</p>
<P> "It took me 15 years to make any kind of significant political comeback," he said. "Luckily I had 15 years to spare."</p>
