<p>LONDON - George W. Bush flew into Britain on
Tuesday for a visit during which the U.S. president and his top
ally Tony Blair will close ranks against a groundswell of
protest over the Iraq  war.

</table></font>The two men may have hoped the trip would mark their
countries' victory side by side in Iraq, but increasing attacks
on their occupying forces have dulled any sense of celebration
and massive street protests await Bush in London.
 
<p>
 Organizers expect up to 100,000 anti-war demonstrators to
cap their protest by toppling a giant statue of Bush in central
London's Trafalgar Square on Thursday -- an echo of the
toppling of a statue of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein  in April.
 <p>
 The first protest was staged in central London just as
Bush's presidential jet Air Force One touched down at Heathrow
Airport at around 7:15 p.m. local time (2:15 EST). About 1,000
demonstrators voiced their opposition to U.S. environmental
policy.
 <p>
 Meanwhile, Bush was given a red carpet welcome at Heathrow
by heir to the throne Prince Charles and a Royal Air Force
guard of honor. Bush and wife Laura then boarded a helicopter
which flew them to Buckingham Palace, where they will stay.
 <p>
 If Prime Minister Blair is a reluctant host he has shown no
sign of it, robustly defending his decision to defy other big
European powers and support Bush's war in Iraq.
 
<p>
 "The prime minister believes this is precisely the right
time for President Bush  to be visiting this country," Blair's
spokesman said.
 <p>
 BUSH IS EQUALLY DEFIANT.
 <p>
 A senior official traveling with Bush on the presidential
jet to London said he would tell the British people that there
are times when the use of military force is necessary.
 <p>
 "History has shown that there are times when countries must
use force to defend the peace and to defend values and he will
say that we have to recognize that times will come when the use
of force is necessary. It is never the first choice," the
official told reporters.
 <p>
 London's maverick Mayor Ken Livingstone has called Bush
"the most dangerous man on the planet" and said that, even if
asked, he would refuse to shake hands with the American leader.
 <p>
 British police are mounting a five million pound (&#36;8.5
million) security clampdown, with weekend suicide bombings in
Istanbul adding to the tensions.
 <p>
 British commentators say the visit will be uncomfortable
for Blair -- under fire at home over Iraq, especially within
his own left-leaning Labour Party.
 <p>
 But Blair has remained steadfast. In a key foreign affairs
speech last week he said critics of the war should accept that
Iraqis were better off without Saddam, and denounced what he
called a "propaganda monster about America."
 <p>
 Despite much talk in the media about Bush's unpopularity, a
poll in the left-leaning Guardian newspaper showed more British
voters welcome the visit than reject it, and that 62 percent
think America "a force for good, not evil, in the world."
 <p>
 Bush and Blair are expected to hammer out details of plans
discussed last week for speeding up the transfer of sovereignty
in Iraq to an interim government.
 <p>
 Blair will also hope to clinch a deal on British detainees
at the U.S. camp in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. There are now 10
Britons among more than 600 prisoners there, and London has
complained about plans to try some under military tribunals.
<p>
 Bush plans to meet relatives of British soldiers who died
in Iraq and has put special emphasis on those meetings in
interviews ahead of the visit. But relatives of fallen soldiers
are now among the most potent critics of the war.
<p>
Blair will also hope for a concession over trade, but a
U.S. official said before Bush's arrival that no announcement
on steel tariffs would be made during the visit.
