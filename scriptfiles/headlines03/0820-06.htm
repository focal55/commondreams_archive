<p>KABUL, Afghanistan -- War-ruined Afghanistan celebrated its Independence Day yesterday amid one of the bloodiest weeks in the past year, with heavily armed guerrillas killing at least nine policemen in the latest in a string of ambushes.



<p>There were also fresh assaults on aid workers. Twenty gunmen raided a mine-clearing group's compound in a province west of Kabul, beating five employees with rifle butts.



<p>During a speech to mark Afghanistan's 84th anniversary of its independence from Britain, President Hamid Karzai urged his countrymen to take responsibility for rebuilding a nation laid waste by nearly a quarter of a century of fighting and dependent on foreign aid.



<p>"It is the duty of everybody to launch a holy war to reconstruct this nation," Karzai told a crowd of several thousand that included Cabinet ministers and diplomats. "We must try harder. We must catch up with the rest of the world."



<p>Karzai made no mention of the stepped-up guerrilla activity. Visitors to the stadium were searched by Karzai's American bodyguards, as well as Afghan intelligence agents and police. Outside, NATO-led peacekeepers stood guard.



<p>In the last week, Afghanistan has been battered by an onslaught from insurgents, believed to be a mix of guerrillas from the ousted Taliban regime, Al Qaeda fighters, and supporters of renegade warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar.



<p>This follows reports that the Taliban's fugitive leader, Mullah Mohammed Omar, has improved coordination among his commanders, dividing Afghanistan into military areas of control.



<p>"These new attacks are a result of their reorganizing," said Hatiqulluh Luddin, a government commander in Logar Province. "Now they even have finance officers to support their operations."



<p>Last Wednesday, at least 64 people were killed in scattered violence, some of that linked to feuding warlords. Over the weekend, at least 26 police and insurgents were killed when huge groups of guerrillas attacked two police stations in eastern Paktika Province.



<p>In the southern city of Kandahar yesterday, an explosion, which was apparently an accident, ripped through the home of Karzai's brother, wounding a servant who was moving arms stored in the basement. Ahmed Wali Karzai said the munitions and explosives that caused the blast had been confiscated in an earlier security raid. "It was a bad incident. But it was not a terrorist attack," he said. Yesterday evening, about 3,000 people attended independence celebrations at Kandahar's main soccer stadium, once used by the Taliban for public executions. The event was attended by hundreds of women, who under Taliban rule were barred from attending such festivities.



<p>On Monday, suspected Taliban insurgents had struck again, killing at least nine police officers in an ambush in Logar Province, south of Kabul, Luddin said.



<p>About 12 gunmen opened fire with shoulder-fired rockets and machine guns.



<p>Security forces arrested seven people.



<p>Also on Monday, a group of 20 armed men raided a compound belonging to the Mine Dog Center in Wardak Province, west of Kabul, beating five employees and destroying vehicles.



<p>Eight men were arrested, local police said.
