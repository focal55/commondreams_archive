<p>WASHINGTON - Many U.S. academics who oppose an  invasion of Iraq now believe the chances of avoiding war are  slim and shrinking and expect President Bush to override or  ignore all remaining obstacles.

<p>



"War is not inevitable but it's become very likely. The  determination shown by President Bush and his advisers to deal  with Iraq has been stunning. It's been an impressive political  feat and an impressive use of power," said Robert Powell, a  professor of international relations at the University of  California, Berkeley.<p>



		Last summer, Powell was one of 33 prominent U.S. academics  to sign a statement that ran as an advertisement in the New  York Times arguing against an invasion of Iraq.<p>



		The professors argued then that the Bush administration  should pursue a policy of containment against Iraqi President  Saddam Hussein while focusing its main efforts on fighting the  al Qaeda organization of Osama bin Laden.<p>



		They also warned that the United States might find itself  occupying Iraq for years to come which would spread instability  in the Middle East and create new threats to U.S. interests.<p>



		Interviewed this week, several said they still believed  that and were worried by the precedent that an invasion of Iraq  would set and by the fact that Bush was apparently willing to  attack with or without specific authorization from the United  Nations Security Council. But they were unanimous in saying  that war had now become almost inevitable.<p>



		Though France and Germany continue to oppose an attack,  other European countries have begun lining up behind Bush,  despite the fact that international public opinion is running  heavily against war in almost every country in the world.<p>



		"When push comes to shove, most nations will find reasons  not to cross the United States and at this point it would be a  tremendous embarrassment to Bush to step back," said Richard  Betts, a political scientist at Columbia University.<p>



		"When America makes it clear it is not going to be stopped,  most other countries tend to go along. The big question is  whether key nations like France, Russia and China with Security  Council vetoes will stand aside or get on board," he said.<p>



		Even U.S. public opinion is far from enthusiastically  behind Bush, who says Iraq must be disarmed because its alleged  illegal arms programs pose a threat to the United States and  its allies. Polls have repeatedly shown a majority strongly  favors going to war only with U.N. authorization and at the  head of a wide international coalition.<p>



		RALLY BEHIND TROOPS<p>



		The president appears to be banking on the fact that once  the fighting starts, the nation will rally behind its fighting  men and women and if the war goes well, previous misgivings  will become irrelevant.<p>



		"The Democrats, who are the organized political opposition  in this country, have been scared to step forward and lead an  anti-war movement even though public opinion has been divided  and there is considerable anti-war feeling in the country,"  said Jack Levy who teaches international relations at Rutgers  University in New Jersey.<p>



		Secretary of State Colin Powell is going to unveil new  information next week to the Security Council that purports to  back up Washington's argument that Iraq is continuing to  develop weapons of mass destruction. That could prompt more  nations to get on the bandwagon.<p>



		"The Bush administration is beginning to put real pressure  on key nations like France, which may be the decisive voice in  determining if there is a real international coalition or just  a paper coalition behind Bush," said Robert Pape, a political  scientist at the University of Chicago.<p>



		"If the French come on board, war is a certainty. But if  they are not convinced by Powell's evidence, they may not be  moved," he said.<p>



		Phyllis Bennis of the Institute of Policy Studies, a  liberal Washington think-tank which has opposed an invasion of  Iraq, said the United States was approaching France and other  key nations with a mixture of bribes and veiled threats.<p>



		For example, if war comes and Saddam is deposed, billions  of dollars of contracts could soon become available for  reconstruction projects in Iraq. Countries which opposed the  fighting might find themselves cut out of the action.<p>



		Bennis said Bush's statement on Thursday that he was  willing to consider exile for Saddam suggested he might still  be looking for a way to declare victory without fighting.<p>



		But she too conceded, "It's hard to believe that there  won't be a war."
