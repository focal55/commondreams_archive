<p>WASHINGTON, Oct. 24 — Congressional investigators have determined that a top Bush administration air-quality regulator was warned that administration proposals to revise federal clean-air regulations could  harm government lawsuits to force power plants and refineries to make upgrades that would sharply reduce the pollution they produce. </p>
<P>
With the release of the report this week by the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, several Democratic senators have called for an investigation by the inspector general of the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
<P>
The senators contend that the administration official, Jeffrey R. Holmstead, the assistant E.P.A. administrator for air and radiation, may not have been honest with them in testimony before Congress last year.</p>
<P>
Appearing before a Senate committee in July 2002, Mr. Holmstead testified, "We do not believe these changes will have a negative impact on the enforcement cases."</p>
<P>
But the report by the accounting office indicates that Mr. Holmstead took  part in at least one of several meetings in 2001 and 2002 attended by  members of the environmental agency's enforcement staff in which the regulatory changes were discussed.</p>
<P>
During those meetings, the accounting office's investigators found, members of the "enforcement staff raised concerns about the revisions' potential adverse impact on the cases."</p>
<P>
In addition, Public Citizen, the group founded by Ralph Nader, has obtained a memorandum, dated June 3, 2002, in which a top E.P.A. enforcement official at the time, Sylvia K. Lowrance, writes to Mr. Holmstead that a "number of proposals" being examined as revisions to clean-air regulations "could undermine current enforcement activities if promulgated as final rules."</p>
<P>
Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, said this week that the report by the accounting office indicated that Mr. Holmstead "intentionally misled Senate committees last year and has continued to work to get industry polluters off the hook and out of court."</p>
<P>
Mr. Leahy and two other senators, James M. Jeffords, independent of Vermont, and Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, have asked for the E.P.A. investigation. Mr. Lieberman is running for the Democratic presidential nomination.</p>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the agency said there were "extensive discussions" among staff members both before and after Mr. Holmstead's testimony about how the rules could affect enforcement actions. But she said that Mr. Holmstead, after taking into consideration all the available information, believed then, and continues to believe today, that the proposals he testified about last year would not affect enforcement.</p>
<P>
"The criticism of Mr. Holmstead's testimony is misleading," said the spokeswoman, Lisa Harrison. "His comments were accurate in that the upcoming rule would not have an impact on enforcement."</p>
<P>
Frank Clemente, the director of Public Citizen's Congress Watch, said the corporations that  could be affected by the clean-air revisions donated $4.8 million to the Bush campaign and the Republican Party during the 2000 election cycle.
