<p>SACRAMENTO --
A state commission on Wednesday denied a Texas company's plan to 
sell genetically altered, glow-in-the-dark fish in California pet stores, 
calling fluorescent fish an example of science gone wrong.
<P>The decision by the state Fish and Game Commission makes California the 
only state to ban GloFish, which will be available for aquariums in the rest 
of the country next month. Despite conclusions from several scientists that 
the new breed of fish posed little threat to the state's natural resources, 
three of four commissioners said genetically engineered pets are simply too 
scary to endorse.
<P>"At the end of the day, I don't think it's right to produce a new 
organism just to be a pet,'' said Commissioner Sam Schuchat. "What's next? A 
pig with wings?''

</table>Schuchat said he consulted with his rabbi about the ethics of the genetic 
engineering before coming to his decision.
<P>The ban is the latest round in a continuing battle in California over 
genetically engineered fish, referred to as transgenic fish. It's a dispute 
that's only happening here: No other state in the country has rules like 
California's that prohibit modified fish. The federal government also has no 
guidelines.
<P>Austin, Texas-based Yorktown Technologies has spent the past two years 
tinkering with zebra- fish, common in a lot of fish tanks, to turn them into 
Glo- Fish. The fish are injected with either green or red fluorescent proteins;
 their spawn become intensely bright under a black light.
<P>The idea was first developed by a university in Singapore that is 
developing a fish that will glow in the dark if it encounters toxins. It's 
called an environmental monitoring fish.
<P>Over protests from environmentalists and commercial fishing groups, the 
company hoped to convince the commission Wednesday for an exemption to the 
state's ban on transgenic fish. 
<P>It presented written testimony from scientists concluding that if a 
GloFish made its way from a tank to the wild, it would not survive and would 
not be toxic to predators. 
<P>"These are tropical fish,'' said Ed Pert, chief of the fisheries branch 
of the state Department of Fish and Game, noting that zebrafish have been sold 
in California pet stores for 50 years and have never survived outside of homes.
<P>Pert and other state officials had recommended the commission allow the 
company to sell its product.
<P>Alan Blake, the company's president, told the commission he expected the 
GloFish to be a hot seller, noting it had made the front page of the New York 
Times and the cover of Tropical Fish Hobbyist magazine.
<P>Afterward, Blake said he was disappointed the commission seemed to put 
personal preferences ahead of scientific evidence.
<P>"It's unfortunate that the consumers of California won't be able to make 
their own decisions,'' he said.
<P>The commission's decision is a big blow to the company. California 
consumers buy 25 million fish for aquariums every year and comprise more than 
10 percent of the national market.
<P>Michael Flores, the lone commissioner to support the company's plan, 
noted anyone who wanted the fish will be able to acquire them in Arizona or 
Nevada.
<P>But environmentalists said the risk is too great that the altered fish 
could someday wreak havoc on the state's environment. Aquariums are the second 
biggest contributor to non-native fish species making their way into 
California streams and lakes.
<P>"Why should we take the risk for something so trivial as a pet,'' said 
Rebecca Spector, West Coast director of the nonprofit Center for Food Safety.
<P>And several commissioners said they saw no reason to OK a mutated fish 
that had no medical or research value. Earlier in the meeting, the commission 
did allow a permit to produce transgenic zebrafish that will be used for 
research. 
<P>But commissioners warned that if they allowed red or green fish, more 
requests would likely come.
<P>"Welcome to the future,'' Schuchat said. "Here we are, playing with the 
genetic bases of life.''</p>
