<p>VATICAN CITY   - Pope John Paul will send a senior  cardinal to Washington with a letter for President Bush in a  personal peace mission to try to avert a war in Iraq, the  Vatican said on Saturday.<p>



		Cardinal Pio Laghi, a former ambassador to the United  States and a personal friend of the Bush family, will leave in  the next few days.<p>



		"The cardinal...will illustrate the position and the  initiatives taken by the Holy See to contribute to disarmament  and peace in the Middle East," the Vatican said in a statement.<p>



		Showing an energy that belies his 82 years, the Pope has  become increasingly involved in diplomatic efforts to prevent a  second Gulf war, which he has said would be a "defeat for  humanity."<p>



		In the past month he has received a stream of foreign  leaders, including British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Iraqi  Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz and U.N. Secretary-General  Kofi Annan.<p>



		Now the Vatican is knocking on the White House door, just  weeks after dispatching a special envoy to Baghdad to try to  persuade Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to cooperate with  United Nations weapons inspectors.<p>



		Cardinal Roger Etchegaray, a Frenchman who has carried out  sensitive papal missions in the past, met Saddam in February  for 90 minutes and handed him a message from the Holy See.<p>



		Laghi's trip to the United States comes as Washington  continues to build a large military force in the Gulf region  and Bush looks firmly on the track to war.<p>



		"My attitude toward Saddam Hussein is that if he had any  intentions of disarming, he would have disarmed," Bush told USA  Today. "We will disarm him now."<p>



		The Vatican does not believe an attack on Iraq could be  considered a "just war," opposes U.N. economic sanctions  against Iraq and argues that diplomacy is the only way to  settle the dispute.<p>



		Earlier this week Italian media quoted White House  spokesman Ari Fleischer as saying Bush would not be influenced  by the Pontiff's opinion.<p>



		In the past the Roman Catholic Church has argued that the  use of force must meet tough conditions of legitimacy -- all  other means must be exhausted and the force used must be  proportionate to the wrong it tries to right.<p>



		That is the message that 80-year-old Laghi, who had close  ties to the Bush senior administration and used to play tennis  with the family, is expected to deliver.<p>



		It is also the message being hammered home in pulpits  around the world --including in Catholic strongholds Mexico and  Chile, two of the 15 nations on the Security Council, whose  votes will be crucial in an expected final United Nations  ballot on Iraq.<p>



		Vatican officials concede that the Pope alone is not going  to prevent a U.S. attack, but say at the very least his  anti-war stance shows the Muslim world that a strike against  Iraq is not some sort of crusade.<p>



		The Pope has called for a day of peace, fasting and prayer  on March 5 to show that "the future of humanity will never be  secured by terrorism or the logic of war."
