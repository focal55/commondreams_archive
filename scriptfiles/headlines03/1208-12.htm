<p>HUTALA, Afghanistan, Dec. 7 — Their embroidered caps, shredded with shrapnel, lay beside a half-dozen small rubber galoshes and caked pools of blood. Seven boys and two girls died here on Saturday morning in an American airstrike, and their bodies were still lying in the dust when American soldiers arrived by helicopter to assess the results of the attack three hours later, villagers and American soldiers at the scene said Sunday.</p>
<P>
A 25-year-old Afghan man was also killed, the villagers said, while the intended target, a Taliban suspect who lived here and bragged about attacking foreign aid workers, might have gotten away, contrary to official accounts that he, too, was among the dead. Some villagers said the suspect and his family, whose house was unscathed in the attack, had not been seen for weeks.</p>

      Afghan girls walk past the graves of nine children killed in a U.S. air strike, at a local cemetery in village Hutala, in eastern Afghanistan, Sunday, Dec. 7, 2003. A U.S. warplane in pursuit of a 'known terrorist' attacked a village in eastern Afghanistan, Saturday,  killing nine children. Clothes of the children are seen placed on graves.<br>

  </table></font>The attack has raised questions about the quality of American military intelligence and the effectiveness of using air power to kill fugitive members of the Taliban and Al Qaeda who are hiding in villages. Afghanistan's president, Hamid Karzai, said he was "profoundly shocked" at the deaths of the children and had sent a delegation to investigate and to offer help to the families. In an interview with the BBC, Mr. Karzai said future military operations should be better coordinated with the Afghan government.</p>
<P>
The American military command expressed regret for the killings and sent officers to this village in a remote area of southern Ghazni Province on Sunday to apologize. But that did little to erase the shock, grief and anger over the dead children.</p>
<P>
"As a human, what would you think?" said Khial Muhammad Hoseini, the deputy governor of the province. "Everyone would be angry at this. We cannot afford this sort of thing, killing innocent Afghans." </p>
<P>
Villagers said the dead boys, who were 8 to 12 years old, had been in front of a house, and the girls, 9 and 10, had been fetching water from a stream alongside it when two American A-10 attack jets firing rockets and machine guns struck at 10:45 a.m.</p>
<P>
"The boys were playing marbles," said one villager, thrusting forward a gnarled hand with three chipped glass marbles he said he had retrieved from the dust.</p>
<P>
The rockets made 30 to 40 small craters in the ground around where the children had died. The 10th victim, an uncle of the two girls, rushed toward the stream after the first plane struck and was cut down beside them, said a woman who identified herself as the man's mother and the dead girls' grandmother.</p>
<P>
Villagers in this small hamlet about 185 miles south of Kabul in southeastern Afghanistan said they buried the victims on Saturday night. On Sunday afternoon, the men were mourning in an open-air mosque and the women were weeping inside the houses. As some men showed journalists and a government delegation around the scene of the killings, they wondered aloud how the Americans could attack so indiscriminately when searching for just one man who, they said, was not even in the village.</p>
<P>
"They bombed this place and said we were giving sanctuary to the Taliban and Al Qaeda, but there are no Taliban or Al Qaeda here," said Abdul Majid Farooqi, the school principal and local mullah. "We all support the government." </p>
<P>
American officials have said the intended target was a man named Mullah Wazir, a Taliban member believed to have been behind several attacks on aid workers in the region and on construction engineers working on a major American project to rebuild the Kabul-Kandahar road.</p>
<P>
The American ambassador to Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, said at a news conference on Sunday in Kabul that Mr. Wazir was a "financier, organizer and facilitator of attacks on aid workers and workers on the highways." Two Indian workers employed on the construction project were reported to have been kidnapped Saturday evening in Zabul Province. There has been a rash of kidnappings and shootings in the area along the road, especially in Zabul Province, just south of here, all apparently attacks by the Taliban to disrupt the reconstruction.</p>
<P>
Villagers said Mr. Wazir had left the village two weeks ago with his family after an American airstrike on a nearby field.</p>
<P>
American soldiers pointed out the house where the family had been living, which they said had been searched, but was otherwise untouched by the bombardment. </p>
<P>
Hundreds of civilians have been killed in American airstrikes in the two years since the United States began its military campaign against the Taliban and Al Qaeda in Afghanistan. After several disastrous raids last year in which planes bombed officials loyal to the Karzai government and after one incident that killed 48 civilians at a wedding party last July, the United States had appeared to restrict air assaults to more precise attacks, and only when groups of militants were engaged by coalition troops.</p>
<P>
Nevertheless, the Saturday attack is at least the third this year in which civilians have been killed or wounded. Eleven members of one family were killed in April in Paktika, in eastern Afghanistan, when American forces called in airstrikes on militants escaping toward the Pakistani border. Eight people, including women and children, were killed in a village in the northern province of Nuristan on Oct. 30 when American planes bombed their village at night. The United States military acknowledged the April bombing but has not confirmed responsibility for the Nuristan bombing.</p>
<P>
This time American soldiers were sent into the village within three hours of the airstrike to assess the scene, Capt. Jorge Cordeiro, the company commander, said in an interview at the scene. Standing amid fruit trees in an orchard slightly away from the village, he spoke as a Chinook helicopter escorted by an Apache helicopter gunship landed. "We came in to secure the site and do an assessment and allow for another team to come in and do the investigation," he said.</p>
<P>
The investigation team arrived Sunday and had left by midafternoon, he said. The rest of the company was ready to pull out too, he said, after his men had exploded a number of munitions found in the village. The soldiers had also detained four armed men but said they would probably be released.</p>
<P>
There was no further official statement from the United States military, pending the results of the investigation, but Mr. Khalilzad and the Afghan interior minister, Ahmed Ali Jalali, both said Sunday that Mr. Wazir had been killed.</p>
<P>
Yet on the ground in the village, residents contradicted that assertion. Captain Cordeiro confirmed that the soldiers had found nine dead children and one dead adult who could have been the target, he said. But he said that the soldiers had not talked to villagers or identified the dead man.</p>
<P>
Villagers said he was Abdul Muhammad, 25, who had returned 10 days earlier from Iran, where he had been working for three years digging wells. The woman who identified herself as his mother said she had finally arranged his wedding and he had returned for his engagement party, which was just five days away. "I was so pleased to have my son back," said the woman, who said her name was Guldana. "And now he is dead." </p>
<P>
She had lost not only her son in the airstrike but her two granddaughters, Bibi Toara, 10, and Bibi Tamama, 9.</p>
<P>
Two brothers in the village, Sarwar Khan and Hamidullah, lost three children between them, they said. "The Americans are all the time making these mistakes," said Mr. Khan, who two sons, Faizullah, 8, and Obeidullah, 10, were killed. "What kind of Al Qaeda are they? Look at their little shoes and hats. Are they terrorists?"</p>
