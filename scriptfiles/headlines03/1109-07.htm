<p>Increasingly alarmed by the failure of Iraq's Governing Council to take decisive 
action, the Bush administration is developing possible alternatives to the council 
to ensure that the United States can turn over political power at the same time 
and pace that troops are withdrawn, according to senior US officials in Washington 
and in Baghdad. <p>The United States is deeply frustrated with its hand-picked 
council members because they have spent more time on their own political or economic 
interests than in planning for Iraq's political future, especially selecting a 
committee to write a new constitution, the officials added. <p>"We're unhappy 
with all of them. They're not acting as a legislative or governing body, and we 
need to get moving," said a well-placed US official who spoke on the condition 
of anonymity. <p>Ambassador Robert Blackwill, the new National Security Council 
official overseeing Iraq's political transition, begins an unannounced trip this 
weekend to Iraq to meet with Iraqi politicians to drive home that point. <p>The 
United States is even considering a French proposal, earlier rejected, to hold 
a national conference -- like the Loya Jirga used in Afghanistan -- to select 
a provisional government that would have the rights of sovereignty. <p>Among several 
options, the administration is also considering changing the order of the transition 
if it looks as though it could drag on longer than planned. The United States 
has long insisted that a new constitution was the essential first step and elections 
the final phase in handing over power. <p>But now US officials are exploring the 
possibility, again backed by other Security Council members, of creating a provisional 
government with effective sovereignty to govern until a new constitution is written 
and elections held. This is again similar to Afghanistan, where President Hamid 
Karzai has governed while a new national charter is written. <p>Two weeks ago, 
Bremer met with the council and bluntly told members that they "can't go on like 
this," a senior US official in Baghdad said. Bremer noted that at least half the 
council is out of the country at any given time and that at some meetings, only 
four or five members show up. Since the council appointed 25 Cabinet ministers 
in August, the body has done "nothing of substance," the US official in Baghdad 
added. <p ALIGN="CENTER">© Copyright 2003 Globe Newspaper Company. <p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable --></font></td></tr>
