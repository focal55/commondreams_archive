<p>LOS ANGELES   - Californians rose up in political  revolution on Tuesday, storming the polls in record numbers to  throw their governor out of office and elect in his place  Arnold Schwarzenegger -- an Austrian-born film star who tapped  into a deep vein of voter anger.<P>
Network exit poll projections showed that when all votes  are counted, Gov. Gray Davis would be swept out of office in  stunning defeat as Californians vented their unhappiness with  the career politician.<P>
It was an unexpected end for the man once mentioned as a  possible presidential candidate. He had called the recall a  "right-wing power grab" and boasted that he would survive, but  the political veteran with 30 years of climbing the statehouse  ladder was beaten by a man who never spent a day in government.<P>
The historic recall election that only months ago was  written off as a circus with 135 candidates -- including a porn  star, smut peddler, sumo wrestler and a muscleman with the  foreign accent -- has become a watershed political moment.<P>
Davis -- reelected only in November -- became the first  governor of California ever essentially fired by the people who  put him in office and Republicans gained a critical bully  pulpit in a heavily Democratic state with the 2004 presidential  election looming.<P>
Schwarzenegger also appeared headed for a commanding  victory from voters, who embraced his lack of political  experience and outsider status and shrugged off a blizzard of  last-minute sexual harassment allegations by 15 women.<P>
An estimated 10 million California voters cast ballots in  the special election, 30 percent more than voted in the  governor's race that reelected Davis last year and the biggest  turnout for any nonpresidential contest in state history,  according to the Field Research Corp.<P>
RECALL THEM ALL?<P>
Political analysts said the lion's share of the higher  turnout was coming from disaffected voters galvanized by  Schwarzenegger.<P>
Experts said the "Terminator" star took advantage of the  political landscape in California, where voters felt ignored by  their leaders in Sacramento and cut off from their government  amid a worsening state economy that politicians failed to fix  because of fierce partisan squabbling.<P>
"If Californians had the constitutional right to recall all  120 members of the state legislature they probably would have  done that too," Allan Hoffenblum, a Republican political  consultant, said.<P>
Analysts said that despite the news media's fixation on  Schwarzenegger, the key to the election was not so much the  action film star as it was Davis -- a profoundly uncharismatic  man who seemed passionate only about raising campaign funds and  was estranged from many state leaders.<P>
"He was all but marginalized and ineffectual and the voters  knew it and they were fed up with it," Hoffenblum said.<P>
While some pundits ascribed Schwarzenegger's success on the  replacement ballot to his movie star status and Populist  rhetoric, analysts said much of the actor's strength came from  his centrist message. The Republican staked out socially  liberal and fiscally conservative positions that appealed to  most Californians.<P>
"You had Cruz Bustamante on the left talking about $8  billion in new taxes and more rights for illegal immigrants and  Tom McClintock on the right and they gave the entire middle to  Arnold Schwarzenegger," Hoffenblum said.<P>
Schwarzenegger's ascendance was seen as a victory for  Republicans -- who hold few statewide offices and saw the state  vote for Democrat Al Gore in the last presidential election --  and devastating to Democrats who control both houses of the  legislature but now must work with the new governor to solve  the state's problems or face voter rage themselves.<P>
Although results seemed clear Tuesday night after polls  closed it could be weeks until the state certifies the official  result and some observers held out the prospect of a recount or  court challenge.
