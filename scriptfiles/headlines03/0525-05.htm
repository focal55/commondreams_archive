<p>The father of a 20-year-old Marine killed during the early days of fighting in Iraq told an anti-war rally Saturday that young people can accomplish more with an education than as soldiers.

<p>Fernando Suarez del Solar of Escondido addressed about 200 people at the march and rally sponsored by the San Diego Coalition for Peace and Justice.

<p>His 20-year-old son, Marine Lance Cpl. Jesus A. Suarez del Solar, died March 27 when he stepped on an unexploded U.S. cluster bomb.

<p>"Instead of grabbing a rifle, young people should be allowed to have books," Suarez said in a telephone interview after his speech in front of a Balboa Park war memorial. "With a book, an education, these young people can do more good in the world than with a weapon."

<p>Suarez said that by promoting peace, he hoped to save the life of other soldiers, especially "those who are forced into the military because of a lack of opportunity."

<p>"For Latinos especially, we need more opportunities for education outside of military service," he added.

<p>Suarez said his son had wanted to join the Marines since age 13. He brought his family from Tijuana to Escondido in 1997 to help his son fulfill that wish.

<p>His son was a member of the 1st Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion, 1st Marine Division, based at Camp Pendleton. He is survived by a wife and a toddler son.

<p>"I want everyone to remember my son as a loving and brave young man," Suarez said. "He gave his blood to show the American people that Latinos do not come here to take or to rob anything. On the contrary, we are here to give our blood for this country."
