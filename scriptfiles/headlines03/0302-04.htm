<p>SEOUL  - North Korean media accused the United  States on Sunday of pushing into full swing preparations for  nuclear war against the communist state, and warned such a war  could wreak havoc.<p>



		The North's official Korea Central News Agency (KCNA)  quoted the ruling communist party's Rodong Sinmun as saying the  U.S. Department of Defense recently ordered huge U.S. air force  deployments in South Korea, Japan and around the Korean  peninsula.<p>



		Besides, it added, the U.S. Air Forces Command in South  Korea put its units at "semi-war footing."<p>



		The paper said, "If the U.S. imperialists ignite a war on  the Korean peninsula, the war will turn into a nuclear war."<p>



		It added, "As a consequence, the Koreans in the north and  south and the people in Asia and the rest of the world will  suffer horrifying nuclear disasters."<p>



		The paper said nuclear weapon production factories in the  United States were developing and manufacturing weapons to  destroy underground structures in the isolated country.<p>



		On Saturday, Pyongyang accused Washington of stepping up  spy flights in preparation for war, while South Korea's new  president vowed to work for a swift and peaceful end to the  nuclear crisis on the peninsula.<p>



		"The DPRK neither wants a war nor avoids it," the KCNA said  in a commentary on Saturday. DPRK is an acronym for Democratic  People's Republic of Korea, the state's official name.<p>



		Tension over North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons plans  spiked on Wednesday after Washington, citing satellite  photographs, said North Korean scientists had fired up a  reactor mothballed since 1994 at the Yongbyon complex north of  Pyongyang.
