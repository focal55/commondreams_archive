<p>When the first American tanks rolled past Hassan Karim Hassan's house he ran with his friends to peer over the fence at the end of the street and watch the army finally advance into Baghdad. 
<p>Although unarmed, the three young men were immediately mistaken for enemy soldiers. One, Qasim Ali, was shot dead, another, Ali Jawad, was hit by a bullet in his left arm. Minutes later a man driving a taxi was killed in a burst of gunfire from a tank which turned his car into a fireball. 

<p>On that morning, Monday April 7, when they rolled through the Hai al-Amal district of Baghdad after a punishing three-week push across the desert, perhaps the troops were more jittery than normal. 

<p>"We didn't imagine they would shoot any civilians," Mr Hassan, 32, said yesterday. 

<p>"I know this was a battlefield and maybe I was wrong to go and look at the American tanks. I don't know. But we are civilians. They could see through their sights we had no guns." 

<p>Almost certainly the young soldiers who fired that morning will never be held to account for the death of Qasim Ali, the injury to Ali Jawad or the killing of the taxi driver, whose charred body lay untouched in his car for two days because people were too scared to leave their homes. 

<p>America's generals stated publicly that as the troops rolled forward there would be no attempt to count the bodies of the dead left behind. 

<p>On Sunday April 6, the day before the Hai al-Amal shootings, Brigadier General Vince Brooks, the deputy director of operations at the US central command in Qatar, was asked about casualties inflicted in Baghdad. 

<p>"It just is not worth trying to characterize by numbers," he said. 

<p>"And, frankly, if we are going to be honorable about our warfare, we are not out there trying to count up bodies. This is not the appropriate way for us to go." 

<p>Despite his misgivings, the US government is now legally obliged to account for the thousands of Iraqi civilians killed or injured in the war, and those who had their homes destroyed, and give them financial compensation. 

<p>Under the Iraq War Supplemental Appropriations Act, which became law last month, it has set aside $2.4bn to pay for this "assistance" (the word compensation, with its legal implications, is never publicly used) and other relief and reconstruction measures. 

<p>But there are unlikely to be Washington officials in Iraq counting the dead. The only independent and properly researched count is being carried out by a small American human rights group. 

<p>It is a painstaking process. Each hospital has a handwritten book which logs the patients who have died in hospital and the corpses brought in. 

<p>At al-Kindi hospital in central Baghdad it show that 192 civilians were killed in the war up to April 9, when the statue of Saddam Hussein was toppled in Firdos Square. At al-Yarmuk hospital in western Baghdad the register is less meticulous but shows 99 civilian deaths up to the hospital's closure on April 6. 

<p>But the staff at both hospitals admit that the logs do not give a full account: some recorded as civilians may have been militia out of uniform, others may have died at the hands of looters, and some of the dead were buried without being taken to hospital. 

<p>"I don't know if we will ever know the total number," the records manager at al-Yarmuk Sebhan Hussain, admitted. 

<p>The most accurate survey is being conducted by the Campaign for Innocent Victims in Conflict, run by a Californian, Marla Ruzicka. 

<p>She has 150 surveyors at work checking each report of a civilian death against several different sources. So far they have confirmed 620 civilian deaths in Baghdad and are studying reports of as many as 1,100 in Nassiriya. 

<p>It will be at least another month before the survey is complete, but the tally seems likely to be several thousand. 

<p>Ms Ruzicka, 26, ran a similar survey in Afghanistan last year, where her team confirmed 824 civilian deaths, although she believes that as many as 2,000 may have died in the war. 

<p>Her lobbying and the support of the Democrat senator Patrick Leahy brought unprecedented changes in the law. 

<p>Appropriations acts in the past year have allocated $3.75m for assistance to Afghan victims, although it has yet to be spent. They prepared the ground for the Iraq act, which was passed after Saddam's regime collapsed. 

<p>"I want the US government to have a human response to policy for victims of conflict," Ms Ruzicka said. "People seem to think all soldiers in the US are, like in world war two, fighting a just war, but they don't understand that many of the people who die are innocent."
