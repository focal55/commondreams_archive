<p>Nuke LaLoosh is going to the show, after all — but in Brooklyn, not Cooperstown.</p><P> After two weeks of controversy about baseball, the war in Iraq and free speech, Tim Robbins and Susan Sarandon, the stars of "Bull Durham," will commemorate the film's 15th anniversary at the Brooklyn Academy of Music on Wednesday. </p><!-- BIGAD ad not targeted --><P> This weekend's screening of the film at the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y., was canceled earlier this month by the organization's president, Dale Petroskey, who said he did not want to give a public platform to Mr. Robbins, a vocal opponent of the Iraq war who played the pitcher Nuke LaLoosh in the film.</p><P> Mr. Petroskey, who had been an assistant press secretary in the Reagan White House, sent a letter on April 7 to Mr. Robbins, saying that his public criticism undermined the country and "ultimately could put our troops in even more danger."</p><P> What ensued were 28,000 letters, e-mail messages and phone calls to the Hall of Fame. Last Friday, Mr. Petroskey said he was sorry that he did not talk to Mr. Robbins and Ms. Sarandon before sending them a letter about the event's cancellation. He did not return calls yesterday.</p><P> Across the country, those who shared the couple's political views, those who just loved the movie and members of the church of baseball sent invitations to Mr. Robbins, asking him to screen the movie in their hometowns of Los Angeles, Denver and Chicago. Some also said they wanted the movie to be shown in connection with political events, Mr. Robbins said yesterday. </p><P> Brooklyn won out because aside from having a more than respectable baseball history, the borough is well connected. Mr. Robbins's publicist, Dan Klores, a board member at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, suggested it as a place to screen the film. Tickets, which cost $10, will go on sale today. Mr. Robbins, Ms. Sarandon and the director, Ron Shelton, plan to attend. Karen Brooks Hopkins, president of the Brooklyn Academy of Music, said the event was not meant to be political. "I don't think that people in Brooklyn will mix politics and arts," she said. "I think the film stands on its own merits."</p><P> The details of the anniversary celebration are in the works, but Mr. Robbins said he did not want a question-and-answer session after the movie. The most political part of the evening may just be that some of the revenue will be donated to the Cooperstown Food Bank.</p><P> Mr. Robbins had responded to the Hall of Fame president in a letter that he did not think "baseball was a Republican sport." But asked about the controversy yesterday, he seemed to take inspiration from the film's suggested clichés for ballplayers giving interviews ("I'm just happy to be here; hope I can help the ball club,"), saying he was just looking forward to a night of baseball and film in Brooklyn. "This has nothing to do with politics," he said. "We're just going to screen the movie and enjoy the movie." </p>
