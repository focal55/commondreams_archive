<p>The anti-globalization movement's alternative summit began in this southeastern French town with a challenge to the legitimacy of the G8 summit of world leaders due to take place in nearby Evian this weekend.

</table></font>"We reject the policies of the G8 and the very nature of a body which claims to be the world's board of directors," Bernard Pinaud, secretary-general of a French third world campaign group (CRID) said in his opening speech.
<p>The "<a href="http://www.g8-autremonde.org/eng/" target="_new">Summit for Another World</a>" -- known as SPAM under its French acronym -- aims to match the agenda of the Group of Eight most industrialized countries with a series of debates until Saturday on alternative proposals for world governance and development.
<p>The organizers said they had arranged to hand over the proposals to French President Jacques Chirac's delegation in Evian on Monday, the second day of the G8 summit.
<p>Other groups campaigning for more development aid and debt reduction for poor countries, as well as environmental groups such as Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth and the anti-globalization group ATTAC, are taking part in the alternative meeting.
<p>Representatives from African countries including Congo, Ivory Coast, Senegal, and Uganda, have been invited to take part, the organizers said.
<p>About 6,000 to 10,000 people were staying in "alternative villages" or campsites set up for anti-globalization protestors in nearby fields on Thursday, according to local Red Cross workers.
<p>Police said 1,000 of the protestors -- 3,000 according to organizers -- marched peacefully through Annemasse.

</table></font>CRID's president Gus Massiah said the alternative gathering at Annemasse's Martin Luther King cultural center was meant to allow new thought on world affairs to counter the G8, which he described as "unbearable".

<p>The head of the French branch of Greenpeace, Bruno Rebelle highlighted three indicators as proof that "the world is standing on its head".
<p>"One euro a day, that's what one third of humanity, or two billion people, are living with," he said.
<p>"Two euros a day, that's what a European cow gets on average from the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy (farm subsidies)."
<p>"Three euros a day, that's the contribution of each American citizen towards the US military budget," Rebelle added.
<p>The groups involved in SPAM aim to promote sustainable development and are calling for a reform of international monetary institutions such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank.
<p>"Our proposals are not so utopian, but they do clash head on with the interests of the members of the G8," Massiah concluded.
