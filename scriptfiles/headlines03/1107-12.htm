<p>The FBI has used the sweeping powers of anti-terrorist legislation enacted 
in the panicky aftermath of September 11 against the owner of a Las Vegas strip 
club suspected of bribing local council officials. <p>Justice department officials 
say the events in Las Vegas mark the first time the FBI has tried to extend the 
use of the Patriot Act to a corruption investigation. <p>The move was described 
by civil rights groups yesterday as proof of the dangers of giving such a free 
hand to the security agencies. <p>The Patriot Act allows the FBI and other agencies 
to seize private documents - such as medical records and college transcripts - 
without obtaining a warrant, or showing probable cause. <p>It does not require 
the authorities to admit they have undertaken such actions. <p>Although the Patriot 
Act went through Congress virtually unchallenged six weeks after September 11, 
Arab-American and civil rights groups have claimed for two years that it puts 
key freedoms at risk. <p>Their lobbying, which has been aimed at quashing the 
act when it comes up for review in 2005, was so successful that last month the 
attorney general, John Ashcroft, went on a tour of 16 US cities to publicise the 
act as a tool to save lives. <p>However, the FBI's use of the act last week to 
subpoena two Las Vegas brokers to hand over their records on the strip club owner 
Michael Galardi, as well as clients serving on the local council, threatened to 
overshadow Mr Ashcroft's road-show. <p>Harry Reid, the veteran Democrat senator 
from Nevada, said the law had gone too far. <p>"The law was intended for activities 
related to terrorism and not to naked women," he told journalists. "Let me say, 
with Galardi and his whole gang, I don't condone, appreciate or support all their 
nakedness. But having said that, I haven't heard anyone say at any time he was 
involved with terrorism." <p>The raids on Mr Galardi's clubs do not immediately 
appear to fit criteria for the Bush administration's invoking of the Patriot Act 
which has given the FBI greater freedom in tracking down terrorist-funding networks. 
<p>However, FBI agents used some of the tools Mr Ashcroft described on his speaking 
tour as lifesaving devices. <p>They include: delaying notification to targets 
of search warrants in order to avoid tipping off suspects; access to the business 
records of suspected terrorists, and "roving" wiretapes in case the target switches 
phones. <p>Mr Galardi, whose family owns nearly 20 strip clubs across the US, 
has been the subject of a long-term investigation into charges that he bribed 
council members to pass a law that would allow physical contact between dancers 
and customers. <p>In September, he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire 
fraud in San Diego, and admitted to bribing police to tell him when his clubs 
were about to be raided. <p>This week, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported that 
FBI agents had invoked the Patriot Act to subpoena two Las Vegas stock brokers 
to reveal their business records. Officials said they were trying to find evidence 
of bribery. <p>However, civil rights activists said the FBI wrongly turned to 
the act in order to circumvent normal criminal procedure for accessing private 
documents such as financial records. <p>"The use of the Patriot Act against a 
sin city vice lord should give pause to anyone who says it has not been abused," 
said Laura Murphy, a spokeswoman for the American Civil Liberties Union. <p>"The 
attorney general didn't tell Congress that he needed the Patriot Act to raid nudie 
bars." <p ALIGN="CENTER">&copy; Guardian Newspapers Limited 2003<p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable --></font></td></tr>
