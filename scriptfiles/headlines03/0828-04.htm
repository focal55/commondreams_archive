<p>GENEVA - The World Trade Organization appeared  set Thursday to rubber-stamp a deal for poorer nations to get  anti-AIDS and other vital drugs more cheaply, but health  activists blasted the pact as "disastrous."

</table>The United States and four key developing countries -- the  states most closely involved in the long-running negotiations  -- reached agreement Wednesday, clearing the way for the full  146-state WTO membership to give their approval.<P>
Ensuring poorer states unable to manufacture medicines can  import cheap generic drugs when they need to is seen as vital  to beating major killers such as AIDS and malaria. But it means  setting aside patents owned by multinational companies which  are protected by trade rules.<P>
Although most trade envoys expected the pact to be nodded  through when the Geneva trade body's executive General Council  resumed its session late Thursday, some trade officials noted  that a couple of states had asked for further information.<P>
"Some were noncommittal, and two in particular (Venezuela  and the Philippines) wanted to ask some questions first," said  one trade source. All WTO decisions are taken by consensus.<P>
The five -- the United States, generic drug producers  Brazil and India, and African representatives South Africa and  Kenya -- were not a formal group but they were seen as  representing all sides of the argument.<P>
African countries, which face the worst epidemics of AIDS  and malaria, applauded the pact as balancing their need for  more drugs with the demands of the international pharmaceutical  industry for restrictions to stop abuse.<P>
"It (the deal) is intended to provide some comfort for the  pharmaceutical industry," said South African trade envoy Faizel  Ismail, who had played a key part in the talks.<P>
ADDS CLARITY<P>
There was agreement from big drugs companies, who say that  without protection of patents they would not be able to invest  in developing new drugs. The head of the International  Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Associations said  the wording was reassuring.<P>
"This text adds clarity to the focus on the neediest and  that is critically important," Harvey Bale said.<P>
But British-based relief agency <a href="http://www.oxfam.org/" target="_new">Oxfam</a> said the accord,  which could end a trade row that has been rumbling for nearly  two years, would do nothing for poorer developing countries.
<P>
"(The) deal ... would be disastrous for poor people around  the world," the agency said in a brief statement. "The text  contains so much red tape and so many obstacles."<P>
Some Indian drugs firms, leading suppliers of generics to  other developing countries, were equally critical. "The policy  is riddled with barriers which will make generic drugs more  expensive than necessary," said D.G. Shah, secretary general of  the Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance.<P>
WTO states had been close to an accord at the end of last  year, but Washington blocked the deal because U.S. drugmakers  feared it could let generic companies in developing countries,  such as Brazil and India, copy lifestyle drugs such as Viagra  for export.<P>
Under the new pact, the United States dropped its  opposition in return for an accompanying statement spelling out  some additional conditions.
<P>
Among them is a pledge by WTO states not to abuse the  system and only waive patents to import generic medicines "in  good faith," not for commercial gain.
