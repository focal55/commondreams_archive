<p>WASHINGTON  - Activists in the growing movement in  the United States against attacking Iraq are expressing  frustration at their inability to deflect President Bush from  his course.

</table>Despite polls showing public misgivings about attacking  Iraq, especially without U.N. authorization, and a string of  large anti-war demonstrations across the country, Bush has  generally ignored the opposition, apparently confident he will  pay no political price.<p>



		"It's very alarming. The Bush administration is prepared to  ignore U.S. sentiment and international sentiment," said  Barbara Epstein, an expert of peace movements at the University  of California, Santa Cruz and peace activist herself.<p>



		"The president and his advisers seem so convinced they are  right that they can't seem to imagine that the American people  won't support them once the fighting begins," she said.<p>



		Epstein and other activists are elated at their success in  drawing hundreds of thousands of people into the streets for  anti-war rallies. They also point to the fact that at least 64  city councils across the country, including Detroit,  Philadelphia, Seattle, Baltimore, Chicago and San Francisco  have passed anti-war resolutions.<p>



		Among religious groups, the National Council of Churches  and the National Conference of Catholic Bishops have also  passed resolutions opposing military action against Iraq. Peace  activists said the active participation of churches and  church-goers has boosted their cause and broadened their  movement.<p>



		All agreed the current anti-war movement was much larger  than that which emerged before the 1991 Gulf War, even though  congressional opposition to that conflict was stronger.<p>



		PEACEFUL PROCESS<p>



		Bush rarely refers to the antiwar movement but has said  that Americans have the right to express their views. White  House spokesman Ari Fleischer said on Thursday that protesting  was a democratic and patriotic act.<p>



		"We settle our differences in this country through  elections and through peaceful protest. And the majority will  prevail," he said.<p>



		Polls to show that support for an attack against Iraq drops  below 50 percent if respondents are asked if they would still  favor a war without United Nations authorization.<p>



		Polls this week showed a slight increase of support for war  following Secretary of State Colin Powell's presentation to the  U.N. on Wednesday. An ABC/Washington Post poll on Thursday  found 67 percent in favor of military action, but the figure  still dropped to 49 percent when respondents were asked if they  would support a war that was opposed by the U.N., while 46  percent said they were against such an attack.<p>



		Many activists blame the weak and disunited performance of  the Democrats for their inability to influence policy. While  many Democrats voted against authorizing Bush to attack Iraq  last October, all but one of the party's prospective  presidential candidates supported the resolution.<p>



		"The Democrats are frightened of being on the wrong side of  the situation or of being perceived as unpatriotic or soft on  terrorism," said Tom Andrews, a former Democratic member of  Congress who now serves as national director for Win Without  War, an umbrella group coordinating opposition to the war.<p>



		"The result is there is no clear, articulate, principled  opposition to the president in the corridors of power, which  does not reflect the situation in the country at large, where  opposition to the war is real, palpable, deep-seated and  growing," he said.<p>



		James Zogby, who heads the Arab American Institute and is a  member of the Democratic National Committee, said Bush was  reading the polls carefully and had concluded that his  political base was secure.<p>



		"The peace movement is not the administration's base vote.  Among Republicans, two thirds are in favor of the war. Among  Democrats, two thirds are against. Among white evangelical  Christians, Bush has 70 percent support. Among blacks and  Hispanics, 70 percent oppose war," Zogby said.<p>



		Epstein agreed: "People in the current anti-war movement  are people who by and large didn't vote for George W. Bush  anyway. We are not his constituency," she said.<p>



		But Zogby also blames his own party for failing to lead the  opposition. "If you don't give people a clear choice, a sense  of resignation sets in," he said.<p>



		Sally Milbury-Steen, who heads Pacem in Terris, a mainly  church-based peace group in Wilmington, Delaware said part of  the problem was that the mainstream media was ignoring the  peace movement and echoing the administration's position.<p>



		She said Bush's assumption that opposition would melt away  once the fighting began as Americans rallied behind their armed  forces was wrong.<p>



		"If we can't prevent the war, we won't disappear. We will  work to stop it if it starts and if we can't stop it, we will  just be a constant spanner in the works," she said.
