<p>PARIS  -- As President Jacques Chirac attempts to prepare the French public for possible war with Iraq, opinion polls show strong opposition to a conflict and growing disquiet among members of Chirac's political grouping in parliament.</p>

    <p> War opponents have become more vocal in recent days, after Chirac this week told the military to be prepared for a possible conflict. This suggests the president faces a difficult task in winning backing for any war that France, as a U.N. Security Council member and strong U.S. ally, would be likely to join.</p>

    <p>A poll Thursday by the Ipsos organization for the newspaper Le Figaro found 77 percent of those interviewed opposed to military intervention against Iraq. The poll found that anti-war sentiment largely spanned the political spectrum, from people on the far left, who are most opposed, to people on the far right.</p>

    <p>The poll mirrors other recent surveys, including one by the CSA polling group released Wednesday in the newspaper Le Parisian, which found 66 percent of the respondents opposed to a war and 24 percent in favor. A CSA poll in August found 58 percent opposed to military intervention, so the latest numbers suggest anti-war sentiment may be hardening.</p>

    <p> Political leaders have also been voicing skepticism about the Bush administration's sincerity in allowing U.N. inspectors to try to peacefully disarm Iraq. Some 85 members of parliament, including members of Chirac's Union for a Presidential Majority, last month signed an anti-war petition.</p>

    <p>Chirac on Tuesday called for a parliamentary debate and promised the legislature would participate "at every step of the evolution of this crisis."</p>

    <p>Leftist members of parliament, led by the Socialists, the largest bloc on the left, seized on Chirac's comments to say the president had already decided to go to war. In a television interview, Socialist Party leader Francois Hollande decried what he called "a shift" in Chirac's position to a more pro-war stance and said the Socialist position is "not to prepare for a war, but to prevent it." Members of the Communist Party and Greens  have been even more critical.</p>

    <p> Anti-war sentiment within Chirac's center-right camp "is going to make it difficult for him," said Philip H. Gordon, a France expert and senior fellow with the Brookings Institution in Washington.</p>

    <p>If there is a U.S.-led military intervention, analysts here and in Washington said, France is certain to participate to maintain its international standing as a military power as well as to have a voice in postwar reconstruction. But the domestic climate is almost solidly anti-war, deeply suspicious of U.S. intentions in the Persian Gulf region and highly concerned about the likely spillover effects, including an explosion of refugees and an outburst of anger among the estimated 5 million to 6 million Muslims who live here.</p>

    <p>"Partly out of ignorance, partly out of anti-Americanism, partly out of fear of the consequences of a war in France for relations between the various communities, the French are acting the way they are," said Dominique Moisi, a political scientist with the French International Relations Institute. "But in the last few days you've seen Chirac starting to prepare the French for war."</p>

    <p>The official French position is that the U.N. inspections should be given a chance to work, that use of force to disarm the Iraqi government should be a last resort and that military action must be authorized by the U.N. Security Council.</p>

    <p>France on Wednesday also called on the United States, Britain and any other countries accusing Iraq of having undeclared weapons of mass destruction to show its proof to the inspectors, saying in a letter to the 15 permanent and non-permanent Security Council members that "all available information should be immediately transmitted to them."</p>

    <p>Commenting on the seemingly solid domestic opposition to war, some analysts noted anti-war sentiment was equally high in January 1991, just before the start of the Persian Gulf War. But after the initiation of hostilities, the opinion shifted, with 67 percent of French backing the military campaign.</p>
