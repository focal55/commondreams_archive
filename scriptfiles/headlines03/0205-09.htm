<p>Tessa Jowell, the culture secretary, yesterday caved in to pressure and allowed next week's rally against war with Iraq to go ahead in Hyde Park, London. She had initially banned the event because of concern it would damage the grass. <P>In what protesters called a humiliating climbdown for the government, Ms Jowell said she had agreed the rally could take place in the park on February 15. Several days of intensive work by her department had failed to find a better venue.  <P>"Everyone agrees that Hyde Park is far from ideal for an event of this kind at this time of year," she said in a statement. "The right of protesters to organize and take part in peaceful marches and rallies has never been questioned. The issue has only ever been to find a venue that is as safe as possible for those taking part."  <P>A spokesman for the Stop the War Coalition (STWC), which is expecting more than 500,000 to gather in the park, said: "We think this is a total victory, we are just sorry she did not do it sooner. But we are very happy that the government has done a U-turn.  <P>"Freedom of speech in this instance was only defended by the actions of the people. The minister wanted to abrogate this fundamental liberty and we have prevented her from doing so."  <P>Speakers at the Stop the War rally, which will begin at midday with a march from two starting points - Gower Street and Embankment - will include bishops and other religious leaders, MPs, the London mayor, Ken Livingstone,   and a video message from Nelson Mandela.  <P>In her statement Ms Jowell said that when CND first approached the royal parks to ask for the use of Hyde Park as a rally point the royal parks constabulary, the Metropolitan police and Westminster city council all said that permission for the rally should not be given.  <P>"I accepted this advice and asked that alternative venues for the rally be considered. Those alternative venues have included Trafalgar Square, which is the normal venue for winter rallies, and the Mall," she said. "The mayor has now ruled out Trafalgar Square, and the Metropolitan police advise against holding the rally in the Mall."  <P>A spokeswoman for the Stop the War Coalition said there was never any question that they would not cooperate fully with the park authorities. "We have got to now go into urgent discussions to try to make it as comfortable and safe for the public as possible."  <P>A spokesman for the royal parks authority agreed: "Our main aim now is to make sure it is as safe as possible for everyone."  <P>He said key issues would include making sure there is enough lighting for people to be able to disperse safely, and trying to guide people away from the areas likely to be most treacherous underfoot.  <P>A spokeswoman for the Countryside Alliance, which was prevented from holding a rally in Hyde Park in December, said: "Good on them. We just hope that next time we want to hold a rally the parks authorities are more accommodating than they were last time."</p>
