<p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Communications Commission on Wednesday issued controversial new rules that would allow media companies to grow larger, regulations that probably will go into effect in August but could be challenged in court.

<p>The rules -- allowing television networks to buy more local television stations and permit a company to own a newspaper, television station and several radio outlets in a market -- will go into effect 30 days after being published in the Federal Register, which can take up to three weeks.

<p>The Republican-controlled FCC voted 3-2 to ease the ownership limits one month ago. Media companies had pushed the agency to loosen the regulations even further while consumer and political groups sought to tighten the rules.

<p>Both sides could ask the FCC to reconsider its new rules or challenge them in federal court. The rules stretch some 257 pages not including statements by the five commissioners.

<p>"There will be judicial appeals," said Andrew Jay Schwartzman, president of a public interest law firm, Media Access Project. He also noted that litigation could be held up while the FCC considers likely requests for clarification or reconsideration of the new rules.

<p>Lawmakers in both the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate have promised to push a bill to roll back the FCC's new rules as well as a resolution that would veto the agency's action, though some House Republican leaders are opposed to undoing the agency's action.

<p>Under the new rules, a television network will be able to own local television stations that collectively reach up to 45 percent of the U.S. television audience, up from 35 percent.

<p>Both Viacom Inc., owner of the CBS and UPN networks, and News Corp., which runs the Fox network, own television stations that collectively reach roughly 39 percent of the national audience.

<p>Also under the new rules, companies will be allowed to own up to three television stations in the largest markets and two stations in all but the smallest markets. But no entity can own more than one of the top four rated stations in a market.

<p>In markets where there are at least nine television stations, companies will be able to own any combination of newspapers, television stations and radio outlets. No cross ownership will be permitted where there are at most three television stations.

<p>In markets where there are four to eight television stations, limited cross-ownership would be allowed under the new rules. The FCC left intact its regulations that limit how many radio stations a company can own in a market but tightened the definition of what makes up a market.
