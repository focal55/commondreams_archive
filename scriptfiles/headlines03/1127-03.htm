<p>The United States, long the safest place in the world to drive and still much better than average among industrialized nations, is being surpassed by other countries.</p>
<P>
Even though the nation has steadily lowered its traffic death rates, its ranking has fallen from first to ninth over the last 30 years, according to a review of global fatality rates adjusted for distances traveled. If the United States had kept pace with Australia and Canada, about 2,000 fewer Americans would die because of traffic accidents every year; if it had the same fatality rate as England, it would save 8,500 lives a year.</p>

</table>Many safety experts cite several reasons the United States has fallen in the rankings, despite having vehicles equipped with safety technology that is at least as advanced as, if not more than,  any other nation. They include lower seat-belt use than other nations; a rise in speeding and drunken driving; a big increase in deaths among motorcyclists, many of whom do not wear helmets; and the proliferation of large sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks, which are more dangerous to occupants of other vehicles in accidents and roll over more frequently.</p>
<P>
"Our fatality rates are lowering, but not to the degree they have lowered in other regions of the world," said William T. Hollowell, director of the Office of Applied Vehicle Safety Research at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.</p>
<P>
Traffic deaths and injuries are growing as a global health issue. The World Health Organization, preparing a report on the issue, says traffic accidents will become the world's third-leading cause of death and disability by 2020, up from ninth today — a toll particularly costly because victims are so often young adults.</p>
<P>
Indeed, automobile accidents will be the main subject of World Health Day next April, supplanting diseases like H.I.V./AIDS and malaria. </p>
<P>
"It's going to be a bigger World Health Day than usual because of the magnitude of the issue," said Dr. Etienne Krug, director of the World Health Organization's department for injuries and violence prevention.</p>
<P>
"Because there's very little emphasis on it, and emphasis on other health problems, we don't expect to make progress on traffic safety, which is why the ranking is expected to get worse," Mr. Krug said. He was mainly referring to the developing world, where preventing traffic injuries lags behind fighting disease.</p>
<P>
Industrialized nations like the United States are well ahead of developing nations like China, where death rates are not only far higher but also rising. </p>
<P>
Transportation Secretary Norman Y. Mineta has laid out an ambitious target of reducing the nation's traffic death rate to 1 death per 100 million miles traveled from 1.5 deaths by 2008. That would translate into roughly 12,000 fewer deaths per year, given projections for increased road use. Last year in the United States, 42,815 people died in traffic accidents, the most since 1990.</p>
<P>
"Here we are losing 43,000 people," Mr. Mineta said. "If we had that many people die in aviation accidents, we wouldn't have an airplane flying. People wouldn't put up with it. They ought not to put up with 43,000 uncles, aunts, mothers, dads, brothers and friends whose lives are snuffed out by traffic accidents."</p>
<P>
Getting to his target would require a radically faster pace of improvement. As of last year, the death rate in the United States had fallen to 1.51 deaths per 100 million miles traveled from 1.58 in 1998. </p>
<P>
Since 1970, the United States traffic death rate has fallen from nearly 4.8 deaths per 100 million miles traveled. By 2000, the rate in Britain had fallen to 1.2 deaths per 100 million miles  from 6.1 in 1970. The new figure is the lowest traffic death rate  compiled by the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development, which collects a variety of statistics from industrialized countries.</p>
<P>
Australia's death rate has fallen from 7.13 in 1971 — the country did not estimate distances traveled the previous year — to 1.45 in 2001. Canada's death rate is slightly less.</p>
<P>
Other nations have much higher rates. Turkey's was close to 11.74 deaths per 100 million miles in 2001 and the Czech Republic was 5.21. The economic organization's  median figure in 2001 was about 2.1 deaths.</p>
<P>
The Bush administration is mainly focusing on seat-belt use and drunken driving in the near term because they are two major areas where the United States lags some other leading nations.</p>
<P>
Dr. Jeffrey W. Runge, administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,  said: "If everybody buckles up, we can save between 7,000 and 9,000 lives a year. That would drop our fatality rate off the table. The only way you get to 1.0 is to deal with these very important human factors."     Most traffic safety experts agree that the seat belt remains the world's most effective safety device. The nation's usage rate has risen considerably over the past couple of decades, to nearly 80 percent today. But top safety regulators in Canada and Australia say their use of seat belts is about 10 percentage points higher.</p>
<P>
One reason more Canadians and Australians buckle up is so-called primary seat-belt laws that allow the police to stop motorists simply for not wearing a seat belt. Less than half of the states in this country have such laws.</p>
<P>
Dr. Runge has been lobbying states to add primary belt laws. A provision in a federal highway financing bill before Congress would divide $600 million among states that either have primary belt laws or reach a 90 percent usage rate.</p>
<P>
Drunken driving rates are also on the rise in this country. Last year, almost 18,000 people died in alcohol-related accidents, the most since 1992.</p>
<P>
The administration is pushing for broader use of sobriety courts, which emphasize counseling and treatment as well as jail time. And Dr. Runge wants local jurisdictions to designate special prosecutors for drunken driving.    Another problem is motorcycle deaths, which have risen more than 50 percent since 1997. Only 20 states require riders to wear helmets, down from 47 in 1975, when federal highway financing was tied to helmet laws.</p>
<P>
The most contentious topic in the safety debate is the effect of sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and minivans. Such vehicles made up about a fifth of new vehicle sales in 1980 but now account for more than half. Studies by the traffic safety agency have shown that light trucks, particularly big sport utilities and pickups, pose considerably more risk to the occupants of cars than other cars do.</p>
<P>
Sport utilities are also no more safe than cars for their own occupants, traffic statistics show, because advantages they get from their bulk are offset by a greater propensity to roll over.</p>
<P>
A new study by two researchers, Marc Ross from the University of Michigan and Tom Wenzel from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, estimates that 3,500 fewer people would die each year if 60 percent to 80 percent of the light trucks — sport utilities, minivans and pickups — on the road were cars or station wagons.</p>
<P>
But the auto industry has disputed such claims. And other studies have attributed thousands of deaths to another cause: fuel economy regulations adopted in the 1970's forced automakers to make lighter passenger cars. But the weights of cars as well as light trucks have been rising for the past decade and a half.</p>
<P>
Dr. Leonard Evans, a top safety researcher who retired after more than three decades at General Motors, said any potential improvements in vehicle design would be far outweighed by improvements in driver behavior. He believes the regulators and the news media are too focused on blaming vehicles.</p>
<P>
"We've got to have much more focus on avoiding rather than surviving crashes," he said.</p>
<P>
The administration is aiming at both driver and vehicle.</p>
<P>
Dr. Runge pressured the industry to collaborate on an effort to make sport utilities and pickups less dangerous to people in cars. And a revamped rollover rating system, due next year, seeks to better inform the public about rollovers, which  account for more than 10,000 deaths each year.</p>
<P>
Mr. Hollowell, a top researcher at the traffic safety agency, said the death rate in the United States had  not fallen further for several reasons unique to the country. "The motorcycle fatalities have gone up, the rollovers have gone up, which is a function of a greater numbers of light trucks and vans, and another aspect, in vehicle to vehicle crashes, is that we have a changing fleet," he said.</p>
<P>
Dr. Runge, who early in his tenure took heat from Detroit for critical remarks about sport utilities, said, "We've got the safest vehicles in the world, so when you consider where we fall in the scheme of things, we can't blame the vehicles."</p>
<P>
He asserted: "We have a unique fleet in this country and we're addressing that. But we could have the perfect vehicles, and until we address the human factors we're not going to change our ranking."</p>
