<p>A British student left brain dead after being shot by an Israeli soldier is set to have his life support machine switched off. Tom Hurndall, 22, is in a permanent vegetative state after he was shot six months ago while taking photographs during a trip to the West Bank.

British peace activist Thomas Hurndall sits on the floor of a home in Rafah, minutes before he left to participate in a protest at which he suffered a gunshot wound to the head, in Rafah, southern Gaza Strip, Friday, April 11, 2003. Hurndall, age 21, from Manchester, England, had been standing between Israeli troops and Palestinian children when Israeli soldiers opened fire, according to a fellow activist from the International Solidarity Movement who witnessed the scene. He was declared brain dead after arrival at a Gaza hospital.<br>

</table></font>His family have been informed that there is little hope of his recovery and doctors are expected to start legal procedures that will end his life.

<p>An application to the High Court to switch off his life support machine is expected to be made by doctors next month, according to Carl Arrindell, a close friend. If the application is successful, it is hoped that Mr Hurndall will be transferred from the Royal Hospital for Neuro-disability in Putney, south London, where he is currently being treated, to spend his final hours at the family home in Tufnell Park, north London.

<p>His mother Jocelyn Hurndall, a teacher, said: "I find this all very difficult. Tom will go when he feels ready to go. It will feel more right for it to happen that way."

<p>Tom, a photography student at Manchester Metropolitan University, was shot while recording the work of a peace group in Gaza and the activities of the Israeli army.

<p>His family launched a campaign to uncover the circumstances leading to his death and have called for an independent judicial inquiry.
