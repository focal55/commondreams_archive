<p>The Associated Press reported last year that the U.S.-led war in Afghanistan had left 500 to 600 civilians dead.



<p>The Project on Defense Alternatives, a military think tank, estimated 1,300.



<p>But from his office in Durham, professor Marc Herold of the University of New Hampshire reported the highest tally to date: 3,100 to 3,600.



<p>Herold has been criticized for his sources (Pakistani and Indian reporters whom the others had rejected) and for his methods (counting Taliban sympathizers as civilians). He has been dismissed as an anti-war radical with an agenda, and he hasn't come close to persuading the Pentagon to begin keeping its own count of civilians killed by bombs said to be "smart" enough to avoid civilians.



<p>But Herold has counted a victory in recent days: Inspired by his Afghanistan count, two British researchers, John Sloboda and Hamit Dardagan, are counting the civilians killed in Iraq. Using Herold as a consultant and his methods as their own, the pair had counted between 316 and 424 Iraqi civilians killed by yesterday evening. 



<p>The deaths bother Herold, but their publication gives him hope that more people are demanding a full accounting of war.



<p>"Giving the full scope of what is happening, that's what this is all about," Herold said last week. "I think the media in a democratic society should be presenting the citizenry with as full a picture as possible. The big media was not doing that."



<p>The British researchers are bound to face the same criticism Herold has about their methods and sources. But with anti-American sentiment growing, they will likely get as much international attention as Herold, if not more.



<p>And at some point, the veracity of the figures won't matter as much as what they say with them, according to a Temple University math professor who studies how statistics influence public policy.



<p>"Numbers are notoriously hard to pin down," said professor John Allen Paulos. "Because of ideologies, numbers can be made bigger than they are or made smaller than they are. It happens with counts on homeless people, battered women and peace marches."



<p>Paulos cited as an example the emergence of anorexia as a public health concern. Initially, reports said 100,000 women a year were dying of the illness. Paulos said those estimates were eventually corrected downward, but by the time they were, the health care industry had already directed new resources to targeting anorexia. 



<p>Sometimes the errors are honest ones. It's hard to count civilian deaths for an entire war from so far away. Sometimes the errors are intentional, he said, although he did not criticize Herold's work directly. "The bigger the numbers (of civilian dead), the less likely people are to want to prosecute the war," he said.



<p>Herold teaches economics and women's studies at UNH, speaks four languages and has lived in many parts of the world. For all those reasons, he's always followed world affairs, especially those of Third World countries.



<p>He also cites that interest as evidence that he is not merely pushing an anti-war agenda with his research. 



<p>"I wanted to be able to show that precision weaponry does kill a significant number of civilians," Herold said. "I'm willing to engage in conversations about my methods, but to go after me for whatever personal views I might have . . . to me that is irrelevant."



<p>So, when the United States launched its air campaign in Afghanistan in October 2001, Herold said he naturally went to American newspapers and television news stations to pursue his long-time interest in foreign matters. He found himself dissatisfied with vague press briefings and repeated images of planes taking off of aircraft carriers.



<p>"I turned off the TV and went looking around (on the Internet)," Herold said. "And lo and behold,there was quite a story unfolding."



<p>Herold began combing news reports from all over the world for details on the numbers of Afghan civilians killed in the bombing campaign.



<p>He relied on stories from the Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune and the Seattle Post Intelligencer but also on foreign reporters whom other researchers had rejected. For instance, Herold used stories from Indian and Pakistani reporters as well as reporters from Al Jazeera, the Arab television news network. But he didn't hesitate to ignore reports he found questionable.



<p>"I knew I would get criticism. But I've learned over time that you can trust these (foreign sources)," he said.



<p>Herold's research has appeared in many forms.



<p>He contributed a chapter on the ground war in Afghanistan to a book titled September 11 and the U.S. War. He has written essays on how the war has contributed to deaths in refugee camps and the impact of cluster bombs.



<p>He also compared the intensity of the bombing campaign in Afghanistan with that of previous wars and found that despite an increase in the precision of bombs, more civilians were killed in Afghanistan than were killed with less-precise bombs in the first Gulf war.



<p>His most publicized - and criticized - work has been the detailed tally of Afghanistan civilian war dead that is available on the Internet and is now the basis for the Iraq body count. Day by day, Herold logged the location of attacks, the number of civilians believed killed, any details he could find and the sources he relied on.



<p>He described an attack in Kabul where bombs meant for an airport hit a playground. Three to six children were killed, according to the Web site. In another incident, Herold noted that 100 houses were destroyed in Nangahar when a 2,000-pound bomb hit more than the single helicopter it was meant for.



<p>Iain Murray, a columnist with Tech Central Station, an Internet publication, accused Herold of double counting civilians killed and confusing details in a way that inflated his numbers. In one case, for example, Herold said a bomb had killed a man while another reporter quoted the same man (still very much alive) describing how the bomb had destroyed his house.



<p>Joshua Muravchik of The Weekly Standard tried to duplicate some of Herold's research and couldn't. And Herold's explanations didn't satisfy him. "Soon I felt like Alice chasing the rabbit down the hole," he wrote.



<p>Herold has also invited allegations that he is using his academic research to push his anti-war agenda. Herold introduces his Web site with a photograph of Afghans on a bicycle and a message.



<p>"Dedicated to the countless Afghans just engaged in simple acts of everyday living ... who became innocent victims of the horrific U.S. air and ground onslaught."



<p>Herold's research has received much better play outside the United States than it has here. The Weekly Standard reported in August that Herold's tally was being cited as fact in many countries, including in Egypt, where the leading daily newspaper, Al-Ahram, said this: "The Pentagon has falsified the facts about its war. . . . one American academic is setting the record straight."



<p>Herold has explained the skepticism of American news outlets by accusing them of being reluctant to criticize or challenge the Department of Defense, which does not count civilian dead but says the numbers are lower than Herold asserts.



<p>Whatever the reason, Herold's research and that of the Iraqi body counters may gain even more credibility and attention with anti-American sentiment on the rise. The Pew Research Center reported this month at the United States's image had plummeted from a favorable rating of 83 percent in Britain in 1999 to just 48 percent today.



<p>Herold said he believes he has gotten the public's attention, even here at home.



<p>"I do think it's working," he said. "Because of the hundreds of radio interviews and television programs I've been asked to do. I've done talks all over the country. Even Phil Donahue called."
