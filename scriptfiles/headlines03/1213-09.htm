<p>BRUSSELS -  The European Union's crucial summit,  meant to approve a first constitution, broke down in failure on  Saturday after leaders were unable to bridge major differences  over voting rights in an enlarged bloc.
<p> 
			
							"At this time, the conference takes note of the fact that  there is no accord," an official of the Italian EU presidency  told reporters after less than two days of negotiation over the  treaty which pitted France and Germany against Spain and  Poland.<p> 
			
							Leaders were meeting over lunch to draft a statement on  what had been achieved so far in talks on a charter designed to  ensure the bloc can still function after 10 new members join  the existing 15 next May.<p> 
			
							Many governments fear gridlock when the bloc expands into  eastern Europe with a total population of 450 million.<p> 
			
							Officials say the failure could paralyze an enlarged bloc  and lead to a two-speed Europe with France, Germany and the  other founders increasingly going it alone. Some skeptics say  it might even be the beginning of the end for the Union.<p> 
			
							EU diplomats said Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi  would announce that the negotiations were "postponed" and would  resume next year but would not set any precise timetable.<p> 
			
							A bare-knuckle fight over voting power triggered the  breakdown, sooner than many diplomats had predicted.<p> 
			
							The row stemmed from a treaty agreed at a summit in Nice in  2000, which gave Poland and Spain nearly the same voting rights  as Germany, whose population is twice as large as theirs.<p> 
			
							The new constitution would have replaced it with a system  under which decisions would need to be backed by a majority of  more than half of EU states, representing over 60 percent of  its population.<p> 
			
							France and Germany had both said they would rather have no  agreement and risk a crisis than accept a bad deal.<p> 
			
							DAMAGE CONTROL<p> 
			
							EU diplomats immediately began damage control over the  breakdown, which came less than a month after the bloc's budget  rules were trampled on by suspending disciplinary action  against France and Germany over their excessive deficits.<p> 
			
							"It is not good, but no disaster," one senior diplomat  said.<p> 
			
							But one of the European Parliament's negotiators at the  summit, Klaus Haensch, warned that public confidence in the EU  would be severely dented.<p> 
			
							"Politically, the Union cannot live a long time with Nice,"  he told reporters. "The failure of this summit will have its  impact on public opinion, and confidence in the future of  Europe will decrease.<p> 
			
							"It is a very bad signal and a failure of one of the most  important summits we have had, and that is not a good sign for  the European Union," the German Social Democrat said.<p> 
			
							Earlier Italy canceled a formal summit session to keep  exploring compromise possibilities in bilateral talks.
<p> 
			
							News of the breakdown came minutes after a last-ditch  meeting between Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar and  Berlusconi and four-way talks between the leaders of Britain,  France, Germany and Spain.
