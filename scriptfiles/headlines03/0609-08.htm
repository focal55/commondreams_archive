<p>TEHRAN  - Iran warned Monday that foreign pressure over its nuclear capabilities, branded a threat to peace by Washington, would backfire and harden Iran's position.

<p>Since its rapid conquest of Iraq, Washington has tightened the screw on neighboring Iran, which it accuses of sheltering al Qaeda fugitives, backing terrorism and developing nuclear arms.

<p>"Excessive pressure on Iran would untie the hands of those who do not believe in dialogue," said Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi. "Even those who favor constructive talks would not accept the language of force and threat."

<p>The United States and European Union are divided over Iran. The EU favors a policy of encouraging embattled reformers around President Mohammad Khatami, while Washington argues this is a waste of time since he has no real power to affect change.

<p>The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), in a report obtained by Reuters Friday, accused Iran of failing to comply with safeguards to curb the spread of nuclear weapons and sent a team of inspectors to the country Saturday.

<p>Asefi played down the visit, which comes a week before IAEA chief Mohamed ElBaradei formally presents his report on Iran's nuclear ambitions to agency governors in Vienna on June 16.

<p>"The visit was planned months ago and has nothing to do with the agency's report," Asefi said. "The visit proves Iran's transparency and close cooperation."

<p>Fresh from war in Iraq over banned weapons, the United States described the report as "deeply troubling."

<p>Since the Iraq war, U.S. administration hawks have raised the specter of military action against Iran, but President Bush, who put Iran in an "axis of evil" with pre-war Iraq and North Korea, has denied he has plans to attack it.

<p>Even so, many in Iran suspect the Islamic Republic may be next on a U.S. hit-list of regimes to be overthrown.

<p>"We hope Iran's constructive cooperation with the agency and other countries makes the international community better aware of America's evil intentions," Asefi said.

<p>"We are always alert about America's policies...but we have no doubt the Americans won't be deluded into mistaking Iran for Iraq. Such a mistake would be irreparable," he said.
