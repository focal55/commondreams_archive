<p>SANTA MONICA --
Women's groups carrying signs saying "No groper for governor" clashed 
Friday with supporters of Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger over his attitudes 
toward women -- even as his campaign faced new questions about his past with 
the wide Internet play of a racy 1983 video starring the former bodybuilder.
<P>Playboy Entertainment, based in Chicago, said Friday that the attention on 
Schwarzenegger's candidacy for California governor -- and the Internet buzz -- 
might spur it to rerelease the 1983 entertainment video called "Carnival in 
Rio," which shows the actor-turned-candidate cavorting with topless samba 
dancers on a tour of Brazilian hot spots.
<P>"It's kind of 'Wild on Carnival' with Arnold," said Frank Marchesini, 
spokesman for Playboy Entertainment Group, which distributed and marketed the 
video. "There's a lot of frolicking during carnival . . . it's very flirty and 
suggestive," said Marchesini, who jokingly called it "a cheesy version" of the 
racy "Girls Gone Wild!" videos.
<P>"We are considering putting it out again," he said Friday. "It's so timely."

</table></font>The video surfaced a week after Schwarzenegger faced questions about a 1977 
magazine interview in which he talked about drug use and described 
participating in group sex.
<P>The interview with Oui magazine -- and other publications alleging the 
actor behaved inappropriately toward women -- spurred about 75 protesters from 
women's groups to picket Schwarzenegger's Santa Monica campaign headquarters.
<P>One protester, Virginia Hagen of Fullerton, said that as a mother of two 
daughters, "I don't like to think of someone like Schwarzenegger in a position 
of power. He boasts about his prowess with women, and he recanted," she said. 
"That means he's lying about something."
<P>Rob Stutzman, spokesman for Schwarzenegger's campaign, dismissed the video 
as "PG-13 material" and called the protesters "left-wing political activists 
slinging the most salacious charges . . . parading on the sidewalk with 
obscene handmade signs."
<P>"Many things that happened, and many things that didn't happen, are part of 
the lore of bodybuilding in the '70s," Stutzman said. "Arnold has said he 
didn't live his life to be a politician . . . voters understand the difference 
between what he did as a young man and the way he's acting now as a candidate 
for governor. They trust the record of someone who is devoted to his wife and 
family."
<P>Schwarzenegger, 56, came to prominence in the 1970s as a Mr. Olympia 
bodybuilder. He parlayed his fame in a 1977 documentary on bodybuilding, 
"Pumping Iron," into a Hollywood career as an action movie hero.
<P>Schwarzenegger bristled when asked by reporters Friday to address the issue 
of his past and his attitude toward women.
<P>"I think you should just go and talk to the women I worked with, either on 
movies or in business and charitable organizations," he said. "Talk to them, 
and you'll find I have the utmost respect for women."
<P>But after his campaign was dogged for a week regarding his past actions 
with women, the candidate is facing questions over "Carnival in Rio," a video 
available on Internet shopping sites. The cover blurb boasts: "Step into the 
heat of the action with star Arnold Schwarzenegger as he parties nonstop 
through the streets, beaches and nightclubs of fabulous Rio de Janeiro. Follow 
him to the wildest, no-holds-barred parties in town."
<P>Schwarzenegger, in the video, tours Brazilian nightlife -- including the 
famous topless samba club, Oba Oba, where he joins gyrating dancers on stage 
and delivers his assessment of the talent.
<P>"Yeah, Americans like breasts. No, no," he says. "After watching mulattas 
shake it, I can totally understand why Brazil is devoted to my favorite body 
part -- the ass."
<P>"I'd say it's more embarrassing rather than horribly offensive. He's kind 
of like the gringo from hell," says Chris McGowan, a writer who specializes in 
Brazilian culture and reviewed the video for CulturePlanet.com. "It's a frat-
boy attitude . . . that focuses on the T&A aspects of Carnival."
<P>At one point, Schwarzenegger teaches one female dancer how to eat a carrot 
and boasts he has memorized the Portuguese word for buttocks: "I learned one 
word yesterday -- bunda -- that's good, huh?"
<P>Though hardly more revealing than other "wild" videos available through 
cable TV, the Playboy video is another distraction to a campaign trying to 
establish its credentials with Republican conservative voters who have been 
the most supportive of the recall effort to oust Democratic Gov. Gray Davis.
<P>Conservative activists have expressed concerns about Schwarzenegger's views 
in support of abortion rights and gun control. After the Oui magazine 
interview was publicized, the Traditional Values Coalition's Rev. Lou Sheldon 
warned Republican legislators to hold off on endorsements, asking, "Is Arnold 
a Republican version of Bill Clinton?"
<P>Karen Pomer, an activist with <a href="http://www.codepink4peace.org/" target="_new">CODEPINK</a> -- a women's peace group that 
coordinated the Santa Monica protest -- said allegations about 
Schwarzenegger's behavior toward women cannot be dismissed as a partisan 
attack.
<P>"I'm an independent, and I'm not voting for Gray Davis. I never have," she 
said. "This isn't about partisan politics. It's about being offensive to women.
<P>"You can't walk up to a woman and pull her breast out in public . . . 
(that's) sexual harassment, which is illegal," said Pomer, referring to 
allegations detailed in Premiere magazine in 2001. "It's outrageous, and he's 
been protected in Hollywood . . . but that kind of behavior doesn't belong in 
Sacramento."
<P>Pomer and other critics say Schwarzenegger hasn't done himself favors by 
appearing to waffle on his explanations.
<P>Schwarzenegger, the GOP front-runner in the replacement part of the recall 
election, has offered three different explanations for the interview. First, 
he said he didn't remember it, then explained it as part of his "crazy" past 
life, then, on Thursday, said he made up statements to promote "Pumping Iron."
<P>"I was trying to get attention for weightlifting -- I say things that are 
exaggerated or untrue to get attention," Schwarzenegger told reporters 
Thursday. "It's not what was said in 1977 by me that's ruined the economy of 
California."
<P>Female supporters defended Schwarzenegger on Friday, saying he has a long 
record of concern for women and children's organizations.
<P>"This is some left-wing organization that is clearly slandering Arnold for 
political gains," said Atherton-based literary agent Jillian Manus-Salzman, a 
moderate, pro-choice GOP activist who is co-chairing Schwarzenegger's outreach 
effort to women. "He's provided opportunities for inner-city kids. He's 
encouraged kids to stay in school. The guy is like Governor Hope."
