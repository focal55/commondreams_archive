<p>WASHINGTON, Nov. 13 — Norman Lear, the 81-year-old television producer, said Thursday that he was beginning a $9 million campaign to register one million to two million new young voters for the 2004 election. 
<p>The campaign, which was announced at George Washington University with the actress Drew Barrymore, has a goal of increasing the number of registered young voters by at least two percentage points. In 2000, 42 percent of eligible voters ages 25 and under went to the polls.
<p>The campaign's focus is shaped by a national survey by Princeton Survey Research Associates International that found that 18 is a pivotal age to register voters.
<p>"If you get them voting at 18, they'll be lifetime voters," said Mr. Lear, who combined politics and popular culture in the television show "All in the Family." "Madison Avenue always said this about product: if you get them buying your car at a young age, they'll stay in the family of cars."
<p>The survey also found that a major reason that young people do not vote is not so much cynicism as the feeling that they do not know the issues or the candidates. Thus, the Lear campaign has created a Web site, <a href="http://www.declareyourself.com" target="_new">declareyourself.com</a>, to be a one-stop shop for voter information. 

<p>The site has a nationwide compilation of voter registration forms and absentee ballot request forms available for downloading. Users can also find listings of local races and candidates, and the specific location of their poll.
<p>In addition to the $9 million currently budgeted, Yahoo and Clear Channel, two companies that have extensive reach among young people, will donate advertising and promotion services to lure audiences to the Web site.
<p>Mr. Lear has given more than $250,000 to Democrats since the 2000 election cycle, but he said the youth voter drive was nonpartisan.
