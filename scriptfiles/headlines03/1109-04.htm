<p>Nine Mexican immigrants who worked as janitors at Wal-Marts in New Jersey sued 
the company on Wednesday, accusing Wal-Mart and its cleaning contractors of failing 
to pay overtime, withhold taxes and make required workers' compensation contributions. 
<p>The plaintiffs, who face deportation for being in the country illegally, also 
accuse Wal-Mart and its contractors of discriminating against them by giving them 
lower wages and fewer benefits than other workers because of their national origin. 
<p>The nine Mexicans were among 250 people arrested in an Oct. 23 federal immigration 
raid on 60 Wal-Mart stores in 21 states. <p>The lawsuit, the first filed by immigrants 
arrested in the raid, said Wal-Mart should be held accountable for its contractors' 
wage and hour violations. <p>The plaintiffs have asked Wal-Mart and its contractors 
to pay more than $200,000 in back pay they say they are owed for overtime. The 
nine say they worked seven days a week, at least 56 hours a week, and were not 
paid time and a half for overtime hours, those over 40 a week. The immigrants 
say they were paid $350 to $500 a week. <p>The lawsuit said that Wal-Mart, "knowingly 
and with the intention to defraud the United States government and the plaintiffs 
and in order to save money on cleaning service contract contractors," employed 
certain cleaning contractors, "with full knowledge" that these contractors would 
pay the illegal immigrants far less than they would have paid legal workers. <p>"Wal-Mart 
must have known about these violations," said Gilberto Garcia, the immigrants' 
lawyer, who filed the lawsuit on Wednesday in Monmouth County Superior Court in 
Freehold, N.J. "If these people are going to work at Wal-Marts, then Wal-Mart 
and its contractors should abide by the labor laws." <p>Mona Williams, vice president 
of Wal-Mart for communications, said on Wednesday that Wal-Mart did not know its 
contractors and subcontractors used illegal immigrants. She also said Wal-Mart 
did not know about the overtime and other labor violations of which the cleaning 
contractors are accused. <p>"Clearly, hungry lawyers are converging on these illegal 
immigrants as if they were accident victims," Ms. Williams said. "We have seen 
absolutely no evidence showing that Wal-Mart did anything wrong." <p>On Tuesday, 
Ms. Williams acknowledged that federal prosecutors had sent Wal-Mart a letter 
warning that it faced a grand jury investigation about illegal immigrants employed 
in its stores. <p>Ms. Williams said Wal-Mart was not liable for the misdeeds alleged 
against its contractors, noting that Wal-Mart has long insisted that its contractors 
obey the law. "If you are scrambling to make a buck at someone else's expense, 
who would you sue, an unknown cleaning contractor or the country's largest corporation?" 
she asked. <p>The lawsuit says the managers at two Wal-Marts where the plaintiffs 
worked, in Old Bridge and Piscataway, N.J., knew that the workers were illegal 
immigrants. <p ALIGN="CENTER">Copyright 2003 The New York Times Company <p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable --></font></td></tr>
