<p>WASHINGTON - A divided U.S. Senate defied a White  House veto threat on Wednesday and voted to block proposed  federal work rule changes that foes say could deny millions of  Americans pay for overtime work.<P>

</table>The Republican-led chamber, on a 54-45 vote, approved a  Democratic amendment that would derail a proposed expansion of  overtime exemptions for white-collar workers under the 1938  Fair Labor Standards Act.<P>
Yet the final fate of the Bush administration proposal  remained unclear, as it still faces a number of procedural and  possible legal twists and turns.<P>
"This was perhaps the most important victory that we have  had for working families in some time," said Senate Democratic  Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota.<P>
But Daschle added, "The president has threatened to veto  this legislation, so our victory today is only the first step."<P>
The administration, along with the business community, has  argued that its proposed changes are needed to update  antiquated work rules and aimed at middle- and upper-level  white-collar employees.<P>
Opponents, who include labor unions, say the changes could  unfairly strip workers, including police and firefighters, of  overtime protection and allow them to be made to work longer  than a 40-hour week without additional compensation.<P>
The Senate vote came on a Democratic amendment that would  deny any funding for these proposed changes. The amendment was  attached to a broader $138 billion spending bill for U.S.  health, labor and education programs.<P>
The White House said last week that President Bush's  advisors would recommend he veto the entire spending bill if  the amendment was attached to it.<P>
PARTY LINES<P>
The vote was mostly along party lines, although six  Republicans, including Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman  Ted Stevens of Alaska, joined 47 Democrats and one independent  in approving the amendment. One Democrat, Zell Miller of  Georgia, joined 44 Republicans in opposing it.<P>
Before the measure could become law, the Republican-led  House of Representatives would have to concur, and both  chambers would have to override any presidential veto with a  two-thirds vote.<P>
The House narrowly defeated a similar amendment earlier  this year, but proponents are hopeful that the Senate action  will give the measure new momentum.<P>
There is plenty of confusion and debate over how many and  what type of workers would be affected by the proposed changes.<P>
The Labor Department estimates no more than 644,000  employees would lose overtime protection. But critics put the  figure at 6 million to more than 10 million.<P>
In addition, the Labor Department contends the changes  would affect only white-collar employees and not manual workers  or firefighters, police officers or nurses. Yet critics have  argued the proposed changes could be interpreted to strip many  of them of overtime protection, too.<P>
The Fair Labor Standards Act created the 40-hour work week  by guaranteeing overtime pay, at time and a half, for each hour  worked over 40. The law allows for the exemption of  administrative, professional and executive workers.<P>
Under the Labor Department's proposal, more employees could  be reclassified as exempt administrators, professionals or  executives -- provided they meet certain criteria.<P>
In addition, employees earning more than $65,000 a year  could be exempt if they meet one or more of the duties for an  executive, administrative or professional employee.<P>
Sen. Judd Gregg, a New Hampshire Republican and chairman of  the Senate Health, Education and Labor Committee, argued that  the proposal was still being reviewed by the administration and  it would be wrong to "short circuit it."
