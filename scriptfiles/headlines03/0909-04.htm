</table>Defense ministers and senior army officers from countries including Algeria, Angola, Colombia, India and Pakistan were expected to attend the four-day exhibition to see military hardware showcased by some 950 companies.<p></p>
<p>More than 2,600 security guards and police were deployed at the <a href="http://www.dsei.co.uk/" target="_new">Defense Systems/Equipment International</a> (DSEi) show, held at the Royal Docks in east London on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Six warships were docked alongside the show center and a Eurofighter Typhoon jet fighter and an Apache attack helicopter were displayed in the main hall.</p>
<p>Several companies planned to unveil details of systems that can be installed on civil aircraft to ward off surface-to-air missiles.</p>
<p>About half the exhibitors at the show were British firms, with 20 percent from the United States and the remainder from other NATO countries.</p>
<p>London's Scotland Yard police department said they had arrested 54 people in the week ahead of the show, including three who were held early Tuesday for throwing red paint over the walkway leading into the event venue.</p>
<p>A small group of demonstrators shouted "Shame on you!" at delegates queuing for entry to the event as it opened, but made no attempt to break through security cordons.</p>
<p>Nearby around 100 protesters with props including a cardboard tank listened to music and chanted peace slogans.</p>
<p>The officer in charge of policing the event said last week that he was concerned that protests by anti-arms and anti-globalization groups could turn into a riot.</p>
<p>Metropolitan Police deputy assistant commissioner Andy Trotter said: "Our concern would be if the demonstration turns into riots and we have got to be prepared to deal with that."</p>
<p>A candle-lit vigil held outside the fair passed off Monday night without violent confrontation.</p>
<p>A spokesman for protest group the Campaign Against the Arms Trade (CAAT) said that between 30 and 40 people had attended the vigil, billed as "a silent witness against the arms trade".</p>
<p>The spokesman added that CAAT would attempt to disrupt the show in a number of ways, including holding a procession to the east London site.</p>
<p>"This arms fair is a bringing together of companies and countries with terrible track records," the spokesman said.</p>
<p>"First and foremost we hope we will get it cancelled, or create a public outcry big enough to make sure it doesn't happen again."</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Ministry of Defense's Export Services Organization said: "We have strict export licence criteria, and going to the exhibition in no way implies that you can buy the equipment."</p>
<p>He added: "Defense brings five billion pounds (eight billion dollars, 7.1 billion euros) a year to the UK and benefits between 70,000 and 100,000 jobs."</p>
