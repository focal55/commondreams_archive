<p>LUCK, Wis. - Nearly 500 people have registered to travel by bus from Wisconsin to Washington, D.C., for a protest Saturday opposing war with Iraq, organizers said.
<p>"I was hoping to fill one bus from northern Wisconsin to join with the usual suspects from Madison and Milwaukee," Mike Miles of the Northwoods Peace Initiative said Monday. "We have already filled almost six buses with no end in sight."<p>Guy Wolf of La Crosse said he has collected enough donations to finance the trip for 40 people.<p>"People who can't go themselves are paying for others to go in their place," he said.<p>The protest, being organized by International A.N.S.W.E.R (Act Now to Stop War and Racism), headed by former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark, is being planned on the weekend of Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday.<p>Actors Jessica Lange and Mike Farrell and demonstrators from religious groups, labor organizations and schools are among the more than 100,000 people expected to attend the event, organizers said.<p>Demonstrators plan a rally on the west side of the Capitol. They will then march to the Washington Navy Yard, where they will ask to inspect weapons of mass destruction they say the government might have.<p>Miles said nine buses have been contracted to transport protesters from Wisconsin. Participants include many people who have never done anything like this, he said.
