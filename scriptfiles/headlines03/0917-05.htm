<p>FALLUJA, Iraq  - Sheikh Khaled Saleh, a fiery  Iraqi Sunni Muslim cleric, says the young angry men battling  U.S. troops in the violent town of Falluja are holy warriors  who look to Osama bin Laden as their mentor.<P>
"Although unorganized and without leadership, the Iraqi  resistance is a ball of fire in America's face that will bring  its end in Iraq," said the 53-year-old cleric, whose sermons  draw thousands in the main Badawi mosque, one of over 70  mosques in the center of Falluja.<P>

</table>The cleric said growing numbers of young men in Falluja  were influenced by bin Laden, the fugitive Saudi militant  behind the shadowy al Qaeda network blamed for the September  11, 2001 attacks on the United States.<P>
The city of almost 500,000 people, 45 miles west of  Baghdad, lies in the Sunni Muslim triangle, a bedrock of  support for deposed leader Saddam Hussein and anti-U.S.  resistance.<P>
In recent weeks, it has seen some of the fiercest clashes  with U.S. forces, with ambushes on convoys by unknown attackers  using small arms, explosives and grenades.<P>
"We have made the Americans dizzy," said the cleric at his  home in the town, known by its inhabitants as the "City of  Mosques."<P>
Residents are coy about the identity of the men who spray  walls with pro-Saddam graffiti and encourage citizens to kill  American troops.<P>
The latest public messages were posters plastered across  the city that warned residents to stay far from U.S. convoys to  avoid being hit.<P>
One slogan scrawled on the wall of the busy open market  read: "Our leader Saddam Hussein will return."<P>
  <b>THIRST FOR REVENGE</b>
<P>
Residents of the conservative tribal region insist the  fighters are driven by a thirst for revenge against  heavy-handed tactics by American troops.<P>
"They are moved by national pride and honor to protect  their homes," said Hisham Alousi, who runs a religious school  for mosque preachers.<P>
In a city that saw Saddam, a Sunni, as protector, locals  say the attacks have struck fear into the Americans.<P>
"The Americans are cowards and now they are afraid of any  gunshot from any strange quarter," said Fadl Ibrahim.<P>
Local anger was inflamed even further when 10 Iraqi  security officers and a Jordanian were killed in a gunbattle  with U.S. troops last week. The U.S. military apologized for  the incident.<P>
Many locals recall a history of resistance to foreign  conquerors, saying the Americans would meet the fate of their  predecessors.<P>
"This is the 21st fall of Baghdad and at every turn the  invaders were repulsed here at the heart of Arab world," said  Ahmad Said, a former army officer in Saddam's now-defunct army.<P>
For many of Falluja's residents, Saddam remains an Arab  warrior who fought for Iraq's glory.<P>
"It's a crime that President Saddam should go. He was  everything for us, our father who gave us everything," Mohammad  Shaker said.<P>
