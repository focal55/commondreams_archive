<p>UNITED NATIONS  - U.N. Secretary-General Kofi  Annan warned world leaders on Monday that the war against  terrorism must go beyond simply fighting extremists but also  hold out the promise of a "better and fairer world."<P>

</table>Annan opened an international conference on terrorism only  hours after U.N. headquarters in Baghdad was attacked for a  second time, wounding 19 people, including two Iraqi U.N.  workers, and killing a security guard. The first attack on Aug.  19 killed 22 people, including senior staff.<P>"Terrorism will only be defeated if we act to solve the  political dispute and long-standing conflicts which generate  support for it," Annan said. "If we do not, we shall find  ourselves acting as a recruiting sergeant for the very  terrorists we seek to suppress."<P>
Annan told more than 20 heads of state at the conference  that human rights violations, like targeted assassinations,  which Israel has carried out against Palestinian militants, as  well as civilian deaths from off-target bombings in Afghanistan  and Iraq ran the risk of winning over converts and spurring new  terrorist acts.<P>
"Paradoxically, terrorist groups may actually be sustained  when, in responding to their outrages, governments cross the  line and commit outrages themselves -- whether it is ethnic  cleansing, the indiscriminate bombardment of cities, the  torture of prisoners, targeted assassinations or accepting the  death of innocent civilians as 'collateral damage," Annan said.<P>
"These acts are not only illegal and unjustifiable. They  may also be exploited by terrorists to gain new followers and  to generate cycles of violence in which they thrive," he added.<P>
The summit at a New York hotel was scheduled on the eve of  a two-week high-level session of the 191-nation U.N. General  Assembly, due to open on Tuesday which is expected to focus on  terrorism and post-war Iraq.<P>
President Bush was invited to the conference but the  administration sent Sen. Richard Lugar, chairman of the Senate  Foreign Relations Committee, as its representative while Colin  Powell will be at U.N. headquarters addressing an AIDS summit.<P>
Norwegian Prime Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik, one of the  conference sponsors, said the goal of the meeting, launched two  years after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States,  was "to shed new light on the roots of terror" in search of a  new generation of tools to use against "this evil."<P>
"The rule of law and respect for human rights are the first  and the best way to counter terrorism," the Norwegian said. "We  must provide outlets for human ambitions, for hopes and  beliefs, but also for anger and grief."<P>
He stressed the need for governments and private groups to  work with educators and religious leaders to ensure children  are raised in ways that promote tolerance and mutual respect  rather than hate.<P>
Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf dismissed the idea of  a "militant Islam" as being at the root of the problem, saying,  "There are only some 'militant Muslims' -- as there are  militant Hindus, Christians and Jews."<P>
"Most of the political disputes of our times afflict  Islamic peoples and nations," he said. "Religious extremism and  militancy have risen because these conflicts have been allowed  to fester. There is a feeling in the Muslim world that Islam is  being targeted."<P>
"This widening gulf of perceptions between the West and the  Islamic world must be bridged," he said, calling on the West to  seek to better understand Islam and on the Muslim world to  reject extremist laws and practices.
