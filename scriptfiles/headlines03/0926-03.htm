<p>Struggling denim icon Levi Strauss & Co. said Thursday that it will 
cut 1,980 more North American jobs within six months when it closes its two 
remaining U.S. plants in San Antonio as well as three plants in Canada.
<P>The layoffs, combined with 650 planned U.S. and European job cuts 
announced earlier this month - roughly half of which are expected to come from 
Levi's San Francisco headquarters  --  will trim the company's worldwide 
workforce by about 21 percent.

</table>Thursday's announcement signals the end of Levi's U.S. jeansmaking era, 
which has faded in waves of domestic layoffs and more than 20 Levi's plant 
closures in half as many years.
<P>By the end of December, Levi's said, it will fire 800 sewing-machine 
operators, fabric finishers and other plant workers in San Antonio. At that 
point, the 150-year-old American company will have closed the last of its 
plants in the country where its brand achieved fame.
<P>A small amount of Levi's and Dockers manufacturing will remain in the 
United States, through agreements with other firms, according to the company. 
Much of the work once done in this country has moved instead to cheaper 
contract factories in Asia and Latin America, reflecting a long-building 
industrywide shift.
<P>Last year, in a move symbolic of that trend, Levi's closed its landmark 
Valencia Street plant in San Francisco, which had been open since 1906. About 
100 San Francisco workers lost their jobs. Levi's cut 4,200 jobs worldwide 
last year and closed eight plants, six of them in the United States.
<P>The company hoped that the resulting savings would help it turn around 
its business and pay down its huge debt, which now tips the $2.3 billion mark. 
But investors have been left waiting as Levi's credit troubles continue to 
mount and its optimistic sales projections fail to materialize.
<P>Levi's executives, most notably Chief Executive Officer Philip Marineau, 
have continued to insist that their plans are on track for increased sales by 
next year, in large part through the new, lower-priced Levi Strauss Signature 
brand sold in Wal-Mart Stores Inc.
<P>Calling Thursday a "difficult and poignant day," Levi's Chairman Robert 
Haas, great-great-grandnephew of company founder Levi Strauss, said in an 
interview with The Chronicle that the latest cutbacks were inevitable.
<P>"We've resisted all of the pressures that have been upon us to close 
plants,'' he said. "As you know, we are one of the very last major companies 
that has any kind of a manufacturing presence in North America any more. ... 
Belatedly and reluctantly, we're having to follow in the footsteps of other 
apparel manufacturers" in shifting work to factories elsewhere.
<P>Responding to criticism in recent years that Levi's has cut its 
manufacturing and personnel costs too little, too late, Haas said, "I'm not 
going to second-guess (previous) decisions."
<P>Marineau, who came on board four years ago, was unavailable Thursday 
because he was out of the country, Levi's spokesman Jeff Beckman said.
<P>Haas said that despite persistent snags in Levi's plans to increase its 
annual sales for the first time since 1996, he remains confident in Marineau's 
leadership. "Phil and I are very close partners, and I admire the changes he's 
undertaken, and the way in which he's done it. I recognize that there's been a 
lot on his plate, and I think he's done it very effectively."
<P>Prior to Marineau, Haas had been CEO of the company since 1984. Levi's is 
largely controlled by Haas' family; but because some its debt is publicly 
traded, Levi's files quarterly earnings reports.
<P>Haas on Thursday directed other comments toward the company's history of 
generosity toward its workers.
<P>Regarding the just-announced layoffs, he said, "I anticipate that these 
(severance agreements) will be packages that will be similarly generous to 
what we've provided displaced workers in the past."
<P>Of the layoffs announced Thursday, 1,180 jobs will be eliminated in March 
2004 when Levi's closes factories in Edmonton, Alberta; Stoney Creek, Ontario; 
and Brantford, Ontario. 
<P>In San Antonio, where Levi's has had sewing operations for 25 years, 
workers were dismayed.
<P>"There was shock and anger. A lot of people cried,'' Hope Villanueva, who 
has worked for Levi's three years, told the San Antonio Express-News.
<P>Company executives last year indicated that they planned to keep the San 
Antonio factories open to fill unexpected orders quickly.
<P>Workers, many of whom make $11 an hour, said it will be difficult to find 
other jobs that pay that much. "We were blessed to be here. We're never going 
to find a place like this,'' Maria Hernandez, 45, told the Express-News. She 
has spent 26 years with Levi's.
<P>The nearly 2,000 plant workers affected by this year's layoffs will 
benefit from about $1.4 million in work-transition training and community 
grants through the nonprofit Levi Strauss Foundation, the company said.
<P>Last year's layoffs and plant closures resulted in $113 million in 
restructuring charges, according to Levi's. Until severance packages are 
negotiated with plant worker unions, the company said it can't estimate the 
costs of the newest closures. Investors and analysts said they expect about 
$100 million in related charges.
<P>The costs are surfacing as Levi's is seeking a new $1.15 billion 
financing agreement to replace its existing $850 million arrangement. The 
company has negotiated a waiver in its existing credit arrangement in order to 
avoid defaulting on bank terms.
<P>Standard & Poor's earlier this month lowered its non-investment grade 
rating on Levi's two levels, to B from BB-. The firm reaffirmed that rating 
this week. On Monday, however, Moody's Investors Service downgraded the 
company's debt by multiple notches, citing concerns about Levi's credit 
demands and sluggish sales. "We believe that Moody's actions were overly 
severe, especially considering our recent improvement in sales and earnings,'' 
Beckman said.
<P>The lower ratings nevertheless have spurred speculation that Levi's, 
already highly leveraged, could be edging toward the risk of bankruptcy. But 
Haas immediately dismissed the possibility, calling the speculation 
inappropriate and adding, "That's not something that I lose any sleep over."
