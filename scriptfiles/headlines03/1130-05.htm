<p>HOLLYWOOD, Fla., Nov. 29 — In the condominiums and on the palm-shaded beaches here, where Medicare is a frequent topic of conversation, few people expect to get much help from the new drug benefit just approved by Congress.</p>
<P>
They express disappointment but little surprise because, they say, they never had high hopes. They say they feel they were sold out, by Republicans and AARP, which endorsed a Medicare bill drafted mainly by Republicans. But the  Democrats, they say, did not fight hard enough for a better drug benefit.</p>

</table>"We've been waiting, waiting for this prescription drug bill to provide some relief to seniors, but it won't do much for them, not much at all," said Lorraine M. Angelotti, 72, of Fort Lauderdale. "You would have to be a major, major user of very expensive medications to get any kind of halfway decent benefit."</p>
<P>
The drug benefit has often been described as the biggest expansion of Medicare since its creation in 1965. Some people here, especially those who have been struggling to  pay for prescription drugs, applauded the change. But Ernest D. DeBlasis, 73, echoed the view of many when he said  the new coverage "amounts to peanuts."</p>
<P>
"It's not going to help me," said Mr. DeBlasis, who spends half the year here and half in Marlboro, N.J., where he was an architect. "Let's hope Congress revises this thing before it takes effect in 2006."</p>
<P>
Residents of this coastal city, nestled between Miami and Fort Lauderdale, display a formidable knowledge of Medicare. In interviews, several mentioned that Congress was providing $400 billion over 10 years for the new drug benefit. One woman knew the exact vote by which the Senate approved the Medicare bill on Tuesday, 54 to 44. The measure goes now to President Bush, who has made it a centerpiece of his domestic agenda.</p>
<P>
The new drug benefit would be voluntary. It would be offered to all 40 million Medicare beneficiaries, through government-subsidized private plans, in 2006. Federal officials say premiums would average $35 a month.</p>
<P>
Under "standard prescription drug coverage," defined in the Medicare bill, a beneficiary would be responsible for the first $250 in drug costs each year. Of the next $2,000, Medicare would cover 75 percent and the beneficiary would pay 25 percent, or $500. The beneficiary would then be responsible for all of the next $2,850 in drug costs.</p>
<P>
The beneficiary would thus pay $3,600 for the first $5,100 worth of medicine in a year, and that does not include the premiums, estimated at $420 a year. Beyond that, Medicare would cover 95 percent of the cost of each prescription, after the patient had spent $3,600.</p>
<P>
John Anasis, 81, said he did not like the structure of the drug benefit.</p>
<P>
"It's not straightforward," said Mr. Anasis, who moved here three years ago from West Yarmouth, Mass., where he and his wife ran a travel and insurance business.</p>
<P>
Several Medicare beneficiaries over the age of 75 said they would need lawyers to figure out the new benefits. The options could be even more complex than they realize. Under the bill, insurers could offer variations of the standard drug benefit.</p>
<P>
Joseph S. Shapiro, 89, out for his morning stroll on the boardwalk, said: "People have to pray that they get very ill. If you are in semi-bad shape, you get very little or nothing from the new Medicare bill."</p>
<P>
A major reason for the convoluted shape of the drug benefit is that Congress and President Bush wanted to limit the cost to $400 billion over 10 years.</p>
<P>
In separate interviews, several Medicare beneficiaries questioned the priorities of officials in Washington.</p>
<P>
"If they can send $87 billion to Iraq and Afghanistan this year, I think they could do a little better for our citizens, especially senior citizens who are on fixed incomes," said Tony J. Forzese, 71, a small-business man from Massachusetts who has had a condominium here for 20 years.</p>
<P>
Annual spending on the new drug benefit would start at $26 billion in 2006, rising steadily to $73 billion in 2013, the Congressional Budget Office says.</p>
<P>
Of the new drug benefit, Mr. Forzese said: "I don't expect to get much out of it. I don't think it will help unless I really get sick and need a lot of medicines."</p>
<P>
Low-income people without any insurance for prescription drugs stand to gain most from the new Medicare benefit. They could receive extra assistance,  reducing their premiums, deductibles and other costs.</p>
<P>
"This could be quite helpful," said Hyacinth L. Rickman, 67, as she took a break from shopping at a mall in Pembroke Pines, just west of Hollywood.</p>
<P>
Mrs. Rickman said that she and her husband lived mainly on a Social Security check of about $500 a month. More than $100 of that, she said, goes for drug costs not covered by her health maintenance organization.</p>
<P>
"The $100 is a lot for us," said Mrs. Rickman, who takes Synthroid for thyroid disease, Zocor for high cholesterol and Norvasc for high blood pressure.  "It would be great to get the government to pay some."</p>
<P>
Likewise, Annibale Cappelleri, 65, said, "For low-income people, this new benefit is good."</p>
<P>
The local member of Congress, Representative E. Clay Shaw Jr., a Republican, cited the assistance for low-income people as one of the main reasons he voted for the bill.</p>
<P>
About three-fourths of Medicare beneficiaries have some kind of public or private insurance to help pay drug costs, but the coverage becomes more expensive and more limited every year.</p>
<P>
Gina Vazquez, 66, said, "I have secondary coverage" to supplement Medicare. "But my brother doesn't, and the new Medicare benefit could be useful to him."</p>
<P>
AARP often comes up when people here discuss the new drug benefit.</p>
<P>
Mr. Shapiro, a former New York City school principal and songwriter, said: "I'm going to resign from AARP. Its support of this drug plan tipped the balance. They're more sympathetic to the big drug and insurance companies than to ordinary seniors who want a simple solution."</p>
<P>
Mr. DeBlasis said, "I'm disappointed in AARP, but I can understand their argument for the new drug benefit as a first step."</p>
<P>
Elsewhere, a 73-year-old man, sitting on the promenade of Hollywood Beach as a soft evening breeze fluttered the palm fronds on Thanksgiving Day, said: "I'm more angry at AARP than at Congress because they are supposed to support us. They sold us out."</p>
<P>
Floridians say they cannot understand why many drugs cost less in Canada and Mexico, and they are annoyed that Congress decided not to legalize imports.</p>
<P>
"My brother goes to Mexico every four to six months," Ms. Angelotti said. "He picks up all the medications he needs. Going to Mexico, you get a better deal than the new drug benefit will provide."</p>
<P>
Mr. Anasis said: "I don't understand why the U.S. government does not do the same thing Canada does for its citizens — buy wholesale from drug companies and get a 50 percent discount. I'm an American citizen. I want to buy here in my own country rather than from Canada."</p>
