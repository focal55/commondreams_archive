<p> LOS ANGELES --
Tim Robbins doesn't have much patience these days for labels. In 
case you haven't heard, the actor-writer-director has been called a lot of 
things this past year  --  and not just a likely Oscar contender for his 
devastating performance in Clint Eastwood's "Mystic River." Robbins' outspoken 
opposition to America's foreign policy since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, has landed him squarely in the sights of his conservative critics. 
<P>The name-calling began earlier this year when Robbins and his partner of 
15 years, actress Susan Sarandon, lent their voices and celebrity presence to 
the growing anti-war movement at rallies and television appearances. "Just 
because I expressed my opinion, I've been labeled as all sorts of things, but 
that's (my critics') trip, not mine," Robbins said over the phone recently 
from Manhattan, where he and Sarandon live with their three children. It was a 
continuing conversation that had begun a few days earlier at the opening of 
his new play, "Embedded"  --  a savagely witty commentary on the media frenzy 
accompanying the war in Iraq  --  at the Actors' Gang Theater in Los Angeles.

  </table></font>Robbins got a shrill wake-up call last spring that falling out of step 
with the march to war would mean protesting at his own peril. A torrent of 
personal attacks against Robbins and his family intensified in the weeks after 
the U.S. invasion of Iraq in March. He was accused by the right of being 
unpatriotic. A Saddam supporter. A protest junkie. Death threats arrived, and 
his 13-year-old son was dragged through the gossip pages. Sarandon's speaking 
engagement at a United Way conference on women's leadership was canceled. Then, in a widely publicized dust-up, the president of the Baseball Hall of Fame 
accused Robbins of putting American troops in danger by criticizing the war 
effort and withdrew his invitation to Robbins to come to Cooperstown for the 
15th anniversary celebration of "Bull Durham.''
<P>"It became so blatantly clear that what was going on was attempted 
intimidation," says Robbins, having had time to reflect on the backlash and 
what he thinks motivates those who see his public role as "actor-vist" as a 
dirty word. "The attacks are meant to make you feel isolated, to prevent 
others who feel in a similar way from speaking out against the war. My feeling 
is, when you allow intimidation to prevent you from expressing your opinions, 
then you might as well just give up your First Amendment rights." 
<P>Robbins admits that being lambasted as un-American was particularly tough 
to swallow. Despite his radical rep, he actually sees his penchant for 
democratically sanctioned dissent as every bit as all-American as his love of 
baseball. He says his moral compass has always guided him toward saying and 
doing what he thinks is right, to speaking the truth when he sees hypocrisy in 
the world, and he has trouble understanding why so many people take issue with 
the simple logic of his frankness. 
<P>"I think that if you believe something, and you have an opportunity in a 
free society to express it, then isn't that your responsibility as a citizen? 
If you're an artist, a writer, an actor, isn't that part of the deal? When the 
attacks started on my patriotism, that's when I went into high gear." 
<P>Robbins first channeled his anger into an eloquent speech delivered to 
the National Press Club in April, just three days after the Hall of Fame 
debacle. He cautioned that a "chill wind is blowing in this nation. A message 
is being sent through the White House and its allies in talk radio and Clear 
Channel and Cooperstown: If you oppose this administration, there can and will 
be ramifications." He urged journalists covering the war to live up to what he 
sees as the "awesome responsibility" of their trade and "insist that they not 
be used as publicists by this administration."
<P>And then, Robbins says, he channeled his ire into his art, snapping back 
at his critics the old-fashioned way, in the tradition of the great 20th 
century playwrights of social conscience he admires, like Brecht and Büchner. 
"I started writing 'Embedded.' And it came really fast."
<P>"Embedded," which Robbins also directed, is a very smart, very screwball 
and ultimately very chilling comedy, dramatizing the interactions of 
journalists and U.S. troops during the invasion of "Gomorrah," an oil-rich 
rogue state ruled by the "Butcher of Babylon."
<P>In the play, Robbins asks some of the tough questions that are still 
being debated about the pros and cons of the Pentagon's strategy of 
"embedding" journalists with military troops  --  about the public's right to 
hear bad news along with the heroic, and about the feasibility of filtering 
the real stories through the spin in a modern-day, televised-round-the-clock 
war. "I found the television coverage of the war depressing," says Robbins, 
laying the blame not on what he saw but on everything he didn't see. "It just 
got numbing because of the attempt to make it action-packed, when in fact you 
weren't really seeing anything and you were just being told what to feel. So I 
just read a lot."
<P>Tacked to the Actors' Gang Theater lobby walls are front pages from 
foreign newspapers showing bloodier photos and more details of Iraqi civilian 
casualties than most American readers probably saw during coverage of the war 
at home. Robbins had little patience for the gung-ho reports from what he has 
called "19th Century Fox." CNN's "script approval" policy  --  which dictated 
that all CNN reporters had to send their copy to anonymous officials in 
Atlanta to ensure its suitability to be aired  --  also takes a lashing in the 
play.
<P>Robbins doesn't consider himself a satirist  --  rather, something more 
like a dramatic reporter, holding a mirror up to a stranger-than-fiction world.
<P>"I don't satirize the journalists," he says, then recites a line from 
"Embedded" that's pulled directly from the TV news during one of the first 
nights of heavy aerial assaults on Baghdad: " 'If you don't have goosebumps 
now, you'll never have them in your life.' That's directly off the Fox News. 
That's not satire. That's reportage."
<P>"Embedded" examines not only the discrepancy between the Army's rah-rah 
briefings and the journalists' view of mayhem on the ground, but also the self-
censorship that can result from reporters cozying up to the troops who are 
both their beat and their bodyguards. 
<P>Indeed, Robbins shows genuine sympathy for the journalists and the 
soldiers, who are portrayed touchingly kissing spouses and lovers goodbye 
before shipping out to the desert. He saves his ample scorn for the government 
leaders whose shifting rationales leading up to the invasion, he says, 
perpetuate the public's confusion about the war's inevitability. 
<P>The play's comic stroke of genius is a masked chorus called "The Cabal," 
the policy advisers and analysts in the Pentagon's "Office of Special Plans"  -
-  with names like Rum-Rum, Pearly White, Woof, Gondola, Cove and Dick. ("I am 
not the one who named them the Cabal, by the way," Robbins is quick to point 
out. "Those guys in Washington call themselves that.") They sneer at reports 
of swelling peace marches, consult their Palm Pilots to find the best date to 
launch the invasion ("If we don't get this war started soon, we're going to 
have to compete with the NBA playoffs") and recite a litany of excuses for why 
none of them ever served in the armed forces  --  a feature of the Bush 
administration that makes Robbins seethe. 
<P>"You've got middle-aged men who never served when they were young enough 
to serve in the armed forces now reaching their 50s and 60s and sending young 
men and women off to fight," says Robbins. "And most of those (soldiers) 
they're sending off to fight are poor. On top of that, for those 'chicken 
hawks' to accuse others of a lack of patriotism because they are asking 
questions about why it is necessary to put our young men and women at risk is 
for me another hypocrisy. They were elected to be representatives in a 
democratic society, and they are crushing democratic values when someone 
disagrees with them." 
<P>Robbins takes his constitutional right to question very seriously. And he 
has always seen theater as one of the best ways to ignite dialogue and debate. 
Just don't call what the Actors' Gang does "political theater." "I'm not even 
sure I would want to go see political theater," he says. "Our first 
responsibility is always to provide entertainment."
<P>Many of Robbins' fans and, he says, even his Hollywood peers are 
surprised when they hear he works in theater at all  --  and are even more 
amazed to learn he has written seven of his own plays and is the artistic 
director of a 99-seat warehouse theater company in Los Angeles. 
<P>"I can't tell you how many times I have gotten befuddled, confused looks 
from my colleagues in the film industry when I talk about the Actors' Gang," 
Robbins said in a speech to regional arts presenters in Long Beach in 
September. " 'Theater in Hollywood? Why are you doing that?' I guess the 
assumption with these folks is that theater is something you do until you 
become famous and then once again when you are famous for having once been 
famous. But theater for me has never been about fame. From the first it has 
always been about community."
<P>Robbins founded the Actors' Gang with a group of drama buddies from UCLA 
in 1981, years before he became a movie star. They modeled their edgy agitprop 
aesthetic on the in-your-face antics of the San Francisco Mime Troupe, and 
they shared what Robbins calls a "punk-rock sensibility." (In the program of 
"Embedded,'' Robbins dedicated the play to The Clash's Joe Strummer, who died 
last year.) 
<P>"Theater is an extremely responsive medium," says Robbins. "You can 
engage with the news and the stories that we're being fed that are affecting 
our perceptions of the world  --  right now. I think we are living in 
iconographic times." 
<P>When asked if there have been ramifications to his career because of 
speaking out politically, Robbins says, "I think there would be even more 
(consequences) on me as a human being if I didn't. If you believe something 
and you sit on it, whether it's to further your career or to get more money, 
then there's no difference between you and a politician."</p>
