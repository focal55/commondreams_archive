<p> WASHINGTON - Hundreds of thousands of

opponents of a U.S. war against Iraq called and faxed their

senators and the White House on Wednesday in a &quot;virtual march

on Washington&quot;, jamming many congressional telephone lines for

several hours.

<P> Coordinated by the <a href="http://www.winwithoutwarus.org" target="_new">Win Without War Coalition</a>, an umbrella

protest group, the action aimed to direct at least one

telephone call and fax to every U.S. senator every minute

throughout the day. Organizers said they were far exceeding

that goal.

<P> The White House switchboard was also flooded and most

callers heard a message that &quot;all circuits are busy&quot;.<P> Tom Andrews, a former Democratic representative from Maine

who is running the organization, said more than 500,000 people

had signed up on the Internet to take part and a half a million

more were also expected to participate without registering on

the group's web site (<a href="http://www.Moveon.org" target="_new">Moveon.org</a>).

<P> &quot;We have hundreds of thousands of calls and faxes that we

know are going in. It's a first-of-its-kind protest and a

tremendous success already,&quot; he said. &quot;People are making their

voices heard loud and clear -- don't invade and don't occupy

Iraq.&quot;<P> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><table border=0 align=right hspace=5 cellpadding=6 width="350">

</table></font>The Web site had a running total of what it said was the

number of calls placed. As of 2 p.m (1900 GMT) the number had

exceeded 250,000. The web site was flashing the names of

individual protesters above a map of the United States with

quotes from e-mails sent to the headquarters and to lawmakers.

Each comment included the name and hometown on the protester.<P> Some protesters themselves had difficulties getting through

to their representatives. Molly Lanzarotta from Boston said she

had to dial multiple times to get through to an answering

service in the office of Democrat John Kerry, a leading

presidential candidate for 2004.<P> Others tried for long periods but eventually gave up. Brian

Fry tried to call from Cleveland but kept getting the message,

&quot;all circuits are busy.&quot; He said he would call his senators'

local Ohio offices instead and try to get through to Washington

again later or on the next day.<P> SET TIMES TO CALL<P> Activists were given set times to call. Chicago marketing

executive Mary Rickard was supposed to call at 3:14 p.m, 3:19

p.m. and 3:24 p.m. The faxes from people who signed onto the

Web site were also programmed to go out at set times.<P> Telephone calls placed from Reuters to various senators

received busy signals at all but two offices. At Florida

Democrat Bob Graham's office, a spokeswoman said they had

received 400 calls in the first three hours of the day, well

above the norm. At Nebraska Republican Charles Hagel's office,

a spokeswoman said the front desk did not seem to be any busier

than usual.<P> Andrews said the Internet had emerged as a key tool for the

anti-war movement in organizing protests and instantly reaching

tens of thousands of activists.<P> &quot;It allows us to be in touch instantly with activists all

around the country and the world. It's a tremendous democratic

tool,&quot; he said.<P> Hundreds of thousands of Americans and millions more in

cities around the world have taken to the streets in a series

of demonstrations over the past few weeks.<P> However, the latest polls show a substantial but not

overwhelming majority of American voters support President

George W. Bush on Iraq. Surveys suggest that around 35 to 40

percent of the electorate opposes the war.<P> A Time/CNN poll conducted Feb. 19-20 found 54 percent said

the United States should use military action to remove Iraqi

President Saddam Hussein. The number was down 5 points from two

weeks before and at its lowest level since last November.

Thirty eight percent said they were opposed.<P> Pollster Jennifer Laszlo, a Democrat who has recently

conducted four focus groups, said support for the war was soft

and opponents were far more intense in their views than many

supporters.<P> &quot;Republicans think this is America's war but Democrats more

and more see it as Bush's war and they are getting more

energized and more angry,&quot; Laszlo said.
