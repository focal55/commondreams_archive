<p>MILAN - A U.N. conference agreed on Tuesday to
permit use of genetically modified trees in forests planted to
offset global warming, clearing a final hurdle to the Kyoto
protocol  whose fate now hinges on Russia.
<p>
 The 180 nations left it up to each country to assess
"potential risks" of using genetically modified organisms
(GMOs) under a set of rules promoting forest plantings in the
Third World to soak up greenhouse gases emitted by rich
nations.
<p>
 The European Union had opposed inclusion of GMOs under
Kyoto, fearing they can threaten native species. Nations like
the United States or Argentina see benefits from GMOs as
faster-growing and disease resistant.
<p>
 "This was the last piece of this huge puzzle of Kyoto,"
Thelma Krug of Brazil, who led the talks, told Reuters. "Every
part was difficult." The rules on forest plantings were
formally adopted late on Tuesday by the December 1-12
conference.
<p>
 The forest deal was the last to define the mechanisms of
Kyoto. Remaining issues include a fund to help developing
nations adapt to the feared impact of global warming, ranging
from desertification to the melting of polar icecaps.
<p>
 President Bush  withdrew the United States, the biggest
polluter, from the Kyoto accord in 2001, and the protocol will
now only take effect if Russia backs it. Experts say Moscow is
unlikely to decide until after the March presidential election.
<p>
 All plants absorb carbon dioxide as they grow, making them
storage "sinks" for carbon dioxide, a non-toxic, odorless gas
blamed for blanketing the globe since the Industrial Revolution
and now mainly emitted by power plants, factories and cars.
<p>
 Environmentalists reckon that two trees, for instance,
would be needed to absorb the carbon dioxide produced per
passenger on a return airline flight from Milan to New York.
<p>
 Under Kyoto, rich nations will be allowed to store up to
one percent of their annual emissions of carbon dioxide in such
forest sinks. Kyoto seeks to cut rich countries' emissions of
carbon dioxide by 5.2 percent below 1990 levels by 2012.
<p>
 OPPOSITION TO GMOs
<p>
 Breaking the deadlock on GMOs, the text leaves it to each
country to "evaluate, in accordance with their national laws,
potential risks associated with the use of genetically modified
organisms."
<p>
 Greenpeace and the WWF environmental groups, who had
opposed GMOs in Kyoto, said the forest rules were "two steps
forward, one step back." They faulted failure to rule out
plantations of single species forests like eucalyptus, acacia
or pines.
<p>
 "At least the agreement shows that multilateralism works
despite the U.S. absence from Kyoto," said Jennifer Morgan, WWF
climate change director. "Kyoto is moving forward."
<p>
 Many environmentalists want to stifle emissions at source,
by shifting from coal and gas to solar or wind power, rather
than cleaning up emissions by trying to store carbon in
forests.
<p>
 Some developing nations, like China and Brazil, saw too
many rules on forests as an infringement of sovereignty. Canada
objected that rules, such as taking account of cultural and
religious sites in deciding where to plant, were too complex.
<p>
 The rules set in Tuesday's agreement even stipulate that
trees must be at least 6-feet 7-inches tall and their canopies
have to cover at least 10 percent of an area before they can
count as a forestry project.
<p>
 Kyoto will enter force only if it is agreed by nations
responsible for 55 percent of emissions of carbon dioxide in
rich states. It has reached 44 percent and needs Russia's 17
percent after the United States pulled out its 36 percent
share.
<p>
 Separately, the U.N. Environment Program, Greenpeace and
the WWF launched a new climate symbol -- the earth pictured as
a round candle with white wax dripping from a flame in the
Arctic.
