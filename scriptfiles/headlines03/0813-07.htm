<p>TIKRIT, Iraq&nbsp; - A U.S. soldier was killed and  another wounded Wednesday when their armored personnel carrier  drove over an improvised mine, the third deadly bomb attack on  U.S. forces in Iraq in 24 hours.
<P>
The soldiers from the 4th Infantry Division were traveling  in a convoy southeast of Saddam Hussein's hometown of Tikrit  when the mine was detonated, a U.S. spokesman said.<P>

</table></font>Tuesday, U.S. convoys were attacked by improvised  explosives in Ramadi, a restive Sunni Muslim town west of  Baghdad, and near the town of Taji just north of the capital.<P>
The Ramadi attack, which involved three synchronized bombs,  killed one 3rd Armored Division Soldier and wounded two. The  blast near Taji killed one 4th Infantry Division soldier and  wounded two, U.S. military statements said.<P>
Guerrilla attacks on U.S. forces in Iraq have killed at  least 59 American soldiers since Washington declared major  combat over on May 1. A military spokesman said Wednesday the  official toll was being raised to include soldiers who died of  their wounds after being evacuated from Iraq.<P>Officers said the 4th Infantry Division had killed two  Iraqis overnight in two separate gunbattles.<P>
In Rashidiya, just north of Baghdad, a man was shot dead  after he fired on U.S. troops from a van. Further north near  Balad, attackers fired on a U.S. reconnaissance team. Officers  said one assailant was killed and the rest fled.<P>
HUNTING SADDAM<P>
Washington says the attacks on U.S. troops are being  mounted by die-hard Saddam loyalists and some foreign militants  who have entered the country. Saddam himself remains on the run  despite an intense manhunt and a $25 million price on his head.<P>
The commander of the battalion leading the hunt for Saddam  loyalists and guerrillas around Tikrit said one of the fugitive  former president's bodyguards and a senior general had been  captured and were being questioned.<P>
In an interview, the U.S. governor of Iraq said American  troops were not defenseless against guerrilla attacks.<P>
"The American soldiers here are not sitting ducks. Force  protection is their first job and they do a very good job of  it. It doesn't mean you can eliminate casualties, you can't,"  Paul Bremer told ABC's "Good Morning America" show.<P>
ELECTIONS NEXT YEAR<P>
Bremer said that once the U.S.-appointed Iraqi Governing  Council set up a convention to draw up a new constitution for  Iraq, it would take six to eight months to complete its work  before general elections could be held.<P>
"That's the point at which the coalition's authority here  transitions to the Iraqis," Bremer said. "That doesn't mean  necessarily that's when the troops go home."<P>
In outspoken criticism of Washington's postwar policy in  Iraq, a senior U.N. official said the United States had bungled  its victory since toppling Saddam and prominent Iraqis had  warned of an uprising against the U.S. and British-led  coalition.<P>
"Many influential Iraqis who initially felt liberated from  a despised regime have assured me that they will take up arms  if the Coalition troops do not arrive at a result. Time is  short," Ghassan Salameh, adviser to the special U.N.  representative to Iraq Sergio Vieira de Mello, told the French  weekly Le Nouvel Observateur in an interview. He did not name  the Iraqis.<P>
Most of the violence so far directed at U.S. troops has  been in Sunni Muslim areas of Iraq. But thousands of people  staged an angry anti-U.S. demonstration in an impoverished  Shi'ite district of Baghdad Wednesday.<P>
Television pictures broadcast on Arab television channels  showed a U.S. helicopter flying low over a religious school in  the district and touching the school's flag with its wheel.  Furious protesters accused American troops of provocation.<P>
Fuel and power shortages sparked riots in mainly Shi'ite  southern Iraq at the weekend. The lack of electricity has  hampered efforts to boost oil exports from southern Iraq.
<P>
But the struggling Iraqi oil industry passed a milestone on  Wednesday when it began pumping crude through an export  pipeline to Turkey for the first time since the war. Officials  say oil revenue is key to funding Iraq's recovery.
