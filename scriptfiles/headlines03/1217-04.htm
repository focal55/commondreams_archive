<p>The Departments of Justice and Homeland Security are unlawfully using a national crime database to get local police departments to enforce civil immigration laws, lawyers who have assembled a federal class-action lawsuit against the practice said yesterday.</p>

<!--/endimage/-->The lawsuit, which they plan to file today in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, is the first to challenge the addition of civil information about thousands of noncitizens to the National Criminal Information Center database, which the F.B.I. uses to notify law enforcement agencies about people wanted for crimes.</p>
<P>
Immigration violations,  like staying in the country after a visa has expired,  can lead to deportation but are not criminal matters and have traditionally been the responsibility of federal agents.</p>
<P>
Congress has neither authorized nor required local police agencies to routinely arrest people for such violations, and a  bill that would do so has drawn unexpectedly strong opposition from many police departments, including those in New York, Los Angeles, Miami, Houston, Denver, Boston and Chicago. Advocates for immigrants argue that it would undermine local crime-fighting by making immigrants even more fearful of reporting crimes or helping with police investigations.</p>
<P>
The plaintiffs in the lawsuit — the National Council of La Raza, the New York Immigration Coalition, the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, the Latin American Workers Project and Unite — contend that Attorney General John Ashcroft, Homeland Security and the F.B.I. are misusing the database.</p>
<P>
"Ashcroft is not waiting on Congress, not waiting for the courts, but seizing power for himself under the guise of the war on terror," said Michael Wishnie, a lawyer for the plaintiffs and an associate professor at the New York University School of Law. "It will work a sea change in the relations between police and immigration communities across the nation, to the detriment of us all."</p>
<P>
Mr. Wishnie said he knew of at least one citizen who was mistakenly arrested in New York and held for weeks because of inaccurate information in the database. He said many people at risk of arrest by the local police because of immigration violations were workers with no criminal records.</p>
<P>
Government officials declined to answer questions about the lawsuit's claims, but Jorge Martinez, a Justice Department spokesman, said the department always cooperated with Homeland Security to make the crime database "the most effective tool it can be in our effort to protect the American people."</p>
<P>
The national crime database had its beginnings as a federal clearinghouse during Prohibition, but because of concerns about overzealous agents it has been restricted mainly to criminal justice records like rap sheets, criminal warrants and stolen property records, the plaintiffs said. It does not include civil records for matters like tax evasion or failure to pay child support, they noted.</p>
<P>
The only civil matters included in the database were specifically added by Congress, like orders of protection against domestic violence and stalking, added in 1994 as part of the Violence Against Women Act. Congress has resisted involving local police officials in immigration law, although a 1996 law allowed  them to enter special agreements  to do so with  training and supervision. Only Florida and Alabama signed up for the program.</p>
<P>
Thousands of local, state, federal and tribal law enforcement agencies consult the powerful database, at a rate of  3.7 million times a day, with an average response time of 0.12 seconds. It is  often consulted during routine traffic stops or  patrols.</p>
<P>
Officials say a unit of the Department of Homeland Security in Burlington, Vt.,  adds the immigration violator records and checks them for accuracy. But the plaintiffs say the poor quality of immigration records and the complexity of immigration law make mistakes inevitable.</p>
<P>
Last year, Mr. Ashcroft announced that the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel had concluded that state and local police officials have "inherent authority" to arrest and detain people who are in violation of immigration laws. He has refused to make public the legal documents used in the decision.</p>
<P>
When lawyers at the Migration Policy Institute, an advocacy and research organization,   questioned the legal basis for the change, Alberto R. Gonzales, counsel to President Bush, replied in a June 2002 letter that "only high-risk aliens who fit a terrorist profile" would be placed in the crime database.    "The administration is taking these measures in its effort to strengthen homeland security and combat terrorism," Mr. Gonzales added.</p>
<P>
In practice,  a senior immigration official said, more than 300,000 names of noncitizens subject to deportation orders have  been added  since June  2002. Some are felons, but many are noncitizens who had been ordered deported, usually because they failed to leave the country when their visas expired.</p>
<P>
Government officials have also announced their intention to add a category of civil immigration records to the database: foreign students who have not maintained enough credits, earned minimum grades or otherwise violated a condition of a  student visa, according to university records.</p>
<P>
Since the change, local police departments have been making immigration arrests when a routine check of the database confirms that someone is named as a violator. As of late this year, 5,092 noncitizens with immigration violations  had been arrested by local police departments through routine computer checks. The city with the most such arrests was Boston, with 631 since June,  followed by Los Angeles  with 456, San Diego with 403, San Francisco with 347 and New York  with 317.</p>
<P>
Some of the sharpest criticism of the practice has come from police officials. Chris Ferrell, deputy director of the Houston Police Department, said his department was "completely opposed" to including noncriminal information in the  database.    "You're going to cut down the ability to solve a lot of crimes," Mr. Ferrell said. "We need to be dealing with criminal law — that's what we do best."</p>
<P>
If someone is deemed a national security risk, he added, immigration law violations can be charged as crimes. He added: "With 10 million illegals in this country, hopefully we don't have 10 million who are going to be security risks or we are in a lot of trouble."</p>
