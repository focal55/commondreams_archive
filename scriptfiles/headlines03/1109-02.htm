<p>George Bush's official visit to Britain next week has been condemned as insensitive 
and ill-timed by some families of British troops killed in Iraq. <p>The relatives 
claimed that the continuing deaths of coalition soldiers in Iraq meant the President's 
state visit - the first by a US leader since the Coronation in 1953 - was inappropriate. 
<p>Reg Keys, whose son, Lance Corporal Thomas Keys, was one of the six Royal Military 
Police killed by a mob near Basra in June, said he had developed "a quite passionate 
hatred" of the US leader. <p>"I can't stand the man," said Mr Keys, 51, of Llanuwchllyn, 
north Wales. "He has a nerve coming over to this country after all the misery 
he's caused. I just can't understand why Bush was so keen to go to war against 
Iraq - it's almost as if he was hell bent on making a name for himself." <p>His 
criticisms - which follow angry criticism of Tony Blair's conduct over Iraq by 
the families of eight British war dead - were supported by the mother of one of 
the first Britons killed in the war, L/Cpl Shaun Brierley. <p>Christine Brierley, 
from Batley, West Yorkshire, said: "I think it's disgusting the way Bush is carrying 
on. It's a war that should never have been fought: then dragging England into 
it when it wasn't our war anyway. I just wish all the troops were back home - 
Americans and English. At the end of the day, what's going to be resolved?" <p>Next 
week President Bush and his wife Laura will stay at Buckingham Palace and be guests 
of honour at a state banquet. Anti-war groups plan protests in London, which have 
contributed to a decision by Downing Street to cancel plans for the President 
to address both Houses of Parliament. <p>The Metropolitan police has said it will 
ban the Stop the War Coalition from passing Downing Street and Parliament during 
its main march on Thursday 20 November - an event expected to attract about 60,000 
people - even though Parliament is not expected to be sitting. <p>Several relatives 
linked the visit to today's Remembrance Sunday services, where Britain's 53 war 
dead will be particularly commemorated. Lianne Seymour, whose husband Ian, a commando, 
was one of the first Britons killed, said: "Being invited here for a state visit 
isn't appropriate now. It really isn't a time to be showing off with glorious 
tributes, considering the political dimension. For me, and for many other people, 
this war isn't over. People are still losing their lives, be it Iraqi, British 
or American." <p>Gordon Evans, whose son Lance Bombardier Llywelyn Evans was killed 
in the same helicopter crash as Mrs Seymour's husband, said he wanted Mr Bush 
to meet British relatives face to face, to explain why he went to war. <p>"He's 
the puppet-master, isn't he? If he says do something, Tony Blair jumps. I'm angry 
with the Prime Minister, because he conned the nation into going to war in the 
first place." <p ALIGN="CENTER">&copy; 2003 Independent Digital (UK) Ltd<p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable --></font></td></tr>
