<p>RAMALLAH, West Bank   - Palestinian Prime Minister  Mahmoud Abbas submitted his resignation in a power struggle  with Yasser Arafat on Saturday, but it was not clear whether  the Palestinian president would accept.<P>

  </table></font>Just hours later, Israel hit a house in a missile strike on  Gaza City. Members of the Islamic militant movement Hamas said  its spiritual leader, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, was the apparent  target and was slightly wounded in the hand.<P>
Hamas members said the wheelchair-bound Yassin, a  co-founder of Hamas, received hospital treatment after the  attack on a densely populated area. Medics said about 15 people  were hurt.<P>
Abbas's departure could ruin a U.S.-backed plan for peace  with Israel and accelerate a slide back into violence after  Palestinian militants scrapped a truce and Israel stepped up a  campaign to assassinate their leaders.<P>
Arafat has been locked in a power struggle with Abbas, also  known as Abu Mazen, since appointing him under U.S. pressure in  April, but accepting the resignation could provoke Israel into  trying to expel him.<P>
"President Arafat is still studying Abu Mazen's  resignation," Palestinian national security adviser Jibril  al-Rajoub told reporters in the West Bank city of Ramallah.<P>
Abbas told a closed meeting with parliamentarians that he  had quit because of the power struggle and what he called a  lack of support from Israel and the United States in  peacemaking.<P>
Top negotiator Saeb Erekat, who is close to Arafat, said  Abbas would run a caretaker administration while Arafat  "studies the options."<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's office said Israel  would not accept day-to-day control of the Palestinian  Authority reverting to Arafat "or anyone doing his bidding."<P>
ATTEMPTS TO SIDELINE ARAFAT<P>
Israel has sought to sideline Arafat, saying he has incited  violence in the almost three-year-old uprising against Israeli  occupation in the Gaza Strip and West Bank, a charge he denies.<P>
"He is part of the problem and not the solution. He is a  direct cause that threatens stability in the area," an Israeli  Foreign Ministry statement said.<P>
Israel and the United States have backed Abbas as the main  hope for reforms and peacemaking while trying to isolate  Arafat.<P>
Israel has confined Arafat to his Ramallah headquarters for  most of the last 18 months. Abbas has traveled freely to meet  Sharon in Israel and President Bush in Washington, and attended  a summit with both men in Jordan.<P>
The "road map" plan, which envisages a Palestinian state in  the West Bank and Gaza Strip by 2005, was already in jeopardy  from the collapse of the cease-fire and paralyzing disputes  between the sides over who should take what step first.<P>
Israel accused Abbas of doing nothing to dismantle militant  groups sworn to destroying the Jewish state. It says the truce,  which they declared on June 29, fell apart because of a Hamas  suicide bombing on August 19 that killed 22 people in  Jerusalem.<P>
Palestinians said Israel's continued offensives against  militants sabotaged the truce and that blockades of West Bank  cities denied Abbas the credibility he needed to swoop on what  he has called "armed chaos" in Palestinian-administered areas.<P>
"Abbas's problems stem in part from Israel's continued  incursions and assassinations. In addition, the American  administration has done little to make Israel comply with the  road map," a senior Palestinian official told Reuters.<P>
Sharon's rightist coalition endorsed the peace plan only  after U.S. arm-twisting and remains opposed to ceding land  occupied in a 1967 war and settled by around 230,000 Jews.<P>
Abbas, 68, was appointed by Arafat under international  pressure to democratize the Palestinian Authority and end  almost three years of bloodshed.<P>
But Arafat, a 74-year-old ex-guerrilla leader and icon of  Palestinian nationalism since the 1960s, has since tussled with  Abbas over control of security forces needed to curb militants.<P>
Israel has killed 12 members of Hamas and four civilians in  helicopter gunship strikes since August 21 following a suicide  bombing which killed 22 people on an Israeli bus in Jerusalem.<P>
The latest Hamas victim died on Saturday of wounds received  in an earlier attack.
