<p>Leaders of one of the nation's top scientific organizations issued a 
new warning this week that human activities  --  most notably the greenhouse 
gas emissions from power plants and other industries  --  are warming Earth's 
climate at a faster rate than ever.
<P>The statement came from the 28-member council of the American Geophysical 
Union, whose 41,000 members include more than 10,000 experts on the planet's 
atmosphere and changing climate.

<!--/endimage/-->Although the vast majority of climate researchers are persuaded that the 
evidence, combined with computer models, show that global warming is real and 
dangerous, a few scientists still hold to the view that most of the changes 
are due more to natural cycles than human-induced causes.
<P>Lead scientist of the organization that circulated the statement is 
Robert Dickinson, professor of atmospheric sciences at the Georgia Institute 
of Technology. Another significant signer was John Christy, director of the 
University of Alabama's Earth Systems Science Center, a more cautious 
supporter of the idea that humans are causing climate change.
<P>In a phone interview, Christy said that while he supports the AGU 
declaration, and is convinced that human activities are the major cause of the 
global warming that has been measured, he is "still a strong critic of 
scientists who make catastrophic predictions of huge increases in global 
temperatures and tremendous rises in sea levels." 
<P>"It is scientifically inconceivable that after changing forests into 
cities, turning millions of acres into farmland, putting massive quantities of 
soot and dust into the atmosphere and sending quantities of greenhouse gases 
into the air, that the natural course of climate change hasn't been increased 
in the past century.''
<P>The AGU has issued milder statements on global change in the past, with 
more emphasis on theories about natural changes than on evidence of human-
caused rapid warming. But this statement declared: "Scientific evidence 
strongly indicates that natural influences cannot explain the rapid increase 
in global near-surface temperatures observed in the second half of the 20th 
century."
<P>Although they cannot yet predict the pace of change, the scientists did 
declare that since 1900 more than 80 percent of the atmosphere's heat-trapping 
carbon dioxide  --  the major greenhouse gas  --  has been caused by fossil 
fuel burning and changes in land use. They also said that levels of the gas 
"may be rising faster than at any time in Earth's history, except possibly 
following rare events like impacts from extraterrestrial objects."
<P>Without specifying numbers, the scientists did make these predictions: 
"Mid-continent warming will be greater than over the oceans, and there will be 
greater warming at higher latitudes. Some polar and glacial ice will melt, and 
the oceans will warm; both effects will contribute to higher sea levels. There 
will be considerable regional variations in the resulting impacts.
<P>"The unprecedented increases in greenhouse gas concentrations, together 
with other human influences on climate over the past century and those 
anticipated for the future, constitute a real basis for concern."
<P>In a related development, researchers at the Woods Hole Oceanographic 
Institute in Massachusetts are reporting that the tropical Atlantic Ocean is 
much saltier than it was 50 years ago, according to the Boston Globe.
<P>Scientists have assumed that global warming would speed evaporation in 
parts of the world's oceans but had no direct way of measuring the change. In 
the Woods Hole study, published in the journal Nature, scientists estimated 
that tropical evaporation rates increased 10 percent during the last 15 years. 
<P>As a purely scientific organization, the AGU took no stand on the 
politics of the international Kyoto Protocol limiting greenhouse gas emissions,
which President Bush has refused to sign.
<P>But the AGU did suggest that continuing scientific research "provides a 
basis for mitigating the harmful effects of global climate change through 
decreased human influences." Among the AGU's suggestions: slowing greenhouse 
gas emissions, improving land management practices and removing carbon from 
the atmosphere.
