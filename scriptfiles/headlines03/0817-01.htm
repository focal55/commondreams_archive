<p>BAGHDAD  - A major water pipeline in northern  Baghdad was breached on Sunday, flooding nearby streets and  cutting off the supply to parts of the Iraqi capital, after  what locals said was a bomb attack.
<P>
Sabotage of fuel pipelines, power cables and water pipes  has dogged attempts by the U.S.-led administration to rebuild  Iraq's decrepit oil industry and restore basic services.<P>

An explosion blew a gaping hole in a water main with a 5 1/4-foot (1.6-meter) diameter early Sunday, flooding streets and forcing engineers to cut off water to all of Baghdad. Witnesses said they saw two men on a motorbike leaving a bag of explosives under the pipe detonating it minutes later. (AP Photo/Manish Swarup) <br>

  </table></font>The main oil export pipeline to Turkey -- a crucial  economic lifeline for Iraq -- was shut down last week just days  after reopening, following technical hitches and a bomb attack  that sparked a fire.<P>
Paul Bremer, the U.S. governor of Iraq, said the closure of  that pipeline was costing the country $7 million a day.<P>
Washington blames die-hard supporters of deposed leader  Saddam Hussein and foreign militant groups for sabotage of  infrastructure and attacks on U.S. forces that have killed 60  American troops since the United States declared major combat  over on May 1.<P>
In the latest ambush in Baghdad, two U.S. soldiers were  shot and wounded as they left a restaurant on Saturday, the  military said. Both were in a stable condition in hospital.<P>
Iraqi police and security guards have also come under  attack from anti-U.S. fighters who accuse them of collaborating  with occupying troops.<P>
In the northern city of Mosul, the headquarters of an Iraqi  civilian security force was attacked with machinegun fire and a  rocket-propelled grenade on Saturday afternoon.<P>
One of the security guards was killed and four were  wounded, their colleagues told Reuters. The security force was  set up to help guard hospitals, schools and other facilities.<P>
Earlier on Saturday, Mosul's police chief was wounded in a  gun attack on a police convoy.<P>
SABOTAGE AND LOOTING<P>
Officials at the holed water pipeline in Baghdad said it  would take at least eight hours to repair the damage. Water  cascaded out of the breach in the elevated pipeline and poured  out onto the road below.<P>
Locals said they had been woken by a loud blast and had  seen a car speeding away from the scene.<P>
Thamir Ghadhban, U.S.-appointed de facto oil minister, told  a news conference in Baghdad on Saturday the fire at the oil  export pipeline to Turkey was caused by a bomb attack north of  the town of Baiji.<P>
"We believe at this stage it was an explosive device  planted on the pipeline," he said.<P>
A fire raged at the scene of the blast, sending thick black  smoke into the air, until it was brought under control on  Saturday. The pipeline had reopened on Wednesday for the first  time since the U.S.-led war that toppled Saddam.<P>
Looting and technical hitches have also hampered efforts to  get oil exports flowing fully from a country that has the  world's second-largest known reserves. The oil industry  suffered from a lack of investment in Saddam's final years.<P>
Oil exports from southern Iraq have been badly hit by  electricity blackouts caused by breakdowns of ramshackle  equipment and rampant looting of copper power cables.
<P>
Many Iraqis say U.S.-led forces have failed to restore  water, electricity and other basic services to prewar levels.  They also want to see evidence that the running of the country  will be handed over completely to Iraqis soon.
