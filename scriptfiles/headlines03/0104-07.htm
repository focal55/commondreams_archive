</table></font>Protesters stood where European conquerors shed blood more than 400 years ago. The prospect of a new war made them shiver this cold evening.<P>  "All we're doing now is to try not to go to war," said Peg McIntire, 92. When she joined the group, the chant 'Peg is here! Peg is here!' rose into the sky. "If we do end up at war we want to make sure we stick to U.N., humanitarian principles."<P>  For the past eight weeks, McIntire has marched alongside members of Grandparents for Peace, Veterans for Peace, Catholics for Peace, Mothers Against War, People United for Peace and Women for Peace. Some of the motorists who passed during those weeks shook their fists and shouted obscenities.<P>  McIntire said they always responded with a smile and a wave, riding a slogan she termed, "Peace is Patriotic."<P>  At Friday's rally, Sister Marie Condon, 73, of the Dominican Ministries, said the world would not be safer with Iraq dismantled. She said she is frustrated with America's harsh stance against the country, explaining that she tried to send Tylenol and syringes to help the people of Iraq against their oppressor. As she packaged the gifts, she had to weigh it carefully against U.S. sanctions. She said she was only allowed to send a 7-ounce care package to the people.<P>  Beside Condon was Sharell Holverson, 63, of St. Augustine. She carried a sign, one side reading, "No bombs on babies," the other, "War is terror."<P>  At Holverson's heel was Barkley, her dog who wore a sign reading "Pup for Peace."<P>  Even Barkley was in on the protest, she said.<P>  "He's 16 and never bitten anybody," Holverson said, adding that he has instead spent his life working with handicapped children.<P>  But most at the rally agreed a madman was sleeping in Iraq. Saddam Hussein needed to be ousted, they said, but not by dropping bombs and sending American troops into certain bloodshed in Baghdad.<P>  "He's a bad guy, but I think all of us believe we don't want to kill thousands of people just because of this one bad guy," said Bernie Welch, 63, of St. Augustine. "There have got to be peaceful solutions."<P>  Emanuel Bahn, 17, an exchange student from Germany studying at St. Augustine High School, said his country was split on the prospect of war. Carrying a sign asking, "Want war? Will you go?" he said, "I think this war is not because of any danger, but for getting oil and strengthening the countries."<P>  The protesters handed out fliers stressing their fears of war. "This is not a war against Iraq," Greg Pieper had written on one. "This is an unprovoked invasion of a comparatively defenseless sovereign country by the largest and most deadly military machine the world has ever known."<P>  The peaceful evening was set against a sunset over the city of St. Augustine. Had the protesters marched a few hundred years ago, they might have been ducking the thunder of cannons from the fort only a half-mile away.<P>  "When we begin on the road to unilateral strike on a nation of Iraq, or any other sovereign nation, I am as certain as tomorrow's sunrise; other nations will emulate our policies," wrote Philip J. Rappa. "Others will disregard international treaties and laws. There will be international anarchy."</p>
