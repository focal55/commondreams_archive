<p>ANKENY, Iowa, May 10 -- Rep. Dennis J. Kucinich (Ohio), campaigning in Iowa today for the Democratic presidential nomination, outlined how he would transform the nation's health care system into a government-run, single-payer program if elected.

<p>While several Democratic presidential candidates have detailed how they would help cover the nation's 41 million uninsured, Kucinich's "Medicare for All" proposal is far more interventionist because it would eliminate the role of private health insurers altogether. The plan, which largely mirrors the Canadian model that came under fire when President Bill Clinton tried to revise the U.S. health care system in the early 1990s, would cost $2.2 trillion a year once it was fully implemented in 2013.

<p>Addressing a group of painters union representatives here, Kucinich criticized the current health care system as "a market system" based solely on how much Americans could afford to spend.

<p>"It's long past time we should take the word 'profit' out of health care," he said, sparking applause from the audience. "How many people's lives in this country are shortened because they can't get access to health care?"

<p>Kucinich said he would help pay for the plan by imposing a 7.7 percent tax on public and private employers, which he said would represent slightly less than what these employers currently devote to covering health care expenses. That new tax would produce $917 billion in revenue. Kucinich would also eliminate $245 billion in tax deductions that employers currently take. He would draw on $1 trillion in federal, state and local revenue that now pays for the government's Medicare system.

<p>The government would save money by making bulk purchases of prescription drugs, Kucinich said, something that Canada has done for years. American pharmaceutical companies have fiercely opposed such an approach, however, arguing that in driving down costs the government would siphon away funds needed for innovative research.

<p>Within three years, Kucinich's program would cover all American children. Seniors would come under the system in 2008. And in a decade, all Americans would be enrolled.

<p>While the program has little chance of becoming law, it reflects Kucinich's efforts to inject more progressive policies into his party's presidential race. Former House minority leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.), by contrast, introduced a plan in April that would provide federal tax credits to private employers helping cover their workers' health care insurance premiums. The proposal would be financed by rolling back the trillion-dollar tax cut President Bush successfully championed in the previous Congress. Business groups and many of Gephardt's Democratic rivals criticized the plan as unrealistic.

<p>Several union officials at the meeting said that, although they need to learn more about Kucinich's proposal, they thought he was headed in the right direction.
