<p>SYDNEY   - Former U.N. arms inspector Richard  Butler said Tuesday that Washington was promoting "shocking  double standards" in considering taking unilateral military  action to rid Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction.<p>

		</font>Butler, who led U.N. inspection teams in Iraq until Baghdad  <b>kicked them out in 1998</b><i> (Common Dreams Editor's note: This is not true. See: <a href="http://www.fair.org/extra/0210/inspectors.html" target="_new">http://www.fair.org/extra/0210/inspectors.html</a>)</i>, said Iraqi President Saddam Hussein  undoubtedly possessed weapons of mass destruction, and was  trying to "cheat" his way again out of the latest U.N. demand  to disarm.

		<p>



		But a U.S. attack, without United Nations backing, and  without any effort to curb the possession of weapons of mass  destruction globally, would be a contravention of international  law and sharpen the divide between Arabs and the West.<p>



		"The spectacle of the United States, armed with its weapons  of mass destruction, acting without Security Council authority  to invade a country in the heartland of Arabia and, if  necessary, use its weapons of mass destruction to win that  battle, is something that will so deeply violate any notion of  fairness in this world that I strongly suspect it could set  loose forces that we would deeply live to regret," Butler said.<p>



		Butler's successor as the chief U.N. weapons inspector in  Iraq, Hans Blix, reported Monday to the 15-member Security  Council that Baghdad had only reluctantly complied with its  latest demand to disarm.<p>



		Washington is pressing the United Nations to take firm  action but says it is prepared to go it alone and has amassed a  considerable military force in the region.<p>



		Butler, addressing a conservative Australian think-tank,  The Sydney Institute, said the stated U.S. motive -- to rid  Iraq of weapons of mass destruction -- lacked credibility  because of Washington's failure to deal with others on the same  terms.<p>



		Countries such as Syria are suspected of possessing  chemical or biological warfare capabilities, he said.<p>



		U.S. allies Israel, Pakistan and India have nuclear  arsenals but have not signed the nuclear Non-Proliferation  Treaty.<p>



		The United States and other permanent Security Council  members were themselves the possessors of the world's largest  quantities of nuclear weapons, he said.<p>



		"Why are they permitting the persistence of such shocking  double standards?" Butler said.<p>



		He said that, instead of beating the drums of war, the  United States should propose an international mechanism --  similar to the Security Council -- to enforce the application  of the three main conventions controlling the proliferation of  nuclear, chemical and biological weaponry.<p>



		It should also take the lead by reducing its own  stockpiles.<p>



		"I hope we don't have to await the train wreck before we  decide to change history," Butler said.
