<p>STOUGHTON, Wis. -- Main Street in this town of
12,500 near Madison, Wisconsin, looks like thousands of others,
except perhaps for the Norwegian flags lining the road, a
tribute to the immigrants who settled the area.
<p>There's an antiques shop, a little drug store, a movie
theater, and down the road, there's a Wal-Mart.

Wal-Mart plans to open more than 200 supercenters in the United States this year. For the first time in Wal-Mart's history, U.S. supercenters in 2003 will outnumber the smaller discount stores that do not carry a full line of groceries.

</table></font>People around here like the small-town feel, but they also
like their Wal-Mart -- they just don't want to see it getting
any bigger. So they're putting up a fierce fight against
Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s proposal to build a new
supercenter on local farmland.

<p>"There's a Wal-Mart in town now and it's very well liked,
but it's a little one," said Larry Peterson, who helped
organize local opposition to the proposed supercenter.

<p>"The proposal that Wal-Mart is making is one of these
megastores. It would change us from a local, self-sufficient
town to a regional shopping hub," he said.

<p>Wal-Mart, the world's biggest company, is banking on
supercenters to drive domestic revenue and profit growth over
the next few years. The stores, some of them as large as four
football fields, carry a full line of groceries along with
clothing and other goods usually found in its aisles.

<p>The retailer dominates rural and suburban markets, but as
it bumps up against more urban areas -- with plans for
increasingly large stores -- resistance is mounting.

<p>Wal-Mart plans to open more than 200 supercenters in the
United States this year. For the first time in Wal-Mart's
history, U.S. supercenters in 2003 will outnumber the smaller
discount stores that do not carry a full line of groceries.

<p>The retailer opened its first supercenter in 1988, and is
now the biggest grocery seller in the world. The idea is,
customers may only visit a discount store to stock up on
diapers or detergent a couple of times a month, but they'll
need bread or milk twice a week.

<p>"UFF-DA WAL-MART"

<p>Peterson's anti-supercenter group calls itself "Uff-da
Wal-Mart," using a Norwegian expression of displeasure to
reflect the community's roots. A city council hearing earlier
this week on an ordinance that would block large retail
development for six months drew a standing-room-only crowd,
nearly all of them opposed to large-scale new development.

<p>"People live in the town because of its tone and its
culture and its history," Peterson said. "They don't live here
because they want rapid access to lots of shopping malls."

<p>Wal-Mart's Stoughton proposal calls for a 180,000-square-
foot store on farmland on the outskirts of town, dwarfing the
40,000-square-foot existing store. Residents would rather see
Wal-Mart expand at its current location, or perhaps open a
small grocery store on the other side of town.

<p>Stoughton isn't alone in its Wal-Mart opposition.

<p>Dallas, Texas, recently denied Wal-Mart's request to build
a massive supercenter with retail floors on top of a parking
structure. New Orleans also turned down a proposal for a
supercenter, and dozens of other communities are trying to
muster enough supporters to block new Wal-Mart developments.

<p>For its part, Wal-Mart says it wants to work with
communities, and has enough expansion opportunities that it
should not have to force its way into an unwilling area.

<p>It regularly modifies its stores to meet local tastes,
whether it means adding stables in Pennsylvania's Amish
country, where shoppers often arrive by horse and cart, or
extra-spicy salsa in communities with large Hispanic
populations.
<p>In some places, Wal-Mart has found residents much more
amenable than the local politicians.
<p>
In California, for example, where Wal-Mart plans to open
dozens of supercenters in the next few years, some local
governments have passed ordinances blocking megastores that
derive more than 25 percent of their revenues from food sales.
<p>
But in at least two cases, Wal-Mart has rallied sufficient
resident support to override the ordinances.
<p>
GOING VERTICAL
<p>
The next hurdle for Wal-Mart is how to build stores in
densely populated urban areas. The retailer has one store on
the edge of Philadelphia and several around Los Angeles, but
None in Chicago or Manhattan.
<p>
"As they start to move more and more into urban areas, it's
a different real estate game. You have to start thinking about
multilevel stores, which are less convenient to consumers,"
said Michael Collins, partner with consulting firm Bain & Co.
<p>
The answer may lie underneath a soccer stadium in Dalian,
China, where Wal-Mart has built a multilevel store. Wal-Mart
has also opened a three-level store in the Baldwin Hills
neighborhood of Los Angeles this year, so the retailer is
clearly considering that model for U.S. expansion.
<p>
But going vertical can be problematic. Wal-Mart's
supercenters work because customers like the convenience of
stopping in for basic grocery items, but are often tempted to
also pick up higher-margin items like clothing.
<p>
If groceries are on the ground floor, how many customers
would venture upstairs to check out the more profitable
merchandise? And if the groceries are on a higher floor, will
it still be convenient enough to lure customers away from other
grocery stores?
<p>
"People hate to go up," said Thom McKay, a vice president
with architecture and consulting firm RTKL. "They may go up one
level if they know there's food there. They're more likely to
go down than up, especially if they can see down."
<p>
Wal-Mart's three-level store in Los Angeles has shopping
cart escalators so people can bring their fully-loaded carts
between floors, but McKay said the novelty quickly wears off,
and the escalators can become an annoyance rather than a
convenience.
<p>
The second option is going small -- at least by Wal-Mart
standards. The retailer runs about 100 Neighborhood Market
grocery stores that include pharmacies and photo finishing
booths, but little in the way of general merchandise.
<p>
Those stores could easily find their way into major urban
areas, but Wal-Mart plans only a handful of new ones this year,
in part because it doesn't have enough store managers to open
as many as it would like. The retailer said it was happy with
the smaller stores, but supercenters are the priority for now.
