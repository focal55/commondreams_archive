</table>An all-star band that includes activist musicians Billy Bragg, Audioslave guitarist Tom Morello and Lester Chambers of the Chambers Brothers will perform in Madison on Nov. 7 at the Orpheum Theatre at the National Conference on Media Reform.
<p>That concert is the first stop on a 13-date &#034;Tell Us the Truth Tour&#034; aimed at raising awareness on fair trade and media consolidation issues facing the country, as well as registering voters for next year&#039;s presidential election.
<p>The tour&#039;s message echoes the conference&#039;s stated goals of improving and diversifying American media, and the musicians involved will take part in panels and other events over three days.
<p>&#034;When presidents and politicians lie, it is the job of the press to expose and challenge those lies,&#034; said Morello, former guitarist for the hard rock band Rage Against the Machine, who will be performing under the alias The Nightwatchman.
<p>&#034;When the press fails, the lies become laws. The point of the Tell Us the Truth Tour is to help others make these connections, and to show them that activism can change the policies of the country.&#034;
<p>Several other nationally known musicians, including Mike D. of the Beastie Boys, Mike Mills of R.E.M. and Ian MacKaye of Fugazi will also attend the Madison conference. But it is unconfirmed whether they will perform in the all-star concert as well.

<p>Steve Earle is joining the Tell Us the Truth Tour in Indianapolis on Nov. 12, but will not perform at the Madison show. 

<p>Actress Janeane Garofalo will join the tour on Nov. 21 and will emcee shows until the final date in Washington, D.C., on Nov. 24, during which the artists will join with other activists to lobby against Federal Communications Commission efforts to allow for greater media concentration. 

<p>Tell Us the Truth has also partnered with Rock the Vote to register voters along the tour. Funds raised by the tour will support future partnerships between artists and activists, including future Tell Us the Truth tours. 

<p>"As artists, all we can offer is energy and a different perspective," Bragg said. "We want to inspire people to get engaged, to feel again as if they can make a difference. The next election is not a foregone conclusion." 

<p><i>The concert in Madison will be open to attendees of the conference only. For more information on the conference, as well as registration information, visit <a href="http://www.mediareform.net" target="_new">www.mediareform.net</a>. </i>
