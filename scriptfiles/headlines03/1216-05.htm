<p>VATICAN CITY  - Pope John Paul took a swipe at the  United States and its allies Tuesday for invading Iraq without  U.N. approval, suggesting they had succumbed to the temptation  to use the law of force instead of the force of law.<p> 
			
							In his World Day of Peace message, issued three days after  the capture of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, he also appealed to  democracies fighting terrorism to uphold the principles of  international law and fundamental human rights.<p>

  <!--/endimage/-->In the message, which is sent to leaders of nations and  world organizations, the 83-year-old pope also said the U.N.  needed reform and the international community had to heal the  underlying social injustices that can fuel terrorism.<p> 
			
							In the 13-page message he appealed to terrorists, telling  them that violence was not only unacceptable but compromises  "the very cause for which you are fighting."<p> 
			
							The message, called "An Ever-Timely Commitment: Teaching  Peace," was largely dedicated to the theme of international law  and its role in resolving conflicts between states.<p> 
			
							Without mentioning any country by name, he recalled that  the U.N. Charter "confirms the natural right to legitimate  defense, to be exercised in specific ways and in the context of  the United Nations."<p> 
			
							He also recalled that the U.N. Security Council had  responsibility for collective security with "competence and  responsibility for the preservation of peace, with power of  decision and ample discretion."<p> 
			
							NOT A JUST WAR<p> 
			
							The Vatican did not consider the war in Iraq "a just war"  because it was not backed by the United Nations and because the  Vatican believed more negotiations were necessary to avoid it.<p> 
			
							U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan warned Washington a week  before the war started that without Security Council backing, a  war to disarm Iraq would violate the world body's charter.<p> 
			
							The pope said it was necessary for states to avoid the  "temptation to appeal to the law of force rather than to the  force of law."<p> 
			
							He also said he realized that international law was "hard  pressed" today because of the presence of terrorist groups  which could not be considered states in the traditional sense  of law.<p> 
			
							"The scourge of terrorism has become more virulent in  recent years and has produced brutal massacres which have in  turn put even greater obstacles in the way of dialogue and  negotiation ..." he wrote.<p> 
			
							Force had to be accompanied by what he called "a courageous  and lucid analysis of the reasons behind terrorist attacks."<p> 
			
							The fight against terrorism had to aim at "eliminating the  underlying causes of situations of injustice which frequently  drive people to more desperate and violent acts..."<p> 
			
							Combating terrorism "cannot justify a renunciation of the  principles of the rule of law," he wrote, adding that political  decisions must take into consideration fundamental human  rights.<p> 
			
							Civil rights groups have criticized new anti-terrorism laws  enacted after September 11, 2001 that give the U.S. government  the power to tap telephones, track Internet usage and cell  phones, share intelligence information and detain immigrants.
