<p>WASHINGTON  - U.S. anti-war activists launched a national advertising campaign on Wednesday urging Congress to withhold new funds for Iraq unless the White House agrees to transfer authority to the United Nations.
<p>Tom Andrews, a former Democratic representative from Maine and director of the <a href="http://www.winwithoutwarus.org/" target="_new">Win Without War</a> coalition group, said the television and print advertisements were designed to force lawmakers to address public unease over the U.S. role in Iraq.

<p>"Our base of support as a coalition is very angry and very eager to be active in turning this around. And clearly public opinion has turned against this invasion and occupation," Andrews said in an interview.
<p>"The people are very receptive to this message in opposition to this (Iraq) policy. That translates into a political momentum that Congress needs to pay attention to."

<p>U.S. President George W. Bush last week sent Congress a request for $87 billion to fund military operations and reconstruction efforts in Iraq. More than 60 percent of Americans oppose the plan, according to a recent poll.
<p>Win Without War's $200,000 advertising campaign, unveiled at a National Press Club news conference, uses the White House funding request as a hook to demand a transfer of power in Iraq and the dismissal of U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld.

<p>One print advertisement features a photo of Larry Syverson, a Virginia resident with three sons in the U.S. military, next to the quote: "Donald Rumsfeld betrayed my sons and our nation. It's time for him to go."

<p>Win Without War accuses Rumsfeld of misleading the public about the reasons for launching war on Iraq, and mismanaging its occupation. "He was the chief architect and it is his house of cards that is tumbling today," the ad reads.
