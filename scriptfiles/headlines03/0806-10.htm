<p>HIROSHIMA, Japan   - Hiroshima's mayor lashed out at the United States' nuclear weapons policy during ceremonies marking the 58th anniversary of the city's atomic bombing, which caused the deaths of over 230,000 people.
<p>
 
Mayor Tadatoshi Akiba said the United States worshipped nuclear weapons as &quot;God&quot; and blamed it for jeopardizing the global nuclear non-proliferation regime.

</table></font>&quot;The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the central international agreement guiding the elimination of nuclear weapons, is on the verge of collapse,&quot; Akiba said Wednesday in an address to some 40,000 people.
 
<p>
 &quot;The chief cause is US nuclear policy that, by openly declaring the possibility of a pre-emptive nuclear first strike and calling for resumed research into mini-nukes and other so-called 'useable nuclear weapons,' appears to worship nuclear weapons as God,&quot; he said.
 
<p>
 The mayor also slammed as unjust the US-led war on Iraq, which he blamed for killing innocent civilians. &quot;The weapons of mass destruction that served as the excuse for the war have yet to be found,&quot; he said.
 
<p>
 Akiba strongly urged US President George W. Bush  and North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il to personally visit Hiroshima and &quot;confront the reality of nuclear war&quot;.
 
<p>
 As the clock clicked onto 8:15 am (2315 GMT Tuesday), the exact time the United States dropped the bomb on August 6, 1945, those at the ceremony at Hiroshima's Peace Memorial Park bowed their heads for a minute's silence in memory of the victims of the attack.
 
<p>
 During the 45-minute ceremony, officials added 5,050 names to the register of victims who died immediately or from the after-effects of radiation exposure in the bombing, bringing the total toll to 231,920, an official said.
 
<p>
 The Hiroshima bombing was followed by the dropping of a second atomic bomb on the city of Nagasaki on August 9, 1945, which killed another estimated 74,000 people.
 
<p>
 Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi told the service that Japan would stick by its pacifist constitution and its non-nuclear principles because the tragedies of Hiroshima and Nagasaki &quot;can never be repeated.&quot;
 
<p>
 This year's ceremony came ahead of six-nation talks over North Korea's nuclear weapons development program, which Pyongyang agreed to last week.
 
<p>
 Koizumi told reporters after the ceremony that North Korea's abduction of Japanese nationals would be a high priority at the talks.
 
<p>
 &quot;At the six-nation talks, obviously, nuclear weapons will be the focus, but for Japan, the abduction issue is just as important,&quot; he said.
 
<p>
 
&quot;We will naturally have close cooperation with the United States and South Korea, but we must make efforts to have China and Russia understand our position as well,&quot; he said.
 
<p>
 
Last week, North Korea said it would accept six-way talks to include North and South Korea, Russia, Japan, China and the United States to end the nuclear crisis that began in October last year.
 
<p>
 Washington had accused the Stalinist state of reneging on a 1994 bilateral nuclear freeze accord by running a clandestine nuclear program based on enriched uranium.
