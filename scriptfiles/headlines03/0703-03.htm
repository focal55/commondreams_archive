<p>WASHINGTON - The nation's unemployment rate shot up to 6.4
percent in June, the highest level in more than nine years, in an
economic slump that has added nearly a million people to jobless
rolls in the past three months.

</table>Businesses slashed 30,000 jobs in June for the fifth straight
month, with cuts heavily concentrated in the nation's factories,
the Labor Department reported Thursday.<p>
The 0.3 percentage point increase from May's 6.1 percent rate
was the largest month-to-month rise since the Sept. 11, 2001 terror
attacks. That surprised analysts, who predicted a smaller rise to
6.2 percent. The last time the overall rate was higher was in March
1994.<p>
The poor economy and swelling unemployment could pose problems
for President Bush next year in his re-election bid. But tax cuts
recently passed by the Republican-controlled Congress are starting
to take effect and will bolster job prospects, the administration
has argued.<p>
"Its effects will be felt by America's working families,
seniors and small business owners later this month, as they begin
receiving tax rebates and larger paychecks," said Labor Secretary
Elaine Chao. "As this stimulus builds momentum, we expect to see
more new jobs created and more out of work Americans receiving a
paycheck again."<p>
At the White House, press secretary Ari Fleischer said that
while the economy experienced a "short and shallow recession, we
are also an economy that is having a slow recovery."<p>
Democrats are determined to make the economy a big issue in next
year's elections. "The verdict is in: The Republicans'
multi-trillion dollar failed economic policy is one the greatest
disasters for working Americans in a decade," said Sen. Jon
Corzine, D-N.J., chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee.<p>
While recent economic indicators point to an economy struggling
toward recovery, the latest report demonstrated that America's job
market was still very much in a state of recession last month.<p>
"It's pretty bad, there's no denying that," said Ken Mayland,
president of ClearView Economics.<p>
Since March, unemployment has increased by 913,000. Two million
people were unemployed for 27 weeks or more last month, an increase
of 410,000 since the start of the year.<p>
Another factor behind the increase in the overall civilian
unemployment rate was the increase in the number of people seeking
work in June. Optimism about an economy rebound led over 600,000
people to resume their search for work.<p>
Because the government calculates the overall unemployment rate
based on a survey of American households, and because the
lackluster economy wasn't producing enough jobs to accommodate an
increasing number of jobseekers, that rate increased significantly.<p>
"That suggests a combination of better prospects, getting the
war behind us, a better stock market -- just more enthusiasm about
economic prospects -- is causing people to re-enter the labor
force," Mayland said, adding that the jobless rate should start to
stabilize.<p>
"It would be my bet that we're at the high-water mark," he
said.<p>
Manufacturing led in payroll cuts last month, with 56,000 jobs
lost. Since July 2000, the nation's factories have cut 2.6 million
jobs.<p>
That sector has been the weakest link in the economy's ability
to get back to full speed. Slack demand at home and abroad and
competition from a flood of imports have throttled back production.<p>
Construction jobs helped offset manufacturing losses somewhat
last month, with the fourth straight gain in hiring. Construction
has added 101,000 jobs since February, reflecting strength in
residential building.<p>
The mortgage boom, stoked by record low rates, has been the
bright spot in the dismal economy. People are buying new homes and
refinancing their old mortgages. The extra cash from refinancing
combined with solid home-value appreciation have kept consumer
spending afloat.<p>
Other hiring gains last month were in health care, leisure and
hospitality and temporary employment services.<p>
In a separate report, new claims for jobless benefits rose last
week to 430,000, an increase of a seasonally adjusted 21,000 from
the previous week's revised 409,000 claims.<p>
The more stable, four-week moving average of claims, which
smooths out weekly fluctuations, dropped to 425,000. That was the
lowest level since April 5.
