<p>RICHMOND, CALIFORNIA -- After a week that included an earthquake, a fire, and a scathing report on price gauging, the Chevron Texaco Richmond Refinery took another hit Tuesday evening  250 anti-globalization and anti-war protestors marching under a sign that read, "we all pass gas, but we won't let the gas pass."</p>

<p>Like the previous assaults the march failed to interrupt business at the largest refinery on the West Coast. The refinery closed most gates to everyone, including employees, at 4:30 p.m. As of deadline the protest had led to no arrests.</p>

<p>Patrick Reinsborough, a spokesman for <a href="http://www.actagainstwar.org/" target="_new">Direct Action to Stop the War</a>, said the rally aimed to “help Americans connect the war with corporate globalization and Chevron. If they knew they were paying $1,000 a piece for the occupation, they’d wonder what they get for it. Chevron gets record profits.”</p>

<p>His group, which organized the event, previously brought thousands of people into San Francisco to halt business March 20, the day after the United States invaded Iraq.</p>

<p>Richmond police were determined to prevent a similar shut down. Dozens of local officers accompanied the march, assisted by officers from Kensington, Antioch, and San Pedro. A busload of deputies from the Contra Costa Sheriff’s Department was on hand, including several officers with vests full of tear gas canisters.</p>

<p>In addition California highway patrol watched the scene from a helicopter and a plane as well as motorcycles and at least six patrol cars.  Sergeant Venus Johnson of the Richmond police said, “We’ve been negotiating and have contingency plans. We’ll extend as much latitude as necessary. But, they can’t go on your property and start destroying things, throwing things. Then, you get into criminal law.”</p>

<p>Before the march, Chevron Texaco spokesperson Dean O’Hare said even the protestors needed the company to remain open. “I’m sure all of them have driven their cars.”</p>

<p>Some did come by car. Others arrived in shuttles from BART. And, about 25 came by bicycle.</p>

<p>Oil researcher Gopal Dayaneni said that missed the point. “Before the war, Chevron assured us they were not making any moves for Iraqi oil. But, they were the first American company to get a contract to move the oil.” He said two or three Chevron tankers have left Iraq carrying millions of  barrels of oil, largely destined for the West Coast. As for the World Trade Organization connection, Dayaneni said, “There are two ways to open markets like Iraq. One is through WTO rules. The other is through war.”</p>

<p>The trade organization is meeting in Cancun, Mexico this weekend to work on a new round of trade treaties.</p>

<p>More than half the Arab oil-producing states are not in the WTO. Under Sadam Hussein, Iraq refused to join the free trade body.</p>

<p>Three miles from the refinery, among the abandoned buildings of downtown Richmond, people were unaware of the action. No one interviewed had heard of the rally. The only posters visible were weathered ads for a socialist meeting August 2nd.</p>

<p>Bill, who didn’t give his last name, was reading the New York Times while working at a Chevron station down town. “I leave protests to the rich people who have opinions,” he said. “I work day to day.”</p>
