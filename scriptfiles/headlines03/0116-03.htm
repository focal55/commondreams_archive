<p> Marching side-by-side in Saturday's anti-war rally in San Francisco: 
pro-Palestinian supporters. Earth-loving environmentalists.
<P>And Joe Six-Pack?
<P>The march down Market Street and to the Civic Center will include 
representatives of more than 50 Bay Area labor unions -- twice as many as 
attended October's big anti-war demonstration along the city's main drag.
<P>Labor's support is a boon to peace activists, who know that the image of 
longshoremen and nurses speaking out against a possible war in Iraq puts a 
"real people" face on their message. It would also run counter to the Vietnam-
era conflict of hard hat vs. hippie, which splintered the progressive 
community's opposition to the war and reflected a larger divide in the country.
<P>Plus, given the potential of reaching the nation's 14 million union members 
-- including an estimated 558,000 in the Bay Area -- anti-war activists could 
broaden their support.
<P>"It definitely helps to mainstream the movement," said Jason Mark, an 
organizer with San Francisco-based Global Exchange, one of the nation's 
biggest anti-war groups.
<P><b>THE USUAL SUSPECTS'</b>
<P>"It shows people that it's not just a bunch of people in dreadlocks out 
there," Mark said. "Blue-collar people are seen as having a lot of salt-of-the-
earth wisdom and legitimacy. They're not the usual suspects when it comes to 
peace and justice issues."
<P>Saturday's rallies in San Francisco, Washington, D.C., and other cities 
come a week after 100 labor leaders from around the country -- including 
several from the Bay Area -- met in Chicago to plan how to sway their 
memberships toward opposing a possible war with Iraq and assume a bigger role 
in the anti-war effort.
<P>So labor union banners will be a highly visible presence at Saturday's 
march and rally afterward at the Civic Center. The event is expected to draw 
at least as many people as attended the Oct. 26 rally, which police estimated 
at 42,000 and organizers placed at 80,000.
<P>Not everyone is convinced that labor's high-profile appearance will make 
any difference when it comes to influencing the Bush administration's policy 
toward Iraq.
<P>"No demonstration in San Francisco is going to have the slightest amount of 
impact on the administration's policy," said Hoover Institution research 
fellow Joseph McNamara. As for labor's influence on people debating their own 
position on Iraq, McNamara said, "It all depends. If the person watching this 
on television is anti-union, then it won't matter much."
<P><b>POLICY ISSUE</b>
<P>Some rank-and-file union members wonder if their union should take any 
position in what they perceive as a foreign policy issue.
<P>In an October poll of its 85,000 Northern California members, the Service 
Employees International Union found that a little over half the respondents 
questioned whether the union should take a position on the war.
<P>"It told us that we haven't done a good enough job explaining to people how 
this war would affect them," said SEIU Local 250 president Sal Roselli, whose 
leadership endorsed Saturday's rally and passed a resolution opposing 
unilateral U.S. action against Iraq. This week, the union's staff met to plan 
how to discuss a war's implications with the membership.
<P><b>CONCERNS</b>
<P>In general, union leaders are urging their memberships to oppose a possible 
war, for reasons having to do largely with domestic concerns.
<P>If the war costs the federal government $200 billion, the figure cited in 
some administration estimates, that could mean less federal spending on 
unemployment benefits, health care and other areas that affect working-class 
families, said Dave Welsh, a retired Bay Area letter carrier who is working 
with labor groups at Saturday's rally on behalf of International ANSWER, the 
group coordinating protests on both coasts.
<P>"Plus, every union family knows somebody in the military," said Bob 
Muehlenkamp, a former organizing director of the Teamsters union who organized 
U.S. Labor Against the War, the meeting of 100 union representatives last 
Saturday in Chicago. "Their children will be the ones fighting this war."
<P>Some blue-collar workers, however, will be tough to recruit.
<P>"The people I worked with are pretty much behind George Bush," said Bob 
Stine, who retired as lead mechanic for United Airlines in December and is now 
a spokesman for Local Lodge 1781 of the International Airline Mechanics, with 
1,300 Bay Area members. The local in Burlingame has not taken an official 
position on the war.
<P>Stine added, however, that many mechanics are concerned that a war would 
further depress the commercial airline industry, which would affect their jobs.
<P><b>POLITICS</b>
<P>Some critics say labor's new high-profile position on Iraq is little more 
than anti-Bush politics at work.
<P>"While there are a lot of sincere feelings among the unions, there's a 
partisan aspect to this, too," said the Hoover Institution's McNamara. "It's 
no secret that most unions strongly support Democrats."
<P>Labor leaders agree that Bush -- who had practically no labor support 
during his presidential campaign -- didn't make any blue-collar friends when 
he invoked the federal Taft-Hartley Act in October to reopen West Coast ports 
where longshore workers were locked out. Union leaders said the move gave port 
operators leverage in their dispute.
<P>Still, Welsh and others say union opposition is about the war, not politics 
-- even though some rank-and-file will march Saturday behind a banner reading, 
"Stop Bush's war on working people here and abroad."
<P>To Barbara Williams, opposing the war is a health care issue. The Santa 
Cruz nurse and California Nurses Association leader plans to march Saturday to 
show how the war would put an additional stress on the nation's hospitals.
<P>"If there's retaliation, (our hospitals) are totally unprepared to deal 
with that," said Williams, 57, who hasn't protested a military action since 
the Vietnam War. "I know. I work in the emergency room every day."</p>
