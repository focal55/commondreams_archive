<p>ATLANTA  - The widow of Martin Luther King
Jr. spoke out on Tuesday against a possible U.S.-led war on Iraq,
evoking the assassinated U.S. civil rights leader's message of
nonviolence.<P> &quot;I believe that more people are thinking about him and
yearning to hear his voice because of concerns about terrorism
and the buildup of war,&quot; Coretta Scott King told Reuters.<P> King said there were alternative means to possible war with
Iraq, such as negotiation.<P> &quot;When you use war as a way of settling disputes, you only
cause more war,&quot; she said in an interview given to highlight the
observance of the King holiday on Monday. &quot;In the long run, the
only way to have peace is to use peaceful means.&quot;<P> Martin Luther King Jr. advocated passive resistance to racial
segregation and co-founded the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference as a base for nonviolent marches and civil rights
demonstrations for U.S. blacks. He was killed in April 1968.<P> Coretta Scott King said one of the reasons her husband was
assassinated was because of his opposition to the Vietnam War.
She said King initially feared that if he took a stand against
that war, fund-raising for his group would dry up.<P> But she said that after King was awarded the Nobel Peace
Prize in 1964, he felt compelled to work to bring about
international peace.<P> &quot;He proved to be right,&quot; she said. After his anti-Vietnam War
speech in 1967, &quot;the nation within a year's time reversed itself
on Vietnam and Martin lived to know that his courageous statement
was not in vain.&quot;</p>
