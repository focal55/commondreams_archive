<p>LONDON  - Deaths and new cases of HIV/AIDS reached  new highs in 2003 and are set to rise further as the epidemic  keeps a stranglehold on sub-Saharan Africa and advances across  Eastern Europe and Central Asia.<p> 
			
							New global estimates released Tuesday based on improved  data show about 40 million people worldwide are living with  HIV/AIDS, including an estimated 2.5 million children under 15  years old. About five million people were infected in 2003 and  more than three million died.<p> 
			
							"The AIDS epidemic continues to expand -- we haven't  reached the limit yet," said Dr. Peter Piot, head of the Joint  United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS).<p> 
			
							"More people have become infected this year than ever  before and more people have died from AIDS than ever before,"  he told Reuters. "It is the first cause of death in Africa and  the fourth cause of death worldwide."<p> 
			
							BURDEN OF EPIDEMIC<p> 
			
							Sub-Saharan Africa remains the worst affected region of the  world with about 3.2 million new infections and 2.3 million  deaths in 2003. Southern Africa is home to about 30 percent of  people living with HIV/AIDS worldwide, yet the region has less  than two percent of the global population.<p> 
			
							In Botswana and Swaziland the infection rate of HIV/AIDS  among adults is 40 percent. One in five pregnant women in some  African countries is infected with the virus, which is more  easily transmitted from men to women than the other way around.<p> 
			
							Piot said the epidemic, fueled by intravenous drug use and  unsafe sex, is spreading in densely populated India and China  as well as Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Vietnam and in Eastern  Europe where the worst affected areas include the Russian  Federation, Ukraine, Estonia and Latvia.<p> 
			
							And he predicted that it could be years before the back of  the epidemic is broken in terms of new infections.<p> 
			
							"The burden of the HIV epidemic will become bigger and  bigger over time because it takes, on average, seven to 10  years after infection before you fall ill and, if there is no  treatment, before you die," he said.<p> 
			
							"In other words, even if by some miracle all transmission  of HIV stopped, people would still become ill. We are only at  the beginning of the impact of AIDS, certainly in Africa."<p> 
			
							REASONS FOR HOPE<p> 
			
							But Piot added that the "AIDS Epidemic Update: December  2003" report also provides hope. In several East African cities  fewer people were infected this year than five years ago -- so  prevention can work. There is also more money than ever being  spent on AIDS.<p> 
			
							"Thirdly, there is also a momentum on treatment, even if  today only 75,000 Africans -- less than one out of 50 who need  it -- are treated with effective therapy. There is now movement  to roll out this treatment on a very large scale," he added.<p> 
			
							In a major boost to combat the epidemic, South Africa has  announced a plan to provide free antiretroviral drugs to  hundreds of thousands of infected people.<p> 
			
							"This is of historic significance, not only for South  Africa but also for the rest of Africa because others I'm sure  will follow," said Piot.<p> 
			
							"We are entering a new phase in the fight against AIDS and  a time of great opportunities," he said.<p> 
			
							"We need to be as passionate about making sure our children  do not become infected with HIV as about treating people who  are already infected today."
