The prospect of invading Iraq is significantly less popular in New York State than in the nation as a whole, and New Yorkers are more critical of the Bush administration's Iraq policy, according to a survey released yesterday by the Siena Research Institute in Loudonville, N.Y.</p>
<P> While a recent Gallup poll for CNN and USA Today found that 63 percent of Americans favor invading Iraq, only 49 percent of New Yorkers do, according to the Siena poll of 620 state residents. </p>
<P> The Siena poll was conducted from Feb. 12 to Feb. 14, and has a margin of sampling error of four percentage points. The eight questions asked were also asked in the Gallup poll conducted from Feb. 7 to Feb. 9, though that poll included more questions. </p>
<P> Only 42 percent of New Yorkers agreed that the Bush administration had a well-thought-out policy on Iraq, compared with 59 percent nationally. Close to half of the New Yorkers polled — 48 percent — did not agree, while nationally only 35 percent took that position. A difference of five percentage points is considered significant.</p>
<P> Douglas Lonnstrom, the director of the Siena Institute, said he was surprised by the magnitude of the difference between New York and the rest of the country, though not surprised that there was a difference. New Yorkers tend to be more liberal than many other Americans, he said, "so it's not surprising that the rest of the nation is more hawkish."</p>
<P> Residents of the New York City metropolitan area were less likely to favor an invasion than people upstate, and more likely to think that the United States has not done all it could to solve its problems with Iraq through diplomatic means.</p>
<P> Only 43 percent of all New Yorkers agreed that the government has exhausted its diplomatic options, compared with 54 percent of the respondents to the national Gallup poll.</p>
<P> Despite their doubts about the Bush administration's policies, large majorities of the New Yorkers surveyed by Siena said they believed Iraq has biological or chemical weapons and the facilities to create weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<P> But they were less sure than most Americans about Iraq's links with Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda. While 86 percent of the respondents to the Gallup poll said they thought it was likely or certain that such ties exist, only 66 percent of New Yorkers agreed. Twenty percent of them had no opinion, which was true of only 2 percent of the respondents to the national poll.</p>
