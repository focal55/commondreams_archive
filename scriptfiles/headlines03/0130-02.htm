<p> LONDON  - The head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog  said Thursday that, in his view, Iraq was not as yet in  material breach of a U.N. resolution on disarmament, contrary  to what Britain and the United States have argued.<p>



		Mohamed ElBaradei of the International Atomic Energy Agency  said on BBC Radio that Iraq had showed "modest or reasonable  cooperation" in the nuclear field but urged the Iraqi regime to  do more to cooperate with inspectors.<p>



		The United States and Britain have accused Iraq of spying  on United Nations weapons inspectors and obstructing their work  and have argued such behavior amounts to a "material breach" of  U.N. Security Council resolution 1441 and so to a legal green  light for war.<p>



		Asked whether such non-cooperation constituted a material  breach, ElBaradei said: "If they decide that this is a material  breach, then that is their prerogative."<p>



		"We are not going to say that this is a material breach  unless we see a gross violation of the resolution. But even  then it is for the Security Council to pronounce itself on this  issue."<p>



		The U.S. and Britain are stepping up diplomatic efforts to  get key allies on their side ahead of a possible war on Iraq  but ElBaradei said weapons inspectors still needed more time.<p>



		He said he wanted another four to five months to carry out  searches for suspected weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.<p>



		"I believe in the next few months, probably four or five  months, we should be able to come to a conclusion that Iraq is  clean from nuclear weapons," he said.<p>



		ElBaradei and chief weapons inspector Hans Blix, whose  teams are looking for chemical, biological and ballistic  weaponry, reported to the Security Council Monday on their  findings.<p>



		Blix said Iraq was not cooperating with the inspections and  had failed to account for stocks of lethal weapons. They will  report again on February 14.<p>



		ElBaradei said his inspectors had found no evidence of  banned nuclear weapons. But he told BBC radio IAEA inspectors  were still investigating aluminum tubes found in Iraq for signs  that they were being readied as part of banned weapons.<p>



		He said the agency's preliminary conclusion was that they  were being used for conventional arms: "We are investigating  that," he said.</p>
