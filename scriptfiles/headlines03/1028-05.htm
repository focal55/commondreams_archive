<p>A government document naming 157 scientists who study AIDS and human 
sexuality is alarming university researchers, who call it a Republican "hit 
list'' that may be used to target prevention programs that some members of 
Congress find offensive.
<P>National Institutes of Health program officers, who are responsible for 
overseeing research funded by the federal agency, have been asking members on 
the list for thumbnail descriptions about the "public benefit" of their 
projects, which in most cases have already been approved and funded, according 
to several scientists familiar with the list.
<P>Named on the list are researchers from some of the most prestigious 
universities in the country, including Johns Hopkins University, Harvard and 
UCSF.
<P>The purpose of the inquiries, NIH has told members of Congress, is to 
help the agency defend those grants should they come under attack. But many 
researchers, drawing hints from notations included in the document, see the 
process as a step toward shutting down their work.
<P>In a letter sent Monday to Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy 
Thompson, Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Los Angeles, labeled the list "scientific 
McCarthyism'' and called for an investigation to determine exactly who wrote 
the document. As ranking minority member of the House Committee on Government 
Reform, Waxman said researchers have been calling his office, fearful that 
they would be subpoenaed. As to the origin of the list, Waxman told Thompson 
that "there are strong clues that this was an inside job. Officials within HHS 
appear to have been directly involved in the creation of this list.''
<P>According to the Associated Press, an electronic copy of the list 
includes comments from The Traditional Values Coalition about several studies, 
including one by a Michigan researcher about teenagers' sexual and mental 
health. The comments read: "Promotes a 'sex positive' attitude among teens; 
endorses sexual behavior and condom use among teens."
<P>Andrea Lafferty, the coalition's executive director, told the Associated 
Press that the grants were a "total abuse of taxpayer dollars."
<P>"We know for a fact that millions and millions of dollars have been 
flushed down the toilet over years on this HIV, AIDS scam and sham," Lafferty 
said. "We know what it takes to prevent getting the disease. It takes not 
engaging in risky sexual behaviors."
<P>Sixteen current UCSF researchers are included on the list, as is UCLA 
professor Tom Coates, who until September was director of the UCSF AIDS 
Research Institute. The list includes more than 250 different grants, 14 of 
which are his projects.
<P>The only way to clear the air, Coates suggested, is to call a public 
hearing, where he said he and other fellow researchers can defend their work. 
<P>Coates said that the disclosure of the list has created a huge stir in 
the AIDS research community.
<P>"The general feeling is one of fear and intimidation,'' he said. "Anyone 
who has engaged in this kind of research and sees their name on such a list 
wonders if one's funding is going to be in jeopardy.''
<P>Among the other UCSF researchers named on the list are Nancy Padian, 
whose project is studying sexually transmitted diseases within groups of 
Latino youth in San Francisco's Mission District; William Woods, who is 
studying HIV risk in bath houses and sex clubs; and Ruth Malone, who is 
studying the tobacco industry's targeting of gays and lesbians.
<P>The concern for possible funding loss is based in precedent. In July, 
Congress fell two votes shy of passing an amendment that would have stripped 
funding of a continuing study of HIV among Asian prostitutes in San Francisco 
massage parlors.
