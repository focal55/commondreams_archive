<p>A thousand immigrants and longtime Americans -- representing dozens of 
community groups and bound by fear of how much worse their lives could get if 
a war erupted -- came together Sunday for the first time.
<P>Connie Liu, a 40-year-old garment worker who lost her job a few months ago 
because of the economic slump, was one of them. She lives with four family 
members in a 10-by-10 room in a Chinatown single-room-occupancy hotel.
<P>"Things are bad now," Liu said through an interpreter. "They would only get 
worse if there were a war."
<P>Liu's neighbor wanted to come to the rally with her. "But she had to work 
at a restaurant," she said quietly.
<P>From the start, the speakers' platform at San Francisco's anti-war rallies 
has mirrored the region's demographics. But the organizers of the huge 
turnouts have had to acknowledge an uncomfortable point: The demonstrators 
themselves haven't reflected the Bay Area's diversity.
<P>It wasn't until Sunday -- the third major peace demonstration -- that a 
"People of Color" contingent marched together, 1,000 strong.
<P><b>'HAVE TO DO BETTER'</b>
<P>"We've done a good job, but we realize that we have to do better," Andrea 
Buffa, national co-chair of United for Peace and Justice, one of five co-
sponsors of Sunday's march and rally, said earlier in the week.
<P>Anti-war activists say that to strengthen their position, they need to 
broaden their support beyond the middle-class whites who have dominated the 
rallies thus far.
<P>To that end, the coalition that organized Sunday's march made the deepest 
outreach efforts yet into the region's communities of color -- the people, 
organizers say, who would be most affected by a U.S. attack on Iraq.
<P>Over the past few weeks, anti-war organizers went door to door in 
previously overlooked neighborhoods like San Francisco's Chinatown and placed 
an unprecedented number of ads in ethnic and community newspapers.
<P>And indeed, many protesters came Sunday because they were actively 
recruited for the first time. While the total was modest compared with 
Sunday's overall turnout, the large number of newcomers pleased organizers, 
who face several challenges in organizing communities that have not turned out 
in large numbers for anti-war protests since the Vietnam War.
<P><b>'FOCUSED ON CITY HALL'</b>
<P>"Foreign policy is one of the last things on the agendas of the small 
community groups," said Linda Burnham, executive director of the Women of 
Color Resource Center, based in Oakland, one of the main organizers of the 
contingent, along with Racial Justice 9/11. "Anti-war work is nowhere in their 
budget. A lot of these groups are focused on City Hall."
<P>But if a war redirects money from state and local government into the 
federal coffers to support the military, Burnham said, communities of color 
will be among those hardest hit.
<P>Some fear a wartime atmosphere would give police and immigration 
authorities more latitude in arresting people in minority communities.
<P>One marcher, Sama Ab Ayyah, worries about more attacks on the Mission 
District apartment where she lives. In the past two months, vandals have spray-
painted "die pig" and "kill Arabs," and tossed human feces at her door. The 
attacks -- one of 150 anti-Arab hate crimes that activists have counted in San 
Francisco since the Sept. 11 attacks -- started after she placed a 4-inch-high 
Palestinian flag on her front door.
<P>"We will be targets again if there is a war," said Ab Ayyah.
<P><b>FILIPINO MARCHERS</b>
<P>In the 400,000-strong Filipino community, many have friends or family 
members working in the Middle East as maids and construction workers, said 
Rhonda Ramiro, a San Francisco resident. An estimated 1.5 million Filipinos 
are employed in such jobs there.
<P>"The biggest challenge in getting people out here," Ramiro said, "is that 
there's a lot of fear in publicly showing up at a demonstration."
<P>Several of those marching with her and the 150 members of Filipinos for 
Global Justice Not War were airport screeners laid off last fall in the wake 
of a new federal act requiring screeners to be U.S. citizens.
<P>"The younger people here know that their schools are bad already and will 
get worse if there's more money going for the military," Ramiro said. "And the 
older people lived through martial law (in the Philippines) or think that a 
war will bring more American military presence in the Philippines."
<P>Shared opposition to the war is linking together neighborhoods that haven't 
had much to do with each other before, said Elizabeth Martinez of Latinos 
Contra La Guerra.
<P>Early Sunday morning, a few dozen Latino protesters from the Mission 
District traveled to Chinatown, where they joined about 500 protesters 
marching to the rally from Portsmouth Square.
<P>"These are two communities who have not had many connections in the past," 
Martinez said.
<P>The Chinese Progressive Association had distributed 1,000 flyers in 
Chinatown over the past few weeks.
<P>"People say the Chinese community is passive, that they're isolated, that 
they don't care," said Leon Chow, the association's chairman. "But we expected 
250 people, and 500 showed up to our rally."
