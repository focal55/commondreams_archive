<p>JERUSALEM, Jun 14 (IPS) - </b>
							With the U.S.-backed road map peace plan in 
danger of being swallowed up by the latest round of bloodletting in the Middle 
East, the prevailing sense among Palestinians is that they are hopelessly 
trapped, unable to end 36 years of Israeli occupation either through negotiation 
or through armed conflict.
<p>"Palestinians want an end to all of this but can't see a way out of the whole 
situation," says Ali Jarbawi, professor of political science at Bir Zeit University in 
the West Bank. "They tried negotiations, in the form of Oslo, for nine years and it 
didn't work. Then they tried confrontation and it didn't work. They see no way 
out, but to endure. Endurance has become the strategy."
<p>There was talk Friday of security contacts between Israeli and Palestinian 
officials being revived, and of a renewed dialogue between Palestinian Prime 
Minister Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen), and Hamas leaders over an end to 
attacks on Israelis.
<p>But violence continued unabated. Toward evening, an Israeli was shot dead in 
the northern West Bank. Then, nightfall brought more strikes by Israeli helicopter 
gunships in Gaza, where a Hamas militant was killed after his car was hit by two 
missiles - the sixth such attack in just three days. Israeli security officials, who 
have vowed to fight Hamas "to the bitter end" said helicopters had targeted a car 
carrying militants who had earlier fired rudimentary rockets into Israel.

<p>If the appointment of a new Palestinian prime minister in late April, U.S. 
pressure on Israel to accept the road map last month, and the decision by 
President George W. Bush to personally back the plan, had bred some hope 
among Palestinian leaders, it has rapidly evaporated.

<p>Jarbawi says there was always skepticism about implementation of the latest 
peace initiative. "The Palestinian public doesn't have much faith in the U.S. or 
(Israeli Prime Minister Ariel) Sharon," he told IPS. "They've been sold promises, 
but they want to see implementation on the ground. Removing a (settler) 
caravan from a hilltop isn't serious. Not when the reality on the ground for 
Palestinians remains curfews and roadblocks. We can't move, we can't work, we 
live in cantons, people are being killed, and houses are being demolished."

<p>The idea of an armed international monitoring force in the region to separate 
the two sides was revived Friday by United Nations Secretary General Kofi 
Annan. Not surprisingly Palestinian leaders, who have always been keen to 
internationalize the conflict, embraced the idea. Palestinian minister Yasser 
Abed Rabbo said an armed force "is the only realistic solution to get out of this 
cycle of violence and counter-violence."

<p>But Israel strongly opposes international intervention in the conflict, insisting it 
will not place its security in the hands of a third party. So, for now, the only game 
in town is the road map. Palestinian leaders, especially Abbas, know this.

<p>Nevertheless, when Abbas and other Palestinian officials returned from the 
U.S.-orchestrated summit in the Jordanian port city of Aqaba on June 4, they 
were somewhat buoyed. They felt Bush had listened to their case, including 
their demands for the transfer of funds frozen by Israel. They believed also they 
had found time to reconstruct the Palestinian Authority security apparatus 
destroyed by Israel in 32 months of fighting.

<p>But since then, and as a result of his speech at the summit, Abbas's credibility 
among his own people has crashed. He called for the end to the "armed 
intifada" and recognized"Jewish suffering" but forgot to mention the suffering of 
his own people and their demands.

<p>He arrived home to a barrage of criticism. If the U.S. and Israel detected 
moderation in the Palestinian Prime Minister's words, his own people viewed 
what he said as a capitulation to international dictates. "Abu Mazen did himself 
a lot of harm with his declaration in Aqaba," says Jarbawi. "He made his 
declaration without getting anything in return, such as the removal of roadblocks 
or something else tangible on the ground, with which to convince the general 
public."

<p>Now, the latest series of strikes by Israel on Palestinian militants in the Gaza 
Strip has further weakened Abbas and the moderate message he has been 
peddling. Hamas leaders who have not hidden their desire to torpedo the road 
map have broken off truce talks with him.
<p>U.S. and Israeli leaders had hoped Abbas would emerge as an alternative to 
Arafat, but while Palestinians recognize the historical role Abbas has played in 
their national movement, they have never viewed him as a possible 
replacement for Arafat. Neither has Abbas, who reported back to Arafat 
immediately after the Aqaba summit, and has made it clear that no substantive 
decisions are taken without Arafat.
<p>Mahdi Abdul-Hadi, who heads the Palestinian Academic Society for the Study 
of International Affairs in East Jerusalem says Abbas was appointed by Arafat, 
constantly reports back to him, and so poses no threat to the Palestinian leader. 
"Abu Mazen has no political ambitions and no charisma," he told IPS. "And he 
cannot afford to anger Arafat who appointed him and who can destroy him with 
a single remark."
<p>Israeli, U.S. and even some European leaders have given up on Arafat, 
believing that after he rejected the Israeli offer made at Camp David in July 
2000, he is incapable of cutting a deal that will end the conflict. But if they 
believed he would be rendered inconsequential after the war in Iraq and with 
the launch of the road map, they have been disappointed.
<p>In fact, since Aqaba, Arafat's position among his own people has 
strengthened. Following the summit, he explained Abbas's failure to mention 
key Palestinian demands by saying that the prime minister had not been 
allowed to say what he wanted - an explanation that helped cultivate further the 
portrayal of Abbas as a U.S. lackey.
<p>Arafat was never happy with the creation of the post of prime minister, which 
he feared would cut into his powers, but agreed to it under international duress. 
Since then, he has done little to help Abbas establish himself.
<p>Despite Israel's insistence that he crush Hamas, Abbas has made it clear he 
does not plan to use force - certainly not for now - in persuading the armed 
militias to lay down their weapons. Jarbawi says that for Hamas leaders to be 
convinced to suspend attacks, Abbas will have to get a guarantee that Israel will 
stop assassinations.
<p>Yohanan Zoref, a senior scholar at the Institute for Interdisciplinary Studies 
located not far from Tel Aviv believes Palestinian public pressure will play a key 
role in curbing Hamas. The Palestinian public, he contends, is fatigued after 
two-and-a-half years of the intifada, and groups like Hamas ultimately cannot 
ignore this. "I believe in the power of the public," he says. "When wisdom returns 
after this latest wave of violence, they will tell Hamas to stop."
<p>But Jarbawi insists that for the Palestinian public to begin to pressure "those 
who are trying to wreck" the road map, "they will first have to be convinced that it 
is worthwhile."
