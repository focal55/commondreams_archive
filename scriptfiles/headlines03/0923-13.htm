<p>WASHINGTON&nbsp; - Too little, too late.
<P>
That's how Democrats who want George W. Bush's job summed  up the president's address on Tuesday to the United Nations.<P>

</table></font>Some of the candidates for the Democratic presidential  nomination in 2004 said Bush wasted an opportunity to bring the  international community on board, militarily and financially,  in postwar Iraq. Others admired his words but called for  action.<P>
"The president's rhetoric is becoming more stirring, but  once again he has failed to tell us exactly what role he  expects the United Nations to play now and what timetable he  envisions for the transfer of sovereignty to the Iraqi people,"  Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry said.<P>
Kerry, and three of his White House rivals -- North  Carolina Sen. John Edwards, Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman and  Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt -- all voted for the  congressional resolution authorizing the U.S.-led invasion of  Iraq, but each has subsequently criticized Bush for failing to  have a postwar plan.<P>
A CNN-USA Today <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/0923-08.htm">Gallup poll</a> released on Tuesday that put  Bush's approval rating at 50 percent, the lowest of his  presidency, offered Democrats some reason for hope that they  might unseat a man the public still sees as a strong leader for  his handling of the campaign against terror.
<P>
The survey also showed Bush to be more politically  vulnerable on issues from the struggling economy to the  continued casualties and mounting reconstruction costs in Iraq.  The president shrugged off escalating Democratic attacks as  'blips on my radar screen."<P>
"I've got a job to do. I'm occupied," Bush said in an  interview with the Fox Broadcast Network aired on Monday.<P>
'I TOLD YOU SO' TONE<P>
Lieberman called Bush's speech an "11th-hour, half-hearted  appeal" delivered in an "I told you so" tone that made it more  difficult to secure international help in Iraq.<P>
Bush took "too long" to make a compelling case to the  United Nations, Gephardt said, and urged the president not to  "simply retreat to the White House" but engage in serious  negotiations with allies to enhance security, rebuild Iraq and  end the U.S. occupation as soon as possible.<P>
Edwards said Bush "missed an opportunity" to bring the  international community in by failing to offer them a seat at  the table and a meaningful role in decision making.<P>
The U.N. role in Iraq outlined by Bush included helping to  develop a constitution, training civil servants and conducting  free and fair elections.<P>
Rep. Dennis Kucinich of Ohio, an opponent of the war,  called the speech "further proof that the war against Iraq was  a complete failure" that had harmed U.S. standing, depleted  funds from domestic priorities and distracted from the war on  terror.<P>
Another staunch critic who voted against the war, Florida  Sen. Bob Graham,  accused Bush of trying to force other nations  to comply with U.S. demands with his "do it my way or the  highway" approach.<P>
"He missed an opportunity once again to unite the world  against terrorism and rekindle relationships with our long time  allies," Graham said.
