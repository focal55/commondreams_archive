<p>Steve Baggarly won't



be feeding the poor this morning.  <p>   Baggarly,  37,  who heads a



free breakfast program in Norfolk,  has been sentenced to six months  in



prison   for splashing blood on the Pentagon  in protest of a possible



war with Iraq.  <p> 



Baggarly  and two  other men were convicted Friday



by federal magistrate Theresa Buchanan  in Alexandria,     said Edward



Adams,  public information officer for the U.S. District Court for the



Eastern District of Virginia.  <p>   The incident happened on Dec. 30. 



The men poured blood -- including their own -- on a door and columns at



a Pentagon  entrance while 60  other demonstrators diverted a contingent



of military police. <p>   The action symbolized ``the bloodiness that's



already on the Pentagon,'' Baggarly  said in an interview before the



trial. <p>



 All three  men belong to the Catholic Workers,  a



nationwide lay movement that serves the poor and promotes social



justice. The others were Bill Frankl-Streit  of the Little Flower



Catholic Worker  in Louisa County,  and Steve Woolford  of the Silk Hope



Catholic Worker  in Siler City, N.C.  <p>



Each man was convicted on two  charges -- disorderly conduct and



violation of preservation of property. Each charge brought a six-month 



sentence, but they will run concurrently, Adams  said.   <p>   The men



managed to make political statements despite being warned by the court,



said Sheila Stumph,  who also is a Norfolk Catholic Worker.  <p>  



``Steve said the blood trail leads from the Pentagon to the courthouse



because the court defends the Pentagon,'' she said.<p>   ``Even



though it was a sad thing, it also was a time of hope because it showed



that people are willing to go to jail for what they believe in,'' Stumph



 said.  <p>Baggarly  and his wife, Kim Williams,  founded the Norfolk Catholic 



Worker  breakfast program, which is held three  <b></b>times a week on



Salter Street,  near downtown Norfolk.  <p>   Baggarly  has been



arrested several times before for anti-war demonstrations and spent a



year in federal prison for damaging a Navy  de<b></b>stroyer in another



protest.  <p>   Other volunteers will continue the food program, which



is held at 7 a.m.  on Tuesdays,  Thursdays  and Saturdays.</p>
