<p>A weekend of bloodshed across Iraq saw November chalk up new and grim records, including the highest number of casualties among coalition troops and the deadliest single month for America's armed forces since the 1991 Gulf war. <P><table bgcolor="#FFFFCC" hspace="2" vspace="2" cellspacing="0" width="150" border="0" cellpadding="3" align="RIGHT">

</table>The killings of seven Spanish military intelligence officers in an ambush at Mahmudiya, south of Baghdad, together with the deaths of two more US soldiers brought the monthly toll of coalition dead to 111.  <P>It also brought to 79 the number of US troops killed in Iraq, outstripping the total for September and October.  <P>The flow of body bags back to the US and other countries made its mark on the political arena, with the Democratic party presidential candidate Wesley Clark, a former Nato supreme commander, yesterday describing Iraq as "a distraction from the war on terror".  <P>"Are we safer with Saddam Hussein gone? That's a very tough case to make," he told CNN.  <P>In Spain, the prime minister, Jos&#233; Maria Aznar, acted to head off criticism from opposition politicians and newspapers of his unpopular policies in Iraq.  <P>With the deaths of the seven military intelligence officers last month bringing to nine the number of Spanish soldiers killed in Iraq, he vowed that the troops would not be brought back. "Withdrawal is the worst possible path to take," he said.  <P>Mr Aznar claimed that the killings were, in themselves, proof that his own policies were correct.  <P>"The fanatical hatred that has accompanied this new atrocity has provided unimaginable pictures that we will never forget. We have no option but to face this fanaticism head on," he said.  <P>The Socialist opposition leader, Jos&#233; Luis Rodr&#237;guez Zapatero, praised the bravery of the dead men but also led calls for the 1,300 Spanish troops in Iraq to be "brought home".  <P>He was backed by smaller opposition parties who, like I&#241;aki Anasagasti of the Basque Nationalist party, warned there could be "many more deaths in a very short period of time and for no good reason".  <P>Several newspapers condemned Mr Aznar's determination to keep troops in the country, despite the fact that 85% of Spaniards - more than any other EU country - believes the Iraq war was a mistake.  <P>"Nobody who saw the glee with which passersby trampled the corpses of our countrymen can still maintain that the majority of Iraqis consider coalition troops to be their liberators," El Mundo newspaper said.  <P>Mr Aznar, whose deputy prime minister and heir-to-be Mariano Rajoy will lead the People's party into a general election in the spring, was an enthusiastic backer of George Bush before and during the war.  <P>An attack on South Korean civilian workers, which killed two and left two more badly injured, has increased pressure on South Korea's president, Roh Moo-hyun, after he pledged to send more troops to Iraq in addition to 675 medics and military engineers deployed since May. He has yet to make the politically sensitive decision whether to include combat forces in the expected 3,000-strong contingent.  <P>Asked whether the killings would affect Korea's decision to send more troops the deputy foreign minister, Lee Soo-hyuck, told a hastily arranged briefing in Seoul: "It is too early to comment. We must take time to analyze things."  
<P>Japan, which had two diplomats killed in Iraq over the weekend, is also struggling with the thorny decision of whether to send troops. Plans to deploy non-combat soldiers were put on hold this month after the attack on the Italian base in Nassiriya.    <P><B> November was the bloodiest month for the coalition forces in Iraq since the invasion, with the following deaths</B>  <P><B> US</B> 79  <P><B> Italy</B> 19  <P><B> Spain</B> 7  <P><B> Japan</B> 2  <P><B> South Korea	</B> 2  <P><B> Poland</B> 1  <P><B> Colombia</B> 1  <P><B> <B>&#183;</B> What the leaders say</B>   <P>US: "We did not charge hundreds of miles into the heart of Iraq, pay a bitter cost    of casualties, defeat a ruthless dictator and liberate 25 million people only to retreat before a band of thugs and assassins" President <B> George Bush</B>   <P>Italy: "No intimidation should divert us from our determination to help resurrect this country" Prime minister <B> Silvio Berlusconi</B>   <P>Spain: "Against fanatical terrorism there is no other option than confronting it" Prime minister <B> Jos&#233; Mar&#237;a Aznar</B>
