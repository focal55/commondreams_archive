<p>BAGHDAD  - Iraqi guerrillas ambushed a U.S. military convoy northeast of Baghdad Monday killing one American soldier and wounding two others, the U.S. military said.

<p>The death brought to 97 the number of U.S. soldiers killed by hostile fire since President Bush declared major combat over on May 1. The soldier was the third to be killed within 24 hours.

<p>A spokesman said the latest soldier to die was from the 4th Infantry Division died when a convoy was ambushed with a roadside bomb and small arms fire near the town of Jalawla, 75 miles northeast of Baghdad.

<p>In the northern oil refining town of Baiji, a U.S. soldier was killed when his Bradley fighting vehicle hit a land mine late Sunday. In the hometown of ousted president Saddam Hussein, another soldier was killed Monday in a rocket-propelled grenade attack.

<p>Occupying forces come under daily attack from anti-American guerrillas who Washington says are Saddam loyalists, criminals and foreign fighters.
