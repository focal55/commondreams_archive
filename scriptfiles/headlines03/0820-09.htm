<p>MONROVIA, Liberia, Aug. 19 — When people here say that democracy is in ruins, that is no metaphor.



<p>Every square inch of the Senate, the House of Representatives and the Supreme Court was smashed and looted by the army of President Charles G. Taylor in the hours before he left for exile last week. A tour of the wreckage today showed that it will take a lot more than the power-sharing agreement signed Monday night in Accra, Ghana, between Liberia's rulers and rebels to rebuild this nation's government.



<p>The pact sets up an interim government to take charge in October. The rebels and the handful of ruling party leaders left behind by Mr. Taylor say they will not claim the top four posts for the next two years, yielding the jobs of chairman, vice-chairman, Senate president and House speaker to civilian noncombatants. An election once scheduled for October will be postponed for two years, until October 2005.



<p>Peace pacts have been patched together and have fallen apart before during 14 bitter years of civil war and conflict in Liberia; some Western diplomats here said today that this accord's wording is hardly different, and hardly better, than the ones that went before it.



<p>But they expressed hope that civilian leaders will stand up now against the abuses they have suffered under years of misrule.



<p>"People have seen peace accords come and go throughout the '90's, and they are probably wise not to be too optimistic," one Western official said. "This realistic attitude may mean they will not repeat the mistakes of the past."



<p>Yet, some of the Liberian officials picking their way in sadness through the shambles of their chambers today expressed grave doubts that the peace would hold for long.



<p>"This is insanity," said Mark K. Hollie, deputy chief clerk of the House of Representatives, as he led a reporter on the first tour of the rubble granted an outsider. "The people who did this are mad. This is the sacred property of the republic. You can see how war has damaged everything and everybody here."



<p>"These are government forces that did this," he said, "the government destroying the government."



<p>Senator George Koukou, 58, of Nimba County, bordering Ivory Coast and Guinea, said: "This is one of the most beautiful buildings in the country, or used to be. But this is the essence of the war. Taylor sent his gangsters to come and do this.



<p>"And as we speak," he said, "I am being told that my county is being tormented by L.U.R.D. and Model," the two rebel groups that signed the accord with the government — Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy, and the Movement for Democracy in Liberia.



<p>"It's just a war of revenge," he said. "And I fear it is not over."



<p>Patrick Williams, the deputy speaker of the House, said he spent most of this summer, until Mr. Taylor's departure on Aug. 11, holed up in a fetid house in downtown Monrovia with roughly 400 terrified refugees. He is 60, and looks exhausted. He, too, fears the Accra accord will not hold.



<p>"The war's not over," Mr. Williams said simply.



<p>Defense Minister Daniel Chea, in Ghana for the signing of the accord, agreed. "The fighting is ongoing" as rebels try to increase their strongholds in the Liberian countryside, he said on Monday.



<p>Saah Mallah, 45, chief of maintenance at the Senate, said today that "the only way this war will be over is when the guns are taken away from the people." To date, there is no evidence whatsoever that the rebels or Mr. Taylor's militias have been disarmed.



<p>Nyudueh Morkonmana, 56, the speaker of the House, and an old friend of Mr. Taylor's, expressed a measured hope. "I hope this peace accord will be the last one," he said. "I pray we won't have to go through this again. But the way we have practiced politics in Liberia is not democracy."



<p>Among the piles of broken furniture, smashed pictures, strewn files and splintered desks in the halls of Congress today was a letter to Mr. Morkonmana from the United States ambassador, John Blaney, dated Oct. 23, 2002. In it the ambassador thanked him for his welcome to the country and pledged "to help Liberians achieve a better future."



<p>Liberia was founded as a republic, with American support, by freed American slaves in 1847. Its political system, on paper, closely resembles America's constitutional democracy.



<p>But paper was about the only thing left after Mr. Taylor's forces ransacked the legislative and judicial branches of government, running rampant from the day he announced he would stepped down, Aug. 8, until the day he left, Aug. 11.



<p>The desolation in the halls, offices and even in the well of the House and Senate was nearly total, as was the destruction of the chambers of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Gloria M. Musu-Scott. In the chambers of Associate Justice Karmo G. Sako Sackor, only one thing was intact: a Christmas card from President Taylor, taped to the wall.



<p>It read: "Let us think not of conflict, but of resolution, not of divisiveness, but of unity, not of hatred, but of love, not of war, but of peace."



<p>The Supreme Court itself, its benches and the seats of justice, all were overturned.



<p>"When the chief justice saw the place, she cried, she shed tears," said the court's chief maintenance man, Peter N. Wilson, the only person in the otherwise deserted court building, called the Temple of Justice. Chief Justice Musu-Scott was reported to be traveling to Liberia from Ghana today and unavailable for comment.



<p>The chief clerk of the House of Representatives, James R. Kaba, dressed in a white shirt and a tie, was himself near tears as he tried to make order out of chaos today.



<p>"Anarchy," he said. "When I think of the madness of my fellow citizens . . ." And then he could not go on.
