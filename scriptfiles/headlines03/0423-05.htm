<p>Advocates for everything from clean air to wildlife protection said yesterday the environment remains a major political vulnerability for the Bush administration and a ready tool for Democrats to exploit in next year's presidential election.

<p>In a high-profile effort to shore up its environmental image and record, the administration moved recently to slash emissions from off-road diesel engines by 95 percent, and negotiated a lawsuit settlement in which Dominion Virginia Power Co. agreed to spend $1.2 billion to reduce pollution at eight power plants and pay a $5.3 million federal fine.

<p>In an Earth Day news conference that frequently resembled a political rally yesterday, nearly a dozen environmental advocacy groups acknowledged these accomplishments but nevertheless blistered President Bush for a list of alleged transgressions, including pulling out of a global warming treaty, relaxing air and water pollution standards and plotting regulatory rollbacks with industry allies and big political contributors.

<p>"Today we're counting the number of days until elections," said Deb Callahan, president of the League of Conservation Voters. "Americans have watched the Bush administration dismantle environmental laws that have improved the health and security of families for decades. And Americans are not happy."

<p>But translating supposed environmental discontent into ballot box success may prove difficult. The annual Gallup/Earth Day Poll found that while the percentage of Americans holding a negative view of the environment's condition jumped from 38 percent in 2002 to 47 percent this year, a declining percentage of voters favor protection of the environment over economic growth -- 47 percent as opposed to 54 percent last year.

<p>Nonetheless, Callahan sees the environment as a key campaign issue next year. "Voters don't believe you have to pick between the economy and the environment," she said. "You can't say that environment isn't a winner, and I think you'll find that out in 2004."

<p>Perhaps, but "we're not running from this issue," said Jim Dyke, communications director of the Republican National Committee.

<p>GOP consultants said the goal is to minimize Democrats' advantage with a few high-visibility initiatives while doing nothing to encourage turnout by voters concerned primarily with the environment, few of whom could be expected to support Bush.

<p>"You're trying to moderate Republican-leaning voters in the suburbs who care about the environment and want to know they're not joining into a party that favors poisoning the water and fogging the air," said Clifford D. May, a veteran GOP consultant and president of the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, a terrorism think tank. "You don't want to leave the impression that environmentalism is the exclusive province of Democrats, any more than they want to leave patriotism to Republicans."

<p>Bush did not attend an Earth Day event but issued a statement saying government "has an important role to play in protecting our environment." He said he was using "new and innovative policies" to protect land, air and water.

<p>The White House, meanwhile, orchestrated Earth Day activities that included administration officials participating in 75 events nationwide. The administration last week opened a Web site, www.EarthDay.gov, that allows visitors to search for environmental volunteer opportunities with 7,000 groups and governments through USA Freedom Corps, Bush's public-service network. Even if Bush chooses not to slug it out with Democrats on the environmental front, he can point to accomplishments that began when he reaffirmed designations of National Monuments made by predecessor Bill Clinton and continued last year when General Electric Co. was ordered to clean up pollutants in the upper Hudson River.

<p>Gene Karpinski, executive director of the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, termed these efforts "crumbs in an overall menu that's great for big business but bad for public health and the environment." He suggested that the administration used its accomplishments as a smoke screen while it worked to undermine longtime environmental laws. He noted that the administration chose New Year's Eve 2002 -- hardly a peak moment for news-watching -- to sign into law measures relaxing clean-air requirements at industrial plants.

<p>Today, suggested Conservation Voters communications director Scott Stoermer, the war in Iraq serves a similar function. "They recognize that people are paying attention to other things, and they're taking advantage to fly under the radar screen," he said. One such administration initiative, Stoermer said, would exempt military bases from most environmental laws.

<p>David H. Winston, a Republican pollster, said Bush had received a war "bump" in polls of about 10 to 18 percentage points, and acknowledged that the White House was trying to sustain it with new initiatives in domestic areas, including the environment. Many voters will care about the domestic record as well as foreign affairs, he said. "It's not an on/off switch."

<p>Bush aides' discussions about the environment emphasize such phrases as "common-sense solutions," "community involvement" and "a comprehensive approach." These generally signal business-friendly alternatives to steps supported by most environmental advocates.

<p>Such groups label it "Bush-speak," and yesterday they frequently ridiculed a recent memo written by GOP consultant Frank Luntz to show Republicans how to convince voters of their "sincerity and concern" about the environment.

<p>"They're more worried about their image than about doing a better job," said Wilderness Society President Bill Meadows.

<p>But the administration was equally dismissive of "so-called" environmental groups and their "zero-sum approach, where you either do it their way or not at all," one senior official said. "The president believes in finding common ground to achieve results," emphasizing personal stewardship and economic growth.

<p>This may turn out to be a telling distinction as election year approaches. The Gallup Poll showed a modest decline in the percentage of Americans praising Bush's stewardship of the environment -- from 50 percent to 44 percent. But this contrasted with a precipitous drop -- from 63 percent to 44 percent -- of Americans who thought Bush was "keeping America prosperous."

<p>With voters giving Bush sub-par marks on both fronts, political strategists could find themselves choosing between two rival viewpoints: The advocates' claim that environmental safeguards will help bring the economy along; or the belief, as expressed by the senior administration official, that "you need economic growth to protect the environment. The other approach often results in lost jobs."
