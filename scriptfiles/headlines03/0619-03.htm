<p>BAGHDAD   - Cursing America, scores of gunmen fired  in the air on Thursday at the funeral of a former Iraqi air  force man killed by U.S. troops during a violent protest in  Baghdad.<P>
"Revenge! Revenge!" several hundred mourners shouted as men  with Kalashnikov assault rifles fired volleys into the air, in  defiance of a U.S. ban on carrying weapons in Iraq.<P>
"There is no god but Allah, America is the enemy of Allah,"  mourners chanted as they followed the coffin of Tareq Mohammed,  one of two men shot dead at a demonstration on Wednesday.<P>

</table></font>There was no sign of U.S. troops in Baghdad's impoverished  al-Hurriya district where Mohammed, a former air force  non-commissioned officer, had lived with his wife and five  children.<P>
Mohammed was killed when sacked members of Iraq's dissolved  armed forces confronted U.S. soldiers during furious protests  outside the headquarters of the U.S.-led administration in the  capital.<P>
The U.S. military said demonstrators had thrown stones at a  convoy entering the compound and one had pulled out a weapon  and begun shooting, prompting U.S. forces to respond.<P>
Mohammed's former colleagues who joined him in Wednesday's  protest denied the accusations, saying they were unarmed.<P>
"We were unarmed in a peaceful demonstration to demand our  frozen salaries," said one mourner, Khazaal Qatie, angrily.  "Isn't that terrorism, shooting at protesters?"<P>
During the demonstration, protesters beat passing United  Nations and press vehicles with shoes, and attacked some  journalists, smashing their cameras.<P>
"They deprived us of our jobs and have not offered us new  ones," Qatie said of the U.S. move to disband Saddam Hussein's  armed forces, security services and two ministries, throwing  400,000 people out of work.<P>
"The Americans should expect problems now. He (Mohammed)  has relatives, friends and neighbors."<P>
People who gathered for funeral prayers at the neighborhood  mosque complained bitterly about the lack of electricity, water  and other services in the area.<P>
"The former regime was 1,000 times more merciful," said one  resident, Abdul-Azim Abdul-Wahed.<P>
"The Americans have only pumps to steal our oil, but have  no generators for us."<P>
U.S. forces have struggled to impose order and restore  services in Iraq since Saddam's government fell on April 9.<P>
