<p>WASHINGTON  -- The Pentagon wants to cut the pay of its 148,000 U.S. troops in Iraq, 
who are already contending with guerrilla-style attacks, homesickness and 120-
degree-plus heat.

</table>Unless Congress and President Bush take quick action when Congress returns 
after Labor Day, the uniformed Americans in Iraq and the 9,000 in Afghanistan 
will lose a pay increase approved last April of $75 a month in "imminent 
danger pay" and $150 a month in "family separation allowances."
<P>The Defense Department supports the cuts, saying its budget can't sustain 
the higher payments amid a host of other priorities. But the proposed cuts 
have stirred anger among military families and veterans' groups and even 
prompted an editorial attack in the Army Times, a weekly newspaper for 
military personnel and their families that is seldom so outspoken.
<P>Congress made the April pay increases retroactive to Oct. 1, 2002, but they 
are set to expire when the federal fiscal year ends Sept. 30 unless Congress 
votes to keep them as part of its annual defense appropriations legislation.
<P>Imminent danger pay, given to Army, Navy, Marine and Air Force members in 
combat zones, was raised to $225 from $150 a month. The family separation 
allowance, which goes to help military families pay rent, child care or other 
expenses while soldiers are away, was raised from $100 a month to $250.
<P>Last month, the Pentagon sent Congress an interim budget report saying the 
extra $225 monthly for the two pay categories was costing about $25 million 
more a month, or $300 million for a full year. In its "appeals package" laying 
out its requests for cuts in pending congressional spending legislation, 
Pentagon officials recommended returning to the old, lower rates of special 
pay and said military experts would study the question of combat pay in coming 
months.
<P><b>WHITE HOUSE DUCKS ISSUE</b>
<P>A White House spokesman referred questions about the administration's view 
on the pay cut to the Pentagon report.
<P>Military families have started hearing about the looming pay reductions, 
and many aren't happy.
<P>They say duty in Iraq is dangerous -- 60 Americans have died in combat-
related incidents since President Bush declared an end to major combat 
operations in Iraq on May 1. Another 69 have been killed by disease, the heat 
or in accidents.
<P>"Every person they see is a threat. They have no idea who is an enemy or 
who is a friend," said Larry Syverson, 54, of Richmond, Va., whose two sons, 
Brandon, 31, and Bryce, 25, are serving in Iraq. Syverson appeared with other 
military families at a Washington, D.C., news conference to publicize efforts 
to bring the troops home.
<P>"You can get shot in the head when you go to buy a Coke," added Syverson, 
referring to an incident at a Baghdad University cafeteria on July 6 when an 
Army sergeant was shot and killed after buying a soda.
<P><b>AFRAID FOR HER SON</b>
<P>Susan Schuman of Shelburne Falls, Mass., said her son, Army National Guard 
Sgt. Justin Schuman, had told her "it's really scary" serving in Samarra, a 
town about 20 miles from Saddam Hussein's ancestral hometown of Tikrit.
<P>Schuman, who like Syverson has become active in a group of military 
families that want service personnel pulled out of Iraq, said the pay cut 
possibility didn't surprise her.
<P>"It's all part of the lie of the Bush administration, that they say they 
support our troops," she said.
<P>It's rare for the independent Army Times, which is distributed widely among 
Army personnel, to blast the Pentagon, the White House and the Congress. But 
in this instance, the paper has said in recent editorials that Congress was 
wrong to make the pay raises temporary, and the Pentagon is wrong to call for 
a rollback.
<P>"The bottom line: If the Bush administration felt in April that conditions 
in Iraq and Afghanistan warranted increases in danger pay and family 
separation allowances, it cannot plausibly argue that the higher rates are not 
still warranted today," the paper said in an editorial in its current edition.
<P>On Capitol Hill, members say the issue will be taken up quickly after the 
summer recess when a conference committee meets to negotiate conflicting 
versions of the $369 billion defense appropriations bill.
<P>"You can't put a price tag on their service and sacrifice, but one of the 
priorities of this bill has got to be ensuring our servicemen and women in 
imminent danger are compensated for it," said Rep. Ellen Tauscher, D-Walnut 
Creek, a member of the House Armed Services Committee.
<P>"Since President Bush declared 'mission accomplished' on May 1, 126 
American soldiers have died in Iraq, and we are losing more every day," 
Tauscher said. "If that's not imminent danger, I don't know what is."
<P>The Senate bill calls for making permanent the increases in combat pay -- 
the first in more than a decade -- for service in Iraq and Afghanistan. The 
House wants to pay more for service in those two countries than for such 
duties as peacekeeping in the Balkans. With the money saved, the House wants 
to increase the size of the active military by 6,200 troops.
<P>What won't be clear until Congress returns is whether the Pentagon will 
lobby against keeping the increase.
<P>The Pentagon reiterated Wednesday that its goal was for service personnel 
to rotate out of Iraq after a maximum of a year in that country. Units of the 
Army's 3rd Infantry Division, which played a major role in last March's 
invasion, have already come home.
<P> <b>By the numbers</b>
<P>U.S. troops in Iraq: 148,000
<P>U.S. troops in Afghanistan: 9,000
<P>Imminent danger pay: $225 per month, but is scheduled to drop to $150 a 
month
<P>Family separation allowances: $250 per month, but scheduled to drop to $100 
per month</p>
