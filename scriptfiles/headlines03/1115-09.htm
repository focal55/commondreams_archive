<p>MOSUL, Iraq  - A guerrilla attack brought down two  U.S. Black Hawk helicopters in Iraq on Saturday, killing 17  people, just hours after the unveiling of a faster timetable  for self-rule which Washington hopes will pacify Iraqi  resentment.<p> 
			
							A U.S. officer at the scene said one of the helicopters was  hit on the tail by a rocket-propelled grenade. Witnesses said  it then collided with another helicopter, and both crashed.<p> 
			
							"I was watching TV when I heard a large explosion," said  local man Mohammad Badran. "I looked outside the window and saw  two helicopters. One was flying low and was on fire. The other  was higher up. The first one climbed and hit the higher one."<p> 
			
							A U.S. Army spokesman in Baghdad said nine people were  wounded in the crash of the helicopters, which belonged to the  101st Airborne Division. Sirens wailed and U.S. soldiers sealed  off the area.<p> 
			
							Facing a mounting death toll and increasingly audacious  guerrilla attacks, Washington has been pushing for a speedier  transition to Iraqi self-government.<p> 
			
							Iraq's U.S. administrator Paul Bremer was recalled to  Washington earlier this week for hastily convened talks on the  situation in Iraq. On his return to Baghdad, the U.S.-appointed  Iraqi Governing Council unveiled a new political timetable.<p>

  </table></font>NEW TIMETABLE FOR DEMOCRACY<p> 
			
							Jalal Talabani, current president of the council, said a  sovereign Iraqi government would take over power from occupying  forces by the end of June. The government would be selected by  a transitional assembly to be picked by May by caucuses in each  of Iraq's 18 provinces.<p> 
			
							A constitution would be written and democratic elections  held by the end of 2005, Talabani said.<p> 
			
							"I am very happy and proud. The dream of the Iraqi people  has been achieved today," Talabani said. Once sovereignty was  transferred, "the state of occupation would end," he added.<p> 
			
							While Iraq will no longer legally be in a state of  occupation, Washington fully expects any new government to  request a sizeable U.S.-led force to remain in the country.<p> 
			
							"The presence of the forces of the United States and other  countries will be discussed by the transitional government,"  Talabani said. "If we need them to stay, we will ask them to  stay. If we don't, we will respectfully ask them to leave."<p> 
			
							In Washington, President Bush issued a statement welcoming  the new timetable.<p> 
			
							Adnan Pachachi, another member of the Governing Council,  said the United States had now agreed to act on Iraqi  aspirations for self-rule.<p> 
			
							"I think they have responded to our insistent desire that  we should rule ourselves and we should have an elected  government, and I'm very glad to see that our point of view and  their point of view have coincided," he told a news conference.<p> 
			
							BOMB ATACK<p> 
			
							Bush has said U.S. troops will stay until Iraq is  stabilized. But more than seven months after U.S.-led invasion  forces ousted Saddam Hussein, the country is far from calm.<p> 
			
							The U.S. military said a U.S. soldier was killed and two  soldiers were wounded in Baghdad by a bomb on Saturday.<p> 
			
							Before Saturday's crash of the Black Hawks, 160 U.S.  soldiers had already been killed in action in Iraq since Bush  declared major combat over on May 1.<p> 
			
							U.S. forces in Baghdad have hit back with "Operation Iron  Hammer," using air and ground strikes to destroy buildings they  say were used by guerrillas.<p> 
			
							On November 2, guerrillas shot down a U.S. Chinook  helicopter west of Baghdad, killing 16 soldiers in the  deadliest single strike against American troops since the war  to oust Saddam Hussein began. On November 7 a Black Hawk was  shot down in Saddam's hometown of Tikrit, killing all six  aboard.<p> 
			
							The bodies of 16 Italian military personnel and two  civilians killed in a suicide bombing in the southern Iraqi  town of Nassiriya on Wednesday were returned on Saturday to  Rome. They were met by grieving families and military honors.<p> 
			
							Another soldier wounded in the blast died in Kuwait on  Saturday. State funerals for those killed in Italy's worst  military disaster since World War II will be held on Tuesday.<p> 
			
							A Portuguese radio reporter kidnapped in southern Iraq has  been released unharmed, his station reported on Saturday.  Carlos Raleiras of private radio station TSF was released in  the Iraqi desert a few miles from the Kuwaiti border, TSF said.  It said he had contacted the station.<p> 
			
							Raleiras was seized on Friday by gunmen who opened fire on  a caravan of cars carrying Portuguese reporters.<p>
