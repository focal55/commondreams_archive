<p>NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- A top Indian official says New Delhi will not be sending peacekeeping troops to Iraq, despite repeated requests from the United States.

  </table></font>The senior defense official told CNN on Friday that India cannot spare any troops to help out in the Middle Eastern nation. 

<p>Speaking on condition of anonymity, the official said while no official decision had yet been made "the internal situation in the North-Western Sector is such that we can't afford to send any troops for peacekeeping." 

<p>The official was referring to the army's commitments in Jammu and Kashmir, where a separatist insurgency has left tens of thousands of people dead. 

<p>Indian forces are also deployed along the Line of Control that divides Kashmir between India and Pakistan. The Indian army says one-fourth of its troops (250,000 men) are in Jammu and Kashmir. 

<p>The official said the same "internal situation" makes it difficult to respond to U.S. requests for troops to Liberia and Afghanistan as well. 

<p>In a Cabinet meeting in mid-July, the Indian government said it would send troops to Iraq only with an explicit U.N. mandate asking for them, and even then they would only serve under the U.N. flag. 

<p>The decision was made after a formal U.S. request asking for about 17,000 Indian troops. 

<p>Instead, Indian External Affairs Minister Yashwant Sinha said India will continue its humanitarian efforts in both Iraq and Afghanistan. 

<p>The defense official's remarks comes at a time when U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Christina Rocca is visiting New Delhi. 

<p>Asked about reports she was on a mission to press for Indian troops in Iraq, Rocca denied that was the purpose of the visit. 

<p>She said she was here to build on bilateral ties between India and the United States.
