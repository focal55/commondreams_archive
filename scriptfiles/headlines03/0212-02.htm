<p>First lady Laura Bush was planning to host a celebration of American 

poetry at the White House today. Instead, poets all over the world will read 

verse protesting the possible war in Iraq.

<P>Bush's "Poetry and the American Voice" symposium was canceled after several 

prominent poets -- including former U.S. poet laureates Rita Dove and Stanley 

Kunitz -- declined her invitation. The White House feared the event would 

become less a literary event than a political forum.

<P>Instead of booking flights to Washington, many poets contributed anti-war 

poems to a hastily created Web site. The protest took on a life of its own, 

and now more than 150 events are scheduled for today in U.S. cities such as 

San Francisco and New York, Tuscaloosa, Ala., and Dubuque, Iowa. Overseas, 

there will be readings in Guadalajara, Mexico, Oslo, Norway, and Oxford, 

England. There will be at least four events today in the Bay Area.

<P>One of the invited poets, Sam Hamill, co-founder of poetry publisher Copper 

Canyon Press in Port Townsend, Wash., declined with a flourish. He urged 

friends to observe "A National Day of Poetry Against the War" and to 

contribute anti-war poems to a new Web site, <A href="http://www.poetsagainstthewar.org" target="_new">www.poetsagainstthewar.org</A>. He 

said he planned to present a printed version of the poems to the White House 

on Feb. 12.

<P>Word spread, and more than 5,300 poems were collected, many from the 

brightest literary talents in America, including Adrienne Rich, Lawrence 

Ferlinghetti, Philip Levine and Diane DiPrima. Hamill said he had expected 

about 50 responses.

<P>"It was never my intention to close down her poetry tea party," Hamill said,

<P>"but I had to make a statement. There isn't just a war being planned against 

Iraq, there's a war going on against the Constitution."

<P>After Bush, who has hosted several lively literary events at the White 

House, postponed the event late last month, her office issued a statement: 

"While Mrs. Bush understands the right of all Americans to express their 

political views, this event was designed to celebrate poetry." The symposium 

has not been rescheduled.

<P>Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Philip Levine, who lives in Fresno and New York,

<P>said that after he received his invitation, "I didn't have time to think 

about much of anything before the phone began to ring. I realized right away 

there was a sort of industry being created not to go to the White House."

<P>He has fond memories of poetry nights during both the Carter and Clinton 

administrations. "I can see poets of all kinds going to the White House in 

World War II. But this war -- it's all too disguised to limit our personal 

rights, to make sure Bush gets a second term, and to show the world that we're 

serious about pre-emptive action and everybody better be good little children 

or else."

<P>Poets not invited to the White House event also joined the protest.

<P>Poet Carolyn Kizer of Sonoma, the first director of the Literature Program 

at the National Endowment for the Arts, from 1965 to '70, said, "As soon as I 

heard about the protest, I hastily sent off a poem." Of the current 

administration, she said, "They are leading us down the road to terrible 

tragedy."

<P>San Francisco poet DiPrima contributed a poem called "Good Clean Fun," 

written in the early '90s, to Hamill's Web site. "I was sick with thinking 

about how often terrorist acts are perpetuated by our government and not 

called terrorism," she said. DiPrima said the importance of poetry had been 

building since Sept. 11. She has helped to launch "peace readings" on the 

anniversary of that day.

<P>When Reiko Redmonde, events coordinator of the all-volunteer collective 

Revolution Books in Berkeley, heard about the Web site, she sprang into action.

<P>"We thought it was so wonderful, we called poets we knew, and they called 

poets they knew, young and old, from all over the Bay Area." The store quickly 

set up a reading of anti-war poetry, scheduled for 7:30 tonight.
