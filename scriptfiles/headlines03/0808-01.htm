<p>Several U.S. Army soldiers in Iraq <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/0716-04.htm">who expressed anger last month</a> toward Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld after their tours of duty were extended have not been punished but have received warnings about respecting the chain of command, according to a senior Army officer.</p>
    <p>In a July 16 appearance on ABC's "Good Morning America," the unnamed soldiers, all members of the 3rd Infantry Division, echoed frustration widely felt at delays in plans to bring them home. "If Donald Rumsfeld was here, I'd ask him for his resignation," one said. </p>
    <p>The remarks drew a rebuke from Army Gen. John P. Abizaid, the top U.S. commander in the region. He warned that troops were not "free to say anything disparaging about" the defense secretary or the president, and said disciplinary action would be up to "the commanders on the scene."</p>
    <p>"Those soldiers were not formally disciplined per se," said a senior Army officer in Washington who declined to be named. Instead, the soldiers received "a good talk" from senior noncommissioned officers who "reinforced their obligations as soldiers to respect their military and civilian chain of command," the officer added.</p>
    <p>Top defense officials showed little sign this week of having pursued the case. "I haven't even asked," Gen. John Keane, the Army's vice chief of staff, told reporters who questioned him Tuesday. But Keane also reiterated the warning to troops to watch what they say about leaders.</p>
    <p>"I don't believe that anyone who's wearing a uniform in this country in a public forum should be critical of the chain of command. Period," the general said. "The chain of command is fundamental to the operating of our military organizations. There are places to disagree with the chain of command, and it's appropriate for military leaders to do so. And that should be done in a private fashion, not in a public fashion." </p>
