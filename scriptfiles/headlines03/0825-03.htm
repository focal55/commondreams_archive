<p>The United States has asked Israel to check the
possibility of pumping oil from Iraq to the oil
refineries in Haifa. The request came in a
telegram last week from a senior Pentagon official
to a top Foreign Ministry official in Jerusalem. 
<p>The Prime Minister's Office, which views the pipeline to  Haifa as a "bonus" the U.S.  could give to Israel in return  for its unequivocal support for  the American-led campaign in  Iraq, had asked the Americans  for the official telegram.

<p>The new pipeline would take oil 
      from the Kirkuk area, where some 40 percent of  Iraqi oil is produced, and transport it via  Mosul, and then across Jordan to Israel. The  U.S. telegram included a request for a cost  estimate for repairing the Mosul-Haifa pipeline  that was in use prior to 1948. During the War  of Independence, the Iraqis stopped the flow of  oil to Haifa and the pipeline fell into  disrepair over the years.

<p>The National Infrastructure Ministry has  recently conducted research indicating that  construction of a 42-inch diameter pipeline  between Kirkuk and Haifa would cost about  $400,000 per kilometer. The old Mosul-Haifa  pipeline was only 8 inches in diameter.

<p>National Infrastructure Minister Yosef Paritzky  said yesterday that the port of Haifa is an  attractive destination for Iraqi oil and that  he plans to discuss this matter with the U.S.  secretary of energy during his planned visit to  Washington next month. Paritzky added that the  plan depends on Jordan's consent and that  Jordan would receive a transit fee for allowing  the oil to piped through its territory. The  minister noted, however, that "due to pan-Arab  concerns, it will be hard for the Jordanians to  agree to the flow of Iraqi oil via Jordan and  Israel."

<p>Sources in Jerusalem confirmed yesterday that  the Americans are looking into the possibility  of laying a new pipeline via Jordan and Israel.  (There is also a pipeline running via Syria  that has not been used in some three decades.)

<p>Iraqi oil is now being transported via Turkey to  a small Mediterranean port near the Syrian  border. The transit fee collected by Turkey is  an important source of revenue for the country.  This line has been damaged by sabotage twice in  recent weeks and is presently out of service.

<p>In response to rumors about the possible  Kirkuk-Mosul-Haifa pipeline, Turkey has warned  Israel that it would regard this development as  a serious blow to Turkish-Israeli relations.

<p>Sources in Jerusalem suggest that the American  hints about the alternative pipeline are part  of an attempt to apply pressure on Turkey.

<p>Iraq is one of the world's largest oil  producers, with the potential of reaching about  2.5 million barrels a day. Oil exports were  halted after the Gulf War in 1991 and then were  allowed again on a limited basis (1.5 million  barrels per day) to finance the import of food  and medicines. Iraq is currently exporting  several hundred thousand barrels of oil per  day.

<p>During his visit to Washington in about two  weeks, Paritzky also plans to discuss the  possibility of U.S. and international  assistance for joint Israeli-Palestinian  projects in the areas of energy and  infrastructure, natural gas, desalination and  electricity.
