<p>WASHINGTON  - A federal appeals court on Thursday  refused to reconsider its ruling against Vice President Cheney  in his effort to keep secret the documents of his energy task  force.<P>

  </table></font>The U.S. Court of Appeals voted 5-3 against rehearing the  case, leaving Cheney and his Justice Department lawyers with  the option of either appealing to the U.S. Supreme Court or  complying with a lower court order to release information about  White House contacts with the energy industry.<P>
"We're going to review it and make a determination what our  next step will be," a Justice Department spokeswoman said of  the ruling.<P>
One of the groups suing for the information, Judicial  Watch, said it hoped the White House would now produce the  sought-after list of its contacts with the energy industry  while the task force was writing energy policy in 2001.<P>
"People deserve to have all the facts, to prevent future  energy problems like the recent blackout," Judicial Watch's  general counsel Larry Klayman said.<P>
"They (the Bush administration) are going to be held  accountable if they continue to obstruct, and we have other  problems with our energy grid."<P>
A three-judge panel of the appeals court had decided in  July that it would not intervene to stop the lawsuit delving  into Cheney's energy contacts.<P>
But in August lawyers at the Justice Department asked the  full appeals court to reconsider the case, arguing that it  presented important separation of powers questions.<P>
In its one-paragraph refusal on Thursday, the appeals court  gave no reasons for its decision.<P>
Judicial Watch and the environmental group Sierra Club  allege that as he drafted energy policy, Cheney consulted with  industry executives such as former Enron Corp. . chief Ken Lay  and left environmentalists out in the cold.<P>
Cheney has acknowledged meeting Lay, but his lawyers argue  that the task force was comprised of government officials, not  corporate chieftains. The Bush administration has released  thousands of pages of information from agencies involved in  drafting the energy policy, but none from the White House.
