<p>Gov.-elect Arnold Schwarzenegger is preparing a push to deregulate the 
state's electricity markets -- a move embraced by business leaders and some 
energy analysts but criticized by many Democrats and consumer advocates as a 
return to the failed policies that sparked California's energy crisis.

</table>Although the new Republican governor-elect will be consumed at first with 
tackling the state's budget woes, his advisers say he will push changes next 
year aimed at lowering energy costs for industry and large power users while 
encouraging energy firms to build more power plants to help meet rising demand.
<P>The actor-turned-politician made little mention of his plan to reduce state 
regulation of energy markets during the recall race, devoting his time instead 
to bashing Gov. Gray Davis for saddling the state with expensive long-term 
contracts for power. But with many of those contracts set to expire in the 
next two years, the governor-elect will have to present his solutions or risk 
facing his own energy crisis.
<P>"We will need more power, and we have to make some serious decisions about 
how that's going to happen," said Severin Borenstein, director of the 
University of California Energy Institute. "For the next six months or so, 
we're in good shape, but if we put it off for a year or a year and a half, 
then we're going to be under real pressure."
<P>Schwarzenegger's energy strategy is being driven by some of the same 
members of former Gov. Pete Wilson's team who led the push for energy 
deregulation in the mid-1990s. The governor-elect, for example, picked for his 
transition team Jessie Knight, a former Wilson appointee to the Public 
Utilities Commission and a leading proponent of deregulation.
<P>Consumer groups already are warning that the proposals made by 
Schwarzenegger during the campaign would expose electricity users to greater 
fluctuations in prices while limiting state oversight of power trading -- a 
combination that could allow the type of market manipulation that plagued 
California during the state's energy crisis in 2000-01.
<P><b>DEREGULATION HAS BEEN COSTLY</b>
<P>"Deregulation has already cost the state $50 billion, give or take," said 
Mike Florio, senior attorney for The Utility Reform Network. "Why on earth 
anyone would want to do that again is mystifying to us."
<P>Florio also said he was suspicious of Schwarzenegger's idea because former 
Enron Corp. Chairman and CEO Ken Lay met with the actor and others in the 
spring of 2001, when Lay was pushing deregulation in California. 
Schwarzenegger has said he doesn't remember details of the meeting.
<P>But supporters of Schwarzenegger's energy proposals say they steer clear of 
the flaws that bedeviled the 1996 deregulation plan passed by the Legislature 
and signed by Wilson. Most importantly, the governor-elect would not restrict 
utilities from entering into long-term contracts for power. The restriction 
imposed by the 1996 deregulation plan forced Pacific Gas & Electric and other 
utilities to buy at peak prices on the spot market. The earlier deregulation 
scheme also included a rate freeze that barred utilities from passing along 
the increased costs to customers.
<P>Under Schwarzenegger's plan, large industrial and commercial energy users 
would be allowed to sign contracts and buy cheap power from private generators 
instead of the utilities. Called "direct access," this central provision of 
the Wilson plan was abandoned during the energy crisis. While large users who 
were in the program were allowed to stay, the state barred any new businesses 
from contracting out for power.
<P><b>2 MARKETS FOR ELECTRICITY
</b>
<P>The proposal would create two markets for electricity: Residential users 
and small businesses would continue to get power from the state's utilities, 
while large users could take their chances with private energy firms.
<P>Erik Saltmarsh, director of the state's Electricity Oversight Board, said 
the plan carries risks for large users if they make deals with energy-trading 
firms that later go belly up -- such as Enron.
<P>"There is a certain amount of fairness in saying, 'Let them take the risk,' 
" Saltmarsh said.
<P>PUC Commissioner Jeff Brown opposes the plan, saying it would leave 
residential users and small businesses to pay off the billions of dollars of 
debts racked up by PG&E and other utilities during the energy crisis.
<P>"If you have customers, usually large-scale customers, depart from the 
utilities, it leaves everyone else behind paying the bill," Brown said.
<P>Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of the Sacramento-based Independent 
Energy Producers, an industry group, said any business that joined the "direct 
access" program would likely pay a surcharge to cover the past debts.
<P>Republicans have long argued that consumers would have reduced their power 
usage during the energy crisis if they had been forced to pay the high prices 
that utilities were incurring on the wholesale market. So Schwarzenegger is 
calling for a system of "real-time pricing" where large users would pay more 
for power during peak periods and less during off-peak times. Sophisticated 
meters already installed at most industrial sites could even shut off power 
when supplies are too tight.
<P><b>BUFFER AGAINST BLACKOUTS</b>
<P>The plan would also mandate that utilities meet minimum reserve 
requirements to provide a buffer of extra energy in the system to avoid 
blackouts.
<P>"Most of the plan is quite encouraging," Borenstein said. "It seems to 
recognize that there are benefits from using market incentives in some places, 
but it also recognizes that there are risks and those risks need to be dealt 
with."
<P>The Republican governor-elect also embraced a proposal by the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission to consolidate local grid operators -- such as 
California's Independent System Operator (ISO) -- into a regional organization 
that would oversee power transmission across a number of Western states. 
Proponents claim that standardizing the transmission system would encourage 
energy firms to invest in new plants, preventing supply shortages.
<P>But the proposal, which has been debated as part of the federal energy bill 
in Washington, has faced heavy resistance from lawmakers in Western and 
Southern states, who fear a loss of control over the power grid.
<P>"The states don't want to go there," said PUC Commissioner Loretta Lynch, a 
Democrat. "The Western governors are against it, the Southern governors are 
against it. The only people who are for it are the energy companies and 
deregulation ideologues."
<P>Democratic lawmakers in Sacramento are already warning that they would 
block any effort to push another deregulation plan through the Legislature.
<P>"Not only is the Legislature in no mood for it, the Legislature's 
position is really a reflection of the fact that the public is in no mood for 
it," said state Sen. Joseph Dunn, D-Garden Grove (Orange County), who is 
planning an initiative for the November 2004 ballot to regulate energy firms 
that do business in California. "The polling shows that 75 percent of 
Californians want to re-regulate the electricity system."
<P>Schwarzenegger will also face opposition from the state PUC, which is 
stacked with five Davis appointees. However, two of the most pro-regulation 
commissioners -- Lynch and Carl Wood -- end their terms at the end of next 
year, allowing the governor-elect to shake up the commission.</p>
