<p>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. --
Less than a week after the highest court in Massachusetts ruled that 
gay marriages are permissible under the state constitution, this city is 
poised to become the first in the nation to recognize same-sex marriages.
<P>Members of the city council say they will ignore a warning from 
Republican Gov. Mitt Romney to table the issue while the state Legislature 
crafts a response to the court's ruling. And those council members say they 
have the votes to approve a resolution tonight condoning the unions.
<P>"When you protect a small group of people's rights, you protect all 
people's right," said Councilor Denise Simmons. "We're doing the right thing."
<P>The ruling from the Supreme Judicial Court gave the Legislature 180 days 
to amend the state's marriage laws to include same-sex couples. Romney has 
threatened to reject marriage licenses issued to any gay couples before the 
expiration of that six-month period.
<P>"I would hope that any city or any licensing authority would respect the 
decision of the court," said Attorney General Thomas Reilly. "The Legislature 
has some time here to deal with that."
<P>But the councilors of Cambridge, a liberal city on the Charles River and 
home of Harvard University, are not waiting for permission to act. Simmons 
pledged to defy Romney's threat and take up the resolution tonight.
<P>National gay rights groups have descended upon Massachusetts to lobby 
lawmakers to comply with last Tuesday's ruling and permit gay marriage 
throughout the state. The decision sets the stage for gay marriage legislation 
that would surpass domestic partnership rights codified in California, Vermont,
and other states.
<P>The National Center for Lesbian Rights, a San Francisco-based civil 
rights group, celebrated the decision, calling it a "monumental" victory. 
"Things will never be the same," the group said.
<P>"Nothing short of marriage can provide the protections, obligations and 
benefits of marriage," said Winnie Stachelberg, political director of Human 
Rights Campaign, an advocacy group in Washington.
<P>So far, Cambridge is the only Massachusetts city considering an immediate 
policy change following the ruling, said Linda E. Hutchenrider, president of 
the Massachusetts Town Clerks' Association.
<P>Even in Provincetown, a Cape Cod community in which 701 gay couples have 
registered since 1993, the assistant town clerk, Aaron Leventman, said he has 
informed more than 20 people since Tuesday that they remain ineligible for 
marriage licenses.
<P>"We've been getting calls from people asking if they can get married 
today," he said. "People from all over the country will come here to get 
married. It has the reputation of being a gay mecca."
<P>The marriage proposal in Cambridge has four sponsors on the nine-member 
council; it needs one additional vote to gain passage.
<P>Simmons, who is openly gay, and Councilor Brian Murphy submitted the 
proposal on Tuesday, hours after the court ruling. On Wednesday, two other 
councilors, Kenneth Reeves and Marjorie Decker, endorsed the measure. Decker 
and Simmons said they believe the fifth vote is certain.
<P>The city has a history of advocating for gay rights. In 1992, the Council 
passed an ordinance granting healthcare to the domestic partners and children 
of gay employees. The policy stood until last year, when a judge ruled it 
illegal, leaving 100 families without medical benefits.
<P>Decker said Tuesday's ruling means benefits will be returned to those 
families. "I would be surprised if this didn't pass close to unanimous," she 
said.
<P>Fifty percent of Massachusetts residents surveyed for a Boston Globe/WBZ-
TV poll released Sunday said they agreed with the Supreme Judicial Court 
ruling, while 38 percent opposed it. A separate Boston Sunday Herald poll 
found 49 percent said they support legalizing gay marriage, while 38 percent 
oppose it. Both polls, conducted after Tuesday's decision, had margins of 
sampling error of plus or minus 5 percentage points.
<P>The polls appear to show more support for gay couples in Massachusetts 
than the nation as a whole. A recent national poll by the Pew Research Center 
for People and the Press found Americans oppose legalizing gay marriage, 59 
percent to 32 percent. That survey, conducted Oct. 15-19, had a margin of 
sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
<P>Sue Hyde, 51, said she and her partner of 18 years, who are raising two 
children, had little interest in getting married in Vermont or Canada. But the 
court ruling, she said, has created an opportunity.
<P>"We've discussed it over the years, never with the idea we'd be able to 
do it in our home state," she said. "It's an exciting possibility."</p>
