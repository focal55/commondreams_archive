<p>When the history of our descent into Orwellian surveillance comes to be written, 2003 will stand out. And the names that will be most prominent in that context, oddly enough, will not be David Blunkett and John Ashcroft (pernicious though their initiatives have been), but Wal-Mart, Tesco and Gillette - firms linked by a strange acronym: RFID. <P>RFID stands for radio frequency identification, and it's going to replace bar codes. Whereas nowadays every product has a bar code printed on it somewhere, within a few years every packet will have an RFID tag printed on it somewhere. This tag is in fact a tiny microchip that broadcasts its 96-digit identity code via very low-power radio. The ID code   can be 'read' by special devices located in the vicinity - in supermarket shelves and tills, microwave ovens, fork-lift trucks and so on. If the readers are connected to a network they look up the code in a database, identify the relevant product, and take appropriate action.  <P>As usual, proponents of the technology paint a glowing image of the future - a world in which you can put some RFID-tagged chilled food in your RFID-enabled microwave oven, which reads the tag, checks the identity on the internet, looks up a database for cooking instructions and automatically gives it the appropriate burst of radiation. Bingo! - a perfectly cooked meal without any human intervention.  <P>By the same token, supermarket shelves will 'know' what they're carrying, display the correct price automatically - and alert the warehouse when stocks are running low (important since $30 billion of sales are 'lost' each year because goods are out of stock.) And checkout queues will disappear from supermarkets because you will just wheel your trolley past a RFID-reading station   and pay the amount on the display. No unloading, scanning and packing. Think of the RFID tag as a bar code that scans itself.  <P>RFID has been on the horizon for a while, so why will the year 2003 seem significant? Because in June, Wal-Mart - the 800lb gorilla of the retailing business - announced that it would require all of its suppliers to put RFID tags on their products by 2005. And in the UK, Tesco - which had already been experimenting with the tags on DVDs and Gillette razor blades - has announced that it will introduce RFID into its supply chain by 2007.  <P>So what's the problem? Well, although the economic case for RFID technology is compelling, it also represents a step-change in the technology of surveillance. It offers the potential of tracking every object ever made - every shirt, book, DVD, record and banknote. According to engineering trade paper  EE Times the European Central Bank is working on a hush-hush project to embed RFID into the fibres of every euro note by 2005 as an anti-counterfeiting device. And a school in Buffalo, New York has already deployed it as a pupil-monitoring system - recording the time they arrive in the morning. Next steps involve using RFID to track library loans, disciplinary records, cafeteria purchases and visits to the nurse's office - and eventually to track punctuality for every class and verify the time they get on and off school buses.  
<P>You can see where this is heading. It's not clear whether RFID is as powerful as some people fear (the tags can be blocked by aluminum foil and other substances). For the retail and security industries, RFID is wonderful, but its deployment will need to be controlled to protect consumer privacy and prevent abuse by private bodies and public authorities. For example, shops should be forced to switch off or wipe the tags after the goods have been through the checkout.  
<P>We will certainly need new legislation to regulate this monster - which will arrive much more quickly than was originally predicted. I wonder if anyone in Whitehall is listening?
