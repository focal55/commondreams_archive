<p>United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan warned of rising hostility between Islam and the West, describing it as "ugly, dangerous and wrong".

<p>In a statement to the opening of a summit of the 57-member Organisation of the Islamic Conference, Annan said Western governments must address the grievances of Muslims, while Islamic states needed to make greater efforts to overcome their problems.

<p>He said he hoped to see Christians and Muslims reconciling in Sudan and perhaps Cyprus.

<p>"Yet there is, in too many places, a feeling of rising hostility between Islam and the West. This is ugly, dangerous and wrong," said the statement delivered by the UN special representative to Afghanistan, Lakhdar Brahimi.

<p>"We must unite our efforts to address the extremism that is, alas, on the rise, not only in Islam but among many faiths," said Annan, who withdrew from the summit after the Iraq issue was taken back to the UN Security Council.

<p>He said Western governments must match their rhetoric of respect for human freedom with action to promote development, including a fair world trading system.

<p>But he told the Muslim leaders -- who represent 1.3 billion people -- they also had to play their part.

<p>Muslims are dismayed by the apparent inability of Islamic states to do much about problems such as weak government systems, a lack of democracy and poor human rights, especially for women, he said.

<p>Extremist dogmas are gaining ground, impeding the progress of the Muslim community and threatening the security of people all over the world, he said.

<p>Only when Muslims enjoy fundamental rights will the Islamic world be able to assert its influence.

<p>"The Muslim peoples are capable of much greater things and they know it," Annan said.

<p>The UN leader said the Palestinian people were suffering under "a harsh and prolonged occupation" and no one should be surprised at their feelings of humiliation, anger and despair.

<p>"However, suicide bombings, in which hundreds of Israeli civilians have been indiscriminately killed, are not acceptable."

<p>"These acts of terrorism, abhorred and rejected by all of you, defile and damage even the most legitimate cause."

<p>The roadmap peace plan for the Middle East, drawn up by Russia, the United States, European Union and the UN, is the only hope for freedom for Palestinians and security for Israel, he said. 

<p>The roadmap envisages a Palestinian state being created by 2005 with security guarantees for Israel.

<p>"If it fails, I fear the region will recede even further into violence and misery," Annan said, appealing for support for the peace plan from Muslim states.

<p>The Palestinian cause has been the main uniting force for the OIC, which was formed in 1969 after the burning of the al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem.
