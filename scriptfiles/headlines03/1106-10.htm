<p>WASHINGTON  - The AFL-CIO's largest union endorsed  Democratic presidential contender Howard Dean on Thursday,  political sources said, providing his campaign a huge boost in  momentum and grass roots muscle.<p> 
			
							The executive board of the 1.6 million-member Service  Employees International Union, one of the nation's most diverse  and politically active labor unions, backed the former Vermont  governor over his eight Democratic rivals after a meeting in  Washington.<p> 
			
							"We have reached a decision and we are hopeful there are  other unions who share our excitement for Dr. Dean's  candidacy," said SEIU President Andrew Stern, who declined to  formally announce the endorsement until another major AFL-CIO  union makes its endorsement decision next week.<p> 
			
							Stern, with Dean standing at his side wearing a SEIU  jacket, said he had been asked by the president of the American  Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees to wait to  announce the decision until after it meets next Wednesday.<p> 
			
							But several of the 63 members of SEIU executive board said  there was widespread enthusiasm for Dean's candidacy as they  decided to make the endorsement.<p> 
			
							The highly coveted endorsement will give Dean's insurgent,  Internet-driven campaign a more mainstream source of party  backing and could begin to ease Democratic complaints that his  support is concentrated too heavily on white, upper and  middle-class liberals.<p> 
			
							It also enhances his grass roots organizational reach, with  the union promising to mobilize supporters to help Dean in the  early caucus state of Iowa, where he is battling Rep. Richard  Gephardt of Missouri for the top spot in polls, and in the  first primary state of New Hampshire, where he has opened up a  wide lead.<p> 
			
							BLOW TO GEPHARDT<p> 
			
							The move is a blow to Gephardt, who has strong labor  support nationwide and the backing of 20 international unions.  Gephardt is counting on labor to put him over the top in Iowa  and elsewhere, but failed to win the backing of the full  AFL-CIO labor federation last month.<p> 
			
							The endorsement could open the door for more labor support  for Dean, perhaps even from the influential 1.4 million- member  AFSCME.<p> 
			
							The show of support also comes at a good time for Dean, who  has been caught in a firestorm of criticism all week for saying  he wanted to be the candidate for "guys with Confederate flags"  in their pickup trucks.<p> 
			
							The comment drew charges that Dean was insensitive to  blacks and demands that he apologize, and caused Dean on  Wednesday to say he regretted the pain he may have caused  African-Americans or Southern white voters.<p> 
			
							The SEIU is one of labor's most diverse unions. A majority  of members are women, 20 percent are African American and it  represents more immigrant workers than any other U.S. union.<p> 
			
							The Democratic candidates courted the SEIU's most active  members at a September meeting in Washington, and Dean told  Stern the union's backing would be crucial to help him shorten  the Democratic nominating race.<p> 
			
							The union represents about 750,000 health care workers, an  issue that Dean, a doctor, has promised to highlight during the  campaign, although he has been largely defined by his outspoken  stance against the Iraqi war.<p> 
			
							Dean picked up his first AFL-CIO endorsement, from the  painters union, last week, along with one from the California  Teachers Association.<p>
