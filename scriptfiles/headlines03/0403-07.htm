<p>LONDON  - 



Nashville-born soul singer Edwin Starr,

whose 1970 hit "War" denounced conflict as good for "absolutely

nothing," has died aged 61 from a heart attack at his home in

central England, his manager said on Thursday.

</table></font>"Edwin passed away at his Nottingham home on Wednesday

afternoon following a heart attack," manager Lilian Kyle told

Reuters by telephone.

 <p>

 "I am absolutely saddened and shaken up by his death. He

was performing right until the end," she said.

 <p>

 Starr -- born Charles Hatcher -- gained fame in the mid

1960s with a series of soul hits, including "Agent

Double-O-Soul," which he promoted by appearing in a short film

with original James Bond actor Sean Connery.

 <p>

 Starr signed to the Motown record label and racked up more

hits in the United States and Britain, where his gutsy and

strident style earned him a huge cult following.

 <p>

 His most memorable numbers were foot-stompers "25 Miles"

from 1969 and 1970's visceral number one hit "War," a

thundering indictment against war that earned him a Grammy

award and includes the lines: <p><i> "War has shattered many young men's dreams </i>

 <p><i>We've got no

place for it today </i>

 <p><i>They say we must fight to keep our freedom

but Lord </i>

 <p><i>There's just got to be a better way."

 </i> 

 <p>

 Starr himself served in the U.S. army for three years

before embarking on a career in music.

 <p>

 U.S. rock star Suzi Quatro, who met Starr as a teenager in

Detroit, led the tributes to the soul legend.

 <p>

 She told BBC Online: "He was the best. There was nobody

better on the stage and he was the nicest man you could ever

wish to meet."

 <p>

 Starr shifted from soul to disco in the late 1970s then

moved to Britain in the 1980s where he toured repeatedly on

oldies and soul revues.

 <p>

 More recently, he played at charity events and was due to

perform at the international music festival Womad -- World of

Music, Arts and Dance -- in Reading, southeast England, in

July.

 <p>

 In a 2000 interview with Britain's Guardian newspaper he

analyzed the secret of his success:

 <p>

 "I just take care of myself," he said. "I never drink. I've

never been involved with drugs. I don't let the business

control me. I don't feel the need to be in the public eye. I've

never searched for adulation, and I'm not gonna start, at this

point in my life, to do so."
