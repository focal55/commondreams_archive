<p>Continuing attacks on US forces in Baghdad by Iraqi fighters in 

civilian clothes produced a deadly response on Thursday, as nervous 

soldiers of the US 5th Marines opened fire repeatedly, hitting 

unarmed men, women and children. Three times in three hours I saw 

troops who had seized one of Saddam Hussein's small palaces open 

fire, killing five people and wounding five - among them a six-year- old girl who was shot in the head. Lance-Corporal Manuel Silva told 

me at the palace in Adhamiya, north of the centre, that the marines 

had heard Mr Hussein might be hiding in the area, and had come under 

sustained fire from rocket-propelled grenades and small-arms.



<p>An officer told us later that the marines had taken many 

casualties. "Their soldiers aren't wearing uniforms," Cpl Silva 

said. "You try to pick out where it is coming from and all you see is 

civilians." Half a mile away, we had seen a man in civilian clothes 

carrying a rocket-propelled grenade launcher. Around the corner, a 

dead fighter lay on the pavement by a palm tree, his face covered 

with a white cloth. He was wearing grey trousers and a dirty pink 

jumper. The marines shot anything that they considered remotely a 

threat. An old blue Volkswagen came up an alley opposite the palace 

gate. A marine on top of the stone-clad arch of the gate opened fire 

and the car crashed into a wall.



<p>We heard screaming from the alley. None of the US troops moved. If it 

had not been for Mohammed Fatnan, an Iraqi translator with the UK's 

Channel 4 News, the Americans would not have treated the casualties. 

Mr Fatnan crossed the road outside the palace under the guns of two 

marine armoured fighting vehicles and came back carrying a young 

girl, Zahra Abdel-Samii', bleeding from the head. In the alley, a man 

who had run on to his balcony upon hearing gunfire had been shot 

dead. Men wailing "There is no God but God" were hauling him into the 

back seat of a car in a blanket. Minutes later, the explosion of a 

rocket-propelled grenade thundered through the palace garden, then 

came bursts of heavy gunfire.



<p>A white Mitsubishi van roared along the main road that runs beside 

the palace wall, the driver slumped over the wheel, unconscious or 

already dead. The van veered off the road into a wall. Mr Fatnan and 

two marines ran across the road to help a woman injured in the arm 

and foot and a young man, her son, shot in the head. The dead driver 

had not understood the warning shots meant to tell him to stop. The 

marines had had enough of journalists filming. We walked slowly along 

the road outside the palace back to our van. Our driver met us with 

an account of how marines in a palace watchtower had shot dead three 

men walking up the pavement only 20 yards away from him.
