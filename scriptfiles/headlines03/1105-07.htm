  </table></font>James Willie Brown, 55, sentenced for the 1975 rape and murder of Brenda Watson, was declared dead at 8:32 pm (0132 GMT Wednesday), a spokeswoman for the Georgia Department of Corrections said.

<p>Brown had been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia 17 times, according to the Washington-based Death Penalty Information Center. A judge determined in 1981, nonetheless, that he was eligible to die for his crimes.

<p>Some 58 death row inmates have now been executed since the start of the year in the United States, according to DPIC figures.

<p>Two other mentally ill prisoners are also facing execution in North Carolina, the National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty said.

<p>Joseph Keel is scheduled for execution on November 7. He was sentenced to death in 1990 for the murder of his father-in-law. 

<p>Keel suffers from a personality disorder stemming from multiple brain injuries, ranging from pre-natal to a workplace accident, when he was struck on the head with a 725-kilogram (1,600-pound) steel beam.

<p>Another prisoner, John Dennis Daniels, was sentenced to die in 1990 for the murder of a woman. Daniels is to die November 14, despite psychiatrists' testimony that he has the intellectual development of an 11- or 12-year-old child, the coalition said in a statement.
