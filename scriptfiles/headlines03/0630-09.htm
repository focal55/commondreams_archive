</table></font>Speaking before more than 200 people at a forum at Sacred Heart University, the four-term Ohio congressman, said he would establish a "Department of Peace."

<p>An early and vocal opponent of the war in Iraq, Kucinich said the department would have various function to prevent violence both domestic and internationally. He said the department would work with the United Nations and other countries before conflicts arise.

<p>The lawmaker said his underdog bid for the nomination is gaining momentum, with endorsements and volunteers. Kucinich has hired a professional campaign staff, and expects campaign finance reports, which are due July 15, to show that he has raised more than $1 million.

<p>He dismissed the notion that he would run as an independent if he did not win the Democratic nod.

<p>"I'm a Democrat. I'm attracting people to vote - disaffected Democrats, Greens, Libertarians," he said.

<p>The forum, sponsored by <a href="http://www.culturalcreativesinaction.com/" target="_new">Cultural Creatives in Action</a>, a Connecticut-based peace group, had the feel of a 1960s peace rally, although most of the crowd was middle-aged.

<p>He drew ovations as he lashed out at the Bush administration and an expanding military budget. He said Americans "are aware their needs are not being met."

<p>Kusinich made his remarks in the back yard of another Democratic hopeful - Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman, the 2000 vice presidential candidate.

<p>The other Democratic candidates vying for the nomination are former Vermont governor Howard Dean, former Illinois Sen. Carol Moseley Braun, North Carolina Sen. John Edwards, Missouri Rep. Dick Gephardt, Florida Sen. Bob Graham, Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry and Al Sharpton of New York.
