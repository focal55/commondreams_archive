<p>MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay- 
							The Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) looks
less like a true regional integration project than a ''neo-colonialist''
plan that will make poor communities even poorer and will not respect
national sovereignty, said the Catholic bishops of the members of South
America's largest trade bloc.

<p>
   ''What we condemn is that the only aim of the project is to increase
trade flows, regardless of whether or not it devastates everything and
everyone in its path,'' the secretary-general of the bishops' conference of
Uruguay, Bishop Pablo Galimberti of the southern Uruguayan city of San José,
told IPS on Thursday.

</table>The Catholic bishops of the countries of South America's Mercosur trade
bloc -- Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay -- and the bloc's associate
members Bolivia and Chile met Tuesday through Thursday in Montevideo, the
Uruguayan capital, to discuss the challenges of integration in Latin America
and the ''ethical and moral'' aspects of the creation of the FTAA.

<p>
   The initiative promoted by the United States will create a free trade
zone made up of 34 countries -- all of the nations in the Americas with the
exception of Cuba -- with a total population of 800 million people and a
combined Gross National Product (GNP) of over 11 billion dollars by 2005.

<p>
   The main objections to the FTAA raised by the bishops were that it will
benefit the richest countries -- like the United States and Canada -- at the
expense of the less competitive members, and that it will consolidate the
hold of ''unfettered neo-liberalism'' on the entire region.

<p>
   ''Christian ethics and the Christian vision encompass everything, not
just the moral aspects,'' said Galimberti. ''They encompass the spiritual as
well as the economic. We do not separate out religious and social aspects..''

<p>
   In a statement, the bishops said the creation of the FTAA would have
''grave consequences'' due to ''the excessive disproportion of the
competitive capacities of the countries, some of which have very strong,
developed economies while others are weak.

<p>
   ''This initiative will foment the concentration of economic power in a
few hands, favoring the formation of monopolies and oligopolies, which will
end up imposing their hegemony over governments, especially in the weakest
countries in the Americas.

<p>
   ''Rather than integration, this could involve neo-colonialism, with a
negative impact on local communities...The chief aim of an initiative like
the FTAA should be to promote the common good and solidarity between
nations, and not merely to search for the greatest advantage for just a
few,'' they said.

<p>
   The bishops also expressed concern over the future of indigenous and
rural communities, ''which in this system would run the risk of being
displaced,'' from land rich in natural resources, for example.

<p>
   In addition, they said the strategic natural resources of poor nations
''should not be susceptible to appropriation by private interests.

<p>
   ''A true process of integration in the Americas should be based on a
continent-wide policy that takes into account human rights and the
principles of sovereignty, justice, solidarity and respect for the cultural
identities of nations,'' said the statement.

<p>
   The secretary-general of Brazil's bishops' conference, Bishop Odilo
Scherer of Sao Paulo, told IPS that the Brazilian Catholic Church is working
with non-governmental organizations on a campaign aimed at raising awareness
about the FTAA, which will include another ''people's referendum'' in which
Brazilians will be asked what they think about the future free trade area.

<p>
   ''We will hold an unofficial popular referendum this month to allow
Brazilians to express their opinions about the FTAA. Our big concern is
human beings, who should always take top priority,'' he said.

<p>
   In a similar ''referendum'' held in September 2002, 10 million Brazilians
said they were opposed to the free trade area, according to the organizers.
<p>
   The president of Argentina's bishops' conference, Eduardo Mirás, stressed
the negative impact that the prescriptions of the multilateral lending
institutions have had on his crisis-stricken nation.

<p>
   ''Our countries need help, without a doubt, but they don't need an
invasion of our sovereignty, which also implies a loss of our identity. By
meddling in our educational programs, for example, they are undermining
the free determination of nations,'' Mirás, the archbishop of the eastern
Argentine city of Rosario, told IPS.

<p>
   The bishops who met in Montevideo did not agree on any concrete common
strategy, nor did they decide to discuss their point of view with their
respective governments.

<p>
   ''We are making closer contact with political leaders, but we are not a
political party. This statement simply has the objective of helping to form
the faith of Christians, with a social dimension,'' said Galimberti.

<p>
   The declaration signed Thursday by the bishops of the Mercosur nations
and their associates Bolivia and Chile concurs with the pastoral letter
Ecclesia in America that Pope John Paul II made public in Mexico in 1999.

<p>
   Ecclesia in America stated that ''more and more, in many countries of the
Americas, a system known as 'neo-liberalism' prevails; based on a purely
economic conception of man, this system considers profit and the law of the
market as its only parameters, to the detriment of the dignity of and the
respect due to individuals and peoples.

<p>
   ''At times this system has become the ideological justification for
certain attitudes and behavior in the social and political spheres leading
to the neglect of the weaker members of society. Indeed, the poor are
becoming ever more numerous, victims of specific policies and structures
which are often unjust.''

<p>
   The views of the Roman Catholic Church are of great significance in the
Americas, which is home to 528 Catholic faithful, nearly half of the world's
1.1 billion Catholics, according to statistics from the Vatican.

<p>
   But Bishop Walter Pérez of the central Bolivian city of Potosí said the
Church's influence on complex social realities is often limited.

<p>
   Pérez cited the failure of the ''Reencuentro Nacional de Bolivia'', a
panel set up to seek an accord between the government of President Gonzalo
Sánchez de Lozada and the opposition, which is demanding changes in economic
policy, and is opposed to the FTAA.</p>
