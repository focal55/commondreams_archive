<p>Gov. Ryan will make U.S. history today when he announces a blanket commutation to all prisoners on Illinois' Death Row, he told the Chicago Sun-Times late Friday.<P>



&quot;I have had mixed emotions concerning this issue,&quot; Ryan told the Sun-Times explaining while he'll reduce all of the sentences to--at most--life in prison. No pardons are expected. &quot;Occasionally, it was on the front burner, sometimes on the back burner and sometimes off the burner as to what to do at all.

<P>

</table></font>&quot;I thought about it night and day. I finally came to the conclusion that this was the right decision and I'm going to have to live with it. Maybe [Saturday] morning I'll wake up and be uncomfortable with my decision. But I will live with it no matter what. I believe it's the right thing to do.&quot;

<P>Earlier Friday, in announcing his full pardon of four Death Row inmates, Ryan detailed the many ways in which he said police and prosecutors railroaded Madison Hobley on shoddy or non-existent evidence for a fire that killed his wife and child, Hobley's sister Penny held both hands over her face, crying and rocking her head.<P>



A few minutes later, when Ryan announced he was pardoning Hobley and three other Death Row inmates who said police had tortured false confessions from them, Penny Hobley and 200 other prisoners' relatives, law students and death penalty opponents jumped to their feet in a standing ovation.<P>



The Rev. Jesse Jackson leaned over and kissed Jo Ann Patterson, whose son Aaron was also freed. Patterson cried and shook her head &quot;yes&quot; as she sat in the front row at a DePaul University Law School classroom where Ryan made the announcement.<P>



Across town in Englewood, Ollie Dodd, 71, cried that Ryan was freeing Hobley, who she still believes set the fire that killed her daughter Johnnie Mae. Prosecutors around the state joined Dodd in denouncing Ryan's move.<P>



In addition to Hobley and Patterson, Ryan pardoned Stanley Howard and Leroy Orange. It was the end of a three-year crusade led by journalism professors and their students and public interest lawyers who have proven that men sitting on Illinois' Death Row were innocent.<P>



&quot;This is a watershed moment, a turning point in the debate over capital punishment,&quot; said David Elliot, spokesman for the Washington, D.C.-based National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty. &quot;Everybody is going to have to sit up and take notice that a state system was so fundamentally flawed that drastic steps had to be taken, and by a Republican nonetheless.&quot;<P>



Ryan has heard pleas from South African leaders Nelson Mandela and Desmond Tutu, from the Vatican, and from the governments of Mexico, Poland and the European Union as he decided whether to grant pardons or commutations to the 160--now 156--men on Illinois' Death Row.<P>



Today, Ryan confirmed to the Sun-Times he will continue making history by issuing a blanket commutation to all 156 inmates remaining on Death Row, likely reducing their sentences to life in prison. <P>



Ryan hinted at his decision publicly  earlier Friday when he stated, &quot;I was challenged by a young prosecutor at a conference in Oregon who asked me why, if I was so concerned about the state of our capital punishment system, I didn't just commute the cases of all inmates on Death Row. I said that was something I would have to look at.&quot; <P>



Ryan will formally announce his decisions at 1 p.m. today at Northwestern University's Law School. <P>



Even before Ryan told the Sun-Times he would issue the blanket clemency, his every word pointed in that direction, much to the frustration of prosecutors.<P>



&quot;I don't think there's any doubt in my mind what's going to happen tomorrow: We're going to see clemency granted across the board, despite what the governor has told families of the victims,&quot; a disgusted Cook County State's Attorney Dick Devine said.<P>



As the freed men emerged from prison Friday, they thanked Ryan and encouraged him to keep pardons and commutations coming.<P>



&quot;There have been innocents that have already been executed,&quot; Orange said as he emerged from Cook County Jail.<P>



Howard was the only one of the four not leaving prison Friday--he has to serve time on another conviction. But Ryan said the evidence in that case was suspicious, too, and he hopes his successor, Rod Blagojevich, will look at that case when he takes office Monday.<P>



Rolando Cruz, pardoned earlier by Ryan, said he got to know many of these men--Orange, Patterson and others--on Death Row and knew they were innocent. He is praying that Ryan also pardons Mario Flores today.<P>



Prosecutors and other Ryan critics say Ryan's motivation for granting pardons and commutations is to eclipse headlines about the federal investigation of corruption on his watch. But the lawyers and law students at DePaul called him a hero and said he should admit his actions were &quot;courageous.&quot;<P>



Ryan went through a long ridiculing of the case against Hobley, noting that police said they &quot;threw away&quot; an alleged signed confession by Hobley because coffee spilled on it.<P>



&quot;Why wouldn't you keep an important document like that?&quot; Ryan asked.<P>



Asked if he sympathized with family members of the victims of these convicted killers, Ryan said, &quot;I spent hours with them in Chicago and Springfield. I don't think anybody will ever understand the agony they go through. I can't imagine losing somebody under those conditions. I also met last Friday with family members of the condemned. That's a whole other class of victims that never get mentioned.&quot;<P>



That class was well-represented at DePaul on Friday.<P>



&quot;It has been a long, long wait, and exhausting, and I was hoping that the governor would do something before he left 'cause it seemed like we would have to start all over again, it would be another 20 years,&quot; Jo Ann Patterson said. &quot;It just makes me feel wonderful, wonderful. It's the first time I've ever seen a politician who thinks the way I think about the justice system.&quot;<P>



<P><b>What Ryan said Friday </b></p>



<P>

&quot;Three years ago, I was faced with startling information. We had exonerated not one, not two, but 13 men from Death Row. They were found innocent. Innocent of the charges for which they were sentenced to die. Can you imagine? We nearly killed innocent people, nearly injected them with a cocktail of deadly poisons so they could die in front of witnesses on a gurney in the state's death chamber. . . .<P>



&quot;How does that happen? I'm a pharmacist. If I got 50 percent of my prescriptions back because they were filled wrong I wouldn't be in business.<P>



&quot;I must share with you some startling information. There are more innocent people on Death Row.<P>



&quot;The foreman of the [Madison Hobley] jury, a suburban police officer, intimidated some jurors by laying his gun on the jury table and announcing 'We'll reach a verdict.' The jury finally came back with a guilty verdict after four days of strained deliberations.<P>



&quot;Like Madison Hobley, Stanley Howard was suffocated with a plastic bag until he confessed. His confession was obtained by Area 2 detectives. In Howard's case, medical evidence uncovered after trial directly establishes that Howard was physically harmed while in custody of the Area 2 detectives.<P>



&quot;In April of 1986, Aaron Patterson was tortured by Area 2 Violent Crimes detectives, under the direct supervision and with the active participation of Commander (Jon) Burge. . . . Detectives subsequently handcuffed Patterson behind his back, turned out the lights, suffocated him with a gray plastic typewriter cover over his head and struck him in the chest. When Patterson refused to confess, he was suffocated and beaten about the body again. He was also threatened with a gun by Burge himself.<P>



&quot;During the 17 years since his conviction, [Leroy] Orange has sought a hearing to prove that his confession was false. . . . The prosecution has opposed Orange's repeated requests on procedural grounds and even seeks to bar evidence of the torture that led to Orange's confession. . . . I'm not a lawyer . . . but how does this happen? It appears to me the system has failed Orange by relying on procedural technicalities at the exclusion of the quest for truth.<P>



&quot;What I can't understand is why the courts can't find a way to act in the interest of justice. Here we have four more men who were wrongfully convicted and sentenced to die by the state for crimes the courts should have seen they did not commit. We have evidence from four men who did not know each other, all getting beaten and tortured and convicted on the basis of confessions they allegedly provided. . . . These cases call out for justice, they cry out for reform. Their cries have fallen on deaf ears.<P>



&quot;Today, I shall be a friend to Madison Hobley, Stanley Howard, Aaron Patterson and Leroy Orange. Today I am pardoning them of the crimes for which they were wrongfully prosecuted and sentenced to die. I have reviewed these cases and I believe a manifest injustice has occurred. I have reviewed these cases and I believe these men are innocent.&quot;
