<p>BANGKOK - A conference on reproductive health began here
Monday with U.S. President George W Bush being cast as a villain for his
attempt to bully health clinics in the developing world to follow his
conservative political agenda.
</b>
<p>
   While some speakers did not specifically name the Bush White House as
they warned about the dangers that Washington's policies pose for the
Asia-Pacific - the denial of funding to groups that offer abortion-related
services -- others were more direct.
<p>
   The White House is trying to make up for what it cannot achieve
domestically by pushing its policies overseas, Nancy Northup, president of
the U.S.-based Center for Reproductive Health Rights, said in her address
on the opening morning. ''In some Asian countries, groups have stopped
performing abortions for fear of losing funding.''
<p>
   Northup also drew attention to another course of action used by
Washington to stamp its narrow reading of reproductive health in
Asia-Pacific countries - having U.S. government delegations ''turn the
clock back on reproductive rights'' at international conferences.
<p>
   Even the representatives of the two major sponsors of the conference -
the Ford Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation, both U.S.-based -- did
not spare the Bush administration from accusations on has been perceived as
an open assault on the advances made to secure reproductive health rights
over the past 10 years.
<p>
   ''We need to resist conservative efforts attempting to force us into a
moral approach than an evidence-based approach'' in shaping reproductive
health policies, Rosalia Sciortino, regional representative of the
Rockefeller Foundation, said in her remarks at the opening session.
<p>
   The Second Asia Pacific Conference on Reproductive and Sexual Health,
which runs from Oct. 6-10 in the Thai capital, has attracted some 1,500
participants, including doctors, policymakers, activists and social
workers, from 41 countries across Asia. The first conference was held two
years ago in Manila.
<p>
   The discussions this week are expected to shape a course of action to
help vulnerable communities secure noticeable improvements in their
respective reproductive health environments.
<p>
   And as was evident on the first morning, Washington's current policies
-- dubbed the Gag Rule -- have emerged as a challenge that the Asia-Pacific
countries will have to surmount in their quest for progress.
<p>
   In January 2001, the Bush administration reimposed the Gag Rule, or the
Mexico City Policy, as it is officially known. Under this policy, which was
first endorsed by former President Ronald Reagan and given further backing
during the presidency of Bush's father, the U.S. Agency for International
Development (USAID) is prohibited from giving funds to foreign
non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that have as their mission any
activities Washington sees as abortion-related.
<p>
   Such restrictions included NGOs involved in performing abortions,
offering counseling services on abortions and even those who sought to
make it a political issue by lobbying for women to have the right to
determine if she wanted to have an abortion.
<p>
   In July this year, the U.N. Population Fund (UNFPA) too became a victim
of the new conservative mood that governs Washington's thinking. The U.S.
Congress voted to stop the U.N. agency from getting its annual
contributions for the years 2004 and 2005, amounting to 100 million U.S.
dollars.
 
   The London-based International Planned Parenthood Foundation (IPPF)
estimates that close to 50 million abortions are done every year, of which
20 million are unsafe. ''This results in the death of about 78,000, but
many more suffer injuries and illnesses.''
<p>
   It adds, that ''at least a quarter of all unsafe abortions are to girls
15 to 19 years.''
<p>
   In Asia, unsafe abortions are the reason for 12 percent of all maternal
deaths, claiming the lives of 38,000 women each year, Sheila Macrae of the
UNFPA told the conference. ''This is a human tragedy that must be squarely
addressed.''
<p>
   Currently, USAID coughs up an estimated 425 million dollars annually in
assistance to 65 countries in the developing world, 16 of which are in
Asia. But in the wake of the new conditions placed on receiving such
assistance, a number of family planning associations in Asia have agreed
not to accept such funds, Northup revealed.
<p>
   But as has become increasingly obvious in some quarters, the
implications of such a decision on top of those being denied funds by
Washington can have devastating consequences on poor countries afflicted by
a host of health-related problems, including HIV/AIDS.
<p>
   Cambodia, in fact, has emerged as the prime example of how deadly the
Gag Rule can be. It is one of four Asian countries -- the others including
Bangladesh and Nepal, both with a majority of the population living on less
than 1 U.S. dollar a day, like Cambodia -- that has seen funds drying up
due to family planning programs that run counter to Washington's stance.
<p>
   This poor, war-ravaged South-east Asian country has lost over three
million dollars ''for HIV prevention, adolescent sex education and
counseling as a result of the Gag Rule, states the IPPF. 
<p>
   It comes at a time when Cambodia is staggering under the spread of HIV
infections, making it the country with the highest HIV rate in Asia.
According the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), over two
percent of the population has been struck by the pandemic.
<p>
   Besides that, Cambodia has also to grapple with its disturbing maternal
mortality rate - 900 deaths per 100,000 live births per year. By contrast,
states the IPPF, a developed country like Japan has 18 maternal mortality
cases per 100,000 live births and the region's largest country, China, has
95 maternal mortality cases per 100,000 live births.
<p>
   NGOs working in the field of reproductive health in Asia ''must make it
clear that U.S. government policies are an attack on their work,'' Northup
argued. ''The Bush administration is not going to change its stance on the
global gag rule.''
