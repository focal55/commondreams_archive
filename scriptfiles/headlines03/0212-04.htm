<p>Environmental groups asked a federal court Tuesday to halt a rule that 

they say would weaken the "dolphin safe" label on canned tuna and dramatically 

increase the number of deaths among the ocean mammals.

<P>For 12 years, the label had guaranteed consumers that the tuna was caught 

by nets that did not surround and harm dolphins. But in December, a new rule 

by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration applied the label to 

tuna captured in encircling nets.

<P>The <a href="http://www.earthisland.org/" target="_new">Earth Island Institute</a> and six other groups asked the U.S. District 

Court in San Francisco for an injunction to the new rule, arguing that science 

-- and not trade concerns -- should guide environmental policy.

<P>The fishing practice allowed by the new rule continues to kill, injure and 

harass thousands of dolphins in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean every year, 

they say. If the new rule remains in effect, it will open the U.S. market to 

supplies from Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela and Vanuatu, where vessels chase 

down and encircle dolphins to catch the tuna that swim with them.

<P>If the tougher label survives, however, the Mexican government has 

threatened to bring barrier-to-trade charges against the United States before 

the World Trade Organization.

<P>Stanley Minasian, president of the Animal Fund in San Francisco, a 

plaintiff, said the new federal rule would remove dolphin protections.

<P>"If the Latin Americans and the Bush administration have their way, 

thousands of dolphins will die every year," Minasian said. "They get caught up 

in the nets, and they drown. The mothers and babies get separated, and the 

babies die."

<P>The environmentalists' suit names the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 

Administration, whose new rule said the encircling fishing practice would no 

longer disqualify tuna from a "dolphin safe" label as long as independent on-

vessel observers certified that no dolphins had been killed or injured during 

a catch.

<P>William Hogarth, head of the oceanic administration, said there wasn't 

enough evidence to show that the encircling nets had a significant role in the 

continued decline of some dolphin species.

<P>In response to the suit, Connie Barclay, a spokeswoman for the oceanic 

administration, said, "We will review their brief and submit our own comments 

to the judge."

<P>The case goes before Judge Thelton Henderson, who over the last decade has 

generally ruled in favor of dolphin protections. He ruled in 1999 that the 

government couldn't weaken the criteria for the label in the absence of study 

showing that the fishing practice wasn't harming dolphins.

<P>Armed with recent footage taken off the Galapagos Islands showing 50 or 

more dolphins dead or dying in a purse-seine net, the environmental groups say 

they don't trust the observers, many of whom are pressured by the fishermen. 

The groups also argue that the observers can't measure stress or separation of 

mothers and babies.

<P>They cite a 100-page study prepared by the Southwest Fisheries Science 

Center in La Jolla (San Diego County), part of the Commerce Department, 

stating concerns that the "practice of chasing and encircling dolphins somehow 

is adversely affecting the ability of these depleted stocks to recover."

<P>Three weeks before Hogarth issued the new rule, Secretary of State Colin 

Powell sent a letter asking him to carefully review the evidence before making 

his decision.

<P>The Department of State has an interest in this matter, Powell wrote, 

because the finding would profoundly affect its role as leader in an 

international agreement among 14 nations and the European Union that has been 

very successful in reducing dolphin deaths.

<P>State Department officials didn't return requests for a comment on Powell's 

letter.</p>
