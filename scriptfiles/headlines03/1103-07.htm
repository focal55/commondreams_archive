<p>BRUSSELS, Belgium  - Israel expressed outrage  Monday at a European Commission opinion poll suggesting more EU  citizens see Israel as a threat to world peace than any other  country including Iran, Iraq and North Korea.
<p> 
			
EU spokesmen sought to play down the significance of the  survey while Israel and its supporters focused their fire on  the messenger rather than the message.<p> 
			
							Israel said the survey, in which 59 percent of those polled  said the country was a menace, revealed a "hidden agenda" by  the European Union executive asking the question.<p> 
			
							"They have put the Jewish state below the level of the  worst pariah states and terror organizations," Israel's mission  to the EU said in a statement.<p> 
			
							"We are not only sad but outraged. Not at European citizens  but at those who are responsible for forming public opinion."<p> 
			
							It said the poll reflected the impact of distorted media  coverage of the Middle East conflict and served to "promote a  hidden agenda of those who draft the questions in a way that  will suit their political ends."<p> 
			
							The European Commission, which published the poll Monday,  sought to play the result down as just one finding among many  in a survey on Iraq and world peace.<p> 
			
							"It is not our role or our policy to interpret each opinion  poll or to base our policy on it," spokesman Gerassimos Thomas  told the Commission's daily news briefing.<p> 
			
							"A poll is a poll, and policy is policy."<p> 
			
							The question did not mention the Palestinians because it  only referred to states, Thomas said.<p> 
			
							He insisted the questions were set by technocrats, not the  Commission's political leaders or external relations  department.<p> 
			
							It was one of 60 surveys the Commission carries out every  year seeking the views of the EU's 375 million citizens on  everything from the euro to EU enlargement.<p> 
			
							UNITED STATES SECOND<p> 
			
							Around 500 people in each EU country were asked whether  they considered 14 listed countries as threats to world peace.<p> 
			
							Close behind Israel came the United States, Iran and North  Korea, each with 53 percent. Respondents were allowed to pick  more than one country.<p> 
			
							Fifty-two percent said Iraq was a threat, 50 percent said  Afghanistan was. The other countries -- Pakistan, Syria, Libya,  Saudi Arabia, China, India, Russia and Somalia -- scored less  than 50 percent.<p> 
			
							Israel's minister for diaspora affairs and Jerusalem, Natan  Sharansky, said the survey showed that "behind the 'political'  criticism of Israel lies nothing other than pure  anti-Semitism."<p> 
			
							Israeli Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom said in a statement  the poll was "conducted in an irresponsible manner and distorts  reality," but rejected assertions it proved European  anti-Semitism.<p> 
			
							"There's no comparing the amount of media exposure Israel  gets in Europe in comparison to Iran or North Korea. The images  broadcast from here have an impact but we should not get  excited about it," Haaretz daily quoted Shalom as saying.<p> 
			
							LEADING QUESTION<p> 
			
							Italy, which holds the rotating EU presidency, stepped in  to calm the diplomatic furor, saying the findings were due to a  "leading question" and did not reflect the EU's position.<p> 
			
							"Foreign Minister Franco Frattini ... expresses surprise  and disappointment at the distorted message that emerges from  the EU poll," a statement issued by his ministry said.<p> 
			
							The Simon Wiesenthal Center, a U.S.-based Jewish rights  group, said the survey "shows that anti-Semitism is deeply  embedded within European society" and said Israel should draw  the only conclusion possible and exclude the European Union and  its members from any future Middle East peace process.
