<p>Former Vice President Walter Mondale accused President Bush on Friday of forcing democracy in Iraq and Afghanistan "at bayonet point" &#151; an approach creating more enemies for the United States than friends and doing little to prevent terrorism.</p>
<p>The administration's policies are at odds with six decades of foreign policy through Democratic and Republican administrations aimed at forming international coalitions to address national security problems, Mondale said.</p>
<p>Widely viewed as the elder statesman of Democratic politics in Minnesota, Mondale, 75, was vice president under Jimmy Carter and ran unsuccessfully for the presidency in 1984. His popularity is strong among the state's political liberals and his lecture series packs auditoriums. Last year, following the death of U.S. Sen. Paul Wellstone, he agreed to enter the U.S. Senate race in its final days, losing to Republican Norm Coleman.</p>
<p>"I cannot understand why the current administration believes that throwing all this out the window &#151; to be replaced by what I see to be their radical, unilateral, go-it-alone, in-your-face approach &#151; can strengthen America. I don't see how it can,'' Mondale said. "Their announced doctrine of pre-emption and their policy of dominance frightens our friends and fuels animosity and rage upon which our true enemies rely."</p>
<p>Mondale was joined in his pointed criticism of Bush's foreign policy by two other officials from former Democratic administrations &#151; Zbigniew Brzezinski, national security adviser in the Carter administration, and William Perry, defense secretary in the Clinton administration &#151; before an audience of 300 at Macalester College.</p>
<p>Brzezinski said the Bush administration's foreign policy can be summarized in a quote from Bush: "If you're not with us, you're against us." Brzezinski, a naturalized American born in Poland, said it's a stance "straight from (Soviet leader Vladimir) Lenin."</p>
<p>Perry said Bush's failure to work with a broad coalition of allies to halt the spread of nuclear weapons increases potential for them to fall into the hands of terrorists. "Unless stemmed, it is likely before this decade ends that nuclear bombs will be used in regional wars and terror attacks against American cities," Perry added.</p>
<p>Mondale and the others spoke out against Bush administration foreign policy as Republicans are targeting Minnesota as a state they might be able to win in the upcoming presidential election for the first time since 1972.</p>
<p>White House spokesman Jim Morrell later responded, "President Bush has committed to increasing the security and peace of the free world. We are engaged in a global war on terrorism, and the president is working with our allies to address threats to freedom-loving people everywhere."</p>
<p>Morrell said international coalitions have been formed in both Iraq and Afghanistan, and that the United States continues to reach out to its allies.</p>
<p><b>RETOOLING INTELLIGENCE</b></p>
<p>Perry said pre-emptive wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have failed because the United States lacks capabilities for gathering "human intelligence" in a world where nuclear bombs and biological weapons can be produced in small facilities indiscernible by Cold War technology and satellites.</p>
<p>Botched intelligence reports on Iraqi weapons of mass destruction have left the public skeptical of any future pre-emptive military action, Perry said.</p>
<p>Morrell responded that conclusions about whether Saddam Hussein was developing weapons of mass destruction were based not only on U.S. intelligence but on Saddam's previous development of the weapons as well as U.N. Security Council reports.</p>
<p>Perry said a better approach to safeguarding the country against terrorism would be to work with other nations to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons to rogue nations and terrorist groups.</p>
<p>"Unless this tide can be stemmed, it is likely that before this decade is over nuclear bombs will be used in regional wars &#133; and terror attacks on American cities," said Perry, who is now a professor at Stanford University.</p>
<p>He said the administration's use of pre-emptive wars in Iraq and Afghanistan leaves countries such as North Korea, which has developed nuclear capabilities, believing that nuclear weapons are the only way to defend their countries against the world's sole superpower. Perry said financially strained North Korea also has signaled its willingness to sell the weapons.</p>
<p><b>DIPLOMACY</b></p>
<p>The remarks came as part of the Mondale Lectures on Public Service at Macalester College, co-sponsored by the Hubert H. Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs at the University of Minnesota, the Minnesota Historical Society and Minnesota Public Radio.</p>
<p>An enthusiastic audience, interrupting the speakers regularly with applause, included students from Macalester, as well as Highland Park Senior High School and Minneapolis South High School.</p>
<p>"There has never been a time before when the United States was as isolated in terms of its foreign policy," said Brzezinski, who is a professor of American foreign policy at Johns Hopkins University.</p>
<p>Morrell disputed that, citing coalitions in Iraq as well as Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Brzezinski also had a tough admonition for U.S. citizens about how their response to terrorism is being viewed around the world, especially in Europe, where terrorism has been relatively constant through the 20th century and beyond.</p>
<p>"We're allowing ourselves into a state of mind that maximizes the effect of terrorism," he said.</p>
<p>American fears, Brzezinski said, have led to reactions out of sync with American values. In particular, he cited the Patriot Act, which he called "not a proud moment in our national history" and likened to the Alien and Sedition Acts and the internment of the Japanese during World War II.</p>
<p>"These are things subsequent generations are ashamed of," Brzezinski said.</p>
