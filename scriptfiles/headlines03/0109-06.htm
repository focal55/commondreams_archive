<p>San Francisco, long a stronghold of the Democratic Party, got a jolt 

Wednesday when Green Party candidate Matt Gonzalez made history by landing the 

powerful post of Board of Supervisors president.

<P>"This sends a very strong message about the ascension of progressives, and 

particularly the Greens," said Ross Mirkarimi, a San Francisco-based political 

consultant who was a founding member of the state's Green Party.

<P>"Nationally speaking, Matt Gonzalez will be one of the highest-ranking 

(Green Party) officeholders in the United States when you look at the scale of 

the populace he represents," Mirkarimi said. "This is very significant and 

very symbolic."

<P>The board president, elected by the supervisors, makes committee 

assignments, orchestrates the movement of legislation and, if effective, 

builds a majority coalition to pass laws. It's the second most powerful job in 

City Hall, after mayor. The job will put the soft-spoken but passionate Texas 

native, who at times has gone out of his way to avoid media attention, into a 

high-profile role.

<P>After a grueling battle, Gonzalez beat out two Democratic colleagues, 

Supervisors Aaron Peskin and Sophie Maxwell, for the presidency. The winner 

had to secure at least six votes on the board -- the bare majority -- which 

Gonzalez finally pulled off on the seventh round of voting once Peskin dropped 

out and broke the deadlock.

<P>Gonzalez, a brainy former deputy public defender who represents the 

liberal Haight-Ashbury and surrounding neighborhoods that make up District 5, 

abandoned the Democratic Party two years ago, right before he won a four-year 

term on the board.

<P>The office of supervisor in San Francisco is nonpartisan.

<P>Gonzalez's election as board president was not, obviously, made along party 

lines. Nine of the 11 supervisors are Democrats, and some of the Democratic 

Party's heavy hitters, most notably state Senate President John Burton, 

lobbied against Gonzalez, not wanting to see the elevation of a Green.

<P>Gonzalez, 37, said the race for president wasn't about party affiliation, 

but about who could best lead the board. Still, he acknowledged, his Green 

Party credentials shouldn't be ignored.

<P>"It's significant for the party because it shows that someone elected in 

the party can gain a leadership post," he said.

<P>Jane Morrison, chair of the San Francisco Democratic Party, was reluctant 

to comment on the Gonzalez victory.

<P><b>DEMOCRATS DISAPPOINTED</b>

<P>"You'd think that with nine Democrats on the board, they would have voted 

Democratic," is all she would say.

<P>City Treasurer Susan Leal, a Democrat and mayoral hopeful, said that "in 

some ways as a Democrat it's disappointing. But on the other hand, it puts the 

Green Party on the spot. Now they have to show what they can do with 

leadership instead of just being the protest party."

<P>Voters in Maine recently elected a Green to their state Assembly, and 

Greens have been elected mayor in smaller cities, including Santa Monica. In 

San Francisco, two Greens serve on the Board of Education.

<P>The Greens showed strength in San Francisco in the November governor's race 

when their candidate, Peter Camejo, garnered 15 percent of the vote -- far 

short of the 66 percent that went to Democratic Gov. Gray Davis, but for the 

first time slightly ahead of the Republican candidate, Bill Simon.

<P>Gonzalez said he would focus on issues that improve city services and 

government accountability and, without stating specifics, forward a 

progressive agenda. Looming over everything, however, is the projected $200 

million budget defict the city faces.

<P>During his tenure as supervisor, Gonzalez floated the idea of enacting a 

local minimum wage in San Francisco and supported efforts to raise the real 

estate transfer tax on high-priced properties. He led the charge against 

allowing the 49ers to sell the naming rights to Candlestick Park, a city-owned 

stadium, and has proposed limiting cars in Golden Gate Park on Saturdays.

<P><b>VOCAL CRITIC OF MAYOR</b>

<P>He has been a vocal critic of Mayor Willie Brown's administration, pushing 

plans to reduce Brown's cadre of special assistants and to blunt the mayor's 

control over certain city commissions and the Department of Elections.

<P>To win the job, Gonzalez had support from the left and the right. His 

original votes were from himself and Supervisors Tony Hall, Gerardo Sandoval 

and Chris Daly.

<P>Maxwell had herself and Supervisors Gavin Newsom and Bevan Dufty. Peskin's 

camp included himself, outgoing board President Tom Ammiano and Supervisors 

Jake McGoldrick and Fiona Ma.

<P>After the sixth round of voting, Peskin backed out. Ammiano and Ma switched 

to Maxwell; Peskin and McGoldrick voted for Gonzalez, giving him the win.
