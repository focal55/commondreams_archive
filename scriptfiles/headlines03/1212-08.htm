<p>LONDON  - It is polling day in the United States and George W. Bush has gathered together his friends and family at the White House to celebrate his imminent re-election.
<p>But the party is gate-crashed by a sinister U.N. weapons inspector, just back from 18 fruitless months wandering Iraq in search of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs).
<p>He has a devastating report to deliver to the U.S. Congress and a few tough questions to ask Bush and his friends.
<p>That, in short, is the plot of a new play by director Justin Butcher, whose first political farce, "<a href="http://www.themadnessofgeorgedubya.org/index.html" target="_new">The Madness of George Dubya</a>", took London's theatreland by storm a year ago when it was staged during the build-up to the Iraq war.
<p>"<a href="http://home.btconnect.com/theatrotechnics/framset/home.htm" target="_new">A Weapons Inspector Calls</a>" is a similar offering -- "slapstick, vulgar, brash entertainment", according to Butcher.
<p>It mercilessly pours scorn on Bush, Prime Minister Tony Blair and their increasingly desperate efforts to justify their decision to invade Iraq.
<p>"I was quite reluctant to write a sequel because they're often worse than the originals," Butcher told Reuters after the play opened at a small fringe theatre on Tuesday.
<p>"But as the pretext for the war crumbled to ashes and it became obvious that no WMDs would be found, the idea slowly started to take shape in my head."
<p>The play, which takes its title from the classic stage thriller "An Inspector Calls" by playwright J.B. Priestley, depicts Bush as a bluff fool who refuses to believe there are no banned weapons in Iraq.
<p>"We know they're there because Donald's got the invoices," he tells the inspector, to the despair of his shrewd, irascible Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld.
<p>"GUACAMOLE BAY"
<p>Bush, dressed in a leather bomber jacket, rails against "tourists" -- a play on his Texan pronunciation of the word "terrorists" -- and warns of the danger posed by prisoners interned in "Guacamole Bay" (Guantanamo Bay).
<p>His vice president elect is Arnie Schwartzenegger, clad in a black leather jacket and dark sunglasses, a Terminator-style pistol stuffed down the front of his trousers.
<p>Schwartzenegger spends much of the play flirting with Blair's wife Cherie, a new-age mystic, obsessed with astrology, strange potions and finding her "elemental" self.
<p>Subtle it is not, and often the play's humour is close to the bone.
<p>At one point, weapons inspector Dan Styx (Hans Blix), describes how he saw U.S. troops open fire on a farmer and his family in rural Iraq, mistakenly thinking they posed a threat.
<p>The farmer's wounded children tried to protect themselves from shells and bullets with blankets, Styx tells his listeners, laughing hysterically at the tragic absurdity of their desperate efforts to save their own lives.
<p>The play ends darkly, with Styx struck down in the Oval Office by Rumsfeld, clad in a white Ku Klux Klan-style hood.
<p>"It ends badly and I'm thinking about a third play in the trilogy, in the "Star Wars" mould," Butcher said. "Maybe part three will be "Escape from Guacamole Bay", modelled on "The Great Escape".
<p>Butcher says he wrote his first satire a year ago in a bid to shake-up theatre, which he believes is reluctant to engage with political issues and current affairs.
<p>"Things have improved since then," he says. "The theatre of this country has definitely been repoliticised in the past year, which is a good thing."
