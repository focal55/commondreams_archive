<p>WASHINGTON  - A group of former Clinton administration health officials Thursday blasted the Medicare bill President Bush plans to sign next Monday, saying the measure could lead to the demise of Medicare as it currently exists.

</table>"Every page you look at you find more things (to suggest) the real goal is to replace traditional Medicare," Robert Berenson of the Urban Institute told a briefing sponsored by the Democratic think tank the Center for American Progress.

<p>Berenson said the new "Medicare Advantage" program for private health plans "is better called the traditional-Medicare-disadvantaged" program, because it represents "an effort to tilt the playing field" toward private plans by significantly increasing their payments.

<p>Private health plans will get subsidies to provide prescription drug coverage while private "Medigap" supplemental plans will be barred from offering drug benefits, and there is no limit on premiums that stand-alone "drug-only" plans could offer. For these reasons, many beneficiaries will find themselves with no choice but to leave traditional Medicare and enroll in a private plan if they want any of their medications paid for.

<p>"The notion that you can stay where you are if you're not happy is just not right," Berenson said.

<p>Judy Feder, Dean of Policy Studies at Georgetown University, predicted that seniors and the disabled on Medicare will be utterly confused by the complexity of the choices they will face -- but that they already understand how small the benefit is. "They get that the benefit is limited. It's not what they've been promised," she said.

<p>And for the poorest beneficiaries, she said, "they will actually have a reduction in coverage," because the new law will allow them to be charged higher copayments than the joint federal-state Medicaid program currently allows, and because private plans will be able to limit which drugs are covered.

<p>In fact, said Jeanne Lambrew of George Washington University, all beneficiaries will have to "choose blindly" when it comes to selecting their drug coverage, because plans will not have to tell beneficiaries in advance which particular medications are or are not covered.

<p>At the same time, she said, plans will be able to change which drugs are covered during the course of a plan year, but beneficiaries "will be locked in" and will not be allowed to change.

<p>But perhaps the biggest problem with the new Medicare bill, Lambrew said, is that Congress will likely spend so much time dealing with the fallout that it will not be able to move on to other critical health issues, including 44 million Americans with no health insurance at all.

<p>"This will probably suck the oxygen out of the health policy debate for the next several years," she said. "The implications of what we're talking about go far beyond Medicare."
