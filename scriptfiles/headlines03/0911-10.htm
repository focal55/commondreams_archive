  </table></font>The cabinet is understood to have asked the army to draw up a series of options for Mr Arafat's expulsion from his compound in the West Bank town of Ramallah.
<p>The decision comes after Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon convened an urgent meeting of cabinet ministers to consider their response to suicide bombings on Monday that killed 15 people.
<p>The BBC's James Reynolds in Jerusalem says the decision may be part of an effort by the Israelis to show the new Palestinian Prime Minister Ahmed Qurei he should keep his distance from Mr Arafat.
<p><b>'Serious threat'</b>
<p>"Arafat is an obstacle to peace and Israel will act to remove this obstacle," a statement from the meeting was quoted as saying.
<p>No action against Mr Arafat is expected to be taken straight away, although Israeli troops are reported to have taken control of buildings close to Mr Arafat's headquarters on Thursday in advance of the cabinet meeting. 
<p>Palestinian Labour Minister Ghassan Khattib told the BBC: "I think this is to be taken very seriously... such an act is hugely expected of them [the Israeli cabinet]."
<p>A spokesman for Mr Arafat called on the international community to exert pressure to prevent the Israelis from carrying out the expulsion.
<p>Correspondents say removing Mr Arafat risks destabilising the whole region.
<p><b>Change of heart</b>
<p>Two key Israeli ministers - Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom and Defence Minister Shaul Mofaz - have long argued for the expulsion of Mr Arafat, who they consider to be linked to anti-Israel terrorism.
<p>"Security officials who in the past were opposed to this measure are now in favour. Everyone now supports it." Mr Shalom told public radio ahead of the cabinet meeting.
<p>Up to now, Mr Sharon has rebuffed expulsion calls, fearing international condemnation.
