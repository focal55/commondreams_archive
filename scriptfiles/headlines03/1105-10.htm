<p>MAKUHARI, Japan, Nov. 3 - "Hybrid cars will be the future," boomed an electronic voice as Japanese men lined up six deep at the Tokyo Motor Show this week to snap photos of a model dressed in hot pants, knee-high boots and a skimpy top as she waved frenetically in front of a  Toyota hybrid car.</p>
<p>Outside, Arishiro Tadao, a Toyota driver, gave test drives of the new Prius, shoving the accelerator to the floor so visitors could feel the kick of this latest- generation hybrid, powered by a gasoline engine and an electric motor.</p>
<p>Hybrids, still  accounting for only 1 percent of Japanese car sales, are getting a marketing push at Japan's biggest auto show, from the prettiest models to the most polished sound bites from car company executives.</p>
<p>"We firmly believe that automobiles will have no future, unless the environment is taken into account," Fujio Cho, president of the Toyota Motor Corporation, said. "This represents Toyota's drive to create the ultimate eco-car through fusion of Toyota's originally developed fuel cell system and hybrid technology."</p>
<p>Kyoji Takenaka, president of Subaru, showed off a futuristic concept car and asked: "If the environment is protected, is it all right to compromise on drivability, or vise versa? A hybrid car that is both environmentally friendly and fun to drive - that's our proposal."</p>
<p>Almost every Japanese carmaker offered a hybrid car, either as a prototype or, in the case of Toyota and the  Honda Motor Company, as a car now available in dealerships. (No other carmakers as yet have a hybrid on the market.) Some of the buzz came from the news that Toyota had received 17,000 orders for its new-generation Prius, which went on sale here Sept. 1. The car, which offers 50 percent more power than the original version, went on sale in the United States Oct. 17.</p>
<p>Adding to the sense that Japan is far ahead of the United States in  hybrid technology, the motor show opened with the news that Japanese cars won 7 of the top 10 places in fuel efficiency rankings maintained by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Honda's Insight topped the list, getting 60 miles a gallon in the city, followed closely by the Prius, with 59 miles a gallon. Toyota says the new Prius gets 60 miles a gallon.</p>
<p>While sales have been slow since hybrids were introduced sale here six years ago, these low-polluting, high-mileage cars now seem poised to become mainstream. Wielding a carrot, Japan's government now gives the purchaser of a hybrid car about $2,500 in tax credits. Wielding a stick, the government plans to impose draconian new emission-control regulations in 2005.</p>
<p>Japan imports all its oil and sets gasoline prices at roughly three times American levels. With the new Prius, a driver can cruise the length of Japan's main island, about 600 miles, on one tank of gasoline.</p>
<p>"The public is beginning to look at this car as a very viable alternative, not as a science experiment," Paul Nolasco, a Toyota spokesman, said of the new-generation Prius. Noting that Americans had already placed 10,000 orders for the new Prius, he added, "We are very pleased to see the Prius is going very well." Nonetheless, only tens of thousands of hybrid cars are sold a year in a market of roughly 17 million. </p>
<p>In contrast, Detroit is seen as falling behind in this technological battle.  Ford Motor's Escape, the first American car with hybrid technology, has had its introduction delayed by a year until next summer.</p>
<p>"Toyota is going into the second generation of  these hybrid vehicles, and Detroit isn't even there yet," Christopher J. Richter, senior auto analyst for HSBC Securities Japan Ltd., said while standing in front of a hybrid demonstration car by Honda. "Being a groundbreaker is much better than being a follower. I hear that Toyota is taking out a lot of critical patents. So, if you want to get the technology, you are going to have to deal with Toyota."</p>
<p>Even at stands where there were no hybrid cars, the new technology was seen as essential for the future.</p>
<p>"We are betting heavily on hybrids," Oles Roman Godacz, spokesman for Hyundai Motor, said at a stand without hybrids. "We are field-testing through next year. In 2005, we will sell them in Korea. In 2006, worldwide."</p>
<p>Carlos Ghosn, the president of the  Nissan Motor Company, said, "Our X-Trail FCV, a high-efficiency hybrid fuel cell vehicle, will see initial marketing this fiscal year." </p>
<p>Freely admitting that Nissan is behind on the hybrid race, Mr. Ghosn has said that his company is investing $780 million in research to catch up. For now, it will bridge the gap by using Toyota hybrid technology to power its initial hybrid models.</p>
<p>"With hybrids, there was a gap," Mr. Ghosn told reporters. "So we made an agreement with Toyota, which is win-win. It buys us time and gives Toyota the volume."</p>
<p>At Honda, Nissan's rival for Japan's No. 2 car maker, sales have been anemic in Japan and the United States for its two hybrid models, the Insight and the Civic. Working on a more advanced technology, researchers recently produced a fuel cell with more power and the ability to start in subzero temperatures.</p>
<p>"Hybrid vehicles are bridge vehicles, to bridge the gap from where we are now and where we will  be 20 to 30 years in the future," said David Iida, a Honda spokesman, echoing a widely held conviction in Japan that fuel cells will power cars of the future. Fuel cells run on hydrogen and emit only water as a byproduct.</p>
<p>In Japan and the United States, Toyota has a total of 18 fuel cell cars undergoing road tests. The first sales are not expected until 2010.</p>
<p>To accelerate this transition, Japan's government is investing heavily in fuel cell technology.  Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi has said he wants to see 50,000 fuel cell vehicles in Japan by 2010 and 5 million by 2020. By contrast, the total number of cars, trucks and buses sold in Japan this year is expected to be about four million.</p>
<p>Last year, Honda sold a total of 20,661 hybrid cars in Japan and the United States. For Toyota, the total was 40,277.</p>
<p>With these low numbers, Americans touring the show here were divided.</p>
<p>"The key question on hybrids is the ability to commercialize them in a way so the customers will go for them," said Mark Fields, chairman of Ford's Premier Automotive Group, which includes Aston Martin, Jaguar, Land Rover and Volvo. A hybrid car can cost around $4,000 more than a regular car. "A certain kind of customer will go for hybrids because of the way it meets environmental concerns," Mr. Fields added. </p>
<p>Near the Toyota stand, one of the largest in the show, Tanya Sepell, an auto interior designer from Troy, Mich., said that Detroit was missing a market.</p>
<p>"People my age tend to be eco-friendly," Ms. Sepell,  38, said. Adding that she was disappointed to find that the new Prius was not in stock when she recently bought a car. "The American car companies are not offering what people want."</p>
<p>By contrast, Koji Endo, a car analyst for Credit Suisse First Boston, estimated that Toyota had invested as much as $1 billion in hybrid technology. By 2005, Toyota plans to be selling 300,000 hybrid cars a year.</p>
<p>"Toyota is now the de facto standard of hybrids," Mr. Endo said. "In the U.S., with gas prices low, there is little pressure. It is years away, decades away for Detroit's Big Three to become active in those fields.''</p>
