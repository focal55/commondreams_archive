<p>For several years, as growing summertime surges of power criss-crossed the web of transmission lines in Ohio and the rest of the Midwest on their way to Manhattan or Toronto or Detroit, utility and government monitors grew increasingly concerned about the risks of straining the system.



<p>Problems on the lines were becoming more frequent, and a series of reports, by the industry's own quality-control offices and government agencies, described the risks and urged utilities to be more aware of the physical limits of the Midwest system.



<p>The complexity and magnitude of the power flows, one report by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said, could "overwhelm the electronic and software tools used to model and manage power flows on the grid."



<p>So when an hourlong series of line failures and plant shutdowns suddenly exploded on Thursday into North America's biggest blackout, few experts were surprised at where it had begun.



<p>"Reliability here," said Dr. Stephen A. Sebo, an electrical engineering professor at Ohio State University and a member of the Ohio Power Siting Board, "is unquestionably a sore issue."



<p>Now it is the focus of an international inquiry. And Midwestern and Ohio power managers and the FirstEnergy Corporation, an Akron utility that struggled for an hour before the full catastrophe to deal with the failure of several of its lines, find themselves enduring intensifying scrutiny and criticism.



<p>Among the questions officials want to answer is whether anything was done by Midwestern or FirstEnergy officials to alert neighboring regions to the growing crisis. They may also want to determine whether enough was done over the years to manage the Midwestern system responsibly. Finally, the fact that the blackout occurred on a day of only ordinary summer demand suggests the problem lay with the way the system was managed and not with a lack of capacity, some critics said.



<p>At FirstEnergy, Todd Schneider, a spokesman, said yesterday that the company was far from ready to say that the precipitating event was the failure of four of its lines and one co-owned by American Electric Power. Three hours earlier, he said, there were signs of instability on the grid outside FirstEnergy's service territory. He would not say where they occurred, but said they could have played a role.



<p>"There were situations throughout the region that may have contributed to the event, not just these power lines in our system," he said.



<p>FirstEnergy distributed a statement on Saturday saying that it had failed to notice the line failures because an alarm system designed to alert its operators was not working.



<p>Yesterday, Mary Lynn Webster, a spokeswoman for the Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator, the industry group that monitors the flow of power throughout the region, said that during the escalating problems in Ohio, at least three conversations took place between coordinators from that group and FirstEnergy to discuss the line failures. She said tapes of the conversations would be reviewed.



<p>Power managers in adjacent parts of the grid, including the Northeast, said they were concerned that there was no early warning, adding that such an alert might have helped them gird for what one official called the eastward-pulsing "shock wave" that triggered the wider failure.



<p>Last night, leaders of an industry investigation of the blackout said it was too soon to assign blame.



<p>"What we really need to focus on now is why protective schemes that should have localized the impact of various events did not work," said Michehl R. Gent, the president of the North American Electric Reliability Council, a nonprofit industry group set up after the blackout of 1965 to cut the risks of such failures.



<p>Its inquiry is just one of a host of investigations trying to unravel how a building parade of problems around Ohio was not isolated before the problem crossed the maze of lines linking the Midwest and the East, which collectively are called the Eastern Interconnection.



<p>There, within nine determinative seconds, the problem exploded into a power failure affecting 9,300 square miles and millions of people.



<p>The investigators range from teams dispatched by dozens of individual companies inspecting gear and records for strained or failed equipment to an international task force created by the top energy officials in the United States and Canada. They will need to disentangle what Mr. Gent described as more than 10,000 "discrete system events," scattered over thousands of miles of interconnected systems as big as a billion-watt power plant and as small as the diameter of a high-tension power line.



<p>But identifying each failure of a mechanical, electronic or human link in the chain is just the start. One of the biggest challenges, investigators said, will be to put those links in a precise sequence to backtrack to the root cause.



<p>"There's still a very coarse timeline out there, and we need to slice that a lot finer," said Edward Schwerdt, the executive director of the Northeast Power Coordinating Council, one of 10 regional offices working under Mr. Gent's national reliability council. "In some places we'll need to get down to almost a second-by-second slice," he said.



<p>One of the many facts that investigators will have to establish is who said what to whom, and when, and who should have issued warnings. Among other things, they will review tapes of control-room conversations, officials said.



<p>One complicating factor is the different management and operating standards in the Midwest compared with those in the other regions affected by the blackout. In the Midwest, the regional independent system operator schedules movements of power, but individual utilities control the flow moment by moment. In the Northeast, Middle Atlantic states and New England, the regional office does both.



<p>It remained unclear yesterday whether anyone with a broad view of the Midwest's electrical landscape recognized that the individual line failures and other problems might be causing or resulting from some dangerous regional instability.



<p>David R. Nevius, senior vice president of the reliability council, said it would take more analysis to determine what exactly was the triggering event and how it then ballooned into a historic darkening of the North American landscape.



<p>Among the data being collected was information from mechanical recorders called "targets," which take note of when and why a particular circuit breaker tripped.



<p>In the end, it will be important to understand whether Midwestern system operators had time, as the individual failures accumulated, to run computer models that simulate what kinds of risks might be building.



<p>"What did somebody see?" Mr. Nevius said. "It's easy looking backward."



<p>Eventually, he said, his council will reach the point where "we get all the data laid out, with the second-by-second, minute-by-minute sequence: this happened, this caused that to happen, or maybe a series of this happened and that happened and that happened."



<p>Then, he said, the group will ask the question, "Should somebody have done something after it happened?"



<p>Officials from the Northeast insisted yesterday that they received no warning from FirstEnergy or the Midwestern power coordinators until it was too late to take preventive measures.



<p>"They were wrestling with an 800-pound gorilla for an hour, and when it hit here it lasted nine seconds," said Stephen Allen, a spokesman for the Northeast Power Coordinating Council. "The big question is, Could our operators have known about it earlier?" he said. "Were there calls that could have been made?"



<p>Until such questions are resolved, FirstEnergy will find itself closely scrutinized, experts and some energy company executives said. FirstEnergy's seven electric utility operating companies comprise the fourth-largest investor-owned electric system in the country, serving 4.3 million customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania and New Jersey. FirstEnergy operates power plants that produce more than 13,000 megawatts of electricity and owns more than 14,700 miles of high-voltage transmission lines.



<p>Among its array of holdings is the Davis-Besse nuclear plant, near Toledo, which was shut down by federal officials last year after inspections revealed that corrosion had eaten a hole in its metal lid and that if a lining had been penetrated, a significant nuclear accident might have occurred. The damage has been repaired, but the management of the power plant remains under review by the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 



<p>And the region, in general, has seen rising concerns for years over the reliability of its power network. 



<p>Last year, an annual assessment of summertime power-handling capabilities of the links connecting the Midwest to the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states, conducted by the industry, recognized that growth in long-distance energy trading was in a fine balance with the limits of the grid. 



<p>"The results of this analysis stress the continued need for close coordination and communication among the users of the interconnected systems in order to maximize the utilization of the network without jeopardizing its reliability," said the report, produced jointly by groups set up by the three regions' power companies after the blackout of 1965 to cut risks of disruptions.



<p>Many experts stress, however, that there are ample signs that weaknesses in the grid are not limited to the Midwest. It remains unclear why New York's network collapsed while those further along, like New England's, did not.



<p>Yesterday, experts debated possible explanations. Indeed, one said New England survived not because its machinery was better, but because it was weaker.



<p>"The weak tie-lines between New York and New England meant that the shock wave couldn't go through with as much strength, like you can only pump a certain amount of water through a pipe," said Mr. Schwerdt, from the Northeastern reliability group. Others disagreed, suggesting that New England and some Mid-Atlantic states might have had systems in place that sensed a problem while preventing a full-blown shutdown.
