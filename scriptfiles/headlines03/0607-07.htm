<p>WASHINGTON, June 6 &#0151; Democrats and civil rights advocates condemned the Justice Department today for barring a gay pride event planned by department employees, and called on Attorney General John Ashcroft to reverse the decision.</p><P> Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey, told Mr. Ashcroft in a letter that he found the decision "unconscionable" at a department charged with protecting civil rights. Mr. Lautenberg said he would propose legislation addressing the issue if the Justice Department did not allow the event to take place. </p><!-- BIGAD ad not targeted --><P> But conservative groups opposed to gay rights rallied to Mr. Ashcroft's defense, over a matter that has renewed questions concerning his stand on homosexuality.</p><P> Sandy Rios, president of a conservative Christian group, Concerned Women for America, said that "homosexuality is immoral" and that she was grateful that Mr. Ashcroft had taken such a "courageous step to stand against the pressure of the politically correct elite."</p><P> A group of several hundred gay and lesbian Justice Department employees, called DOJ Pride, had budgeted $600 to hold an awards ceremony on June 18 at the department's Great Hall to celebrate Gay Pride Month. The group has held similar events at the department each of the last six years, members said, and Mr. Ashcroft's top deputy spoke at last year's event.</p><P> But Justice Department officials have told the group that it cannot hold the ceremony at the department this year because of a new policy prohibiting events not recognized by White House proclamation. </p><P> Mr. Bush has issued hundreds of presidential proclamations, recognizing events like National African American History Month, National Prayer Day and Leif Erikson Day. </p><P> But unlike President Bill Clinton, Mr. Bush has not recognized Gay Pride Month.</p><P> "The president believes everybody ought to be treated with dignity and respect, but he does not believe we should be politicizing people's sexual orientation," said Scott McClellan, a White House spokesman. </p><P> Officials at the department's equal employment opportunity office acknowledged that the office had notified DOJ Pride of the decision regarding the gay pride event, but referred all other questions to the department's public affairs office. Officials there declined to comment.</p><P> Gay associations at many federal agencies have held gay pride events in recent years. Employees at the Commerce Department and a few other agencies have complained about not receiving enough administrative support, but this is the first time any agency has forbidden a gay group to use the premises, said Leonard Hirsch, president of Federal Globe, a gay and lesbian association of government employees.</p><P> "There's a political calculation going on here by the Justice Department," Mr. Hirsch said, "and they figure they gain more with the conservative right than they lose by discriminating against gays."</p><P> Mr. Ashcroft, socially conservative and deeply religious, was known for his strong views against homosexuality during his days in the Senate. He said then that he considered homosexuality a sin, and he opposed legislation to protect gays.</p><P> But in his confirmation hearings in 2001, he pledged not to tolerate discrimination against gays in the Justice Department. Critics said today that the decision to bar the gay pride event amounted to his backpedaling. </p><P> Senator Russell D. Feingold, Democrat of Wisconsin, said in a statement today that he had asked Mr. Ashcroft before confirmation about DOJ Pride's use of government facilities. Mr. Ashcroft said then that he had "no intent to treat this group differently than any other." </p><P> Writing to Mr. Ashcroft today, Mr. Lautenberg noted that conservative groups had lobbied to ban gay pride events at government facilities, and said that "the possibility that the department would put the wishes of groups with a political agenda ahead of the civil rights of its own employees is unconscionable."</p><P> The American Civil Liberties Union said the decision could violate the Justice Department's own anti-discrimination policies. </p><P> A Justice Department official denied that, but the A.C.L.U. said it was considering a legal challenge. </p><P> "I think Ashcroft has gone out on a legal limb on this," said Matt Coles, director of the A.C.L.U.'s Gay and Lesbian Rights Project, "and he's certainly trashed his own personal word in the process."</p>
