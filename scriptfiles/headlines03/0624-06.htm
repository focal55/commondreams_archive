<p>HEBRON, West Bank   - Israeli troops rounded up  more than 130 Palestinians in sweeps for suspected militants  Tuesday, drawing Palestinian charges that Israel was trying to  sabotage efforts to reach a cease-fire.<P>
The raids in Nablus and Hebron, the two largest West Bank  cities, added to tensions surrounding faltering moves to  implement a U.S.-backed "road map" for ending nearly 33 months  of Israeli-Palestinian bloodshed.<P>

</table></font>Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas has been trying to  persuade Hamas and other militant groups to call a temporary  truce with Israel to end a cycle of violence that has battered  the peace plan affirmed at a U.S-led summit on June 4.<P>
Parallel talks between top Israeli and Palestinian security  officials ended with no final agreement overnight on a proposed  Israeli troop pullback from the northern Gaza Strip and the  West Bank town of Bethlehem.<P>
Within hours, Israeli forces launched raids in the West  Bank in operations the army said were aimed at "terrorists and  their helpers" behind suicide bombings and other attacks on  Israelis.<P>
About 130 Palestinians, including suspected militants and  people wanted for questioning, were rounded up without  resistance in sweeps targeting the Islamic group Hamas in  Hebron, an army spokeswoman said. She said five more suspects  were arrested in Nablus after clashes with gunmen.<P>
"It is an Israeli madness aimed at undermining any move  forward," Palestinian cabinet minister Yasser Abed Rabbo told  Reuters. "These arrests are an attempt to sabotage the  understanding with Hamas. Israel does not want a cease-fire."<P>
SECURITY TALKS INCONCLUSIVE<P>
The Palestinian Authority says such actions, including  Israel's track-and-kill operations against militants, severely  undermine its efforts to secure a truce with militants.<P>
But Israel insists it reserves the right to act unless the  Palestinians rein in groups led by Hamas, an Islamic faction  committed to the Jewish state's destruction.<P>
In the latest talks, Israeli Maj. Gen. Amos Gilad and  Palestinian security chief Mohammed Dahlan discussed a  U.S.-proposed deal whereby Israeli troops would withdraw from  Gaza areas and Bethlehem as a proving ground for the  Palestinians' ability to quell militant activity there.<P>
The meeting adjourned after the Palestinians demanded  Israeli military measures be curtailed further. Among their  demands is an end to Israel's killings of leading militants,  free passage for Palestinian traffic on Gaza's main highway and  the release of thousands of Palestinian detainees.<P>
"Israel has to realize that only by backing off can it give  us the space we need to secure a 'hudna'," a Palestinian  official told Reuters, using the Arabic term for a truce.<P>
Despite that, Secretary of State Colin Powell sounded an  optimistic note on the road map's prospects Monday.<P>
"I know the Palestinian Authority is hard at work trying to  bring into place a cessation of violence on the part of  (militants)," he said at the World Economic Forum in Jordan.<P>
U.S. National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice will visit  the region for talks with Israeli and Palestinian leaders on  Saturday and Sunday, the White House said.<P>
The road map calls for reciprocal measures, including an  end to Palestinian violence and dismantling of Jewish settler  outposts, paving the way for a Palestinian state by 2005.<P>
