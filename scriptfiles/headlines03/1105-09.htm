<p>The dark side of concentrated media power has resonated so deeply with the public that the Rev. Jesse Jackson, Al Franken and Ralph Nader insisted they be included in this weekend&#039;s National Conference on Media Reform on the UW-Madison campus.
<p>&#034;I think this will be a real weekend in Madison people will notice,&#034; said conference organizer Bob McChesney, founder of <a href="http://www.mediareform.net/" target="_new">Free Press</a>, the main sponsor of the conference. McChesney, a former UW-Madison professor, now teaches at the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana.
<p>McChesney said his organization originally thought they&#039;d get about 200 registrants willing to brave Wisconsin&#039;s chilly fall weather, but recently closed registration at 1,400.
<p>McChesney said the seeds of the conference were planted before the Federal Communications Commission decided this summer to relax regulations overseeing media ownership.
<p>But this regulatory action has stirred up such massive discontent over the state of media consolidation in this country, it helped kick the conference up several notches.
<p>&#034;That&#039;s what put this issue on the map,&#034; said McChesney. &#034;We really didn&#039;t anticipate the group, the movement or the conference growing at the rate they did in the last 10 months.&#034;
<p>McChesney launched Free Press less than a year ago with the help of John Nichols, editorial page editor of The Capital Times and Washington correspondent for The Nation, and campaign finance reform advocate Josh Silver.
<p>The bulk of the conference, which will kick off Friday afternoon, will take place on the UW-Madison campus, with the Havens Center as primary host.
<p>Speakers will include Bill Moyers, veteran journalist and host of the PBS series &#034;NOW With Bill Moyers&#034;; U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis.; U.S. Rep. Tammy Baldwin, D-Madison; FCC Commissioners Jonathan Adelstein and Michael Copps; and AFL-CIO President John Sweeney.
<p>Several public events associated with the conference are scheduled throughout the weekend, including a lecture by Nader, musical performances by Billy Bragg, the Nightwatchman and Lester Chambers, and a screening of &#034;Orwell Rolls in His Grave,&#034; a documentary by Robert Kane Pappas.
<p>McChesney said the war in Iraq, in addition to the FCC ruling, proved a lightning rod for the media reform movement. It became clear, he said that the media conglomerates that lobbied hard to relax media rules were the same ones leading the cheerleading for the war while &#034;doing no critical journalism.&#034;
<p>Baldwin, who will give opening remarks Friday afternoon, said she has been frustrated by domestic coverage of the war and has felt the need to seek out international news sources to get more information about the situation in Iraq.
<p>She said she expected the conference would generate &#034;a great deal of meaningful discussion and activism.&#034;
<p>&#034;It&#039;s time Americans started to demand comprehensive and unbiased reporting of events and issues instead of the pre-packaged sound bites and photo-ops that too often pass for news,&#034; she said.
<p>Patrick Barrett, administrative director of the Havens Center, said the issue of media consolidation cuts across ideological lines.
<p>Even conservative commentator William Safire, Barrett said, &#034;is bent out of shape about the corporate control of media.&#034;
<p>And Midge Miller, longtime activist, state assemblywoman and founder of the Madison Institute, a progressive think tank, said many people do not feel well served by their media outlets.
<p>&#034;There is a desperate feeling in the land that the mainline media are not doing their job,&#034; she said.
<p>The Madison Institute earlier this year formed a task force on media reform. Miller said a free press is essential to a free society.
<p>&#034;People are quite likely to make the right decision if they know what is going on,&#034; she said. &#034;That&#039;s why so many governments go to such efforts to control what people know.&#034;
<p>The conference is being funded through conference fees and about four or five &#034;modest&#034; grants from foundations, McChesney said.
<p>The emphasis of the conference will be on activism, focusing primarily on finding solutions to the problems of media consolidation, he said.
<p>&#034;This is not a conference to analyze how bad the media are and what the nature of the problem is. The assumption is we know there are serious problems. Now what do we do about it?&#034;
