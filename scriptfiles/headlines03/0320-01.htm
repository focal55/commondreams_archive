<p>As cruise missiles struck Iraq on Wednesday night, thousands of peace 

activists marched through the streets of San Francisco and blocked a major 

intersections in a glimpse of the huge demonstrations planned for today.

<P>Frustrated that they'd proved powerless to stop a war some demonstrators 

did not realize had already begun, many activists vowed Wednesday to do 

everything they could to end it quickly.

<P>"Now our goal is to get it stopped as soon as possible," said LeiLani 

Dowell of International Answer, which coordinated Wednesday night's generally 

peaceful demonstration. "We're angry. And we've got to keep fighting."

<P>Police did not provide a crowd estimate, but observers said it looked like 

the demonstration drew from 2,000 to 3,000 participants. Protests also took 

place Wednesday in New York, Boston, Detroit and other cities.

<P>Today, protest groups expect a lot more people to descend on the Financial 

District and other locations citywide, beginning at 7 a.m., in a campaign to 

shut down the city through civil disobedience.

<P>Similar campaigns are slated for 49 other cities nationwide, and smaller 

demonstrations such as rallies and vigils are expected in as many as 500 

communities, activists said.

<P>"Bush, brace yourself," Gopal Dayaneni of Direct Action to Stop the War, 

told a roaring crowd gathered at Powell and Market streets before the cruise 

missile strike began. "We are here. And we are going to stop this war."

<P>The demonstration was orderly, police said, until about 7:30 p.m., when 

thousands of people briefly blocked the intersection at 24th and Mission 

streets. But there were no arrests by 8:30 p.m.

<P>Similar demonstrations took place from Los Angeles to Santa Rosa and beyond.

<P>Most were peaceful, but police in West Los Angeles arrested 35 protesters 

after they refused to disperse during an afternoon demonstration one block 

from the Federal Building, authorities said.

<P>The San Francisco protest, which began as the 5 p.m. deadline for Saddam 

Hussein to step down passed unheeded, was marked by a sense of frustration not 

seen at far larger demonstrations held in recent weeks.

<P>"At the rallies and protests in January and February, there was more of a 

sense of hope that we might be able to stop the war," said Dan Fahey, a Navy 

veteran of the 1991 Gulf War. "At this point, it's disgust and anger."

<P>Others expressed fear -- for U.S. soldiers, for the Iraqis and for our own 

homeland security.

<P>"We're here to protest the war because we got letters from kids in Baghdad,

" said Sheena Castrejon, a seventh-grader from Oakland. "They are really 

scared and so are we. It made me think about how they're suffering. I could 

imagine myself in their shoes."

<P>Police led the rain-soaked crowd, led by actor Danny Glover, down Market 

Street toward the Mission District. At one point, Glover climbed onto a 

flatbed truck to address the crowd.

<P>"We're all here to let our voice be heard, to say we are against this 

illegal, unilateral war against the people of Iraq," Glover said. "It's not 

just about Saddam Hussein, it's about the women and the children, it's about 

the people."

<P>The crowd was dotted by placards and signs decrying the war and the Bush 

administration, and many in the crowd had harsh words for the president.

<P>Monica Neff of Fremont came with her husband and clutched her 22-month-old 

son in her arms. An American flag was draped around her shoulders, a black 

swastika emblazoned across its stripes.

<P>"Bush wants to be in control of the world," Neff said.

<P>Moments later, Sue Harden, a fourth-grade teacher with two adult sons, 

commented on Neff's get-up.

<P>"I told her I would have never agreed with that before today," Harden said. 

"In other wars, we were attacked, like Pearl Harbor, but now we are the ones 

doing the attacking. Never in 225 years have we done anything like this."

<P>If there were any Bush supporters along the march route, most of them kept 

quiet.

<P>"I'm not for war, but I'll support the troops," said David Loudermilk, a 17-

year-old high school student from Hayward. "I really don't think our country 

can survive if it's divided."

<P>Of the marchers filing past him, he said, "I respect their decision. I 

don't agree with it, but I respect it."

<P>Police and security officials braced for civil disobedience or violence. 

Scores of police, many with riot gear in hand, climbed off three buses near 

the Old Mint before the demonstration started.

<P>As the 5 p.m. deadline crept closer, a security guard at the San Francisco 

Shopping Center was overheard on his walkie-talkie telling someone, "Are you 

ready for this? It's showtime. We're going to knock heads."

<P>But police, who followed the demonstrators on foot, bicycle and in patrol 

cars, said the crowd was well-behaved.

<P>"Very peaceful," San Francisco police Capt. Bill Davenport said Wednesday. 

"They even changed their route, and we accommodated them. We're hoping things 

go like this tomorrow."
