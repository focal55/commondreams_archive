<p>Buried in a bill that provides money for the war in Iraq is an $8.5 million federal boost for Miami to host the Free Trade Area of the Americas conference later this month.</p>
<p> Passed in the House last week and the Senate Monday, the FTAA money is a single line within the massive Iraq bill.</p>
<p> But for the 40 local communities expected to provide extra police officers and equipment at the conference, it helps ease the financial burden on already strapped cities and counties.</p>
<p> Between 20,000 and 100,000 protesters are expected to flood downtown Miami during the conference set for Nov. 17-21.</p>
<p> &#34;The money enables the city of Miami and Miami-Dade County in particular to go the extra mile in security,&#34; said Charles Cobb, chairman of the nonprofit Florida FTAA Inc., which is helping organize the conference. &#34;It gives them much more comfort to do whatever is necessary to provide good security and do it in a friendly, positive way.&#34;</p>
<p> The FTAA would establish a free-trade zone among the nations of the Americas and the Caribbean, excluding Cuba. It would be the world&#39;s largest free market, with a combined gross domestic product of nearly $13 trillion and nearly 800 million consumers. </p>
<p> U.S. Rep. Clay Shaw, R-Fort Lauderdale, said Miami can&#39;t be expected to shoulder the entire security burden, especially since violence and protests have erupted at free trade meetings in Seattle and Cancun, Mexico.</p>
<p> &#34;I think we can be sure we&#39;ll have the same problem in Miami,&#34; Shaw said. &#34;It&#39;s certainly to the United States&#39; advantage to show the world we can have a successful conference in the U.S., protect civil liberties and maintain order.&#34;</p>
<p> U.S. Rep. Alcee Hastings, D-Miramar, also supports federal money for the FTAA.</p>
<p> &#34;Congressman Hastings is supportive of having the meeting in South Florida and that obviously costs money,&#34; said Hastings&#39; spokesman, Fred Turner. &#34;As far as the federal government can help with funding, he&#39;s happy it was included.&#34;</p>
<p> Cobb said it&#39;s important for Miami to make a good impression on the foreign ministers attending the conference.</p>
<p> &#34;Security is a critical element,&#34; said Cobb. &#34;Doing it firmly, but friendly.&#34;</p>
