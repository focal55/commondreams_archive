<p>On the face of it they are an unlikely threesome, ganging up against America and its planned war on Iraq.

<p>

Russia, under President Putin, has been currying favor with Washington, especially since the terrorist attacks of 11 September, 2001.

<p>







Germany, as Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer pointed out at the weekend, is grateful to the Americans for their part in the defeat of Nazism and the restoration of democracy.

<p>

And France... Well, France has always been something of a wandering star in the Allied constellation. But it too, in recent years, has played its role in American-led wars in Kosovo and Afghanistan.

<p>

So what's changed?

<p>

One thing unites Moscow, Berlin and Paris - their abhorrence of what they regard as American bullying, a feeling that has grown in the past week or so as the insults about them piled up. 

<p>







	

First there was Donald Rumsfeld, the US defense secretary, damning France and Germany as "Old Europe", then his remark that Germany's stance on Iraq resembled that of Libya or Cuba. 

<p>

The more criticisms are leveled against them - for causing a "crisis of credibility" within Nato, and for their "shameful" refusal to help Turkey - the more this new triangular relationship will be cemented.

<p>

Germany, currently in the chair of the UN Security Council, has been canvassing opinion, and says only four of its members - the US, UK, Spain and Bulgaria - oppose the line being taken by the anti-war troika. 

<p>

The consequences could be very interesting.

<p><b>Security Council tactics</b>

<p>



Unless the UN's chief weapons inspector Hans Blix delivers a damning report on Iraq next Friday, then the three will at the very least stand a good chance of preventing the US and UK from getting a second resolution adopted which would authorize the use of force against Iraq. 

<p>

They may go even further and propose a "counter-resolution" calling for prolonged, intensified arms inspections, backed up by increased surveillance.

<p>







France's role in the troika is crucial. It has a long history of independent thinking, especially in foreign and defense policy. Since Jacques Chirac's re-election as president last summer Paris has been more bullish than ever.

<p>

Russia may have been sucking up to America of late, but as a nation it has been smarting ever since the Soviet Union collapsed and it lost its status as a superpower, and with it the "right" to divide the world into spheres of influence with the USA.

<p>

Under President Yeltsin, the Kremlin resisted every American move towards hegemony, including the gradual extension of Nato into eastern Europe. 

<p>

Vladimir Putin was more pragmatic. He acquiesced in the expansion of Nato, even to include the three Baltic states territories which were once part of the USSR. 

<p>







	

The reasons for this included a desire for better relations and the promise that Russia would be better integrated into the world community. 

<p>

After 11 September Putin quickly signed up to the "war on terror", partly to gain sympathy and help in his own war on terrorism in Chechnya. 

<p>

A Nato-Russia council was set up last May, crowning the new relationship.

<p>

But Iraq is another matter. For one thing, like France, Russia has economic interests there. 

<p>

But more important, President Bush's attitude has reminded Russians of the bad old days when American presidents branded Russia the "axis of evil" and went around toppling or undermining pro-Soviet regimes around the world. It has reawakened Russia's acute sense of hurt and inferiority. 

<p><b>German pacifism</b>

<p>



Germany's position is the most extreme - ruling out participation in a war on Iraq even if there is a UN resolution in favor of it. That stance was adopted before last September's elections and probably helped Gerhard Schroeder scrape back into office.

<p>

It was a popular policy in a country which since World War II has developed strong pacifist traditions. Nonetheless, it might have been modified had it not been for America's strong-arm tactics, which have united Germans in their opposition to war.

<p>

All three countries suspect the US is using Nato as its personal weapon, circumventing the United Nations, where international action should really be decided. 

<p>







The deadlock in Brussels HQ has not really been about Turkey (France and Germany made quite clear they would come to Turkey's aid in the event of a real threat) but about being bullied by the Americans. 

<p>

Officials in Paris and Berlin point out that Turkey would not be under a particular threat from Iraq in the first place, were it not for America's plans for war.

<p>

The divide is deep. The new troika believes there is no reason to plunge the region into war at this stage, for three reasons: it would lead to massive civilian bloodshed, it would destabilize the region, and it might still be possible to disarm Iraq by peaceful means.

<p>

And if there is to be action, they argue, it should not be carried out by a self-appointed "world policeman" (a phrase coined by the Soviet Union to decry American foreign adventures) but collectively, by the United Nations.</p>
