<p> Hamza al-Gahnem is 12 years old, and lives in building number 32 in an estate with 55 identical seven-story buildings. He likes football, and pines for a Sony PlayStation, but what he wants most of all is to meet Iraq's president, Saddam Hussein, so he can tell him the story of his birthday. 

<P>It's one Hamza never tires of hearing. He came into this world on January 17 1991 - the first night of American bombing in the last Gulf war. The first 40 days of babyhood he spent in an underground shelter.  <P>Hamza, like the rest of Iraq, could soon relive experiences he was too small to remember, as his country stands once more on the brink of a possible war. Today, the security council is to hear the latest report from the chief weapons inspector, Hans Blix, on whether Iraq has demonstrated true willingness to abandon its weapons of mass destruction. Britain is promoting a compromise resolution designed to mend the rift in the security council over whether to follow America into an early war, or give Dr Blix more time for his inspections, and Iraq a last chance to disarm.  <P>Hamza is too young fully to understand the struggles of international diplomacy. Within his child's world, Hamza appears to have mustered his own defenses against these international tensions -though his mother, Wisal al-Gahnem, complains that the adult conversations around him have left her eldest child fretful and distracted.  

<P>"I do think about the war," Hamza says, "But I don't think there is going to be one. It is just a rumor."   

<P>War, and the threat of war, have dominated Hamza's life. During the build-up to the last Gulf war, his expectant mother was alone in this complex of flats in central Baghdad.  <P>His father, Abdul Khalak al-Gahnem, was in Basra, near the Kuwaiti border. He had been called up for compulsory service in 1983, during the earlier war against Iran, and though he was badly wounded by an artillery shell that exploded at his feet, he was not released from service.  <P>During that winter of 1991, America's deadline for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait was looming, and Mr al-Gahnem was frantic with worry for his pregnant wife. By January 16 1991 Wisal was more than a week past her due date.  <P>Alone in the rented two-bedroom flat, Wisal felt the first labour pains when missiles struck the government installations not far from the estate after 2am. Her neighbors bundled into the shelter, and told her to hold off until daylight, when it would be safer to find a car, and to get her to al-Alwiyah, Baghdad's main maternity hospital.  

<P>The hospital was in chaos. "The moment Hamza was born everybody ran down to the shelter, and left me alone without even cutting the umbilical cord," she says. "There was no electricity, the heating had stopped, the windows were broken, it was very cold, and he was naked. I thought the bombs were falling directly on top of us."  <P>Hamza was among the lucky. Dr Jawad Zayer, who heads the neo-natal unit at the hospital, says many newborns were lost in the early days of that war - especially those born prematurely when oxygen and incubators failed.  <P>Ms al-Gahnem made it home with Hamza, and to the shelter, where they shared a mattress on the cold concrete floor with about 300 others. Hamza cried for three days.  <P>She remains convinced that those first experiences left an imprint. Hamza was clingier than her other babies and re mains more serious now, keeping aloof from the chatter of his five brothers and sisters.  <P>He does well at school, starts his homework without complaining, and stands out at football, captaining the team from building number 32.  <P>Hamza's parents feel sorry for a generation that has never known the prosperity in which they grew up in the 1970s after Iraq nationalized the oil industry. Their firstborn is entering his teens in a society with big gaps between rich and poor as the middle class created by Iraq's oil wealth is destroyed by sanctions.  

<P>Hamza's father, Abdel Khalak, earns enough as a taxi driver to feed his family - thanks to the government rations that are distributed to every Iraqi. But he can never hope to move out of the rented flat to a house with a garden.  <P>"There are very different standards of living now between the Iraqi people," says Wisal. "The things that children want nowadays are very expensive. Where we   wanted dolls, they want computers, and I feel bad that we can't buy it."  <P>None of this matters terribly to Hamza. He remains quiet as his younger brother, Abbas, compares the prices of used and new Sony PlayStations.  <P>But still he feels overlooked. Most of his friends don't even know the story of his birthday. In the Iraqi calendar, which makes a point of involving children in anniversaries of revolutions, no activities mark the start of the last war against America, the Mother of All Battles.  <P>That is why it is so important to Hamza to meet Saddam. The Iraqi leader, he is convinced, will immediately recognize that he is special, and to illustrate Hamza pulls out a class composition on Saddam.  

<P>"You are the beat of my heart, and nicer than the days of Eid," he reads. "You are the secret of creativity, and you are like a shadow protecting me always. You are like the magic of an angel and sir, you are dearer than my life. That is why we say: 'Yes, yes, Saddam Hussein'."  <P>Despite his conviction that his birthday marks him out for a grand future, he knows little about what led to the war into which he was born. He has studied the eight-year war against Iran in his civics class, but they haven't yet reached the last Gulf war.  <P>He only knows it was about America - just as it is this time around. "They want our land and our oil. They have a lot of cars, and petrol is very expensive there, much more than here, that is why they want to take it," he says.  <P>He does not hate America. His favorite movies are Home Alone and Spiderman. But while he cannot quite conjure up an image of that country he says its greed has made it Iraq's enemy. That enmity, in turn, is what has defined him.  

<P>"This is a special generation in many ways. They are oppressed greatly because of US policy. Food and medicine is not available because of sanctions," says Wisal al-Gahnem. "On the other hand, Hamza will have lots to pass on to the next generation about his suffering, and experience. He will have his special story."</p>
