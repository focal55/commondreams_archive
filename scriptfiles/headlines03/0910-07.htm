<p>A UC Davis scientist who led the air monitoring of the smoldering ruins 
of the World Trade Center said dangerous levels of pollutants were swirling 
about the site at the same time the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
assured the public that the air was safe to breathe.
<P>Thomas Cahill, a professor emeritus of physics and atmospheric science, 
headed the scientific team that studied the aerosols from the fuming site in 
lower Manhattan during the weeks right after Sept. 11, 2001.
<P>In an interview Tuesday, Cahill called the conditions for people working at 
ground zero without respirators "brutal" and said conditions were only 
slightly better for those working or living in adjacent buildings.
<P>"The site was hot for months. The metals burned into fine particles. They 
rose in a plume and moved over people's heads on most days. There were at 
least eight days when the plume was pushed down into the city. Then people 
tasted it, smelled it and saw it. But people who worked in the pile were 
getting it every day. The workers are the ones that I worry about most," 
Cahill told The Chronicle.
<P>Cahill's data found that the pollution included very fine metals, which 
interfere with lung chemistry; sulfuric acid, which attacks lung cells; 
carcinogenic organic matter; and very fine insoluble particles such as glass, 
which travel through the lungs and into the bloodstream and heart.
<P>He is expected to present his latest findings at a national meeting of the 
American Chemical Society in New York today.
<P>Cahill's comments echo a report issued in August by the EPA inspector 
general, an internal watchdog on the agency. The inspector general concluded 
that under White House influence, the EPA issued misleading assurances that 
there was no health risk from air pollution after the attack.
<P>A week after the attack, the EPA announced that the air near ground zero 
was safe to breathe, but the agency did not have enough information to make 
such a guarantee, the inspector general's report said.
<P>"Christie Whitman was too premature to say it was safe," Cahill said 
Tuesday. "I think the EPA should have known. The EPA had its own reports 
saying it could be dangerous. Why didn't the EPA bring in their own people 
from all over the country? They could have. Never thought of it. They did 
later. But not in the time that mattered."
<P><b>WHITE HOUSE PRESSURE</b>
<P>The White House "convinced EPA to add reassuring statements and delete 
cautionary ones" by having the National Security Council control EPA 
communications, the inspector general's report found.
<P>Marianne Horinko, EPA acting administrator, has defended her agency's 
post-Sept. 11 statements about air quality, saying the agency put out "the 
best information we had, based on just the best data that we had available at 
the time."
<P>The EPA's public messages stand at the center of the confirmation of Utah 
Gov. Mike Leavitt to replace former EPA administrator Whitman, who resigned in 
May.
<P>Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, D-N.Y., pledged last week to block his 
appointment unless the White House takes responsibility for telling the EPA to 
disseminate misleading reassurances.
<P>Cahill heads the DELTA Group, which stands for Detection and Evaluation of 
Long-range Transport of Aerosols, an association of scientists at several 
universities and national laboratories. The U.S. Energy Department asked the 
group to monitor air quality in New York. The group has studied global 
transport of aerosols from the Gulf War oil fires in Kuwait in 1991, volcanoes, dust storms and worldwide factory emissions in China.
<P><b>HEALTH CONCERNS</b>
<P>In the two years since the attack, thousands of New Yorkers have contacted 
the World Trade Center health registry, reporting cases of persistent coughs, 
wheezing, shortness of breath and sinus inflammation.
<P>A year ago, the New York Fire Department reported that up to 500 employees 
may have to retire early as a result of respiratory disability or chronic 
breathing problems caused by their exposure to dense clouds of dust, smoke and 
fumes at the site.
<P>Cahill's first report in 2002, based on 8,000 air samples collected a mile 
from the complex, found high levels of very fine airborne particles that could 
increase risk of lung damage and heart attacks.
<P>The new data confirm four classes of pollutants at levels higher than what 
Cahill's group found in Kuwait or China, Cahill said. Tons of concrete, glass, 
furniture, carpets, insulation, computers and paper were reduced to debris 
piles that burned for three months.
<P>In that hot pile, some of the elements combined with organic matter and 
abundant chlorine from papers and plastics and then escaped to the surface as 
metal-rich gases. They burned or chemically decomposed into very fine 
particles capable of penetrating deeply into human lungs, Cahill said.
