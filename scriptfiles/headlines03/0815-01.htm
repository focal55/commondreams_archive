<p>BAGHDAD - Clerics from across the Muslim  sectarian divide blasted the U.S. occupation of Iraq in Friday  prayers as guerrilla hit-and-run attacks in the center of the  country inflicted more American casualties.

      Iraqi Shi'ites gather in the Baghdad suburb of Sadr City, prior to Friday prayers August 15, 2003. Thousands of Shi'ite Muslims gathered for prayers chanting &quot;Yes for Islam, No to America.&quot; More than 3,000 worshippers flocked to the street where U.S. forces shot one Iraqi dead and wounded four during a protest earlier in the week.

  </table></font>Two U.S. soldiers and three Iraqi civilians were wounded  when gunmen fired two rocket-propelled grenades at a small  military convoy near the town of Balad, northeast of Baghdad.<P>
"The Iraqis were treated at the scene and released while  the soldiers were (evacuated) to a field hospital and are in  stable condition," said Lieutenant-Colonel William MacDonald,  spokesman for the 4th Infantry Division. "We have not yet  captured the attackers."<P>
The division is leading the hunt for ousted leader Saddam  Hussein in the area around his hometown of Tikrit. U.S. troops  have detained 14 Iraqis in the past 24 hours and seized  surface-to-air missiles, rockets, rocket-propelled grenades and  mortars, MacDonald said.<P>
U.S. forces are facing a guerrilla campaign in Sunni areas  where support for Saddam is strongest and 60 soldiers have been  killed since May 1.<P>
There are also signs of surging resentment among Iraq's  Shi'ite Muslim majority, which generally welcomed Saddam's  overthrow in the U.S.-led invasion that began in March.<P>
A roadside bomb killed a British soldier and wounded two on  Thursday in the southern city of Basra after a weekend of  unrest by the city's Shi'ite population.<P>
Chanting "Yes for Islam, No to America," more than 5,000  worshippers held prayers in open air at a street in northern  Baghdad's Sadr City, where U.S. forces shot dead one Iraqi and  wounded four during a protest earlier in the week.<P>
"What happened (in Sadr City this week) clearly shows that  America and international Zionism have declared war against  Islam," Sheikh Abdul Hadi al-Daraji said.<P>
"We tell you, the whole world and the United States of  America that the sons of Iraq will retaliate twice as hard  against anyone who attacks us or our sacred symbols."<P>
APOLOGY REJECTED<P>
Shi'ite residents of Sadr City have rejected a U.S. apology  for provoking Wednesday's protest and vowed more violence  unless U.S. troops withdraw from the district.<P>
Thousands of Iraqis took to the streets of the impoverished  district on Wednesday after a U.S. helicopter flew near the  banner of a religious school, hanging from a communications  tower.<P>
Locals said the helicopter tore down the banner, while the  U.S. Army said it might have been blown off accidentally.<P>
Daraji said U.S. troops must leave Sadr City and apologize  more profusely for the incident, as well as pay compensation to  the victims of the ensuing violence and their families.<P>
Most Shi'ites in Iraq say they were oppressed by Saddam, a  Sunni. But some powerful Shi'ite clerics have spoken out  against the occupation and anger is also brewing in mainly  Shi'ite southern Iraq over chronic fuel and electricity  shortages.<P>
Riots erupted in Basra on Saturday and Sunday in protest at  the shortages. A Nepalese Gurkha private security guard and two  Iraqis were killed.<P>
In the Sunni town of Falluja, Sheikh Abdullah al-Janabi  said U.S. troops faced more attacks if they remained in Iraq.<P>
"The future will witness more killing and resistance  operations against the United States in Iraq," he told hundreds  of worshippers in a mosque in the town, 50 km (32 miles) west  of Baghdad.
<P>
Janabi also took a swipe at Saddam and his "cronies,"  saying they had fled in the face of the U.S.-led invasion.
