<p>Russia says it has not yet reached a decision on whether to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, the global climate treaty. 

<p>It has effectively disowned an official who said on Tuesday that Russia would not ratify, and it is still in the process of coming to a decision.

  </table></font>The official, Andrei Illarionov, said Russia would not back Kyoto in its present form, citing economic reasons. 

<p>The treaty cannot acquire the force of international law unless Russia, one of the world's big polluters, ratifies it. 

<p>Mr Illarionov, President Putin's chief adviser on economic issues, said in Moscow: "Of course, in its present form, this protocol cannot be ratified. It is impossible to undertake responsibilities that place serious limits on the country's growth." 

<p>But Russia's deputy economy minister, Mukhamed Tsikhanov, said the country was moving towards the treaty. 

<p>He said: "There are no decisions about ratification apart from the fact that we are moving towards ratification. 

<p>"I cannot comment on Illarionov, but we do not have any information in the government about the fact that a decision has been made." 

<p>Asked what Russia's final decision depended on, Mr Tsikhanov replied: "You should put this question to Japan and the European Union, about when they will start to speak to us in economic language." 

<p>He said the decision on ratification could be put to the Duma (lower house of parliament) next year. 

<p>US reluctance 

<p>The countries which have signed the United Nations Climate Change Convention, are meeting in the Italian city of Milan this week and next. 

<p>The protocol, negotiated to implement the convention, requires industrialized countries to cut their emissions of six gases which scientists believe are exacerbating natural climate change. 

<p>Signatories will by some time between 2008 and 2012 have to cut emissions to 5.2% below their 1990 levels. 
<p>But many scientists say cuts of around 60-70% will be needed by mid-century to avoid runaway climate change. 

<p>The protocol will enter into force when 55 signatories have ratified it, including industrialized countries responsible for 55% of the developed world's carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in 1990. 

<p>Some critics say President Bush's decision that the US, which emits more greenhouse gases than any other country, would not ratify the protocol has already condemned it to irrelevance. 

<p>But enough other signatories have done so for it to enter into force if Russia, another big polluter responsible for 17% of global emissions, does decide to ratify.</p>
