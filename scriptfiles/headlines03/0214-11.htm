<p>WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- A federal court judge has barred the State of Florida from trying to block plans by a group of women to gather in a state park, strip nude and form a peace symbol with their bodies in protest of a U.S. war on Iraq. 



<p>U.S. District Judge Donald M. Middlebrooks wrote an eleven-page order stating that "nude overtly political speech in the form of a 'living nude peace symbol' is expressive conduct well within the ambit of the First Amendment." 



<p>Middlebrooks also ruled, however, that the state could erect signs to notify the public that the protest would be taking place, or it could put screens around the demonstrators. 



<p>The American Civil Liberties Union of Florida went to court in defense of a naturist and a videographer who planned to record the event. 



<p>The demonstration is taking place this morning at John D. MacArthur Beach State Park on Singer Island, north of West Palm Beach.
