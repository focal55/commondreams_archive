<p>With war brewing on the other side of the world as a new year is ushered in, Baltimoreans are likely to see more anti-war protesters in 2003 - a sign of what peace leaders say is a new age of mobilization.<p>

The word among activists is that more Marylanders are joining grass-roots peace networks and preparing for public dissent. The War Memorial Plaza in front of City Hall and the federal courthouse on Pratt Street are major venues marked for &quot;emergency demonstrations&quot; should a war on Iraq break out, organizers said.<p>

&quot;There&#39;s little doubt there&#39;s a new spirit out there, with a mixture of people who were active in the Vietnam War days and new people,&quot; said Max Obuszewski, a spokesman for the American Friends Service Committee, an activist arm of the Religious Society of Friends pacifist religion.<p>

Groups of high-profile protesters, including those who looked up to the late Philip Berrigan, are rallying in the Baltimore region to the anti-war cause. There&#39;s a march on Washington coming up, organizers are passing around a &quot;pledge of resistance&quot; for Marylanders to sign, and there&#39;s a campaign under way urging city houses of worship to take a stand against U.S. military action in Iraq.<p>

Among the new coalition of protesters is Citizens for Peace, which began as a group of friends meeting in a Northeast Baltimore living room and quickly mustered nearly 200 marchers at a holiday lighting event a month ago.<p>

Their earliest exercise was gathering outside Maryland Democratic Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski&#39;s office, urging her to vote against the war resolution - which she did. The next stop will be the Washington anti-war march Jan. 18.<p>

&quot;People are very frustrated at the madness of a war and not knowing what to do,&quot; said Peter French, a middle school teacher who held the first Citizens for Peace meeting at his Lauraville home.<p>

A few are taking their protest abroad. Ellen Barfield, a peace activist who lives in Hampden, embarked on a journey to witness conditions in Iraq.

<p>

Barfield is on a peace team mission to the Middle East on behalf of a Chicago-based group, Voices in the Wilderness. (The group was fined $20,000 by the U.S. Treasury for delivering medicine to Iraqi civilian health care workers in defiance of government sanctions, spokeswoman Stephanie Schaudel said.)<p>

Better known as Quakers, the Friends society holds hourlong vigils outside its 4805 York Road office and its Homewood meetinghouse at 3107 N. Charles St. at 5 p.m. on Tuesdays and Fridays, respectively. The service committee intends to write to other religious institutions in Baltimore, asking each to speak out against a war.<p>

Elizabeth McAlister, a founding member of Jonah House in West Baltimore with Berrigan, the activist, former priest and her husband, was briefly detained Monday for demonstrating outside the Pentagon against a possible war.<p>

In an interview three weeks after Berrigan&#39;s death, McAlister said she also senses a new anti-war spirit.<p>

&quot;I do perceive more people willing to take risks, from grandmothers to young people, &quot; McAlister said this week. Looking ahead to the Jan. 18 anti-war march at which she is to speak, she added, &quot;I suspect we&#39;ll see the same in Washington, D.C.&quot;<p>

The Baltimore Peace Action Network - a small collection of individuals - has become a way for war opponents to compare notes and strategies, organizers said.<p>

Then there is a &quot;pledge of resistance,&quot; which applies only to those willing to be arrested after committing acts of civil disobedience. At least 175 Marylanders have signed it, Obuszewski said, along with a estimated 5,000 people across the nation.<p>

The prospect of fresh recruits to an anti-war cause heartens experienced dissenters who see Berrigan&#39;s passing as a sign of a new era.<p>

&quot;A lot of people I see are motivated by Phil&#39;s legacy,&quot; Obuszewski said.<p>

Among those new to the art of resistance is Marcia Allwine, a secretary at a downtown law firm. Allwine said the Internet helped her find other city residents who oppose a military campaign in Iraq. She plans to take a training session on nonviolent resistance offered by the AFSC Jan. 5 and Jan. 11.<p>

&quot;Dissent is the most patriotic thing we can do. I tell you, I&#39;m concerned about the direction this country is headed,&quot; she said. &quot;I plan to be arrested.&quot;
