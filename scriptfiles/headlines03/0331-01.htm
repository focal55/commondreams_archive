<p> CAIRO - Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak

said on Monday the U.S.-led war on Iraq would produce &quot;one

hundred new bin Ladens&quot;, driving more Muslims to anti-Western

militancy.

A wounded Iraqi girl  in central Iraq  March 29, 2003. Confused front line crossfire ripped apart an Iraqi family on Saturday after local soldiers appeared to force civilians towards U.S. marines positions. The four-year old girl, blood streaming from an eye wound, was screaming for her dead mother, while her father, shot in a leg, begged to be freed from the plastic wrist cuffs slapped on him by U.S. marines, so he could hug his other terrified daughter.

</table></font>&quot;When it is over, if it is over, this war will have horrible

consequences,&quot; Mubarak told Egyptian soldiers in the city of

Suez.<p></p> &quot;Instead of having one (Osama) bin Laden, we will have 100

bin Ladens,&quot; he added. Osama bin Laden is the Saudi-born

fugitive Islamic militant leader blamed by the United States for

the September 11, 2001 attacks on New York and Washington.<p></p> Egypt, a key regional U.S. ally which has cracked down hard

on Islamic militants, publicly opposes the war launched by

Washington to overthrow President Saddam Hussein.<p></p> European opponents of the war, led by French President

Jacques Chirac, have also argued that military action against

Iraq would fuel terrorism and split the international coalition

assembled by Washington to fight bin Laden's al Qaeda network.<p></p> Mubarak said Iraqi forces fighting U.S. and British troops

were &quot;guarding Iraq's lands and defending its national honour

and nobility&quot; in the conflict.<p></p> Reflecting widespread public anger at what many Arabs see as

Western aggression against an Arab country, he said the war

woould cause a &quot;great tragedy (and) destroy a deep-rooted

culture and people&quot;.<p></p> &quot;Egypt's position has been and still is clear in

rejecting...the military option and rejecting participation in

military action of the coalition forces against brotherly Iraq,&quot;

he said.<p></p> Mubarak said the war had raised many questions, especially

among the Arab and Muslim peoples of the Middle East, about the

&quot;credibility of the international system of collective security

represented in the United Nations&quot;.<p></p> Many Arabs think Washington has employed double standards in

enforcing U.N. resolutions on Iraq while not making Israel

comply with resolutions demanding withdrawal from Palestinian

territories and an end to Jewish settlements.<p></p> Mubarak read out the highlights of an international plan for

Israeli-Palestinian peace called the &quot;roadmap&quot;, saying that

while the Palestinian Authority had accepted it, the government

of Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon had asked for 100

changes.<p></p> &quot;This means the roadmap has been rendered meaningless.

Unless the big powers agree and put forward a mechanism to

implement it without any alterations...I believe the roadmap

will not move on the right road and it might lead to

complications,&quot; he said.
