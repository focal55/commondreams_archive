<p>International pressure group <a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/homepage/" target="_new">Greenpeace</a> today stepped up its campaign against war with Iraq by blocking a major UK military port, according to the charity.

<P>

At 9am today, Greenpeace's flagship Rainbow Warrior dropped anchor at Marchwood, Southampton, blocking the entrance to the military supply port.

Rainbow Warrior Blocks Military Port<br>

</table></font>As well as blockading the Hampshire harbour, two 

Greenpeace protesters have climbed aboard a military supply ship, according to a Greenpeace spokeswoman.

<P>

In the past two weeks the support arm of the Navy, the Royal Fleet Auxiliary, has been despatching a fleet of ships loaded with tanks, helicopters and Royal Marines headed to the Gulf.

<P>

The nine RFA ships will be supporting the Royal Naval Task Group headed by the aircraft carrier HMS Ark Royal.

<P>

The Greenpeace spokeswoman said the aim of today's action is to disrupt the naval ships joining the military build-up in the Gulf.

<P>

She said: "Rainbow Warrior has blockaded the UK military port of Marchwood at Southampton.

<P>

"We want to cut the military supply chain to the war in Iraq.

<P>

"Day and night ships and containers have been loaded up with helicopters and tanks at Marchwood bound for the Gulf.

</table></font>"We have got some Greenpeace climbers who have attached themselves to one of the supply vessels and Rainbow Warrior is anchored directly across the mouth of the military docks.

<P>

"This peaceful action is part of a global campaign to prevent a war that will kill hundreds of thousands of people and increase the chances of weapons of mass destruction being used.

<P>

"We want to stop this relentless rush towards a war which is basically placing a higher price on oil than blood."

<P>

The spokeswoman added that the Rainbow Warrior had a team of 25 protesters and Greenpeace intended to keep the ship in position at Marchwood as long as possible.

<P>

A protester was arrested today as he attempted to board a military supply ship, according to a Royal Navy spokesman.

<P>

At about 9am, military police detained the man after he climbed on the jetty at the Marchwood port.

<P>

But two other protesters managed to climb aboard two merchant ships leased by the Ministry of Defence as supply vessels.

</table></font>One of the ships currently in dock is destined for the Falkland Islands, with the other due to join the Navy Task Group heading for the Gulf.

<P>

A Navy spokesman said the actions of Greenpeace had so far not disrupted the loading of the ships.

<P>

He added that Rainbow Warrior would not be allowed to delay the planned departure of the ships later today - but declined to say what action would be taken to stop the blockade.

<P>

The spokesman said: "One person was arrested by the military police and two others got on board the ship. One was on the top of a mast and the other was dangling over the side painting a slogan on the side of the ship.

<P>

"Nothing has been delayed so far, we are continuing with the operation. The loading has not been disrupted, it is continuing and it will not be prevented in any way.

<P>

"I cannot speculate on what Rainbow Warrior will do but if they decide to break the law then they will lay themselves open to arrest."

<P>

Police patrol boats despatched by both the civilian police and military police are patrolling the Rainbow Warrior today, according to a spokeswoman for Hampshire Police.

</table></font>The spokeswoman said that at present no action had been taken against the campaign ship but the marine units, as well two patrol cars, were on stand-by.

<P>

The MoD today said responsibility for dealing with the blockade lay with the civil authorities.

<P>

A spokesman said: "Greenpeace, like any other lobby group, are able to demonstrate peacefully.

<P>

"But if they cause hindrance to operations or any other activity then the port authorities will need to take action.

<P>

"If they are breaking the law then civil authorities will take charge of it."
