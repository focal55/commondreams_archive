<p>It sounds like the beginning of a political joke: What do you get when you put Moby, a former White House chief of staff and Katrina vanden Heuvel in the same room?</p>
<P>
What you got on Tuesday night was an unorthodox attempt to combine brains, beauty and star power to focus criticism of the war in Iraq and the White House's foreign policy. The occasion was a screening of a documentary film called "Uncovered: The Whole Truth About the Iraq War" by Robert Greenwald, a Hollywood producer and director who has spent the last several months interviewing former diplomats, weapons inspectors, scientists and career spies to try to show that the Bush administration misled the public and Congress in the lead-up to the invasion of Iraq.</p>
<P>
Part television expos&#0233;, part long-form political advertisement, the film, shown in a stylishly dim basement lounge at the TriBeCa Grand Hotel, drew a crowd of about 100 stylish people who ate St. Andr&#0233; cheese, drank pinot grigio and looked like weathered veterans of such downtown screenings.</p>
<P>
But the event was also a kind of New York coming-out party for the <a href="http://www.centerforamericanprogress.org/" target="_new">Center for American Progress</a>, a new liberal Washington institute created by John Podesta, President Bill Clinton's last chief of staff. And as such, the opening made for some strange theater seatmates.</p>
<P>
While not exactly as sensational as the Vietnam-era radical chic of Leonard Bernstein and the Black Panthers, the TriBeCa affair was nonetheless the first time that the actress Janeane Garofalo had rubbed elbows with Joseph C. Wilson IV, the former ambassador who has accused the White House of manipulating intelligence about Iraq and who says the administration leaked the identity of his wife, Valerie Plame, a C.I.A. officer, in retaliation. (The Justice Department has begun a criminal investigation into whether a leak occurred.)</p>
<P>
Or that Moby, the electronica musician, had chatted with Ms. vanden Heuvel, the telegenic editor of the The Nation, and John Brady Kiesling, the former political counselor at the United States Embassy in Athens, who resigned in February to protest American policies in Iraq.</p>
<P>
Mr. Podesta, who weaved through the crowd like a merry matchmaker, said that the Center for American Progress had decided to help finance the 60-minute documentary because he felt that criticism of the White House's justifications for the war needed an approach "much more creative than the &#0151; you know &#0151; hold a conference, write a white paper."</p>
<P>
"I think so much political information is just blotted out from people's minds," he said. "We've got to reach people in the way that they're seeing and experiencing information. And I think people are angry about this now, and frustrated. I think people feel a little bit had, and that's what this is about. Actually, strike the `little bit.' "</p>
<P>
He added that while connections between liberal politics and the arts and entertainment world, especially in Hollywood, were nothing new, they rarely produced anything like Mr. Greenwald's documentary, which is being distributed on DVD's through the Web site of MoveOn.org, an advocacy group that protested the war.</p>
<P>
"At some level the connection between Hollywood and Washington is a connection about power, not creativity," Mr. Podesta said, adding that the cultures of the two places were often so different that, while they often agreed politically, they were unable to work together. "People sort of talk past each other."</p>
<P>
They were talking mostly to each other Tuesday night. Mr. Wilson, who is interviewed in the documentary, was talking to Mr. Greenwald, who was talking to Ms. Garofalo, who knew Mr. Greenwald because she starred three years ago in a movie of his about Abbie Hoffman called "Steal This Movie!"</p>
<P>
Mr. Greenwald's documentary, which has also been screened in Washington, will undoubtedly attract a different kind of critic than many of his previous films, which include the television movie "The Burning Bed," and "Xanadu," starring Olivia Newton-John.</p>
<P>
Scott Reed, a Republican strategist in Washington who has not yet seen the movie but has heard about it, belittled it as an awkward attempt by the left to find traction with voters as the presidential campaign heats up. "Podesta is desperately trying to become relevant through gimmicks like this," he said yesterday, adding that the presence in the documentary of Mr. Wilson, a registered Democrat who is supporting the presidential candidacy of Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, "cheapens the whole thing."</p>
<P>
"My sense is that Podesta is attempting to catch a wave here with some nontraditional voters," he said. "And he's going to be alienating them by injecting politics into this issue."</p>
<P>
But Mr. Podesta and Eli Pariser, the international campaigns director of MoveOn.org, said that by all early indications there was an eager audience for the movie. At the moment there are no plans to show it on television or release it theatrically; instead its creators will urge people to screen it at house parties around the country.</p>
<P>
Mr. Pariser said at the screening that when his organization began to offer the DVD to anyone who contributed $30 or more, 22,000 copies of the movie were ordered.</p>
<P>
"Honestly, I would have expected a couple of thousand people to respond," he said, describing his group's $50,000 investment in the film as "grass-roots venture capital that is already beginning to pay dividends."</p>
<P>
Mr. Podesta said that those dividends were particularly evident when the film was screened recently in Washington and "lots of establishment people &#0151; I mean, real Washington establishment, lots of gray hair &#0151; got very excited about it and said they were going to show it to all of their friends."</p>
<P>
"All of the sudden," he said, "it was like they were young again."</p>
