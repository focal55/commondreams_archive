<p>WASHINGTON  - Former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean accused some party insiders on Sunday of desperation politics in backing Democratic presidential rival Wesley Clark, a retired general who voted Republican in the past.

<p>Dean, who has campaigned as a Washington outsider, said members of the establishment embraced the former NATO commander after White House bids of others in their circle sputtered.

<p>"I think that Wes Clark is, first of all, a good guy," Dean told CBS's "Face the Nation." But Dean added, "I think what you see in the Wes Clark candidacy is a somewhat of a desperation by inside-the-Beltway politicians."

<p>"You've got a lot of establishment politicians now surrounding a general who was a Republican until 25 days ago," said Dean.

<p>Clark declared his candidacy and party affiliation as a Democrat this month, and promptly replaced Dean atop a number of polls for the 2004 Democratic presidential nomination.

<p>Clark joined Dean and eight other Democratic presidential candidates for his first debate last week as some polls showed the political newcomer even with President Bush.

<p>Bush's job approval ratings have dropped from the 70 percent range during the Iraq war to below 50 percent, about what where they were before the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.

<p>Dean noted that Clark voted for Republicans Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon for president. "I think that's going to be hard to swallow for a lot of Democrats," Dean said.

<p>Another Democratic presidential contender, U.S. Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri, took aim at Dean.

<p>Again sounding a line from the Thursday debate, Gephardt accused Dean of having echoed Republican criticism nearly a decade ago of the federal Medicare health insurance program, a critical issue to older voters.

<p>"We need to improve (Medicare), but we sure don't need to adopt the Republican rhetoric on this that it's a horrible program. It's not. It's a great program," Gephardt told NBC's "Meet the Press."

<p>Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina, who is also seeking the 2004 Democratic nomination, said he would not back the Bush administration's request for $20 billion for Iraqi reconstruction until it answers questions about the postwar effort.

<p>"Questions, like ... what are we going to do to bring our friends and allies into this process, how long is this going to go on, what is the long-term plan, what do we expect the long-term cost to be?" Edwards told "Fox News Sunday."

<p>Americans are increasingly concerned about the soaring costs of the Iraqi operation. Besides the $20 billion for reconstruction, Bush has asked the U.S. Congress for $67 billion more for the U.S. military deployment. He received $79 billion in emergency funding mostly for the Iraqi operation in April. (Additional reporting by Douglas Palmer)
