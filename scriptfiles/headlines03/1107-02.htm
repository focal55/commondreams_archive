<p> DUBAI  - President George Bush's calls for democracy rang hollow in the Middle East, where many said on Friday they were appalled Washington was preaching liberty for Arabs while occupying Iraq.

</table>The war on Iraq and Washington's support for Israel in its bloody conflict with the Palestinians have antagonized many Arabs and Muslims who were already seething at the United States' war on terror, seen by many as a battle against Islam.

<p>And Bush's sweeping foreign policy speech on Thursday, in which he challenged ally Egypt and foes Iran and Syria to adopt democracy, fueled Arab indignation.

<p>``Bush's speech is like a boring, broken record that nobody believes,'' said Gulf-based political analyst Moghazy al-Badrawy.

<p>``He wants democracy and the U.S. is occupying Iraq and its ally Israel is killing Palestinians? Arabs just don't buy it.''

<p>Abdel-Monem Said, director of Egypt's Al-Ahram Center for Political Strategic Studies, said the perceived U.S. dishonesty in justifying the Iraq war had also tarnished its credibility.

<p>``Democracy is all about legalities, rule of law and legitimacy,'' he said. ``There is an issue of double standards.''

<p>Mohammad al-Bsairi, a Kuwaiti member of parliament and spokesman for the Gulf state's Muslim Brotherhood, told Reuters Washington's blind bias for Israel -- battling a Palestinian independence uprising -- also flew in the face of democracy.

<p>Lebanon's top Shi'ite Muslim cleric, Sheikh Mohammad Hussein Fadlallah, scornfully described Bush's call as an attempt to ensure compliancy in the region, rather than better lives.

<p>``It's the democracy of the American administration to preserve its strategic interests in the Middle East and not to preserve the interests of the people,'' he said at a sermon.

<p>In an editorial, Saudi Arabia's leading Al-Riyadh daily said it was ironic that Bush was now concerned with the welfare of the Arab people after the United States vetoed almost all U.N. resolutions that would benefit them.

<p>``America is traveling in a path that is totally opposite to the economic and political future of the Arabs,'' it added.

<p><b>DOUBLE STANDARDS</b>
<p>Some commentators said Bush's Middle East assessment -- in which he praised many authoritarian governments and criticized Iran and Syria -- was based on which nations backed U.S. policies rather than their democratic credentials.

<p>``Praising Saudi Arabia and criticizing Iran. It's not fair at all,'' said Egyptian analyst Gamal A.G. Soltan. ``The spectrum of freedom available in Iran is much wider than Saudi Arabia.''

<p>Bush also appeared to add insult to injury when he said the United States had made a mistake by supporting non-democratic governments in the region for the past 60 years, analysts said.

<p>Washington has for decades backed governments throughout much of the Middle East which are seen by their own citizens as totalitarian, corrupt, politically illegitimate and un-Islamic.

<p>``Mr. Bush has not read history. Who supported and still supports the very governments whose oppressive rules breed extremism and terrorism?'' asked an Arab analyst based in Dubai.

<p>Other Arab commentators read the speech as a precursor for U.S.-backed aggressions in the Middle East aimed at justifying the U.S. presence in Iraq despite mounting casualties.

<p>``As the crisis in Iraq deepens, the United States is trying to open a new front in the region, especially with Syria,'' Qatar's Al-Sharq newspaper said in an editorial.

<p>However, some Arabs put a positive spin on Bush's speech, saying it might be the first step toward democracy.

<p>``Democracy is a demand and I think that Middle Eastern countries will never grant it to its people without international pressure,'' said Saudi employee Abdulrahman Nasser.
