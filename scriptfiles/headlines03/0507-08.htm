<p>Ten years ago, Rep. John Spratt, D-S.C., co-sponsored a widely supported piece of legislation that seemed an enlightened coda to the Cold War.</p>
<p>After the military had eliminated most of its smaller, tactical nuclear weapons, Spratt's amendment codified the leap by prohibiting the development of any more of these low-yield warheads.</p>

</table>In a remarkable sign of the times, a congressional committee will debate today the repeal of the so-called Spratt-Furse Amendment, under a proposal by the Bush administration.</p>
<p>Further, the White House is pushing in next year's defense authorization bill for funds to design a new generation of bunker-buster nuclear warheads and to increase the readiness of the underground site in Nevada where the weapons were once tested, which could lead to the end of a decade-old test ban and send ripples around the globe.</p>
<p>The Bush administration describes its aggressive nuclear policies -- which appear likely to sail through the Republican-controlled Congress -- as a necessary response to the more dangerous world it faces, particularly with countries such as North Korea and Iran developing a nuclear capability. The aim, the White House said, is to provide ways of attacking buried caches of weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p>But Spratt and many arms-control experts said conventional weapons could do the job just as well, as the recent bombing campaign in Iraq demonstrated. They expressed amazement that what had seemed a firm resolve to cut back on the most dangerous weapons ever created had eroded so quickly since the end of the Cold War.</p>
<p>"We saw this as one small symbolic way of saying, 'Let's not backslide into thinking about using these tactical weapons,' " Spratt said in an interview. "We decided we didn't want to go back. We'd been there."</p>
<p>He added that his biggest concern was that the military might regard the low-yield nuclear weapons as just bigger bombs, rather than an entirely different level of warfare that increased the risks of devastating nuclear exchanges. Repealing his amendment, he said, seems like it will lower the threshold all over again, creating weapons that will seem more "usable" than the hugely destructive "strategic" nuclear warheads in the arsenal.</p>
<p>Just how provocative those steps could prove was evident half a world away in Geneva, where dozens of countries have been meeting over the past week to strengthen one of the principal arms-controls agreements, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.</p>
<p>Jayantha Dhanapala, undersecretary-general for disarmament affairs at the United Nations, said there were already deep concerns that the Bush administration's nuclear policies could trigger a new arms race and undermine years of success in limiting the spread of the weapons.</p>
<p>"I never imagined that this kind of regression would take place," said Dhanapala. He added that if the Bush administration were to create new low-yield weapons and then resume underground testing, other countries would surely follow.</p>
<p>The Bush administration insists it supports most of the arms-control agreements past presidents have signed. In a statement read at the Geneva conference last week, Secretary of State Colin Powell said that the Bush administration had "an intention to reduce our reliance on nuclear weapons" and that "the spread of nuclear weapons would gravely destabilize our world."</p>
<p>But a number of administration officials have cast scorn on old agreements for failing to restrain nations such as North Korea and Iran and have demanded a more muscular U.S. response -- especially the repeal of the Spratt-Furse Amendment and a big push on developing new nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>Spratt said that, given the Republican majority in Congress, he was hoping merely to water down the White House effort. He said he was proposing to loosen his amendment so it would allow advanced design work on low-yield weapons, but not actual production.</p>
<p>In addition, he said, he is seeking to pass an amendment that would require the president to seek congressional approval if he plans to resume nuclear testing.</p>
