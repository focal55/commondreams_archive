<p>The struggling presidential campaign of Ohio Rep. Dennis Kucinich got a brief boost from an unidentified hacker Friday when a pro-Kucinich advertisement took over <B>CBSNews.com</b>.
<p>The Kucinich campaign denied involvement.
<p>At around 9:30 a.m. a page bearing the Kucinich campaign logo appeared in place of the CBSNews.com homepage. 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><table border=0 align=right hspace=5 cellpadding=6 width="350">
    <tr valign="top">
      <td width=350 height="262" align=right><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><img border="0" src="images/1003-04.jpg" width="350" height="263"><br>

  </table></font>The screen automatically shifted to a page playing a 30-minute video called "This Is The Moment," in which the liberal congressman — aided by the likes of actor Ed Asner — outlines his philosophy.
<p>"According to the most recent CBSnews/nytimes poll, 77% of Democrats do not know enough about Dennis Kucinich. Since we can not expect the media to provide this information I decided to help them out," the hacker page read. "Please watch this video and listen to the man who has inspired me into taking this rash action."
<p>"There are honest politicians out there, you just have to look past the bs. I suggest checking out select smart to see who really agrees with you, not simply who sounds the best," it continues. "we don't want another Florida do we people?"
<p>The hacker page provided links to the Kucinich campaign for people who wished to contribute or volunteer.
<p>A CBS spokeswoman said the network was looking into the matter.
<p>A spokesman for the Kucinich campaign denied any involvement by the congressman's campaign staff.
<p>"It cannot be that anyone in my campaign is involved in such a thing," spokesman David Swanson said. "Our campaign would never do such a thing or condone such a thing. We are not interested in taking over someone else's website, I can assure you."
<p>The poll to which the hacker referred, published Thursday, revealed Kucinich running 10th in the field of 10 seeking the Democratic nomination with support from 1 percent of respondents. 
<p>When voters were asked who has the best chance of beating President Bush, Kucinich was the only candidate with 0 percent. Five percent of respondents have a favorable view of him, 8 percent had an unfavorable view, and 86 percent hadn't heard of him — making Kucinich the least-known candidate.
<p>The poll was conducted among a nationwide random sample of 981 adults interviewed by telephone from Sept. 28 to Oct. 1, and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
<p>CBSNews.com was also hacked during the 2000 presidential campaign with anti-Bush material.
