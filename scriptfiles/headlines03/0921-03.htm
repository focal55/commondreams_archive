<p>BAGHDAD   - Attackers killed two American soldiers  in a mortar attack and a third died from a roadside bomb blast  in the latest strikes against U.S. occupation forces in Iraq,  military officials said Sunday.<P>

The Saturday night attacks and an assassination attempt on  a member of Iraq's U.S.-backed Governing Council earlier in the  day cast a shadow over efforts by the country's interim leaders  to entice investors with a raft of liberal economic measures.<P>

  </table></font>Iraq's new finance minister announced the reforms,  including allowing foreign investments into all sectors except  oil, in Dubai Sunday. But the violence plaguing the country is  bound to make many investors extremely wary.<P>

Under cover of darkness, guerrillas fired two mortar bombs  Saturday evening at the Abu Ghraib prison west of Baghdad which  is guarded and run by the U.S. Army.<P>

"There were two soldiers killed and 13 wounded," a military  spokeswoman said, adding that the dead were military police.<P>

She said no detainees were injured in the attack.<P>

On August 17, assailants fired mortar rounds on the prison  killing six Iraqis and wounding 59.<P>

U.S. forces hold common criminals and Iraqis suspected of  guerrilla attacks against them at the jail, one of the largest  in Iraq and which human rights groups say was notorious for the  execution and torture of inmates during Saddam Hussein's rule.<P>

Also Saturday night, a soldier from the U.S. 3rd Armored  Cavalry Regiment was killed by a bomb attack on his vehicle. He  was pronounced dead on his way to a military hospital, U.S.  Central Command said in a statement.<P>

The deaths raised to 79 the number of U.S. soldiers killed  by hostile fire since President Bush declared major combat in  Iraq over on May 1, following the war that ousted Saddam the  previous month.<P>

The rising death toll is putting more pressure on Bush at  home as he seeks a new U.N. resolution to create a  multinational force for Iraq.<P>

But France and Germany, opponents of the U.S.-led war that  toppled Saddam, are demanding that the U.S. agree to a fast  handover of power to Iraqis. The U.S. believes a speedy power  transfer would lead to failure.<P>

Leaders of France and Germany stood firm on their demand at  weekend talks in Berlin with Britain's Tony Blair, casting  doubt on whether talks with the United States this week will  make progress.<P>

SADDAM'S SUPPORTERS BLAMED<P>

U.S. commanders mainly blame secular Saddam loyalists for  attacks on troops, running at about a dozen a day. Some Iraqis  argue that resistance fighters are motivated by Islamic beliefs  and revulsion at seeing their country under occupation.<P>

Guerrillas are also targeting Iraqis cooperating with the  occupiers. Saturday morning, gunmen shot and critically wounded  Akila al-Hashemi, a Shi'ite career diplomat who is one of three  women on the U.S.-appointed Governing Council.<P>

Hashemi was in a critical but stable condition having  undergone two operations, a senior official in Iraq's U.S.-led  administration told reporters Sunday.<P>

Despite the violence, officials have voiced determination  to push on with efforts to transform Iraq after decades of  authoritarian rule under Saddam.<P>

Finance Minister Kamel al-Keylani unveiled plans to open up  Iraq to widespread foreign investment as economic  decision-makers gathered in Dubai for the World Bank and  International Monetary Fund annual meetings.<P>

"The reforms will significantly advance efforts to build a  free and open market economy in Iraq, promote Iraq's future  economic growth (and) accelerate Iraq's re-entry into the  international economy," he said in a statement.<P>

The measures include "100 percent foreign ownership in all  sectors except natural resources," excluding current outside  participation in Iraq's coveted oil reserves, the  second-largest behind those of Saudi Arabia.<P>

Foreign investors cannot own real estate but are allowed to  lease property for 40 years, the statement said. (Additional  reporting by Glenn Somerville and Mona Megalli in Dubai)<P>
