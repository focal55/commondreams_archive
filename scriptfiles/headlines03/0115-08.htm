<p>AN overwhelming majority of Labour’s senior officials are telling Tony Blair that he must not go to war against Iraq without UN approval. 
<P>With Mr Blair facing an anxious meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party today, a survey for <I>The Times</I> of Labour’s constituency chairmen shows that anti-war opinion has hardened and that only 10 per cent would give the Prime Minister unambiguous support.<I> The Times </I>has also learnt that Robin Cook, the Commons Leader, has been arguing in private that military action should happen only after the passage of a second UN resolution. 
<P>The mood of Labour MPs will be further upset later today when Geoff Hoon, the Defense Secretary, announces that Britain will allow the US to use British bases for a new “son of Star Wars” missile Defense system. He will say that backing in principle is being given to the American request for an updating of the Fylingdales early warning radar system in North Yorkshire. 
<P>Mr Blair will speak to Labour MPs this morning, having declared in a press conference on Monday that the UN could not have a veto on military action. 
<P>Large numbers of Labour MPs, including many ministers, are arguing that there should be a second UN resolution before any military action. 
<P>Clare Short, the International Development Secretary, said on Sunday that military action must have UN authority and Mr Cook, while fully supportive of Mr Blair’s line in public, is understood to have been arguing in Cabinet that a second resolution is needed. Mr Blair has made plain that he, too, would prefer a second resolution and believes that one would be passed. But he has also said that the UN must not impose an “unreasonable or unilateral” block on action. 
<P>Meanwhile, Germany’s differences with Britain were further exposed when Gerhard Schröder insisted on a second UN resolution. “I think that it is very possible that the European partners will agree on the need for a second resolution . . . I believe this to be sensible,” the Chancellor said. 
<P>The<I> Times</I> survey of constituency chairmen found that 77 per cent would be vehemently against Britain and the US taking action without UN support. They said that if Mr Blair defied party opinion he would prompt a wave of resignations. 
<P>Sixty-three officials in Labour’s 130 most vulnerable constituencies were asked if they would support the use of force without a UN mandate and 49 said no. But most accepted that, should there be a resolution sanctioning action, Britain would be right to take part. 
<P>Only six of the 63 said the Prime Minister would receive their backing if he decided to act independently of the UN in launching military action.
