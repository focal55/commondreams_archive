<p>Tomorrow, NBC will air its made-for-TV movie celebrating Army Pfc. Jessica 
Lynch, whose capture and dramatic rescue is the feel-good story of America's war 
in Iraq. <p>But some African Americans don't feel so good about Lynch's story. 
Instead, they ask: What about Shoshana Johnson? <p>Johnson, an Army specialist, 
belonged to the same 507th Maintenance Company as Lynch. Unlike Lynch, Johnson 
fought to stave off their Iraqi captors. Like Lynch, she sustained serious injuries. 
<p>But only Lynch got the headlines, the TV movie, the prime-time TV interviews, 
and a biography by a Pulitzer Prize-winning writer. Lynch, in short, got the full 
American celebrity treatment, while Johnson has largely been ignored. Many African 
Americans think that's simply because she didn't have the right "face." <p>African 
American suspicions of a racial double standard were reinforced last month when 
it was revealed that Johnson, a Panamanian American who was shot in both ankles, 
will get only 30 percent of her monthly pay in disability benefits. Lynch, who 
had a head injury and broken bones in her arm, leg, thighs and ankle, will get 
80 percent disability. <p>"Shoshana is getting the shaft, and people are outraged 
about it," said Mary Mason, a Philadelphia talk-radio host (WHAT, 1340 AM) whose 
show was bombarded with callers complaining about the disparity in treatment. 
"It's ridiculous, and complete racism." <p>Johnson and her family, in El Paso, 
Texas, say they have no proof that her treatment is rooted in racism, but they 
have engaged the Rev. Jesse Jackson to press the Army to increase her disability 
benefits. <p>Lynch, through a spokesman, stressed that she and Johnson were good 
friends and expressed hope that "Shoshana gets 100 percent" of what she deserved. 
<p>Others think race hovers around the edges of this story. They see Johnson's 
plight as another chapter in the long struggle of African Americans trying to 
get their due from white society. <p>"There before you is the American dilemma: 
We are unfair in treatment and view when it comes to people of color," said William 
Smith, a Vietnam veteran and media adviser for the National Association for Black 
Veterans. <p>Robert Thompson, a professor of television and popular culture at 
Syracuse University, said he doubted that race was the reason Lynch became a media 
celebrity. But, he added, with her good looks and compelling story, Lynch looked 
like a figure from Central Casting at a time when the Pentagon desperately needed 
one. <p>Just weeks into the battle, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and Gen. 
Tommy Franks were enduring heavy criticism over whether their battle plan provided 
enough ground forces to get the job done. The April 1 rescue of Lynch, videotaped 
by the U.S. forces who raided the hospital where she was being held, helped stem 
the criticism. <p>"I think everybody was looking for a symbol of the war with 
a happy ending," Thompson said. <p>And the early version of Lynch's story was 
good - too good. The Washington Post's initial front-page report said Lynch had 
suffered knife and bullet wounds while ferociously fighting off her attackers. 
Pentagon officials later said Lynch was hurt when her humvee crashed after being 
hit by a rocket-propelled grenade. Lynch, in an ABC interview to air Tuesday, 
says her weapon jammed and she never fired a shot. She also criticizes the military 
for hyping her story. <p>The new book I Am a Soldier, Too: The Jessica Lynch Story, 
written by Rick Bragg, maintains that Lynch also was raped and sodomized by her 
Iraqi captors. <p>Army officials said both women's disability benefits were based 
on the extent of their injuries and how those would affect their employment and 
lifestyles. <p>"There is no double standard in the Army," Army officials said 
in a written release about the controversy. "Every soldier is treated equally 
when they go before a Physical Evaluation Board, and in all situations race is 
not an issue." <p>Lynch and Johnson get different benefits because a military 
Physical Evaluation Board placed them in different categories, the Army said. 
<p>Lynch was put on a Temporary Disability List, meaning that she can stay in 
the Army for up to five years and that her condition can be reevaluated periodically. 
If it doesn't improve, she could get a medical discharge. <p>Although Johnson 
is awaiting a final decision on her disability status, her injuries were judged 
stable but permanent, and the board recommended that she be discharged from the 
Army. Johnson plans to appeal the board's recommendation next week, according 
to Rep. Diane Watson (D., Calif.). <p>Donna Brazile said she couldn't help seeing 
the disparities as a black-white issue. The African American political strategist, 
who managed Al Gore's presidential campaign in 2000, said she wasn't going to 
watch Lynch's TV movie. <p>"Jessica's story is a compelling story, but so is Shoshana's," 
Brazile said. "My reason for not tuning in is simple: I am tired of the double 
standard." <p ALIGN="CENTER">Copyright 1996-2003 Knight Ridder<p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable --></font></td></tr>
