<p>HOLMEN, Wisconsin - It&#039;s the sight of body bags labeled with the names of dead soldiers that bothers Major Mark Parker the most about his missions to Iraq.
<p>&#034;In an e-mail, he said that over here (in the U.S.), we think of numbers, but when you actually see the body bags, the reality of war sets in,&#034; Parker&#039;s mother, Jean, said from her home in Holmen.
<p>Parker, a 1979 graduate of Onalaska High School, is in the Air Force Reserve and was recently sent to Kuwait as part of the crew of a C-130 transport plane.
<p>&#034;Yesterday, I flew my first dead soldier out of Iraq,&#034; Parker wrote Dec. 20 in an e-mail to his mother. &#034;I don&#039;t know his exact age, but I&#039;m sure he was just a kid.&#034;
<p>The young private died three days earlier when an improvised roadside bomb exploded beneath the Humvee he was driving in a convoy in northern Iraq, Parker said.
<p>&#034;There was no ceremony when the Army delivered his body to our C-130,&#034; Parker wrote. &#034;He was in a body bag, strapped to a (stretcher), which was on the back of an open Humvee.&#034;
<p>The body was loaded into the plane and secured to the floor, and the 60 soldiers who boarded afterward &#034;had to endure the two-hour flight from northern Iraq to Kuwait with the remains of the private right there at their feet,&#034; he wrote.
<p>&#034;I still get teary-eyed once in a while when I think about this young man and his family,&#034; he wrote. &#034;It&#039;s visions like that which remind me that war is not glamorous, that war is not a video game.&#034;
<p>When the huge transport landed in Kuwait, all the soldiers and the plane&#039;s flight crew stood at attention and saluted as the private&#039;s body was removed, he said.
<p>In addition to transporting the dead, Parker&#039;s missions often include picking up troops going home and bringing in their replacements.
<p>&#034;There were smiles on the faces of the soldiers who were coming out and frowns on the ones going in,&#034; Parker wrote of one such assignment.
<p>&#034;I feel a lot of sympathy for these poor troops we&#039;re taking into Iraq,&#034; he wrote. They go on patrol and are being shot and killed every day, yet they never know who the enemy is.&#034;
<p>According to Jean Parker, her son, too, has been shot at.
<p>&#034;I&#039;m very concerned for him, but he says he is more worried about the troops on the ground,&#034; said Parker&#039;s mother. &#034;He said that at least he has some equipment for protection.&#034;
<p>Parker is not new to warfare. He flew cargo planes in the first Gulf War and Kosovo while in the Air Force.
<p>Parker&#039;s reserve unit is based in Milwaukee. Aviation is also Parker&#039;s avocation - he&#039;s a pilot for Delta Airlines.
<p>Jean Parker said she&#039;s not sure when her son will be coming home, but being able to exchange e-mails with him has been wonderful.
<p>&#034;We&#039;re a military family. I was a flight attendant during the Korean conflict and my husband was in Iceland at the time. The only way we had to communicate was by regular mail,&#034; she said. &#034;But having e-mail now is just so absolutely incredible.&#034;
<p>Mark Parker has only one wish as a new year gets underway, his mother said. It came at the end of one of his e-mails.
<p>&#034;I hope you join me in praying and hoping that this conflict will come to a speedy end and that all of us will be able to return home soon,&#034; he wrote.
<p>Parker added one more closing thought.
<p>&#034;Please put the private and his family in your thoughts and prayers.&#034; </p>
