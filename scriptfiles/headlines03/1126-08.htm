<p>The man the US initially put in charge of governing Iraq says mistakes were made after the coalition took charge. 
<p>Lieutenant General Jay Garner, who was replaced after less than a month, says the US could have communicated better with the Iraqi people.

  </table></font>In an interview with the BBC, he added that more US soldiers should have been sent to Iraq. 

<p>And he says more should have been done to restore electricity supplies. 


<p>General Garner, who was retired from the military when he took control in Iraq, said the US should have moved more quickly to establish a government in Iraq. 

<p>He said: "If we did it over again, we probably would have put more dismounted infantrymen in Baghdad and maybe more troops there." 


<p><b>Poor communication </b>
<p>The general also said he would have shipped in huge generators to supply electricity.


<p>He added: "On my part I would certainly (have) done a better job on having communications with the Iraqi people." 

<p>The consequences of that is that Iraqi's now listen to Al-Jazeera, the Arab TV channel that the US accuses of colluding with insurgents to film attacks on coalition forces, he told the BBC. 
<p>But General Garner said these poor communication links with the Iraqis had not strengthened opposition to the coalition. 


<p>He blamed that on hardcore supporters of Saddam Hussein's Baath party and international terrorists. 

<p>General Garner was replaced as the American's senior civil administrator in Iraq by Paul Bremer after initial reconstruction efforts did not go according to plan. 

<p>The change of personnel was also the result of rivalry in Washington between the Pentagon and the state department over who should be doing what in Iraq.
