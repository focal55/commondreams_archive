<p>The last of the Christian Peacemakers who had hoped to report to the world on the effects of war on the people of Baghdad has left the city in frustration. 



<p>"Conditions have changed, there was no way of communicating to the outside world because of the bombing of the telephone building and it was pretty well impossible to go where we wanted because of security measures," said Stewart Vriesinga, 46, of Lucknow, Ont., speaking from a hotel in Amman, Jordan.



<p>Thirteen members of Christian Peacemakers and the Chicago-based Iraq Peace Team left Iraq Monday. Another group had been expelled last week. About a dozen members of the Iraq Peace Team remain in Baghdad, including Canadian Robert Turcotte.



<p>"It was pretty impossible to go anywhere without government minders," Vriesinga said. "And if you did go without them some other government minder would find out and you'd get thrown out."



<p>The team was also running low on money, said Vriesinga, who was moved by his Quaker beliefs to join the Christian Peacemakers Team. He estimated they had to pay about $700 (U.S.) for each car to transport them to Amman. When they made the same trip to Baghdad a month ago, the cost was about $250, he said.



<p>He said he felt deflated that he could not continue to report his observations from Baghdad.



<p>"But it's clear to me they (Baghdadis) are going to do whatever they can to oppose the invasion. They do not see it as liberation.



<p>``However threatening they find the current regime, their loyalty is to their country and they will resist invasion and occupation."



<p>Another Canadian, David Havard, a former deacon at St. Margaret's Anglican Church in Vancouver, said he and others from his team plan to stay in Amman to set up supply and communication lines with those remaining in Baghdad.
