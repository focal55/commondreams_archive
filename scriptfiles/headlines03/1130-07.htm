<p>Patricia Johnson died with her floral-print suitcase still neatly 
packed and sitting in her apartment in Gambia, where it had sat for more than 
two years while she waited to come live with her daughter in the Bay Area.

</table>Johnson, who was 92, had escaped her native Sierra Leone during the 1997 
civil war and received permission to move to the United States before Sept. 11,
 2001. But after the attacks, she and tens of thousands like her learned their 
approval was on hold while various security agencies conducted new background 
checks to ferret out any potential terrorists.
<P>Weeks, then months, went by as Johnson  --  in a one-room apartment in 
Gambia  --  and her daughter Olive Briggs  --  in her two-room Pinole 
apartment  --  awaited further information. On July 3, Johnson died of 
advancing arthritis and a sudden illness.
<P>"The worst was that they never told us what was the concern, why was 
there the holdup,'' said Briggs, who became a naturalized U.S. citizen earlier 
this year. "Did they seriously think this woman could possibly be a terrorist 
threat? They just kept telling us to wait.''
<P>Briggs is not alone in her anguish. Hundreds of Bay Area families are 
still left to wonder and worry each day about relatives overseas who have been 
approved for resettlement but remain in a post-Sept. 11 bureaucratic limbo.
<P>Briggs still lingers by the phone and mailbox hoping for information 
about her 64-year-old sister, Alicia, and her 20-year-old adopted daughter, 
Josephine, both of whom live in Gambia and still have refugee applications 
pending. Her concern runs especially deep for Josephine, because she turns 21 
in January and might be forced to start the refugee visa application process 
from the beginning because she will no longer be considered a child.
<P>A second adopted daughter, Alice Bockarie-Briggs, was also waiting in 
Gambia for a visa but eventually married, which made her ineligible for 
admission to the United States as a refugee.

  </table></font>Don Climent, the director of the San Francisco chapter of the 
International Rescue Committee, one of the nation's largest refugee relocation 
agencies, said Briggs' was one of the more heartbreaking cases he has learned 
of, though all are painful in their own way. About 300 families in the Bay 
Area have been affected by the new security requirements of the refugee 
admissions program, he said, adding that African countries have been among 
those most severely impacted by the additional background checks and delays 
for final interviews.
<P>For the last two years, the United States has let in fewer than half the 
number of refugees it promised it would while government officials scrutinized 
the program.
<P>A decade ago, the United States typically allowed about 130,000 refugees 
into the country each year. Only 28,421 refugees were admitted during the 
fiscal year that ended last September.
<P>"Our tradition of being the leading place in the world to offer succor to 
those in need has served both refugees and us very well,'' Climent said. "But 
now our tradition itself is at risk of becoming another 9/11 victim.''
<P>Statistics cannot do justice to the suffering that is behind them, said 
Lavinia Limon, executive director of Immigration and Refugee Services of 
America and the U.S. Committee for Refugees, a nonprofit resettlement agency 
in Washington, D.C.
<P>"We know of people who have been murdered, who have died of diseases, who 
have been raped, deported or incarcerated. There are serious consequences when 
people are kept in this limbo, and this is happening all over the world,'' 
said Limon, who also served as the director of the Office of Refugee 
Resettlement during the Clinton administration. "These people are now in a 
security never-never land.''
<P>Despite more than two years of delays and detailed background checks, not 
a single refugee applicant has turned out to be a security threat, said a 
State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
<P>That does not surprise people like Limon.
<P>"Really, no terrorist worth his or her salt is going to sit for 10 years 
in a refugee camp and wait to win the lottery,'' she said. "So either it is a 
question of bureaucratic inertia ... or perhaps even more scary, is the fact 
that people are more comfortable saying nothing than saying yes, because 
everyone is so afraid they are going to be the one to sign the visa for 
someone who might turn out to be a terrorist.''
<P>As a result, America's doors remain effectively locked to the most 
desperate and in danger  --  the tired, poor, huddled masses that the Statue 
of Liberty once beckoned to her shores. Some find it oddly symbolic that the 
landmark itself, the world's most famous icon of immigration and freedom, has 
been closed since the terrorist attacks. 
<P>When the government decides it wants to let refugees into the country, it 
can do it in short order. 
<P>Refugee advocates point to the fact that in September, the State 
Department chartered two planes to bring hundreds of Liberians who had been 
living in the Ivory Coast to the United States, skirting official regulations 
that allow only 35 refugees to come on commercial flights because of the 
elaborate paperwork processing that must be done for each.
<P>"They managed to process these people in record time, so it displays what 
they are capable of if they decide to do it,'' Limon said, adding that the 
government was motivated to do so because it didn't want the admission numbers 
to be lower than the previous year.
<P>A State Department official confirmed that the chartered flights did 
bring in "more than we normally do,'' and said it demonstrated the 
government's commitment to providing refuge.
<P>"It wasn't uncommon before 9/11 for us to bring in charters with that 
number of people on board, and that's what we're striving for again, to get 
the program back to what it was pre-Sept. 11,'' the official said.
<P>At the heart of the problem lies an inherent contradiction between two 
powerful arms of the administration  --  the State Department, which is 
responsible for bringing refugees into the country, and the Department of 
Homeland Security, which seeks to safeguard the country by keeping out as many 
unknown elements as possible.
<P>Asked to comment about the potential policy conflicts, a State Department 
official would say only that, "We're partners with the Department of Homeland 
Security and we want to bring as many refugees as the ceiling allows but at 
the same time ensure the safety of the American public and the safety of the 
workers helping adjudicate the cases to bring the refugees in.''
<P>A few months ago, the State Department asked David Martin, a former 
general counsel for the Immigration and Naturalization Service, to study the 
refugee admissions process and recommend ways to streamline the process. 
Through interviews and field visits, he said, he is "guardedly optimistic" 
that increased staffing and improved processing procedures over the last year 
will result in more refugee admissions.
<P>Meanwhile, people like Agnes Grimes, a 51-year-old Liberian refugee who 
is living in an Ivory Coast refugee camp, continue to await final security 
clearance. Her brother, Rufus Berry, lives in Oakland and sends $400 each 
month to support her family, including her husband, Orlando, a retired 
government auditor, and their four children. Grimes, 51, has stomach cancer 
and has been given little care and expired medications.
<P>"Words are inadequate to describe what it is like, I feel so betrayed and 
let down and feel completely helpless,'' said Berry, who came to the United 
States as a student in 1987 and is now an accountant. "My sister is at the 
stage where she is losing hope.''
<P>As vice president of the Bay Area-based Coalition for African Refugees 
and Immigrants, Berry said he personally knows at least 200 families who live 
with the daily stresses and strains of worrying about loved ones who are 
waiting to be relocated, and has met thousands more through his travels across 
the country. 
<P>They fear news similar to that which Berry received in 1999, when he 
learned that his brother, who he described as a "low-level civil servant,'' 
saw his four children shot to death by rebels before being kidnapped in 
Liberia. He has not heard from his brother since, and is certain he was also 
killed.
<P>A former choirboy who once contemplated becoming a priest, the 38-year-
old Berry said he relies on his faith to keep his hopes up that his sister 
will soon be cleared to come to the United States and build a new life with 
her family here. Until then, he keeps raising funds and gathering donations to 
send to Liberian hospitals because helping others helps him feel better.
<P>Because the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security will 
not give status information to relatives directly, Berry and others  rely on 
organizations like the International Rescue Committee to submit queries on 
their behalf  --  which often go unanswered.
<P>"The lack of communication is the hardest thing for people to deal with, 
because there are often no hard and fast answers,'' said Climent. "'It's 
heartbreaking. I have one woman who calls me at least four times a week asking 
about her daughter in Liberia, and there's often nothing I can tell her.''
<P>Olive Briggs, whose mother died while waiting in Gambia, is haunted by 
the belief that her mother would not have died if she could have received 
medical care in the United States.
<P>"She did not have Alzheimer's or any serious illness,'' said Briggs, 62. </p>
