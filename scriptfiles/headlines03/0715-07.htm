<p>JERUSALEM - Forget the twists and turns of Palestinian and Israeli peacemaking. The newsmaker captivating Israelis this summer is a 5-foot-tall single mother of three who got so angry over government welfare cuts that she walked across the desert in a 125-mile trek to Jerusalem and pitched a protest tent outside parliament.

</table></font>Vicki Knafo, 43, was so outraged at a government notice that nearly halved her family's monthly subsidy that she staged a six-day march to the capital to express anger and frustration over financial cuts aimed at fighting off recession.
<p>Charismatic, energetic, quick with a hug and a quip, she has drawn dozens of women towing toddlers and teenagers - and everything in between - to her encampment outside parliament, the Knesset. She arrived a week ago, and by Monday Israel Radio was topping hourly news bulletins with updates of other angry mothers hiking to the Holy City, from Nazareth in the north to Ofakim in the south.
<p>"I did something crazy. I was home one day, then came on foot; now all the single parents are supporting me," Knafo said amid a crowd of fellow protesters who were slurping watermelon Monday afternoon.
<p>The showdown exemplifies Israel's 21st-century struggle to shed old socialist subsidies in an effort to develop a stronger market economy. Earlier this year, the government sold shares in the national airline, El-Al, and announced plans to cut everything from monthly child allowances to guaranteed income grants that have allowed the poorest of the poor to get by.
<p>The Bush administration demanded economic reform as part of a $9 billion loan-guarantee package that was approved earlier this year to help invigorate Israel's withering economy. The reforms also continue a social restructuring that Finance Minister Benjamin Netanyahu started during his 1996-99 premiership.
<p>Netanyahu, 53, a former furniture salesman who was catapulted to celebrity as Israel's ambassador in the United Nations, has long argued for economic restructuring. He even once advocated ending Israeli dependency on financial aid from the United States.
<p>Now he is slashing child allowances - which are paid to every Israeli, rich and poor - and welfare as part of a program to shrink the government by reducing taxes and government spending at the same time.
<p>"We will not move back to the culture of welfare," the daily newspaper Haaretz quoted him Monday as telling a conference on pension reform. "We will move forward and allow single mothers to work, while taking care of their children, because this is the only way to break the cycle of unemployment."
<p>With bloodshed dramatically diminished because of a 2-week-old Palestinian cease-fire, Knafo has emerged as a media darling in the summer doldrums, especially since her complaints touch a nerve in an economy that has suffered a double punch from the global recession along with declining tourism and investment during 33 months of Arab-Israeli violence.
<p>	Knafo also galvanizes public sympathy in a country where everyone seems to have felt the economic woes.
<p>Security guards at the Knesset have allowed her and two of her kids, aged 17 and 7, to shower nightly in their nearby guardhouse, to keep tidy in the tent where they sleep on thin mattresses. More comfortable Jerusalemites come around with home-cooked meals and bottled water.
<p>This native Israeli, whose parents emigrated from Venezuela, is the perfect poster child for the cause.
<p>To critics who jeer, "Get a job," she replies that she already has one, working four hours a day as a kindergarten chef for 1,200 shekels a month, about $300. To people who preach family values, she can reply that her ex-husband contributes 600 shekels a month ($150) in child support. The couple split seven years ago.
<p>Knafo said she could make ends meet only with her monthly government subsidy package of 2,500 shekels ($625), which was slashed in June to 1,300 shekels ($325).
<p>Besides, she said, "there's no work" in Mitzpe Ramon, the dusty Negev Desert town where she shut the door on her 150-shekel-a-month ($37.50) apartment and launched her hike to Jerusalem, at times wrapping herself, Superman cape-style, in a blue-and-white Israeli flag.
<p>She has vowed to camp out at the Knesset, across the street from Netanyahu's Finance Ministry, "until there's a revolution, or they force us out. I'm not sending a hungry child to the army. No one can serve this country hungry."
<p>The lines roll off her tongue so easily she seems a natural politician, although she said she'd been too busy raising her children to become active in causes. In fact, she said she hadn't voted since she helped elect Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in 1992, and was devastated by his assassination by an Orthodox Jew.
<p>But with her cause she has united the poor from this nation's often-fractious communities - Arabs and Jews, immigrants and native-born, Sabbath observers and secular Israelis - as exemplified by an Israeli Arab woman named Nadia who showed up Monday to sit on a sidewalk in solidarity.
<p>"They're cutting everything; there's nothing left," lamented Nadia, 36, who didn't want to give her full name. The divorced mother of five children, aged 7 to 16 and a half, said the cuts had made it impossible to manage in her port city, Jaffa.
<p>"How do we pay the rent? House our children? Buy food?" she said shyly, peering out from beneath a scarf and hiding her face when television cameras came around.
