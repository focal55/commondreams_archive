<p>With a defiant tone, embattled Gov. Gray Davis appealed to voters Wednesday to keep him on the job, saying he would "take responsibility" for California's problems but calling the unprecedented recall election a "right- wing power grab" by Republicans. 



<p>Davis, battling poll numbers that show voters are ready to turn him from office, laid out the case he'll make until the Oct. 7 election in what could be the pivotal speech of the incumbent Democrat's 30-year political career. 



<p>"I know California is going through a difficult time, and this is a challenging moment for all of us," Davis said during a 19-minute address televised live statewide from UCLA's Ackerman Student Union. "I come here tonight to take responsibility, to set the record straight and to talk about our future." 



<p>With 48 days to go until the first recall election against a California governor, Davis' combative address confronted widespread criticism he has received for the way he handled issues such as the energy crisis and budget deficit. But he also sought to cast the recall in a purely partisan light, aiming to fire up passions among his Democratic base of voters. 



<p>The governor repeatedly blamed Republicans in the Legislature and in Washington, D.C., for California's problems. And he said they were behind a recall effort that would damage "the fabric of our democracy." 



<p>"The Republicans behind this recall say they want you to oust me for past mistakes," he said. "My fri ends, they don't give a rip about past mistakes. This is all about control in the future, seizing back the governor's chair and . . . with so many candidates running, they can do it with just a handful of California voters." 



<p>Republicans immediately dismissed the speech as political theatrics. 



<p>"The speech was insulting," said California state GOP Chairman Duf Sundheim, 



who watched in the UCLA auditorium and later was surrounded by angry union members as he voiced his criticism. 



<p>"To say a group was trying to steal an election is an insult to the voters who signed the recall petitions," Sundheim said. 



<p>Rescue California spokesman Jonathan Wilcox, who represents the pro-recall movement, said of the governor's effort: "I finished off the Tums and I'm moving on to the Maalox . . . . That was a 30-minute attack ad. Gray Davis is going to go out exactly as he came in: blaming, attacking and frankly not telling the truth." 



<p>Voters on Oct. 7 will face two choices: a "yes" or "no" on whether to recall Davis and, should he be removed from office, which of the 135 candidates should replace him. 



<p>Bruce Cain, director of the Institute of Governmental Studies at UC Berkeley, noted that Davis' speech contained elements of the defense used by former Democratic President Bill Clinton when he was impeached. 



<p>"The Clinton strategy is clear," Cain said. "They're trying to get the forces marshalled to make it Democrats versus Republicans." 



<p>Clinton and Davis have talked often in the past few weeks about the recall and the way to fight it. 



<p>The speech was better than remaining silent, but it doesn't seem likely to alter the political landscape, said Jack Pitney, a government professor at Claremont McKenna University College. 



<p>"If the election were held tomorrow, he would still lose," Pitney said. 



<p>Pitney said Davis' attack of the recall election as a right-wing power grab was less effective now, given the background of the two leading candidates to replace him -- Democratic Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante and Republican actor Arnold Schwarzenegger. 



<p>"Neither one is a right-winger," he said. 



<p>The moment of high drama began last night as the governor and his wife, Sharon, entered the auditorium to booming cheers. Davis placed his hand over his heart and bowed before the made-to-order audience of several hundred enthusiastic union members and supporters. 





<p>PETE WILSON POSTERS

<p>Labor leaders walked through the crowd distributing posters of former Gov. Pete Wilson dressed as "The Terminator," with a heading that said: "I'm back: Hasta la vista, unions!" 



<p>In that partisan atmosphere, Davis played to the crowd, noting what he said were GOP failures and roles in state problems. 



<p>"I inherited the energy deregulation scheme, which put all of us at the mercy of the big energy producers," he said. "We got no help from the federal government." 



<p>And he argued that California wasn't alone in its energy meltdown. "Last Friday, 50 million Americans lost power for 29 hours. In California, not a single light has gone out in the last two years," he said. 



<p>Davis noted that the American economy "has tanked" and said 46 other states have felt the pain of job losses. 



<p>"Yes, I could have been tougher in holding down big spending," he said. "But let's be clear. Our increases on my watch went to education and health care, and I make no apology for that." 



<p>Davis' advisers said the governor will press his case in meetings with voters across the state beginning today in Los Angeles. 



<p>"I may not be the warmest TV personality in politics . . . but I am warming to this fight," Davis vowed. "And I will go all over this state, talk to all comers, answer all their questions -- and I might have one or two of my own to ask them." 



<p>Some said Davis' approach may be too little, too late. 



<p>"This is something he should have done a long time ago," said political analyst Sherry Bebitch Jeffe. "He may try to take the blame. He may acknowledge the energy crisis . . . but doing it now doesn't cut it." 



<p>Assemblyman Kevin McCarthy, R-Bakersfield, said Davis' speech, particularly attacking the 1.6 million people who signed the recall petitions, showed the governor "has not gotten the message." 



<p>"I think one thing people think he never did was lead. He had five years to change, what makes people think he is going to change now," McCarthy said. 



<p>But union leaders -- who have been his most critical allies through two elections as governor -- lauded Davis' decision to come forward. 



<p>"This is absolutely necessary," said Raymond Cordonva, chair of the South County Labor AFL-CIO. "His message hasn't resonated, but he has to get it out. People have to realize that they're hitting him on energy, but at least our lights didn't go out like in New York." 





<p>DEMOCRATS SUPPORTIVE

<p>Democratic legislators were equally supportive. 



<p>"I thought he was strong, clear, determined and even a bit humorous," said Assemblyman Mark Leno, D-San Francisco. "Rather than any kind of mea culpa, he explained what he has done. . . . Californians need to be reminded that it was Pete Wilson, not he, who signed deregulation, and we got screwed." 



<p>The speech provided plenty of free air time to Davis, but in the Bay Area, KTVU stayed with "The People's Court" and KGO showed the first two minutes before returning to its regular news show. 



<p>"We are covering it as a news item," said Kevin Keeshan, KGO's news director. "But as part of the fairness issue for the other candidates, we're not covering it in its entirety." 



<p>KRON, KPIX and KNTV showed all 19 minutes of the speech. 



<p>"We're taking this because it's news, it's hot, it's the main story," said Dan Rosenheim, news director for KPIX. ". . . It's a major story, and people want to hear it."
