<p>STOCKHOLM - Since the start of the nuclear era,
highly radioactive waste has been crossing continents and
oceans in search of a secure and final resting place.
<p>
 Nearly all countries produce nuclear waste, some types of
which can remain radioactive for thousands of years, but they
cannot agree on the best way to store it.
<p>
 At present highly radioactive waste is put into interim
storage where it has to sit for 30-40 years for its
radioactivity and heat production to decline. It is still
hazardous and should be stored somewhere permanently.

<!--/endimage/-->In many countries it is unclear who will pay for the cost
divided over hundreds, even hundreds of thousands of years.
Utilities could end up with a bigger bill than expected.
<p>
 Most high-level waste, the most dangerous kind, is spent
fuel from the over 400 nuclear power reactors in more than 30
countries. The dismantling of nuclear weapons adds to the pile.
<p>
 Even nuclear-free states produce waste from industry,
hospitals providing radiation therapy, and research centers.
<p>
 Experts say technology exists for secure underground
deposits which could last millions of years. Most countries
plan to seal the highly hazardous waste in containers and store
it 1,640-3,280 feet underground.
<p>
 Skeptics say it could be safe for decades or even
centuries, but at some point it would be bound to leak or be
attacked by terrorists.
<p>
 "If there isn't a responsible solution to deal with nuclear
waste, it may be better to keep it above ground for a while
longer when we are looking for technology that is safer," said
Martina Krueger, who works for the environmental organization
Greenpeace in Sweden.
<p>
 TO OPEN OR NOT?
<p>
 Some politicians have demanded that the repositories are
built so that future generations can open them and eliminate
the waste with the help of new technology.
<p>
 Others say that would also leave the deposits vulnerable to
potential social chaos thousands of years down the line.
<p>
 If waste is safe in interim storage, why not keep it there?
<p>
 "Sure it's safe...but what we have to communicate are the
trade-offs," said Thomas Sanders from Sandia National
Laboratories, owned by the U.S. government.
<p>
 Some nuclear plants are already running into the limits of
their storage capacity. And since the September 11, 2001
attacks on the United States attention has turned to individual
plants and whether these can be protected from terrorist
attacks.
<p>
European Union countries plan to build repositories by
around 2020, but some have not even started considering sites.
In 2001 Finland became the first and so far only EU state to
decide on a site for a final storage.
<p>
 The United States plans to deposit waste from its 103
nuclear plants beneath the Yucca Mountain in Nevada. The site
should open in 2010, but faces local protests and legal
hurdles.
<p>
 Critics say big central repositories would again increase
the risk of accidents or theft because the nuclear waste has to
be transported to them from each plant.
<p>
WHO PAYS?
<p>
In many cases it is unclear for how long nuclear waste is
the liability of the firm causing it, and when the state takes
over.
<p>
This makes it tough for utilities to calculate the cost,
especially if the repositories are built in such a way that
they have to be guarded for security reasons.
<p>
"It is difficult to give precise costs because France
hasn't decided on a strategy on long-term waste management,"
said Yves le Bars, chairman of ANDRA, the national radioactive
waste management agency in France, the EU's biggest nuclear
power.
<p>
"We say it will take between 15 to 25 billion euros to
build a repository, operate it and close it for the existing
facilities," he said. This would cover high-level waste from
France's 58 nuclear plants, assuming fuel would be reprocessed.
<p>
Finding a location for a dump is one of the biggest
hurdles.
<p>
In South Korea, the state tried for years to find a county
willing to host a repository for low and intermediate level
waste. Finally this year, Buan county applied for the deposit
and suggested Wi-do island as a host.
<p>
The island has 1,000 inhabitants, most of them fishermen.
<p>
"They decided to accept the repository because the
government is paying a tremendous financial package," said
Myung Jae Song, general manager at the Korea Hydro and Nuclear
Power Company, the world's fifth largest producer of nuclear
power.
<p>
Mohamed ElBaradei, head of the International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA), suggested in early December that countries
should consider shared storage, even though no state should be
forced to deal with another's atomic waste.
<p>
At Eurajoki, site of Finland's final repository, people
were upset by the idea that their town could one day start
importing foreign waste, said local politician Altti Lucander.
<p>
"It causes confusion and may lead to there being no
acceptance for national deposits," Lucander said.
