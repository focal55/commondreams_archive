<p>PORTLAND, Maine (AP)  &nbsp; -- Former Maine congressman Tom Andrews has

been rubbing elbows with celebrity musicians and appearing on

political affairs TV programs. He has orchestrated a massive

call-in campaign that tied up phone lines in U.S. Senate offices

for most of a day.

<p>   It's all part of the job for Andrews, who has assumed a

prominent role in the national anti-war movement. As director of

  <a href="http://www.winwithoutwarus.org" target="_new">  Win Without War</a>, a coalition of nearly three dozen diverse

organizations, Andrews thinks up and organizes ways to get the

anti-war message out to America.

<p>   Last month, Andrews helped put together Musicians United to Win

Without War, an alliance of more than 40 musical artists. After a

news conference to announce the alliance, he talked strategy with

rock musicians David Byrne and Lou Reed, country music star

Roseanne Cash and hip-hop mogul Russell Simmons.

<p>   Andrews also proposed having actor Martin Sheen, the president

on NBC's ''The West Wing,'' appear in an anti-war TV ad, then wrote

the script and helped produce it. He has faced off with hawkish

conservatives on NBC's ''Meet the Press'' and CNN's ''Crossfire.''

<p>   And he directed a national ''virtual march'' on the nation's

capital that resulted in more than 1 million phone calls to the

White House and U.S. Senate offices to protest an invasion and

occupation of Iraq.

<p>   Andrews, an unabashed liberal, said the Bush administration has

made itself clear on Iraq, and that it's time for an opposing view

to take the bully pulpit.

<p>   ''We're talking about an invasion and full-scale occupation of

the most volatile part of the world where anti-American sentiment

is already at a fevered pitch,'' Andrews said.

<p>   Andrews, 49, is no stranger to controversy   or to issues of

war.

<p>   Maine's 1st District congressman from 1991-95, Andrews set off a

ruckus when he supported closing Loring Air Force Base in northern

Maine during a round of military base closures in the early 1990s.

While a freshman in Congress, he gave a fiery speech on the House

floor against the 1991 war with Iraq.

<p>   He's also no stranger to liberal causes. For most of his life,

he has crusaded on human rights, global economic policy, nuclear

power, poverty, free speech, sweatshop labor and disability rights.

Andrews, who lost a leg to cancer as a teenager and now uses a

prosthetic device, was in Augusta last month to support a

legislative bill to bolster insurance coverage for artificial

limbs.

<p>   When he's not in Washington or on the road, he spends time in

Maine; he and his wife have a home in South Portland.

<p>   David Cortright, a Win Without War committee member and director

of Fourth Freedom Forum anti-war organization in Indiana, said

Andrews was the first choice when it was decided Win Without War

needed a full-time director. The coalition, formed in December,

counts Greenpeace, the NAACP, the National Organization for Women,

the National Council of Churches and the Sierra Club among its

members.

<p>   Cortright said Andrews was chosen because of his legislative

experience, his media savvy and his organizing skills.

<p>   ''He seems to have earned his way building coalitions, listening

to people, and articulating messages that are creative without

being extreme, without sounding radical and putting people off,''

Cortright said.

<p>   Craig Brown, who was Andrews' congressional chief of staff for

four years, said Andrews' position in the anti-war movement is

consistent with the kind of work he's done his whole life. Brown

heads the Portland-based <a href="http://www.commondreams.org">commondreams.org</a>, a nonprofit Web site

with news and opinion for ''the progressive community.''

<p>   ''He's unique in that he understands Washington mechanics, but

his roots are grassroots organizing,'' he said. ''He understands

coalitions and strategizing as an organizer. There aren't many

current or former members of Congress that have those skills.''

<p>   For now, Andrews finds himself ''in the lion's den of debate''

on Iraq.

<p>   On CNN's ''Crossfire,'' he went up against former U.S. Rep. Bob

Dornan, a conservative from California once known as ''B-1 Bob.''

On ''Meet the Press,'' he was paired against Sen. Lindsey Graham,

R-S.C.

<p>   Andrews is sure more public appearances are to come. ''Any time

and every time we have the opportunity to present our point of

view, we will take it.''
