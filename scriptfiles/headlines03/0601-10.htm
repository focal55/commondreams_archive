<p>WASHINGTON   - Once the Federal Communications Commission votes on Monday to ease restrictions on media ownership, the ultimate arbiter will be the courts and possibly Congress, industry experts agree.

<p>The five FCC commissioners are expected to vote 3-2 to relax decades-old rules, allowing television networks to own more television stations, permit a broadcaster to own two stations in more markets, and allow one company to own a newspaper and a television or radio station in most markets.

<p>Media conglomerates wanted the FCC to go further to ease the rules, if not eliminate them outright.

<p>Meanwhile consumer groups and smaller broadcasters have sought strict regulations -- fearing further industry consolidation would reduce local news as well as diversity in viewpoints.

<p>With the outcome unlikely to please either side, legal challenges at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia are almost guaranteed.

<p>"I think the likelihood is high there will be a court challenge," said Kenneth Ferree, who heads the FCC's Media Bureau and helped develop the new rules. "But we have facts and a really good record with lots of evidence for these rules."

<p>In fact, a big reason the FCC is revising media ownership restrictions is the appeals court's scathing criticism of the agency in the past couple of years for failing to justify the need for the rules or where the limits were set.

<p>RAISING THE CAP

<p>News Corp., which runs Fox Television, and Viacom Inc., which owns CBS and UPN, called for eliminating the rule that prevents a network from owning television stations that collectively reach 35 percent of the national audience, but the FCC is poised only to raise the limit to 45 percent.

<p>"The big guys don't seem to be getting everything they want, but they may be smart enough to accept their gifts with appreciation and keep their discontent under wraps," said Deborah Lathen, a former FCC official turned consultant.

<p>The FCC allowed News Corp. and Viacom to creep above the 35 percent limit while the agency revised its rules. Spokesmen at the two companies would not say whether they would challenge the FCC's expected decision.

<p>Lathen predicted the appeals court would probably uphold the new rules, and the case could go to the Supreme Court.

<p>A lawyer for an alliance of local broadcasters said the FCC failed to collect evidence to justify raising the cap to 45 percent, but the group has not yet committed to a court fight.

<p>"We think the commission is vulnerable on the number it picked because it's not justified in the record," the lawyer said, declining identification. He argued that Congress had dictated 35 percent unless the FCC found evidence to ease it.

<p>The agency is also expected to let companies own two television stations in more markets after the appeals court questioned the FCC's method of counting voices in a market, a rule challenged by Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc. .

<p>The FCC previously only allowed a company to own two stations in a market if eight different station owners remained. The FCC is expected to cut that to five.

<p>"Going from one arbitrary number to another arbitrary number isn't going to serve them well in either the courts or Congress," said Chris Murray, a lawyer for Consumers Union, which will probably go to court to keep strict limits.

<p>A bipartisan group in the U.S. Senate has crafted a bill to keep the national audience limit at 35 percent but it's unclear if the measure has support from the Republican leadership.

<p>In the House of Representatives, Rep. Billy Tauzin, chairman of the committee with jurisdiction over the FCC, has opposed a similar measure, making passage more difficult.

<p>Mark Cooper, research director of the Consumer Federation of America, said the FCC will count voices differently for each rule that could make them vulnerable for court challenge.

<p>"I don't think they have the law," he said. "I don't think they have the facts. What do they have? They've got three votes."
