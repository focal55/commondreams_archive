<p>Thousands of Scottish demonstrators tonight rounded off a day of protest against US President George W Bush’s state visit to Britain.<p>
Several thousand people took to the streets of Edinburgh and Glasgow, in peaceful but angry protests.<p>
In the capital, between 2,000 and 3,000 anti-Bush campaigners tonight turned the city center into a sea of flags, banners and placards as protesters converged in the streets for the culmination of the day’s demonstrations.
<p>
The crowds gathered in Charlotte Square outside Bute House, the official residence of First Minister Jack McConnell, before heading towards the US Consulate.<p>

  </table></font>Protesters periodically sat down on the roads, bringing rush hour traffic in the capital to a standstill.<p>
In Glasgow in the evening, police said 2,000 people took part in a candlelit vigil in the center which ended in St Enoch Square.
<p>
Earlier in the day, schoolchildren were among the demonstrators who joined university students, trade unionists and ordinary members of the public in protests.<p>
In the capital, more than 600 people brought Edinburgh to a standstill as the rally marched past the Scottish Parliament, towards Calton Hill, chanting: “Bush Go Home.”<p>
Police officers on horseback and students wearing painted T-shirts spelling out the words “Troops Home” led the march from Bristo Square down towards Princes Street.<p>
Police closed off the main routes through the city to allow protesters to pass through.<p>
Meanwhile in Glasgow, 300 people converged at lunchtime to a rally in the city center
<p>
Protesters, made up mostly of students and pensioners, attempted to stop the traffic in George Square but were outflanked and ushered away by mounted police.<p>
A 10ft high effigy of George W Bush, which had been propped up against an electricity pillar box, was thrown down and dumped in the middle of the square, to more anti-war chants.<p>
Schoolgirl Leila Armstrong, 11, from Shawlands Academy, told reporters why she was protesting. “We’re sticking up for our country.<p>
“Just go home and leave the innocent people alone. I want him to get out of Iraq and stop killing innocent people.”<p>
Her mother, Beth Armstrong, said: “Leila asked me if she could walk out and I said if there other pupils walking out then she could join them.<p>
“I think it is great that young people are protesting because they have a right to express their views.”<p>
But she added: “I know the friends Leila is with and they care about the environment and are against the war – they do not want to grow up in a world of war.”<p>
In Edinburgh Rosie Kane, Scottish Socialist Party list MSP for Glasgow, sent a message to Mr Bush: “We will have a democracy when people say no to war.”<p>
She said: “This war is not in our name, get out of our country, you are not wanted.”<p>
And SNP MSP Fiona Hyslop told a crowd in Bristo Square they were marching for “peace and justice”.<p>
She said: “We marched before the war for peace and justice and we march now for peace and justice. Scottish voices will be heard.<p>
“If we are going to have a world of peace and justice it has got to be one that is fair.<p>
“When you march for the people of Iraq, for them to have control of their own country, you also march for those people across the world who also need peace and justice.”<p>
Civil rights lawyer Aamer Anwar, speaking at march in Glasgow, said: “I think it is a disgrace that George Bush has come to this country to get state processions and pats on the backs and cooked dinners courtesy of the Prime Minister and the Queen when people are still dying in Iraq.<p>
“It really doesn’t matter if they are American, Iraqi or British it is time to bring the troops home and get the hell out of Iraq and the Middle East.”<p>
Scots demonstrators were traveling down to London to take part in mass protests taking place tomorrow.
