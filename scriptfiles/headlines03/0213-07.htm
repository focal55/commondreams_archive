<p>BAGHDAD, Feb 13  - A group of Western peace

activists said on Thursday they had written to former South

African President Nelson Mandela asking him to come to Iraq to

help them prevent war, but he said he needed a U.N. mandate.

<P> Mandela, a Nobel Peace Laureate, has accused U.S. President

George W. Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair of running

roughshod over the United Nations in their bid to oust Iraqi

President Saddam Hussein.<P> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><table border=0 align=right hspace=5 cellpadding=6 width="350">

</table></font>&quot;He has not responded yet, but we believe that Mr Mandela

would come,&quot; said Roberta Taman, spokeswomen for 15 activists

from Canada, Italy and other European countries who recently

arrived in Iraq.<P> Mandela's spokeswoman Zelda LaGrange said Mandela would need

a clear mandate from United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan

before embarking on any trip to Baghdad.<P> &quot;He has received a number of requests to go to Iraq, but he

is adamant that he will not go unless he is requested by the

United Nations,&quot; LaGrange told Reuters in Johannesburg.<P> Mandela, a recipient of Bush's Presidential Medal of Freedom

last year, launched a blistering personal attack against the

U.S. president last month, questioning whether he would treat

the United Nations the same way if it wasn't headed by a black

man.<P> &quot;If the U.N. kindly requests him to go, then he will go,&quot;

LaGrange said.<P> In Baghdad, members of the group of activists -- one of

several around the world involved in a variety of solidarity

visits to Iraq -- said they would sit outside Iraqi power plants

and hospitals. It was unclear if they would remain there under

bombing.<P> &quot;We have a responsibility to say no to this war. There is no

justification,&quot; Taman told a news conference.<P> Millions of people in cities across the globe are expected

to demonstrate on Saturday against any U.S.-led invasion of Iraq

and organisers say it could be the world's biggest anti-war

protest.<P> Hundreds of thousands of protesters are expected in London

and Rome, with smaller events planned from Antarctica to

Reykjavik. In South Africa, where President Thabo Mbeki shares

Mandela's anti-war position, demonstrations are planned in

Johannesburg, Cape Town and other major cities.<P> A group of about 50 peace activists said in Turkey this week

they had got visas to enter Iraq where they plan to disperse to

populated areas of Baghdad and other parts of the country,

acting as &quot;human shields&quot;.<P> They hope their presence and the possibility of Western

casualties will encourage U.S. political leaders and military

planners to rethink any plans to bomb Iraq over its alleged

chemical, biological and nuclear weapons.<P> The Iraq Peace Team, another Western group, has been in the

country since September 2002 and pledges to stay with Iraqi

families if war erupts.<P> Neither Washington nor London, preparing for a possible war

over Saddam's alleged weapons of mass destruction, have said if

the presence of Western human shields would affect their plans.<P> In the Muslim world, the main rallying point for would-be

human shields is in Jordan. There, a campaign led by leftist

parties and civic bodies is seeking 100,000 volunteers.
