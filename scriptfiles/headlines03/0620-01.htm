<p> MPs from across the political spectrum today reacted with shock and concern to revelations that trigger-happy US troops in Iraq regularly kill civilians. 
<p>
Yesterday the Evening Standard published <a href="0619-11.htm">confessions from American soldiers</a> that they have fired indiscriminately at non-combatants and left wounded fighters to die or even shot them. 
<p>
The GIs said they were often unable to tell civilians from enemy troops. 
<p>
However, former government whip Graham Allen, who led Labour backbenchers in opposition to the war against Saddam, said the Americans' conduct was creating a "cycle of hatred and revenge". 
<p>
Mr Allen said President Bush had "failed in his responsibility to prepare properly for the occupation of Iraq when Saddam Hussein had gone", adding: "Mr Bush never told his army or his people what to expect. 
<p>
"The result is the terrible and growing toll of casualties of US soldiers and Iraqi civilians, and a cycle of mistrust, hatred and revenge reminiscent of Vietnam. This situation is intolerably dangerous, not only for the Americans and the Iraqis but for British forces, administrators and aid workers." 
<p>
Mr Allen said there was now only one answer - the full-scale takeover of Iraq's administration by the United Nations. 
<p>
Another leading Labour anti-war rebel, former defense minister Peter Kilfoyle, said: "I think the Standard's report shows, sadly, that the predictions many of us made - that the invasion of Iraq would increase chaos - have been coming true. 
<p>
"While the British have their own difficulties, their experience in peacekeeping makes them far more disciplined than their American counterparts. It is indicative of how badly planned and ill thought-out the whole Iraqi escapade was." 
<p>
Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman Menzies Campbell said: "This approach is hardly likely to win over hearts and minds in Iraq. If anything, it is likely to provoke further unrest. There must be serious doubts about the legality of these actions, which on the face of it, constitute serious breaches of the Geneva Convention." 
<p>
And Colonel Bob Stewart, commander of the UK peacekeeping force in Bosnia, warned the US could reap a whirlwind of its own making - an extremist Islamic state in Iraq - unless it reined in its soldiers. 
<p>
Col Stewart added: "What the Americans are doing will lead to more and more revenge attacks by Iraqis. The worst scenario is that an Islamic republic will be created as a result of the actions of American soldiers." 
<p>
A Foreign Office spokesman said: "These are American soldiers commenting on American operations. I am sure that the American government will be looking into this report and making its own investigations." 
<p>
A Ministry of Defense spokesman added: "Obviously we would expect all the forces there to abide by the Geneva Convention. We have our own rules of engagement and the Americans have theirs." 
<p>
The performance of the US military is to be examined by human rights groups and will be the subject of an investigation by the International Committee of the Red Cross.
