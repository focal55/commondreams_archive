<p>EASTON, PA -- A 12-foot statue of President Bush with his pants on fire attracted a crowd of about 80 people to Centre Square Saturday night. 

<p>A Ford Crown Victoria decorated with four American flags pulled the statue on a trailer as it made several laps around the circle. 
<p>Local volunteers for TrueMajorityACTION drove the car as part of the organization's nationwide <a href="http://pantsonfire.net/index.htm" target="_new">PantsOnFire project</a>.

  </table></font>When they parked the car on the southwest corner of Centre Square, onlookers engaged in spirited political debate while others listened in. 
<p>"This is great. It's always good to have debate," said Fiona Parker-Givens of Easton, one of the organizers. "The point is to get the message out that Bush is a liar." 
<p>Parker-Givens, her sister Sarah Parker-Givens and Amanda Kniepkamp brought the display to the Lehigh Valley. 
<p>They will deliver it to Allentown for a demonstration tonight. From there, it goes to Quakertown, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C., Sarah Parker-Givens said. 
<p>"This is the most action we've seen in awhile," she said as men argued on the sidewalk about the protesters' message. 

<p>Matt Cols of Palmer Township adamantly was opposed. He came to Centre Square expressly to share his views. 

<p>"I'm disgusted," Cols said. "He's the only president who's had any courage. 

<p>"This must be the Saddam Hussein fan club." 

<p>Bill and Becky Bartlett of Upper Nazareth Township wore T-shirts that said, "Impeach Bush (and Cheney, too)." 

<p>They said they believe the president led the country into war based on false pretenses. 

<p>Their 4-year-old son, Matthew, learned the rhyme "Liar, liar, pants on fire," at the demonstration and cheerfully recited it. 

<p>"Humor is always good," Becky Bartlett said about the medium the protesters chose. "I think it's funny." 

<p>Jonas Stirner of Captiva Island, Fla., traveled to Easton for his father's 80th birthday party Saturday. After seeing the PantsOnFire display, he said he would try to volunteer to bring it to his community, which is 80 percent Republican. 

<p>Mike Maurer of Lower Nazareth Township said providing an open forum for debate is important. 

<p>"I think we've lost a little bit of that in this country," Maurer said. "I miss the old days of burning in effigy. I think it has impact." 

<p>Unpopular figures of the past were often burned in effigy. Usually a paper, straw or some other flammable material was used as fuel for heated debate. 

<p>The statue of President Bush wore a military uniform and held a scrolling LED sign displaying messages about truth and lies. Lights shining on flowing pieces of white fabric represented flames shooting from the rear of Bush's pants. 

<p>A sign on the back of the trailer read, "Don't get burned again."
