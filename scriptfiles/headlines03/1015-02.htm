<p> GAZA - A roadside bomb ripped through a U.S.  diplomatic convoy in the Gaza Strip Wednesday, killing three  security guards in the first attack on U.S. officials in three  years of Israeli-Palestinian violence.
<P>
Israel Radio said the convoy included representatives from  U.S. Middle East envoy John Wolf's office and the CIA, but U.S.  officials said Wolf was not in the region at the time.<P>
A silver Cherokee jeep used by American diplomats was  completely destroyed in the bomb blast, which dug a large  crater in the street. Blood and wreckage were splattered yards  away and a black shoe lay on the ground.<P>

      Palestinian security officials secure the area of an apparent roadside bomb attack against a convoy of US diplomatic vehicles in the Gaza Strip October 15, 2003. Israeli radio reported that the convoy included officials from US Middle East envoy John Wolf's office and from the CIA, but added that Wolf was not in the convoy at the time of the blast.

  </table></font>Israeli security sources said three security guards  attached to the U.S. diplomatic contingent were killed and a  diplomat was wounded in the blast. Israel Radio had earlier  reported four dead.<P>
A spokesman for the U.S. embassy in Tel Aviv said: "I can  confirm there were American casualties."<P>
It was the first time that a convoy of U.S. diplomats had  been targeted in Israel or the Palestinian territories where  violence has raged since a Palestinian uprising for statehood  began in September 2000 after peace talks stalled.<P>
A U.S.-backed "road map" for peace that Wolf was  responsible for promoting on the ground has been stalled in  recent months by tit-for-tat violence and Palestinian political  infighting.<P>
Palestinian Prime Minister Ahmed Qurie quickly denounced  the attack and vowed to investigate.<P>
"We strongly condemn this incident regardless of who is  behind it and we express deep regret over the killing and  injury," Qurie told reporters in the West Bank city of  Ramallah.<P>
There was no immediate claim of responsibility. Palestinian  militants have frequently detonated roadside bombs against  Israeli troops operating in parts of the Gaza Strip.<P>
ISRAELI TANKS RUSH TO SCENE<P>
Shortly after the blast, Israeli tanks swept onto the scene  and opened fire with machine guns in the vicinity, witnesses  said.<P>
Palestinian security sources said the Israeli army had  informed them that troops would arrive with U.S. diplomatic  officials to carry out an investigation.<P>
A Reuters witness saw a detonator wire stretched for about  330 feet away from the blown-up vehicle into a factory area at  the entrance to the Jabalya refugee camp, near Gaza City.<P>
"We were inside our storage room, and heard the siren of  police cars approaching. A few seconds later there was a huge  explosion and shrapnel from body parts and debris from damaged  M-16s were scattered everywhere," said witness Ahmed Samir.<P>
A U.S. embassy spokesman confirmed that a U.S. vehicle had  been hit by an explosion in the Gaza Strip. He said the car was  "a security contractors' car, it was not an embassy vehicle per  se."<P>
The discovery of a detonator wire by a Reuters  correspondent at the scene indicated the blast may have been  timed to hit the convoy.<P>
"I was standing by the side of the road when a convoy led  by a Palestinian police car drove by. It was followed by two  foreign jeeps and at the back there was another Palestinian  police car," a witness, Khaled Abu Nour, told Reuters.<P>
"There was an explosion and one of the two jeeps blew up  and was torn apart. We saw on the ground three people dead.  They looked like they were foreigners ... a fourth was badly  wounded."<P>
Hospital workers bundled up body parts in a bedsheet and  one body was brought to the morgue in Shifa hospital,  Palestinian medics said.
