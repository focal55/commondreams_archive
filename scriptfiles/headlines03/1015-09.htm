<p>&#8220;A few of them will get their clocks cleaned in 2004,&#8221; 
              said Larry Purpuro, former deputy chief of staff at the Republican 
              National Committee, referring to politicians too unimaginative to 
              adapt to the Internet.
<p>
              The Web already has helped raise millions of dollars in campaign 
              contributions, aided grassroots efforts in legislative battles and 
              is the tool used to build both large and small networks of activists.

</table>The big remaining questions are not whether the Internet will change 
              American politics, but who will utilize the new technology best, 
              and when its full impact will become known.
<p>
              Recently, grassroots campaigns have been credited with contributing 
              to Democrats&#8217; prevailing on two issues and setting Congress 
              on a collision course with the White House.
			  
<p>Last month the Senate passed a joint 
              resolution of disapproval in an effort to overturn the Federal Communications 
              Commission&#8217;s (FCC) relaxed media ownership rules, an effort 
              spearheaded by Sens. Trent Lott (R-Miss.) and Byron Dorgan (D-N.D.) 
              by addition, the House and Senate, where Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) 
              led the initiative, have voted on language disapproving the Bush 
              administration&#8217;s proposed changes to overtime rules. 
<p>
              That was especially significant in the House because earlier this 
              year, lawmakers had voted to retain the Bush administration&#8217;s 
              overtime rules. Many credited grassroots campaigning with getting 
              several Republicans to switch their position on the issue to allow 
              a nonbinding motion to instruct the conferees to pass.
<p>
              Wes Boyd, a founder of the grassroots group MoveOn.org, said one 
              of his organization&#8217;s greatest successes was its contribution 
              on the Senate vote on the media ownership rules. 
<p>
              The vote involved an issue that people normally would not focus 
              on but did when grassroots groups moved it into the spotlight and 
              raised public awareness, he said. 
<p>
              Although more times than not the group does not reach its stated 
              goals, such as preventing the war in Iraq, Boyd said MoveOn.org 
              always gets something out of its campaigns.
<p>
              &#8220;Win, lose or draw &#8212; we get stronger&#8221; because 
              public awareness is raised and additional people join the organization, 
              he said.
<p>
              An industry source said organized labor&#8217;s grassroots campaign 
              on the overtime vote was aided by the unions&#8217; ability to set 
              up a system in which a union member &#8220;only had to hit a button&#8221; 
              to send an e-mail opposing the Bush administration&#8217;s proposed 
              changes to the overtime regulations.
<p>
              The source added that there is &#8220;no question&#8221; that the 
              union&#8217;s grassroots effort had an effect on the overtime vote 
              in the House because organized labor and other groups managed to 
              flood members&#8217; offices with e-mails and calls.
<p>
              Meanwhile, Purpuro, the architect of the Republican Party&#8217;s 
              year 2000 online initiative, the e.GOP Project, said the growing 
              importance of the Internet in politics will be clear in November 
              of next year. 
<p>
              &#8220;The Web will be revolutionary in this election cycle, but 
              political pros are not as revolutionary in utilizing it,&#8221; 
              he said. &#8220;Politicians and campaign pros are not known for 
              innovation and risk-taking. Too many dumb politicians are wedded 
              to the old ways [of campaigning].&#8221; 
<p>
              In 2001, Purpuro was declared one of &#8220;25 Who Are Changing 
              the World&#8221; of Internet and politics by PoliticsOnline, Harvard 
              University and the American Association of Political Consultants 
              for his work for the RNC. He is also the founder of Web consulting 
              firm Rightclick Strategies.
<p>
              Purpuro&#8217;s message to his party this time around is that although 
              Republicans outhustled Democrats online in the 2000 election cycle, 
              the tide has shifted and the Democratic National Committee is &#8220;ahead 
              in the game.&#8221;
<p>Liberal Democratic presidential candidates are &#8220;showing 
            a higher level of sophistication&#8221; in utilizing the Internet, 
            he said, adding, &#8220;Left-of-center organizations are showing more 
            energy, innovation and more strength in numbers.&#8221; 
<p>
            He cited MoveOn.org, EMILY&#8217;s List and gay rights groups as examples.
<p> &#8220;I can&#8217;t think of a group on the right,&#8221; Purpuro 
            said, adding, though, that they &#8220;have a lot of potential.&#8221;
<p>
            Jim Moore, a senior fellow at Harvard University&#8217;s Berkman Center 
            for Internet and Society, agrees that left-of-center groups are &#8220;putting 
            a lot of energy in this and are getting a lot of traction.&#8221; 
<p> Some of this is happening &#8220;out 
              of necessity&#8221; because Republicans dominate direct mail efforts 
              and talk radio, Moore explained. 
<p>
              &#8220;The Howard Dean phenomenon should be a wakeup call to all 
              political operatives who think in 2004 it will be business as usual,&#8221; 
              Purpuro added.
<p>
              The former Vermont governor began his campaign for the Democratic 
              presidential nomination in relative obscurity, but his anti-war 
              views and the use of the Internet have helped to propel him to frontrunner 
              status. 
<p>
              In the last two fundraising periods, Dean has raised half his contributions 
              online, and his campaign has utilized the Internet to build a growing 
              base of tens of thousands of active volunteers.
<p>
              Moore said the Internet is &#8220;changing the culture of political 
              fundraising&#8221; by allowing individuals &#8220;who never considered 
              making a contribution&#8221; to give money.
<p>
              Dean is the main beneficiary so far. While long-established candidates 
              are getting the vast majority of their campaign funding from individuals 
              giving at least $1,000, Dean gets his money from smaller contributions.
<p>
              At the end of the June reporting cycle, President Bush received 
              69 percent of his funds from those giving the maximum contribution 
              of $2,000, while Dean got less than 10 percent from such large donors.
<p>
              Presidential candidates Sens. John Kerry (D-Mass.) and Joseph Lieberman 
              (D-Conn.) and Rep. Dick Gephardt (D-Mo.) each received over 70 percent 
              from those giving at least $1,000.
<p>
              MoveOn.org&#8217;s Boyd said the political direction of the Internet 
              and the relative success of the organizations using it would be 
              more accurately described as inside/outside rather than left or 
              right of center.
<p>
              He argued that the Internet can capture the &#8220;roiling discontent&#8221; 
              of those frustrated with current leaders and the political process.
<p>
              As opposed to television and radio, the Internet is not a tool for 
              narrative but rather for conversation, Boyd said, adding that MoveOn.org 
              selects the issues it get involved in by listening to its participants 
              and looking &#8220;to where the energy is.&#8221;
<p>
              After deciding to become involved in an issue, MoveOn.org, which 
              has 1.7 million participants in the United States, tries to be &#8220;civil&#8221; 
              and &#8220;get people to use their brain,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If 
              politics at the dinner table means getting screamed at by your uncle,&#8221; 
              people will stay away from the process, Boyd said.
<p>
              An effective political campaign includes organization, fundraising 
              and communication, Purpuro argued, stating that &#8220;the Web represents 
              the most cost-effective, high-impact tool a campaign can use.&#8221;
<p>
              &#8220;Howard Dean&#8217;s success should erase the doubts from 
              the greatest cynics,&#8221; he said. 
<p>
              Purpuro calls the Internet &#8220;the great equalizer in politics&#8221; 
              that propelled Dean from an &#8220;asterisk&#8221; to a frontrunner 
              for the Democratic nomination. Dean&#8217;s organization has used 
              the Internet &#8220;beautifully,&#8221; especially by giving people 
              the chance to become actively involved in the campaign, Purpuro 
              said. 
<p>
              Dean Campaign Manager Joe Trippi made this year&#8217;s list of 
              &#8220;25 Who Are Changing the World.&#8221;
<p>
              &#8220;Advantages of the medium allow for the easy collection of 
              small donations but more importantly the participation of small 
              donors [in the campaign],&#8221; Purpuro said.
<p>
              Moore said he believes the Internet is an effective political tool 
              because it gives people the chances to become involved by building 
              activism &#8220;from the ground up.&#8221; People are not limited 
              to listening and watching, as in radio or television, Moore said, 
              but also can communicate with others and take action, such as attending 
              or staging political events or donating money. 
<p>
              The impact of the Web is not limited to Dean&#8217;s campaign and 
              will be evident in the election, Purpuro said. &#8220;Web-driven 
              Davids will take down well-funded Goliaths,&#8221; he predicts.
<p>
              Boyd also said the Internet is most valuable in political campaigning 
              when not seen as just another source for money. &#8220;Leaders &#8230; 
              need to see the Internet as a way to engage people,&#8221; he said. 
              
<p>
              Boyd argued that the Internet would help candidates tap into small 
              donors online and said he hopes that groups such as MoveOn.org would 
              &#8220;decrease the importance of &#8216;big money&#8217; [in the 
              political process].&#8221;
<p>
              One of the events that led to a surge in support for Dean was his 
              placing first in a MoveOn.org online primary. Tens of thousands 
              of MoveOn.org participants allowed the organization to pass on their 
              contact information to the campaigns.
<p>
              Boyd said the possibility of retaining people&#8217;s contact information 
              is one thing that sets the Internet apart from other forms of grassroots 
              activism. &#8220;At an antiwar march, at the end of the day everybody 
              goes home&#8221; but the organizers do not get everybody&#8217;s 
              address. The Internet, however, enables organizers to mobilize large 
              numbers of people instantly in the future, he said.
<p>
              AFL-CIO Legislative Director Bill Samuel said MoveOn.org began a 
              new kind of grassroots movement that complements union efforts.
<p>
              Samuel said organized labor had been effective in get-out-the-vote 
              efforts in election fights but had not done as well in legislative 
              battles. He credits groups such as MoveOn.org with having helped 
              to change lawmakers&#8217; minds on the overtime issue.
<p>
              The industry source who commented on the overtime vote said more 
              people now get involved than before because it takes less effort 
              to send a form e-mail to Congress. &#8220;In the old days, a businessman 
              or a worker had to write a letter, which took much more time,&#8221; 
              the source said, adding that in the future, &#8220;a written letter 
              will mean much more.&#8221;
<p>
              Dennis Johnson, associate dean of the Graduate School of Political 
              Management at George Washington University, agreed, saying that 
              one problem faced by those launching online grassroots campaigns 
              is that e-mail does not have as much weight in congressional offices 
              as letters do.
<p>
              He said it is &#8220;a lot cheaper to mobilize people faster&#8221; 
              through the Web. However, Johnson said that once everybody is using 
              the Internet as a tool for grassroots operations &#8220;it will 
              dull the impact&#8221; of each campaign. 
<p>
              Although Johnson said that the importance of the Internet on politics 
              will increase, he called the impact of MoveOn.org&#8217;s involvement 
              in the overtime vote &#8220;relatively minor,&#8221; adding, &#8220;MoveOn 
              was not the reason&#8221; for how the vote turned out.
<p>
              Johnson, the principal investigator for the Congress Online Project, 
              which analyzes congressional websites, said that to be most effective, 
              the Internet has to be used as &#8220;one of many tools.&#8221;
<p>
              Johnson argued that merely sending out thousands of e-mails would 
              not equal an effective grassroots campaign. He believes a good understanding 
              of politics has to be a staple for successful Internet lobbying 
              campaigns.
<p>
              &#8220;Strength in numbers and getting the right message out at 
              the right time to the right member&#8221; is important to succeed 
              but tricky to accomplish, Johnson said.
<p>
              However, Purpuro said times are changing and lobbyists will have 
              to adapt to the tools of a new generation, adding that e-mail could 
              replace the personal contacts lobbyists currently tout. 
<p>
              &#8220;Eighty-five percent of Hill staffers are under 35, and they 
              are online all the time,&#8221; he said.
<p>
              Further evidence of the importance of the Internet in politics is 
              that lawmakers are making more use of the medium and becoming more 
              skillful at it, Johnson said. 
<p>
              In its second year of analyzing congressional homepages, the Congress 
              Online Project identified more good websites than it had the year 
              before. 
<p>
              He added that currently House Republicans and Senate Democrats are 
              doing a better job with their websites than their respective counterparts.
<p>
              However, challengers may be doing an even better job with the Internet 
              as they build their own grassroots campaigns to unseat incumbents. 
              
<p>
              Many experts say there will be a watershed moment in the future 
              that will show how powerful the Internet has become. While they 
              do not want to predict when this day will come, it could be Nov. 
              2, 2004 &#8212; Election Day.
<p>
              &#8220;He who masters the Internet will not only level the playing 
              field, he will also level the opposition,&#8221; Purpuro said.
