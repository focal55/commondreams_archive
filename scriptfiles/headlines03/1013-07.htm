<p>BAGHDAD - On that bright and sunny April 9, scores of people 
pulled down a statue of Saddam Hussein in a central square in Baghdad before 
live television broadcasts aired to the world.

</table>Just over six months later, many Iraqis are openly asking whether the end of 
35 years of Saddam Hussein's tyrannical regime has brought them the benefits 
they expected.
<p>
   ”When the Americans came, people were happy,” Ban Ali, a mother of two told 
IPS. ”We thought the Americans would increase the food ration or give each 
family 50 dollars to improve their livelihood. But nothing has changed. Same 
amount of food, same quality of food.”

<p>
   The quality of food matters, but these issues are not the primary concern for 
most Iraqis. Security and jobs are.

<p>
   No official figures are available, but some estimates place unemployment 
around 80 percent. It does not help that even in Saddam's days nearly half the 
people had no jobs.

<p>
   Added to the dilemma now is the plight of 450,000 former Iraqi army officers 
and conscripts who find themselves with nothing to do.
<p>
   A part of the problem is psychological. ”During Saddam's time an army officer 
enjoyed great respect among the people,” Ali says. ”He was considered high-
ranking. He cannot now accept to go and work in a shop or open a small 
business for himself.” Many other ranking government employees share the 
same attitude.
<p>
   Daily life is indeed harder now than it was during Saddam's time. Complaints 
do not come just from ordinary Iraqis. Ranking politicians too are complaining.
<p>
   ”Certainly what's different from six months ago is that Saddam is no longer 
around, and that is a great thing,” says Sherif Ali Bin Hussein, a member of the 
former royal family in Iraq. ”But the down point is that the standard of living for 
average Iraqis is now even lower than it was during Saddam's time. There is a 
serious problem of marginalization and isolation of the people from the political 
decision-making process.”
<p>
   Officials with the coalition forces argue that the situation has improved 
drastically and will improve every day they remain here. They say a lot has been 
achieved in the past six months and that Iraqis should think long term.
<p>
   Paul Bremer, the U.S. administrator in Iraq and other officials from the coalition 
forces blame the media for over-emphasizing the daily attacks on U.S. and 
British soldiers in an area dubbed the ”Sunni Triangle” to the north of Baghdad, 
where support for Saddam and his regime remains higher than in other parts of 
the country.
<p>
   ”This is an area that is 5 percent of the country but in which we are facing 99 
percent of the attacks,” says Lt. Col. George Krivo, spokesman for the coalition 
forces. ”It is an area that has no strategic importance.”
<p>
   He admits, however, that this 5 percent of the area is keeping a third of the 
140,000 U.S. forces in Iraq busy.
<p>
   The road ahead is difficult, Krivo admits. ”I must warn you that on the road 
ahead there will be attempts for tremendous attacks by terrorists and non-
compliant forces,” he says. ”I think it is very, very likely that one day America will 
wake up in the morning and hear that we have suffered a dozen or so casualties 
in one attack.”
<p>
   The coalition forces and the Iraqis differ on the standards that can be used to 
measure success.
<p>
   For Iraqis, these are an immediate and dramatic improvement of lifestyle and 
conditions. Coalition forces, in typical military style, measure success 
incrementally and over time.
<p>
   People like Ali want immediate changes in the food basket. Krivo and his 
colleagues judge success by whether one more school was painted and 
whether electricity production increased by a few megawatts.
<p>
   ”It is West meets East,” says one Iraqi man. ”We are just not sure if this was the 
right time and this was the right forum for this discussion.”
