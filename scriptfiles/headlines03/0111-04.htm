<p>Hundreds of protesters lined the streets outside the Immigration and 

Naturalization Service office in San Francisco on Friday, denouncing the 

agency's mandatory registration of mostly Arab and Muslim men from 13 

countries.

</table></font>Friday was the registration deadline for men 16 and older who hold 

temporary visas from countries the U.S. government views as high-risk for 

terrorist activity. Protesters called the action racist and said they fear it 

will lead to a mass detainment akin to the internment of Japanese Americans 

during World War II.

<P>"At any time when our brothers and sisters are denied civil liberties, 

civil rights or human rights, we must always have a cadre of people who will 

stand up and say, 'No, no, no,"' said the Rev. Cecil Williams of Glide 

Memorial Church in San Francisco.

<P>Williams stood on a flatbed truck addressing the crowd that lined the 

intersection of Sansome and Washington streets.

<P>Between 100 and 150 men have registered in the city this week, with several 

detained, said members of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, who 

interviewed men as they entered and left the building.

<P>Nationwide, 7,200 men were expected to register, and Department of Justice 

officials have said about 400 men have been detained in California since the 

National Security Entry-Exit Registration System began in November.

<P>All but about 20 of them have since been released, justice officials said.

<P>Friday's deadline was for men from Afghanistan, Algeria, Lebanon, North 

Korea, Bahrain, Eritrea, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Somalia, Tunisia, the United 

Arab Emirates and Yemen.

<P>The first phase of the registration tracked immigrants from Iraq, Iran, 

Libya, Sudan and Syria. The next deadline is Feb. 21 for men from Saudi Arabia 

and Pakistan.

<P>On Friday, men leaving the INS building said it took about four hours to be 

interviewed, fingerprinted and photographed. They said INS interviewers asked 

questions about where the men lived and worked, their country of origin and 

their families.

<P>One man, who only wanted to give his first name of Ali, was shaking as he 

left the building after his interview. He pulled a cigarette from a pack and 

leaned against the granite wall, taking deep drags.

<P>"I've seen people going in and not coming out. Basically it's like luck 

whether you have to stay," said Ali, a Marin resident who came on a student 

visa three years ago but has since changed his status.

<P>He had worried "big time" that his change in status could lead to 

detainment.

</table></font>Meanwhile, protesters and speakers shouted ferocious condemnations of the 

registration, with an intensity and unified message anti-war protests in the 

city have lacked.

<P>"When you lie to one of us, you lie to all of us. When you detain one of us, you detain all of us. When you terrorize some of us, you terrorize all of us,

" shouted Renee Saucedo of La Raza Centro Legal's INS Watch project, 

electrifying the crowd.

<P>San Francisco Public Defender Jeff Adachi, who also spoke, said he never 

understood how his parents and grandparents of Japanese descent could be 

detained during World War II while the rest of the country watched.

<P>He said his own ambivalence toward articles and other information about 

government actions after Sept. 11 showed him how internment went unchecked.

<P>"Our greatest enemy is our own inaction," he said.

<P>About 100 protesters also gathered outside the INS building in New York.

<P>Speakers in San Francisco demanded, and received, a meeting with the acting 

director of the INS here. Seven people representing various groups met for 

about 45 minutes with Acting Director David Still.

<P>Still told the group that men who missed the deadline because they were 

unaware of its existence or those whose visa papers were still pending would 

not be detained, said Marc Van Der Hout, who represented the National Lawyers 

Guild at the meeting.

<P>Not every man who registered saw the policy as intrusive.

<P>Samim Ansary, who came from Afghanistan in June, said he felt safer after 

talking to INS officials and did not mind the interview questions.

<P>"They already had the information in my file from when I arrived here," 

said Ansary, who worked as a doctor in Afghanistan and is doing sales in 

Concord. He brought an attorney to the meeting nonetheless.

<P>Those attending the protest mostly held signs denouncing the registration, 

while in previous city protests, any number of groups and messages were 

present.

<P>Speakers still denounced the possible war in Iraq and other Bush 

administration policies, which elicited cheers from the crowd.

<P>"No one wants to be terrorized, but no one wants to be terrorized by their 

government in the name of terrorism," said San Francisco Supervisor Tom 

Ammiano, who spoke.

<P>Alexis Downey, who attended the massive anti-war protest Oct. 6 in San 

Francisco, said the spirit of the crowd felt different at Friday's event.

<P>"I felt an undercurrent not of anger, but of united strength," said Downey, 

a student at UC Berkeley.</p>
