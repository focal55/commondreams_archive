<p>WASHINGTON&nbsp; After Army Sgt. Vannessa Turner survived a
still-unknown illness doctors feared would kill her, she thought
her toughest battle was over.

  </table></font>But since a military flight brought Turner home she says she's
had to fight to get medical treatment and can't even get personal
items returned.
<p>   The homefront, she's finding, can be as daunting as the front
lines in Iraq.
<p>   ''It's easier to stay a soldier and be in harm's way than to
come home and get care,'' said Turner, her quiet voice quaking with
emotion.
<p>   Arriving at her mother's home in Boston's Roxbury neighborhood
last month after hospital stays in Germany and Washington, the
six-year Army veteran says she was told that despite severe nerve
damage in her right leg she'd have to wait until mid-October to see
a doctor at the local Veterans Affairs hospital.
<p>   She sought help from Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and
eventually got an appointment scheduled this week, but the
experience was frustrating for Turner and her family. They look at
the hero's welcome given to former prisoner of war Pfc. Jessica
Lynch, who was in one of Turner's rehabilitation sessions, and see
a double standard.
<p>   ''Some people are getting scholarships, my sister can't get a
doctor's appointment,'' said her sister Nicole. ''To me, they threw
her away like a piece of trash. She served her country and now
nothing is being done for her.''
<p>   Veterans' advocates said Turner's frustration is not unusual.
More than 110,000 veterans are waiting six months or more for their
initial visit with a VA doctor or to see a specialist, the VA
acknowledges.
<p>   ''Is this what our returning heroes from Afghanistan and Iraq
can expect from their elected officials as they seek health care
for their painful injuries sustained in the line of duty?''
Veterans of Foreign Wars Commander Ray Sisk said.
<p>   VA undersecretary for health Robert Roswell said everyone who
served in Operation Iraqi Freedom is entitled to two years of VA
health care benefits. And the benefits are available to those
wounded in combat as well as those injured in accidents or who
suffer illnesses.
<p>   He blamed Turner's treatment on errors at the VA's West Roxbury
facility. Officials there failed to recognize her as a newly
released veteran needing immediate care.
<p>   ''We made an admitted mistake. But it was caught,'' Roswell
said, adding that changes are being made to ensure it doesn't
happen again.
<p>   Turner's ordeal started in Camp Balad, 42 miles north of
Baghdad. One of the more than 150,000 American soldiers dodging
bullets and toiling in the searing Iraqi heat, Turner was suffering
from severe mosquito bites when she collapsed on May 18.
<p>   The next thing she knew medics were giving her shots, cutting
off her clothes and rushing her to the hospital. As they wheeled
the gurney down the hall, the 40-year-old Army cook could hear the
doctor's terrifying words: ''She's not going to make it.''
<p>   ''I tried to move my hand, I wanted to signal them   I was
trying to say, 'Hey, I'm alive, don't let me die.' But I couldn't
move. I couldn't talk,'' Turner said.
<p>   Doctors still aren't sure what caused her illness, though they
suspect it could have been a reaction to the ointment she used on
the mosquito bites.
<p>   Turner's recovery presented a new set of problems for her
family. Because of her severe condition, the military quickly
classified her as medically retired so her 15-year-old daughter
Brittany could get increased benefits.
<p>   But because she no longer was an active member of the military,
the Pentagon couldn't transport her family to her bedside in
Landstuhl, Germany, where Turner had been airlifted for treatment.
<p>   ''They told me she had no heartbeat, that she wasn't
breathing,'' said Turner's mother, Beverly. ''They said she had 36
to 72 hours to live.''
<p>   Turner's family couldn't afford airline tickets so they turned
to Kennedy and Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., for help. Through their
offices family members got flights to Germany courtesy of the
United Service Organizations, and they received lodging and food
from the Fisher House Foundation, which provides housing for
military families.
<p>   Turner's fitness aided her recovery. An avid weightlifter, she
began to slowly improve and by the end of May was flown to Walter
Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, where she stayed for about
six weeks before going to her mother's home.
<p>   For Turner, the work to rehabilitate the damaged nerves in her
leg is compounded by confusion over her benefits, her quest for a
doctor, and the Pentagon's initial assertions that she go back to
Germany herself to get her belongings.
<p>   Turner is hesitant about the future. A year from now she'll go
before a military board to see if she should be retired permanently
or if she's well enough to be reinstated.
<p>   ''Half my brain says yes, half my brain says no,'' she said.
''But, ma'am, I'm a soldier. I love being a soldier. This is what I
do.''</p>
