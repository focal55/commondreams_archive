<p>WASHINGTON  - 

Emboldened by the U.S. military's

apparent quick rout of Iraqi forces, conservative hawks in

America are setting their sights on regime change in Iran and

Syria.

<p>

 "It's time to bring down the other terror masters," Michael

Ledeen of the American Enterprise Institute wrote on Monday --

two days before U.S. troops swept into the heart of Baghdad --

in a piece entitled "Syria and Iran Must Get Their Turn."

<p>

 "Iran, at least, offers Americans the possibility of a

memorable victory, because the Iranian people openly loath the

regime, and will enthusiastically combat it, if only the United

States supports them in their just struggle," he added. "Syria

cannot stand alone against a successful democratic revolution

that topples tyrannical regimes in Kabul, Tehran and Iraq."

<p>

 No one is explicitly advocating force against Syria or Iran

but conservatives inside and out of the U.S. government hope

the Iraq war will signal to Damascus and Tehran that seeking

weapons of mass destruction may be hazardous to their health.

<p>

"I hope we could change the regimes without military force

and I would not contemplate using military force in those

places," said Kenneth Adelman, a former Pentagon aide and early

advocate of toppling Iraqi President Saddam Hussein by force.

 <p>

 "The combination of totalitarianism and weapons of mass

destruction is a deadly combination for the world," he added.

 <p>

 While some conservatives believe the example of Iraq could

serve to undermine the governments of some of its nondemocratic

neighbors, others simply hope it will dissuade them from

seeking biological, chemical and nuclear weapons.

<p>

 GETTING THE MESSAGE

<p>

 John Bolton, under secretary of state for arms control and

international security, told reporters in Rome he hoped Iran,

Syria and North Korea  -- which the United States believes is

pursuing a nuclear weapons program -- will get the message.

<p>

 "We are hopeful that a number of regimes will draw the

appropriate lesson from Iraq that the pursuit of weapons of

mass destruction is not in their national interest," he said,

citing the three when asked what the post-war period may hold.

<p>

 A U.S. official played down the idea that the United States

was contemplating using force against Iran or Syria, suggesting

the hawks were simply reflecting the "strategic ambiguity" that

the U.S. has long practiced with potential adversaries.

<p>

 "When talking about threats from countries that have really

bad track records and don't wish you well, U.S. policy has been

to never rule anything out," he said. "That doesn't mean you're

actively contemplating an invasion or the use of force."

<p>

 Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, who on March 28 warned

Syria and Iran not to meddle in the Iraq war, said on Wednesday

the United States had evidence Damascus might be helping

Saddam's relatives and supporters flee the country.

<p>

 While he did not cite Syria or Iran by name, Vice President

Dick Cheney  said in a speech to newspaper editors that the

United States must "do whatever it takes" to defeat terrorism

and must confront nations that sponsor it.

<p>

 The United States regards Iran and Syria as state sponsors

of terrorism. U.S. officials believe both are pursuing weapons

of mass destruction, accusing Iran of seeking nuclear weapons.

Iran says its nuclear program aims to produce electricity.

<p>

 "In removing the terror regime from Iraq, we send a very

clear message to all groups that operate by means of terror and

violence against the innocent," Cheney said. "The United States

and our coalition partners are showing ... we have the capacity

and the will to wage war on terror and to win decisively."

<p>

 "We have a further responsibility to help keep the peace of

the world and to prevent the terrorists and their sponsors from

plunging the world into horrific violence," he added.



<p>

 Frank Gaffney, a senior Pentagon official under former

President Ronald Reagan , said he believed that regime change

should be the U.S. policy toward Iran and Syria and said the

United States could not rule out the use of force.

<p>

"If the threat metastasizes in such a way that we consider

it to leave us no choice but to use military force then that

would have to be an option," he said.

<p>

Gaffney, head of the Center for Security Policy think tank,

said many Iranians would like to see their government change

and the United States should help them through information

flows, economic assistance and possibly covert activity.

<p>

"The use of military force is probably genuinely the last

resort here, but I certainly think it's like that we're going

to see efforts made to bring about change in Iran as well as

Syria ... and perhaps elsewhere in the region as a matter of

the natural progression of this war on terror," he added.</p>
