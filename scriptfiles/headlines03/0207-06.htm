<p>Donald Rumsfeld's latest comments comparing Berlin's attitude to a war on Iraq with that of Cuba and Libya have touched a raw nerve in Germany's press.</P>









	<p>

	

	





	









	&quot;<i>There are good reasons to criticize the German position on Iraq, but this is a mixture of tastelessness and insult</i>&quot;	<b>





Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung</b>

 <P><i>"Axis of the ignorant"</i> is how the left-leaning <B>Tageszeitung</B> headlines its report. </P>



<P><i>"Sarcastro" </i>writes Berlin's <B>Tagesspiegel</B>.</P>

<P> <i>"Rumsfeld's latest jolt"</i> says the <B>Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung</B>. </P>

<P>The <B>Hamburger Morgenpost</B> clearly feels irony is called for: <i>"Hooray, at last we have some friends!"</i></P>

<p>

<B>Mystified</B>

<P>In their commentaries, even Germany's centre-right dailies find it hard to stomach Rumsfeld's opinion.</P>

	&quot;<i>





	A friendship must be able to withstand his honesty, but he must be able to take ours as well

</i>&quot;











	









<b>Tagesspiegel</b>

<P>The conservative <B>Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung</B> says <i>"there are good reasons to criticize the German position on Iraq.. but this is a mixture of tastelessness and insult."</i></P>

<P><i>"Verbal jostling just hardens positions even further, because every government has to save face"</i>, the paper warns.</P>

<P>The tabloid <B>Bild</B>, which is normally a friend of all things American, is equally mystified. <i>"Government outraged - Rumsfeld compares us with Libya and Cuba"</i> is its headline.</P>

<P>The paper reports<i> "head-shaking"</i> in Chancellor Schroeder's office, and lists politicians from all parties who have rejected the US defence secretary's remarks.</P>

<p>

<B>Serious affair</B>

<P>The centre-left <B>Tagesspiegel</B> admires Rumsfeld's <i>"entertainment value". </i></P>



<P><i>"A friendship must be able to withstand his honesty",</i> the paper concludes,<i> "but he must be able to take ours as well."</i></P>









	<p>

	

	





	









	&quot;<i>





	Can we continue to draw our principles from the 20th century - a century of extremes?

</i>&quot;











	









<b> Berliner Zeitung</b>

	<P>But Berlin's <B>Tageszeitung</B> takes the whole affair more seriously. It sees Germany's arguments against war within the context of <i>"the legal and political order of the world's states"</i>. The paper says the world faces a choice:<i> "US world domination or a multi-voiced concert, mono-centrism or poly-centrism".</i></P>



<P>The <B>Berliner Zeitung</B> is equally philosophical. <i>"Never again war! Never again Auschwitz! Those are the lessons of German politics</i>", it writes.</P>



<P><i>"But can we continue to draw our principles from the 20th century - a century of extremes?"</i></P>



<P>Only one major paper - Berlin's <B>Die Welt</B> - shows some understanding for the Rumsfeld comments. "<i>Outrageous, but true</i>", it says.</P>



<P>It warns of even worse to come if Germany votes against a possible second UN resolution on Iraq. </P>



<P><i>"Berlin's plunge into the company of pariahs, thieves and the usual suspects for anti-American activities would be complete.</i>"</P>
