</table></font>The demonstrations are part of massive rallies planned  throughout different time zones around the world with the peace  movement expected to spread to more than 600 towns and cities  stretching from the far south to Iceland in the north.<p>



		Organizers expect large crowds in New York and London,  while protesters in Rome said they expected more than a million  people to attend Saturday's peace march.<p>



		In Australia, about 16,000 activists gathered in the  capital city Canberra, three times more than organizers had  expected.<p>



		"It is an overwhelming success...and it points to the fact  politics is made by common people and not by a handful of  politicians," said Rick Kuhn, a spokesman for ACT NOW, the  organizer.<p>



		In Sydney, two activists from a opposition party scaled an  awning of a prominent building around the site of the U.S.  consulate-general to unfurl a banner that read, "No US Oil War  -- The Greens."<p>



		In west Australian city Perth, several thousand are  expected to march later in the day, while in Asia, protests are  planned for Tokyo, Hong Kong and Kuala Lumpur.<p>



		Australia has sent about 2,000 troops, jet fighters and  warships to the Middle East to join American and British forces  preparing for war.<p>



		<p>



		"AXIS OF EVIL"<p>



		In nuclear-free New Zealand, several thousand people  marched peacefully through the center of the nation's main city  Auckland, while a plane trailed a giant banner reading "No War,  Peace Now."<p>



		In the capital Wellington, more than 5,000 people clutching  placards reading "Bush, Blair, Howard -- The Axis of Evil" and  "Stop Bush Start Peace" marched through the city center,  bringing traffic to a standstill.<p>



		Among the crowd, florists handed out leftover Valentine's  Day flowers to mothers with babies, while spiky-haired  teenagers with skulls painted on their faces joined the elderly  as they waved white peace doves.<p>



		"Millions of people around the world are rallying today to  say no to war, and New Zealand is the first country to send  this message," Greenpeace spokesman Robbie Kelman said.<p>



		New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark on Saturday backed  the continuation of weapons inspections in Iraq over any call  for a second U.N. resolution to authorize the use of force.<p>



		Her comments followed a speech by chief U.N. arms inspector  Hans Blix on Friday to the U.N. Security Council that no  weapons of mass destruction had yet been found in Iraq,  although he cautioned that many were unaccounted for.<p>



		<p>



		GLOBAL PROTESTS<p>



		In the United States, New York is gearing up for a large  anti-war rally opposite U.N. headquarters, with more  demonstrations planned across the United States.<p>



		In London, protest organizers said they expected a huge  turnout, while across the rest of Europe, activists were  expected to show their distrust of Washington's motivations and  their fears the world could be engulfed in a wider conflict.<p>



		"We believe that the London demonstration will be one of  the biggest and the most pivotal because the British government  is actively involved in the build up to war and the British  people definitely do not want war," Stop The War UK leader  Andrew Murray said.

		<p>



		A major demonstration is also planned in the Australian  city Sydney on Sunday. (Additional Reporting by Catherine  Walbridge)
