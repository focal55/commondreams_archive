<p> Monday, approximately twenty-five people braved the bitter cold 

                      to stand on a corner in downtown Boone to express their 

                      opposition to the threat of a U.S. invasion of Iraq. Last 

                      week, the protest, slated to become a weekly event, hosted 

                      nearly fifty protesters, some of whom pulled their cars 

off the road to join those on the sidewalks.</p><p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><table border=0 align=right hspace=5 cellpadding=6 width="200">

                      week&#146;s protesters, swaddled in scarves and thick winter 

                      coats, held signs reading Honk for Peace, No Blood for Oil, 

                      and No War in Iraq. A woman moving through the intersection 

                      at the wheel of her large SUV turned to shout that such 

                      a protest &#147;should not be tolerated.&#148;

                      </p><p> A large 

                      percentage of the traffic traveling through the intersection 

                      disagreed with the scolding remarks of the woman. As station 

                      wagons and sedans made their way home for the day, many 

                      honked in support. One driver held by a red light laid on 

                      her horn and, as others peppered the air with their vehicular 

                      voices, Boone was blanketed in a cacophony of protest.

                      </p><p> Anna 

                      Sagel, a member of High Country Citizens for Peace and Justice, 

                      gestured towards the protestors and said, &#147;This is 

                      what democracy looks like.&#148;

                      </p><p> Every 

                      Monday between 5 and 6, concerned citizens will be meeting 

                      at the corner of King and Depot to protest the possibility 

                      of war in Iraq. So far, the protest has drawn a large cross-section 

                      of people including college students, professors, and veterans.
