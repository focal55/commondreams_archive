<p>BRUSSELS&nbsp; -- The European Union Friday vowed a vigorous defense

against any possible U.S. suit at the World Trade Organization challenging the

E.U.'s four-year moratorium on importing genetically modified crops.

<p>

"We would fight a WTO case and we believe we would win it," said Arancha

Gonzalez, an E.U. spokeswoman.<p>  On Thursday, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick slammed the E.U.

moratorium, calling it "immoral" and a "complete violation of WTO" rules.<p>  Some U.S. officials are concerned about raising tensions with Europe and

Zoellick said Washington still hasn't decided to file a WTO case. A high-profile

trade dispute could backfire by strengthening anti-U.S. sentiment in Europe

against GM crops and complicating U.S. diplomacy on a possible Iraq war.<p>  The E.U. also fears an escalation. "We don't think a WTO case will move the

case forward. Rather, it will freeze the process of lifting the moratorium,"

Gonzalez said.<p>  The E.U. passed tough new GM labeling and traceability rules last December and

the E.U. parliament will vote on them this spring. If they are approved,

European fears about the potential risks of such products will be eased and

could lead to a lifting of the moratorium. Some E.U. countries, including France

and Italy, have refused to issue new approvals until strict GM labels are in

place.<p>  Zoellick's anger with the E.U. attitude was sparked by a row over food aid to

Africa. Last fall, famine-stricken Zambia refused U.S. food aid that included

genetically-modified corn. Zoellick now accuses several European countries of

making economic aid to developing countries contingent on whether they bar GM

crops.<p>  The Europeans rejected the charge. "It's a bit far fetched to link the GM

debate with hunger in Africa," Gonzalez said. The U.S. gave African countries an

unfair choice between importing GM seeds that could contaminate their domestic

crops or face starvation, she said.<p>  A possible solution is to provide milled grain, which avoids any fears of

contamination into environment, Gonzalez said.<p>  Drought-stricken Malawi, Lesotho, Mozambique, Swaziland and Zimbabwe say they

will only accept the grain provided it is milled to prevent it from being

planted, while Zambia has imposed an outright ban.<p>  The U.S. has said milling doubles the cost of the grain, meaning less food for

fewer people.</p>
