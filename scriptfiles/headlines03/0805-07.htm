<p>One or more busy vandals spent today's early morning hours painting over the windows of Starbucks coffee shops and posting "For Lease'' and various other signs on the stores, according to San Francisco police.

As many as 17 Starbucks stores may have been targeted, according to Officer Mike Celis, who said the affected stores were mainly in the Financial District, the Tenderloin, and the South of Market areas. 

<p>No one seems quite sure when the vandalism occurred, but Celis said it was likely sometime after midnight. 

<p>The vandalism reportedly makes the stores appear to have gone out of business. 

<p>Christine Eden-Graves, an employee of the Starbucks at 390 Stockton St., said she arrived at work to find the store's windows painted with something white and adorned with a "For Lease'' sign. Other signs had been posted as well, she said, but those were confiscated by police. 
<p>She did not know what type of substance was used to paint the windows, but said it "looks like it's white glue.'' 

<p>A spokesman for the Police Department's Tenderloin Station described the substance as more of "a soapy paste.'' 
<p>Eden-Graves said the Stockton Street store will operate normally today in spite of the foggy windows. 
<p>No suspects have been taken into custody in connection with the vandalism.</p>
