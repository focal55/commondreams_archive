<p> A former Pentagon official helped draft a controversial statement by 10 Central and Eastern European nations this month that supports the United States in its stand-off with Iraq, according to a press report published in Paris.</p>
<p>In an interview, Bruce Jackson, a former US Defense Department official who heads a Committee for the Liberation of Iraq, said that he was among those who helped initiate the statement supporting the US stance, the daily International Herald Tribune reported. </p>
<p>The joint statement by Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia drew a scathing rebuke from France's President Jacques Chirac at a European Union summit meeting in Brussels Monday.</p>
<p>According to the report, it was the Committee for the Liberation of Iraq, Jackson's organization, that helped distribute the text to news agencies.</p>
<p>"The American influence in all this is vastly exaggerated," said Jackson, who, according to the paper, has played down his role in drafting the statement during a dinner organized at the Slovak embassy in Washington which he said he attended. </p>
<p>The statement "was a product of the Slovaks and really the Latvians", he said.</p>
<p>But, according to the IHT, Kestutis Jankauskas, deputy chief of mission at the Lithunian embassy in Washington, said Jackson played a "considerable role" and helped "initiate the text."</p>
<p>Richard Mucins, counselor at the Latvian embassy in Washington, said, according to the paper, that Jackson suggested the following passage, one of the most compelling sections in the statement: "Our countries understand the dangers posed by tyranny and the special responsibility of democracies to defend our shared values".</p>
<p>The statement which was published by what is known as the Vilnius 10 on February 5 is considered as a way to help seven out of the 10 countries, which are not yet members of NATO, to join the Atlantic alliance, says the paper.</p>
