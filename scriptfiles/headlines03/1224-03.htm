<p>LONDON - This is not the kind of wrapping anyone would expect
to see around Christmas time. But a report from <a href="http://www.Greenpeace.org" target="_new">Greenpeace</a> warns of the
dangers of toxic wrapping around thousands of turkeys being sold for
Christmas.
</b>
						<p>
   Samples of turkeys taken from several superstores in Britain ”contained
Nonylphenol, a toxic chemical which can interfere with human DNA and affect
sperm production in mammals,” says the report.
<p>
   Quantities of phthalates, which can cause liver, kidney and testicular
damage were also detected.
<p>
   Turkeys sold in two stores were found to contain a toxic chemical called
Bisphenol A ”which has been shown to cause genetic damage to mammals and is
known to mimic hormones,” the report says.
<p>
   Greenpeace warns that ”the European Union has recently ordered a drastic
reduction in the maximum amount of Bisphenol A used in food packaging amid
health concerns.”
<p>
   The study carried out by a laboratory in the Netherlands says that
dangerous chemicals used in the wrapping had migrated to the food. Samples
of meat tested at one store which does not use such wrapping were found to
be toxin free.
<p>
   ”It's entirely unacceptable for supermarkets to be selling these toxic
turkeys stuffed with hazardous chemicals,” said Mark Strutt, Greenpeace
toxics campaigner. ”The fact that turkeys from other stores show no sign of
these chemicals proves that there are perfectly safe alternatives to these
chemicals, and all supermarkets should be using them rather than peddling
polluted poultry.”
<p>
   Strutt called on the government to ”outlaw these unnecessary harmful
substances.”
<p>
   A spokeswoman at a supermarket said that Greenpeace had tested only one
fillet from the supermarket. ”The packaging residues found were at minute
levels, so there is no cause for customers to be concerned,” she told IPS.
<p>
   A spokesman at another supermarket called the survey ”wholly
unscientific.” The study shows levels of all residues found in the meat are
”well within legal limits,” he told IPS. ”And these are set 100 to 200 times
lower than the safety limits for these products.”
<p>
   The spokesman said Greenpeace was engaging in ”scaremongering” in
offering conclusions that were ”irresponsible” and ”ridiculous”.
<p>
   Strutt told IPS that while Greenpeace had sent several samples to the
laboratory in the Netherlands, it had also done a round of pre-testing. ”We
found the same levels of chemicals also in chicken and bacon,” he said. ”Our
findings were not based on just one test.”
<p>
   Strutt told IPS it was not possible to say whether the toxin levels were
within allowable limits because ”it is not certain that there are any safe
levels for these.” Some of these chemicals are ”extremely dangerous”, he
said.
<p>
   Strutt said there was ”no need for these substances to be there at all.”
One supermarket chain had ”simply used safer type of wrapping,” he said.
<p>
   The Greenpeace report follows a campaign by the group earlier over
dangerous synthetic chemicals that find their way into household goods such
as children's clothing, toys, perfumes, air fresheners and paints. 
<p>
   ”They are allowed into these products because there is no legislation
saying they shouldn't be,” Greenpeace said in its report.
<p>
   These chemicals need to be phased out because through their use, wear and
tear, and disposal from factories they are released into the environment,
the Greenpeace report said. ”The very same chemicals then ultimately make
their way into our bodies.” 
<p>
   Greenpeace had found Nonylphenol, the same chemical traced in wrapping
for turkeys, also in a set of garments it tested.
<p>
   Children's garments were found to contain phthalates, which it said are
banned from teething toys under emergency legislation. This substance too
was reported in the samples tested for wrapping Christmas turkeys.
