<p>VIENNA  - Former chief U.N. arms inspector Hans  Blix felt Washington was intimidating him to produce reports  that would justify military action in the run-up to the Iraq  war, the head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog said on Friday.<P>

  </table></font>In an interview on BBC television's Hardtalk, International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief Mohamed ElBaradei also said  he believed Iraq had not tried to revive its clandestine  nuclear weapons program as the United States and Britain  insist.<P>
Blix and ElBaradei led the hunt for Iraq's alleged weapons  of mass destruction for nearly four months late last year and  early this year. The IAEA hunted for nuclear weapons, while  Blix's UNMOVIC monitoring agency looked for chemical,  biological and ballistic arms.<P>
Asked if the administration of President Bush had tried to  intimidate him to produce reports support their case for a war  on Iraq, ElBaradei said it had not.<P>
"I think there were probably more efforts to intimidate  Hans Blix, because there were more serious concerns about  chemical and biological (weapons)," he said.<P>
"Hans complained a lot about the media campaign, some of  the administration's efforts to put pressure on him."<P>
The Bush administration sharply criticized Blix before the  war for refusing to back U.S. and British assertions about  Iraq's weapons programs in his reports to the U.N. Security  Council.<P>
U.N. weapons inspectors never found the massive stockpiles  of banned weapons that Britain and the U.S. claimed President  Saddam Hussein possessed. Neither have the U.S. and British  forces who took over the hunt for his arsenal after the war.<P>
ElBaradei said a lesson should be learned about the dangers  of cutting short weapons inspections.<P>
"If anything comes out from the war in Iraq, it's that  inspections take time and that we should not jump to  conclusions, because jumping to conclusions on such a vital  issue that determines war and peace is very reckless and  irresponsible in my opinion," he said.<P>
ElBaradei added that he would like to see the situation in  Iraq "coming to a closure soon and put an end to that tragic  situation."<P>
Regarding U.S. and British insistence that Saddam had tried  to revive his secret atomic weapons program, which the IAEA  says it destroyed in the 1990s, ElBaradei was certain this  allegation is unfounded.<P>
"I would be very surprised if we were to discover that  there was a nuclear weapons program restarted in Iraq," he  said.<P>
Blix, who headed the IAEA for 16 years until 1997, retired  as the director of UNMOVIC at the end of June.
