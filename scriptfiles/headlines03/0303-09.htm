<p>Nearly 300,000 mentally ill people are held in US prisons, often because there is nowhere else for them to go. So serious is the problem that one jail in Los Angeles has become in effect the biggest mental institution in the country. <P>Senior police officers and mental health experts say that the situation is critical but there is a lack of political will to deal with it. Some of the mental patients spend many years in jail for minor offences.  <P>Twin Towers jail in central Los Angeles, which Los Angeles county sheriff's department calls the biggest known jail in the world, has become a national symbol of the crisis. About 2,000 mentally ill prisoners, recognizable by yellow shirts and the letter M on their name tags, make up almost half its intended occupants.  

<P>"The more unstable they are, the higher up they are," Deputy Sheriff Daniel Castro said, conducting a tour of the building where the men are housed. "Up on the seventh floor are the most unstable."  <P>All are on medication. It was noticeable that the higher the floor, the slower and more sluggish the movements of the inmates. "Some guys, all they do is sleep all day," Mr Castro said.  <P>Many are both mentally ill and homeless, and have committed minor offences such as public drunkenness or vagrancy, or are awaiting trial. They spend most of the time lying on their bunks or watching television. A few read, but many are illiterate. They are allowed two 30-minute visits a week.  <P>"We shouldn't be running the largest de facto mental institution in the country," the sheriff's spokesman, Steve Whitmore, said yesterday. "We are doing it to the best of our ability but we just don't have the resources. We have to have an alternative to what is going on now."  <P>The sheriff, Lee Baca, says it is not the job of the police and the county jails to incarcerate mentally disturbed people who have committed only misdemeanors. He would like to see a place established in central Los Angeles where they could be given treatment and help rather than locked up.  

<P>"Jails are not the appropriate place for the mentally ill," he said yesterday, adding that the problem had been at "crisis emergency" level for some time.  <P>Nationally the problem is growing. There were at least 283,000 inmates classified as mentally ill in 2000, according to the justice department.  <P>It was exacerbated by the closure of many mental institutions under the "care in the community" policy introduced in the 80s during Ronald Reagan's presidency. (A similar policy was introduced in the UK around the same time.)  <P>Between 1982 and 2001 the numbers of public hospital beds available for the mentally ill decreased by 69%.  <P>Oscar Morgan, a senior consultant at the National Mental Health Association (NMHA) and a former mental commissioner for the state of Maryland, said it was a major issue for the prison service.  <P>"It is acknowledged now that many people in the prison system could, with proper treatment, be elsewhere. The question is how to move them out and how to prevent them from going in the first place. One of the issues is who is responsible for their care and treatment."  <P>A few states are experimenting with mental health courts to deal with such cases. But the NMHA is skeptical about the idea, because it carries the risk of further criminalizing people with mental illness. And lobbyists for the rights of mental patients say they are worried that such courts could insist on coercive treatment.  

<P>In Memphis, Tennessee, the police have begun working with mental health professionals when someone clearly mentally ill is arrested.  <P>Mr Morgan said some mentally ill people spent years inside for minor offences because they did not know how to contact lawyers or explain their cases. There were various projects pioneered by states or individual communities to deal with the crisis but no coordinated national strategy.  <P>Seriously ill patients complain that they are often unable to get the medication they need.  <P>"I had a woman on the phone today whose fiance is bipolar &#91;manic-depressive&#93; and who is in a facility in Florida where they won't give him the medication he needs but have given him Prozac instead, which is completely inappropriate," Kara Gotsch of the American Civil Liberties Union's national prison project said.   <P>The woman had protested, but had then desisted because the prison authorities were retaliating against her fiance.  <P>"Now she is at a loss what to do."  <P>Ms Gotsch said that high security prisons - supermaxes - were now being used as a dumping ground for people with serious mental problems.  <P>"There are now large numbers of the mentally ill in solitary confinement," she said. "They spend 23 hours out of 24 in their cell."  <P>The ACLU is taking legal action on behalf of mentally ill prisoners.  <P>Last year it won a case in Little Rock, Arkansas, where a federal judge ruled that the state had violated the rights of mentally ill inmates by leaving them in jail and denying them court-ordered evaluation and treatment.</p>
