<p>The government's carefully co-ordinated propaganda offensive took an embarrassing hit tonight after Downing Street was accused of plagiarism.



<p>





The target is an intelligence dossier released on Monday and heralded by none other than Colin Powell at the UN yesterday. <p></p> Channel Four News has learnt that the bulk of the nineteen page document was copied from three different articles - one written by a graduate student.<p></p>

</table>On Monday,  the day before the US Secretary of State, Colin Powell addressed the UN,  Downing Street published its latest paper on Iraq.<p></p>

It gives the impression of being an up to the minute intelligence-based analysis - and Mr Powell was fulsome in his praise.<p></p>



Published on the Number 10 web site, called  "Iraq - Its Infrastructure of Concealment Deception and Intimidation",  it outlines the structure of Saddam's intelligence organizations.

<p></p> But it made familiar reading to  Cambridge academic Glen Ranwala.  It was copied from an article last September in a small journal: the <a href="http://meria.idc.ac.il/journal/2002/issue3/jv6n3a1.html" class="txtBlueBold" target="_new">Middle East Review of International Affairs.</a><p></p>



It's author, Ibrahim al-Marashi, a postgraduate student from Monterey in California.

Large sections do indeed appear, verbatim.<p></p>





A section, for example, six paragraphs long, on Saddam's Special Security Organization,



the exact same words are in the Californian student's paper.

<p></p>



In several places Downing Street edits the originals to make more sinister reading.<p></p>



Number 10 says the Mukhabarat - the main intelligence agency - is "spying on foreign embassies in Iraq". 

</p><p>

The original reads: "monitoring foreign embassies in Iraq."<p></p>



And the provocative role of

"supporting terrorist organizations. in hostile regimes" has a weaker, political context in the original:

"aiding opposition groups in hostile regimes."<p></p>



Even typographic mistakes in the original articles are repeated.<p></p>



Of military intelligence, al-Marashi writes in his original paper:

</p><p>

"The head of military intelligence generally did not have to be a relative of Saddam's immediate family, nor a Tikriti.  Saddam appointed, Sabir Abd Al-Aziz Al-Duri as head..."

Note the comma after appointed.<p></p>



Downing Street paraphrases the first sentence:



"Saddam appointed, Sabir 'Abd al-'Aziz al-Duri as head during the 1991 Gulf War."

</p><p>

This second line is cut and pasted, complete with the same grammatical error.

Plagiarism is regarded as intellectual theft.<p></p>

<p><b><font size="3">Sample text</font></b></p>

<p>

<b>Government dossier: (page 13), published Jan 2003 </b>

</p><p> 

"Saddam appointed, Sabir 'Abd al-'Aziz al-Duri as head during the 1991 Gulf War. After the Gulf War he was replaced by Wafiq Jasim al-Samarrai. 

</p><p>

After Samarrai, Muhammad Nimah al-Tikriti  headed Al-Istikhbarat al-Askariyya in early 1992 then in late 1992 Fanar Zibin Hassan al-Tikriti was appointed to this post.  

</p><p> 

These shifting appointments are part of Saddam's policy of balancing security positions. By constantly shifting the directors of these agencies, no one can establish a base in a security organisation for a substantial period of time. No one becomes powerful enough to challenge the President." 

</p><p> 



<b>al-Marashi document: (section: "MILITARY INTELLIGENCE", published sept 2002 - relevant parts have been underlined</b>

</p><p> 

<u>Saddam appointed, Sabir ‘Abd al-‘Aziz al-Duri(80) as head</u> of Military Intelligence <u>during the 1991 Gulf War.</u>(81) <u>After the Gulf War he was replaced by Wafiq Jasim al-Samarrai</u>.(82) 

</p><p> 

<u>After Samarrai, Muhammad Nimah al-Tikriti(83) headed Military Intelligence in early 1992(</u>84) <u>then in late 1992 Fanar Zibin Hassan al-Tikriti was appointed to this post.</u>(85) While Fanar is from Tikrit, both Sabir al-Duri and Samarrai are non-Tikriti Sunni Muslims, as their last names suggest. 

</p><p>

Another source indicates that Samarrai was replaced by Khalid Salih al-Juburi,(86) demonstrating how another non-Tikriti, but from the tribal alliance that traditionally support the regime holds top security positions in Iraq.(87)

</p><p> 

<u>These shifting appointments are part of Saddam’s policy of balancing security positions</u> between Tikritis and non-Tikritis, in the belief that the two factions would not unite to overthrow him. Not only that, but <u>by constantly shifting the directors of these agencies, no one can establish a base in a security organization for a substantial period of time, that would challenge the President.</u>(88)</p>
