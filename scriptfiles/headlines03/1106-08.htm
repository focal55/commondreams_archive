<p>WASHINGTON  -- A former president and powerful police and military higher-ups could be brought to justice as a result of an unprecedented decision by Mexico's Supreme Court Wednesday giving a green light to prosecution of the perpetrators of the "disappearance" of a political activist in 1975. 
<p>
 The decision marks a "major victory for accountability," according to New York-based Human Rights (HRW). which said the ruling could well lead to the prosecution of former officials responsible for the kidnapping and death of hundreds of people during the 1960s and 1970s.
 <p>
 "This is a landmark ruling for accountability in Mexico," said Jose Miguel Vivanco, executive director of HRW's Americas division here, while other activists described it as a sign that the rule of law--long ignored by Mexico's powerful politicians and economic elite--was taking hold.
 
<p>
 It also marked a signal victory for the Special Prosecutor's Office created by President Vincente Fox  in November 2001, which has spent two years investigating the so-called "dirty war" waged by federal and state authorities against suspected leftists.
 <p>
 The case on which the Court ruled involves the disappearance of Jesus Piedra Ibarra, the alleged leader of a guerrilla group called Liga 23 de Septiembre. He was allegedly abducted by police and intelligence agencies in Monterrey in 1975, but his body was never found. 
 <p>
 Piedra's was one of hundreds investigated by the Mexican Human Rights Commission and covered in a report published in 2001. According to the report, Piedra was arrested, tortured, and imprisoned secretly at a military camp in Mexico City at least until 1984, when he was last reported alive. Reports such as this led to the creation of the Special Prosecutor's Office. 
 <p>
 Since its establishment the Office has investigated hundreds of similar cases, but it was not until earlier this year that it applied for arrest warrants in specific cases, including Piedra's. The Office had asked specifically for warrants for two former chiefs of Mexico's secret police, the Federal Security Directorate, Luis de la Barreda Moreno and Miguel Nazar Haro.
 <p>
 Last March, however, the Office ran into a major procedural roadblock when a federal court refused to issue the warrants on the grounds that the statute of limitations covering the crimes for which the warrants were issued had expired.
 <p>
 The Office appealed to the Supreme Court, which decided last month to hear the case.
 <p>
 Adopting an argument that has proven particularly successful with the courts in Chile, Special Prosecutor Ignacio Carrillo Prieto contended that the statute of limitations on abduction does not begin to run if the victim's body remains missing.
 <p>
 By a unanimous vote, the Court accepted this reasoning and ordered the lower court to issue the warrants.
 <p>
 "This is extraordinarily important," said Sergio Aguayo, a human rights activist, told the <i>New York Times</i> Wednesday after the ruling. "It's a blow against impunity, one of the great cancers in our country."
 <p>
 The Human Rights Commission documented 531 cases in which political activists were arrested or abducted and never accounted for. 
 <p>
 Last July, HRW issued a report, "Justice in Jeopardy," documenting the ways in which Carrillo Prieto's work has been undermined by a lack of resources, limited access to important documents, and the failure by the military to cooperate.
 <p>
 Former President Luis Echeverria, who, as interior minister in the 1960s controlled the secret police, could be investigated and possibly prosecuted. He has been questioned by the Special Prosecutor but has refused to testify.
 
<p>
 Echeverria was also interior minister during the notorious massacre of scores of student demonstrators in Mexico City just before the Olympic Games  in 1968, another case falling under the Special's Prosecutor's brief.
 <p>
 Piedra's mother stressed to reporters after the ruling Wednesday that she was still waiting for the actual prosecution. "We don't need symbolism," she said. "We want total justice for the authors of state terrorism."
