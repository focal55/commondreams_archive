<p>WASHINGTON, June 11 &#0151; The House is poised to pass a bill that would give corporate lobbyists one of their most sought-after goals on Capitol Hill: a sweeping rewrite of the rules governing class-action lawsuits.</p>

</table>Business groups, which have been pushing for the legislation for years, want to force many large class-action suits into federal courts and out of the state courts favored by plaintiffs' lawyers. A broad array of industry groups that have been socked by big class-action lawsuits, including health insurance companies and life insurers, argue that the system is being abused by lawyers who increasingly file major cases in a few out-of-the-way jurisdictions that have sympathetic judges and juries.<p></p>
<P> Trial lawyers, as well as some environmental and consumer groups, contend the proposals would weaken a tool for protecting the interests of consumers, and they argue that companies want the legislation so they can push big cases into courts that tend to be friendlier to corporate defendants.</p>
<P> The real battle over the bill is in the Senate, where many Democrats have ties to the powerful trial lawyers' lobby. But backers of the legislation are more optimistic than in years past, saying they are only a few votes short of obtaining the 60 needed to force a vote on the Senate floor, a tally that partly reflects Republican gains in elections last year.</p>
<P> The House, which has approved similar legislation before, is scheduled to vote on Thursday. Because the legislation applies retroactively to many lawsuits and also includes a provision granting mandatory appeals of class-action certification rulings, the bill could cause delays in pending federal-court cases that seek to recover money lost through the corporate scandals at <org idsrc="other-OTC" value="ENRNQ"><alt-code idsrc="other-OTC" value="Enron Corporation"/>Enron</org> and other large companies.</p>
<P> The legislation is also promoted as a remedy for what critics on both sides describe as collusive settlements between lawyers and companies. In these pacts, the lawyers get big fees, but only a few dollars or worthless coupons are provided to each plaintiff. At the same time, the settlements allow corporate defendants to wipe out liabilities they face for fraud, defective products and other claims. </p>
<P> But whether this legislation will curb collusive settlements has become a hotly contested point. Business groups say the provisions they favor will subject settlements to new scrutiny, but critics call the provisions weak and say that lobbyists are resisting a more serious repair to the problem because corporations want to continue using coupons in settlements.</p>
<P> The lobbying has been spearheaded by groups including the United States Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers, aided by lobbyists for trade groups and individual companies. The trial lawyers' team includes lobbyists from the Washington firm Patton Boggs. According to <a href="http://www.citizen.org/congress/civjus/class_action/articles.cfm?ID=9846" target="_new">a new study by Public Citizen</a>, the group founded by Ralph Nader, nearly 500 lobbyists have been registered to promote class-action legislation since 2000.</p>
<P> "Just about every industry group is on the bandwagon on this because every industry is affected," said Lawrence Fineran, the vice president for regulatory and competition policy at the National Association of Manufacturers. For the business community, the bill is the most significant lawsuit-related legislation since Congress overrode President Bill Clinton's 1995 veto of a bill to limit private lawsuits for securities fraud. "It's the biggest thing in years," Mr. Fineran said.</p>
<P> A spokeswoman for Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, the chief Senate sponsor, said 57 senators had committed themselves to back the bill. But a spokeswoman for Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader, said that number was high but declined to say what it seemed to be.</p>
<P> Class-action suits allow individual plaintiffs to sue on behalf of wide numbers of others who may have been subject to the same frauds or injuries. Successful suits, or even those that have merely won class-action certification, can make an industry tremble. </p>
<P> The life insurance industry, for example, has agreed to pay billions of dollars to settle class-action suits in recent years on claims of deceptive sales practices. And the H.M.O. industry, which is also lobbying hard for the bill, faces a class-action lawsuit in federal District Court in Miami saying payments were intentionally delayed and denied to 700,000 doctors. One big health insurer, <org idsrc="NYSE" value="AET"><alt-code idsrc="NYSE" value="Aetna Incorporated"/>Aetna</org>, agreed last month to settle its part of the case for $170 million.</p>
<P> Business groups say the bill is needed to prevent abuses in places like Madison County, Ill., where scores of class action cases have recently been filed. In March, a state-court judge in Madison County awarded class-action plaintiffs $12 billion against <org idsrc="NYSE" value="MO"><alt-code idsrc="NYSE" value="Altria Group"/>Philip Morris</org>, a subsidiary of the Altria group, after finding that the cigarette maker failed to inform customers that its "light" cigarettes were no less harmful than its full-tar cigarettes.</p>
<P> "In many jurisdictions, these judges are elected by the several thousand people who reside in the community, but that person has got no accountability to anybody outside of that court," said John Beisner, who is head of the class-action practice at O'Melveny &#0038; Myers and is helping orchestrate the business community's push for the legislation.</p>
<P> Representative Rick Boucher, a Virginia Democrat who is a co-sponsor of the House bill, said, "In a handful of courts around the country, the will of the lawyer filing the case is almost always done."</p>
<P> But many Democrats and advocacy groups say the bill would make it easier for corporations to delay and defeat cases that would have succeeded in state court.</p>
<P> Carlton Carl, a spokesman for the Association of Trial Lawyers of America, said, "This is fundamentally a court-shopping bill for defendants."</p>
<P> Groups who object to the industry-backed bills include the American Lung Association, the American Heart Association, the Consumer Federation of America and the Sierra Club. In a letter to Senator Orrin G. Hatch, the Utah Republican who is chairman of the Judiciary Committee, they and other groups said the bill would "make it more difficult to successfully litigate class actions and other types of lawsuits, and it would further clog the federal courts."</p>
<P> Also opposing the bill are Eliot Spitzer and Drew Edmondson, the attorneys general of New York and Oklahoma, respectively, who authored a letter to House leaders on behalf of themselves and eight other state attorneys general.</p>
<P> The House bill would require most class-action suits for more than $2 million to be heard in federal court &#0151; unless the "substantial majority" of the plaintiffs are from the same state as the principal defendants. The Senate bill raises the threshold to $5 million and would keep cases in state court if at least two-thirds of the plaintiffs &#0151; and in a limited set of cases as few as one-third &#0151; are from the same state as the main defendants.</p>
<P> An alternative proposal expected to be introduced by Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, would set the threshold at $15 million. But in a provision that has alarmed business groups, it would also require that cases in which the defendants have "significant contacts" with the state could not be forced into federal court. Business groups assert that that provision would preclude any large corporation from removing cases to federal court. Aides to Mr. Leahy, however, say the provision is far less broad.</p>
<P> As for lawyers' fees, the bills would require judges to make written findings that coupon settlements are "fair, reasonable and adequate." But critics say that language will do little to change the system. Mr. Leahy's proposal includes the "fair, reasonable and adequate" standard but also creates a new mechanism in coupon settlements that calls for lawyers to be paid in proportion to the dollar amount of coupons redeemed.</p>
<P> Business lobbyists say the Leahy provision contains loopholes. But the advocacy groups say corporations do not like the coupon mechanism because they want to preserve coupon settlements as a way to buy their way out of liability problems cheaply.</p>
<P> "The bill is a fraud in that it claims to end abusive coupon class-action settlements, but it does nothing of the kind," said Frank Clemente of Public Citizen, the liberal group. "This is a smokescreen for changing the law to the advantage of defendants."</p>
