</table></font>"The American threats are not new. They have threatened us since the beginning of the Islamic revolution," Khamenei said in a speech to mark the 14th anniversary of the death of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founding father of the Islamic Republic.

<p>"They know that militarily attacking Iran and the Iranian nation would mean suicide for the aggressor," he told thousands of Iranians gathered at Khomeini's vast mausoleum on the southwestern outskirts of Tehran.

<p>"In their global propaganda they're attacking Iran and saying Iran is supporting terrorists. This is a shameless lie," Khamenei said.

<p>Washington has hardened its accusations against Iran in recent weeks. U.S. officials say they believe Iran is offering a haven for senior al Qaeda members, seeking nuclear weapons and interfering in post-war Iraq. Iran denies the charges.

<p>Some Pentagon hawks are said to be pushing for Washington to adopt a much tougher line against Iran, including backing efforts to destabilize its clerical establishment.

<p>But Khamenei, who succeeded Khomeini in 1989 and has the last word on state affairs, said Washington would not dare to attack Iran.

<p>The crowd interrupted his speech with chants of "Death to America" and "We are ready to sacrifice our lives for the leader."

<p>SHAMELESS LIE

<p>Iranian officials say they have caught and deported around 500 members of what it calls the "perverted and fanatic" al Qaeda group in the past year and is currently interrogating another batch of suspects.

<p>Khamenei said U.S. calls for greater democracy in Iran was "one of the world's biggest jokes." Unlike many other countries in the Islamic world, Iranian public officials are either directly or indirectly elected, he said.

<p>"(The Americans) deal with apostate dictatorships and governments who came to power through coups because they obey them but they criticize the Islamic Republic because it does not want to accept their dominance," he said.

<p>He said Washington was acting as badly as deposed Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein by not allowing the Iraqis to choose their own government.

<p>"What's the difference between Saddam and you? He was an apostate dictator and you are the same. You are pushing the Iraqi nation step by step to confront you," he said.

<p>U.S. and British officials have warned Iran not to interfere in the post-Saddam power vacuum by exploiting its influence with Iraq's Shi'ite Muslim majority.

<p>"They say they are worried about Iran's interference in Iraq. Well we are worried about your presence in Iraq," Khamenei said.
