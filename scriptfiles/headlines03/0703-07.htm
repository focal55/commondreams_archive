<p>WASHINGTON   - President Bush has used colorful  language before to great effect, but he is taking some heat for  his "Bring them on" challenge to Iraqi militants attacking U.S.  forces, who he said were tough enough to take it.<P>

BUSH AT WHITE HOUSE: 'BRING THEM ON'<br>

</table></font>Even some aides winced at Bush's words, which Democrats  pounced on as an invitation to Iraqi militants to fire on U.S.  troops already the subject of hit-and-run attacks by Saddam  Hussein loyalists and others.<P>
"These men and women are risking their lives every day, and  the president who sent them on this mission showed tremendous  insensitivity to the dangers they face," said Democratic  presidential candidate Howard Dean.<P>
Another Democratic presidential candidate, Massachusetts  Sen. John Kerry, said condemned the comment, saying, "The  deteriorating situation in Iraq requires less swagger and more  thoughtfulness and statesmanship."<P>
White House spokesman Ari Fleischer dismissed the criticism  and said Bush viewed his comment as a way to express confidence  in U.S. troops.<P>
"I think the men and women of the military are appreciative  of the fact that they know they have a president who supports  them as strongly as he does, and who has as much faith in their  ability to complete the mission, despite some of the  second-guessing that this president has," Fleischer said.<P>
Bush, a proud Texan with a penchant for plain talk, told  reporters on Wednesday: "There are some who feel like that  conditions are such that they can attack us there. My answer  is: Bring them on. We have the force necessary to deal with the  situation."<P>
'DEAD OR ALIVE'<P>
In the days after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks he said the  United States wanted al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden "dead or  alive" and vowed to "smoke" them out of their holes.<P>
University of Texas political scientist Bruce Buchanan, a  longtime Bush watcher, said Bush uses such language when under  strain, and that he is likely feeling the heat of criticism  about the lagging post-war effort in Iraq.<P>
He called the remark an unfortunate choice of words because  it sounded belligerent.<P>
"I think that when he feels up against it, as he did at the  time of the 9/11 attacks, or when he does when coming under  criticism now, he has a tendency to strike back verbally, and I  think that's what you're seeing there. He's not choosing his  words diplomatically at those moments because he's not feeling  particularly diplomatic," Buchanan said.<P>
At least 25 U.S. and six British troops have been killed by  hostile fire since Bush declared major combat in Iraq to be  over on May 1.<P>
Brookings Institution presidential scholar Stephen Hess  said many Americans like what they hear from the president,  calling his words reminiscent of his defiant stance against the  Sept. 11, 2001 attacks when he stood in the rubble of the World  Trade Center towers and vowed to fight back.<P>
"My observation is he's saying exactly what the American  people want him to say, and saying it even in a way that they  would want him to say it," Hess said.
<P>
He added: "Obviously we're going into a presidential  election era and one expects the opposition to oppose. That's  their job. But the sort of response that somehow he was  inviting the enemy to attack us I think is more than a  stretch."
