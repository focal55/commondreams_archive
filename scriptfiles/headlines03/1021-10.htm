<p>PHILADELPHIA  - The landmark system for financing presidential campaigns, enacted by Washington reformers 29 years ago to curb the power of private money, is teetering on the verge of collapse.</p>
<p>Republican George W. Bush dealt the first major blow in the 2000 campaign, when he declined to play by the rules that all candidates had voluntarily obeyed since 1976. He refused to accept public money for his nomination drive, and to cap his spending, as the guidelines would have required. Instead, he "opted out," citing his desire for "strategic flexibility," bankrolling his bid with private money and spending as much as he wanted.</p>
<p>It now appears the next major blow is imminent.</p>
<p>Prominent Democrats, including national chairman Terry McAuliffe, now believe that staying within the system could cripple their bid to eject President Bush in 2004. They question the wisdom of voluntarily capping their own expenditures when Bush, in his second privatized campaign, has no intention - or requirement - of doing so.</p>
<p>That's why Democratic contender Howard Dean may soon decide to spurn public financing in 2004 - despite his original promise, uttered in March and repeated in June, to respect the historic reforms that were sponsored primarily by Democrats in the aftermath of Richard Nixon's Watergate scandal in the 1970s. If Dean opts out, rival John Kerry says he may do the same.</p>
<p>With Bush already opting out for the second time, any major Democratic defection would essentially signal a bipartisan renunciation of the system.</p>
<p>Larry Noble, a campaign-finance watchdog and ex-federal elections official, said: "That would leave the public-financing system in serious trouble. If Democrats opt out, then why participate in the system at all?"</p>
<p>This system has governed presidential campaigns during the post-Watergate era. The reforms were designed to curb special-interest clout in presidential races - that's why the government matches the first $250 of each donation raised from individuals - and put a ceiling on spending. Reformers fear that, if major candidates in both parties say no to public financing, all financial restraints would be gone. The price tag for candidacies would rise exponentially - along with the clout of well-heeled private donors.</p>
<p>Officially, Dean is keeping his options open. Campaign manager Joe Trippi said the other day that the decision whether to become the first Democratic dropout would be made "at the appropriate time," late this year.</p>
<p>But national party sources said privately that Dean aides see strong reasons for opting out, and that they are sharing their thoughts with Democrats outside the Dean campaign.</p>
<p>They also sent a strong public signal the other day. Dean's people in North Carolina started collecting petition signatures to put Dean on that state's primary ballot. Any candidate who accepts public money is listed automatically on the ballot; only those who spurn public money are required to gather signatures.</p>
<p>Dean strategists now think they may stand a better chance of winning the nomination, and beating Bush, if they run a privatized campaign.</p>
<p>In the end, it may be a choice between principle (respecting the post-Watergate reforms) and pragmatism (doing whatever it takes to win, even if it means paying a political price for breaking a campaign promise).</p>
<p>Dean has already raised $25 million this year, mostly from small donations - a record amount for an insurgent candidate, and tops in the Democratic field. So Dean strategists question whether it's wise to rein in their own financial prowess and accept the public money - a maximum of $18 million, "matched" against a share of Dean's small donations.</p>
<p>And here's the big hitch: Any Democrat who takes public money must agree to spend no more than $45 million between January and the party convention in August. By contrast, Bush, financed entirely by private donors, will probably have $200 million to spend as he pleases.</p>
<p>So, next spring, when the publicly financed Democratic nominee emerges victorious from the primaries, having spent most of his money, Bush will be poised to rule the airwaves for months - defining the issues, touting himself, and assailing the Democrats.</p>
<p>Trippi raised the issue by phone the other day. Assuming that his candidate triumphs in the primaries, he said that Dean wanted "the opportunity to compete directly with (Bush strategist) Karl Rove and the Bush-Cheney campaign from April to August." It could happen if Dean's private donors - 232,248 and climbing - continue to write checks, and if new donors join up when other candidates quit the race.</p>
<p>Result: a private war chest that could trump Uncle Sam's money.</p>
<p>Yet Dean himself was singing the opposite tune earlier this year. In March, he vowed to rebuke any rival who decided to skip public financing, saying: "It will be a huge issue. I think most Democrats believe in campaign finance reform." Then, on June 7, he signed a letter to the Federal Election Commission, declaring himself "a candidate seeking to become eligible to receive Presidential primary … funds."</p>
<p>So the debate today is whether Dean could pay a price for flip-flopping on the issue.</p>
<p>Some Democrats say yes.</p>
<p>Jenny Backus, a Washington strategist who is not affiliated with any candidate, said: "The risk for Dean is that, by opting out, he takes the shine off his image as a nonpolitical straight-shooter. … What happens if his true believers start to doubt him?"</p>
<p>But some Democrats say that the hunger to defeat Bush trumps all other considerations.</p>
<p>Anita Dunn, another party strategist who is neutral, said: "If Dean was to say, `I'm not going to take public financing and leave us defenseless,' a lot of Democrats would say, `Yeah, you go for it.' "</p>
<p>She also said that since a privatized Dean campaign would be fueled by a mass outpouring of small donations - 54 percent of his money has come from donations of $200 or less - Dean's people could plausibly argue that he was still a reformer in spirit.</p>
<p>Trippi, the Dean campaign manager, contended the other day that if Dean spurns the public money and relies instead on his private givers, "we'd be doing it in the spirit of campaign finance reform."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, those who support public financing are eager to fix the system and ensure that future candidates won't have to face this dilemma, and won't be so tempted to privatize.</p>
<p>Among reformers, the biggest goal is to sweeten the pot - to double the amount of public money, and to raise the spending ceiling. But Norman Ornstein, a nonpartisan Washington analyst who is pushing these reforms on Capitol Hill, doubts that Congress will act anytime soon. He said: "I've been working with the usual suspects."</p>
<p>But Republicans aren't interested, because Bush doesn't need the system, and they don't want to do anything that could help Democrats - even though, in the future, they may not have a candidate who can rake in private bucks like Bush does.</p>
<p>"So, since the current system is broken, Dean should opt out. I think he has to. For him, it's a slam dunk."</p>
