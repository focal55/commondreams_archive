<p>ISLAMABAD - Pakistan on Saturday strongly refuted  U.S. claims that American troops had the right to enter  Pakistan territory in pursuit of suspected al Qaeda and Taliban  fighters crossing from Afghanistan.<p>



		A U.S. warplane dropped a large bomb on disputed land near  the Afghan-Pakistan frontier last weekend after a man dressed  as a Pakistani border guard opened fire on U.S. troops inside  Afghanistan, wounding one.<p>

</table></font>The U.S. military in Afghanistan said on Friday that it had  the right to cross into Pakistan in pursuit of suspected al  Qaeda and Taliban fugitives, adding that Pakistan had been  aware of the "long-standing policy."<p>



		But Pakistan Foreign Minister Mian Khursheed Mehmood Kasuri  said on Saturday: "Operations within Pakistani territory would  be conducted solely and exclusively by our own forces and in  response to decisions taken by Pakistan.<p>



		"Our forces are fully capable of securing and protecting  Pakistan's borders," he added, reading from a prepared  statement.<p>



		According to Kasuri, Secretary of State Colin Powell and  Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf spoke about the incident by  telephone on Friday and agreed it may have been due to a  "misunderstanding at the operational level on the ground."<p>



		"They reiterated the need to further strengthen  coordination to ensure that such incidents do not happen in  future," he said.<p>



		Kasuri also underlined Pakistan's support for the "global  coalition against terrorism" and pointed to Washington's  appreciation of Islamabad's decision to back U.S. military  action in Afghanistan and its hunt for terrorists in Pakistan.<p>



		RED FACES, GRAY AREAS<p>



		But the incident has become a diplomatic headache both for  Washington and one of its key allies in the war on terror, and  has fueled already strong anti-U.S. sentiment in Pakistan.<p>



		Hardline Islamic parties who tapped that sentiment to make  huge electoral gains in October seized on the clash as a case  of Pakistan ceding sovereignty to the world's only superpower.<p>



		They mobilized thousands of people to march through major  cities on Saturday to protest against U.S. military operations  in the region and a possible attack on Iraq.<p>



		The U.S. military said it had never exercised its "right"  to cross into Pakistan, and that the bomb its warplane dropped  on a religious seminary in the town of Angor Adda following  Sunday's clash had landed on Afghan, not Pakistan territory.<p>



		Pakistani officials refuted that claim, although  presidential spokesman Major-General Rashid Qureshi told state  television that there were "ambiguous" areas along the porous  border drawn up by the British in 1893.<p>



		Musharraf threw his weight behind the U.S. military  campaign in Afghanistan and has allowed a handful of U.S.  intelligence agents to operate in Pakistan.<p>



		Pakistan has 60-70,000 troops along its Afghan frontier to  help stop al Qaeda and Taliban members escaping the huge  U.S.-led manhunt in Afghanistan.<p>



		But sympathy for the fugitives is strong among ethnic  Pashtuns who live on both sides of the border.<p>



		The United States has expressed frustration at the apparent  ease with which many suspected militants have managed to cross  from Afghanistan into Pakistan.<p align="center">&copy; 2003 Reuters Limited</p>
