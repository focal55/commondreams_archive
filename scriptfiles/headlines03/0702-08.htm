<p>WASHINGTON  - U.S. President George W. Bush on Wednesday challenged militants who have been killing and injuring U.S. forces in Iraq, saying "bring them on" because American forces were tough enough to deal with their attacks.

</table></font>"There are some who feel like that conditions are such that they can attack us there," Bush told reporters at the White House. "My answer is 'bring them on'. We have the force necessary to deal with the situation."

<p>Bush spoke in the face of increasing American concern about the rising casualty toll among U.S. troops. At least 23 American servicemen have been killed by hostile fire since major combat operations were declared over for the U.S. forces and their British allies on May 1.

<p>Bush, who on Tuesday said the United States faced a massive and long-term undertaking in Iraq, said the United States welcomed contributions from other countries but that "we got plenty tough force there right now to make sure the situation is secure.

<p>"We always welcome help. We're always glad to include others in. But make no mistake about it, and the enemy shouldn't make any mistake about it, we will deal with them harshly if they continue to try to bring harm to the Iraqi people," he said.

<p>He condemned militant attacks on electricity lines and other Iraqi infrastructure and vowed to deal harshly with those responsible.
