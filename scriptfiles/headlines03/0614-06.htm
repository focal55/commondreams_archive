<p>The left-leaning advocacy group Moveon.org will hold its first online presidential primary later this month, a contest that could have a significant impact if any of the nine Democratic presidential candidates is able to seize the group's endorsement. </p>
    <p>The group will endorse, direct volunteers and raise money -- including holding an "urgent" fundraiser in time for the Federal Election Commission's June 30 deadline -- for whomever is able to win at least 50 percent of its members' votes. If none of the candidates reaches that threshold -- and it may be difficult, given the size of the field  --  the group will put off announcing its endorsement until  this summer. </p>
    <p>It is an unusually early contest; most outside groups wait for a front-runner to emerge before even considering announcing their preferences.</p>
    <p>"Ordinary people, at the grass roots, often stand back until a lot of this is decided -- and it doesn't make a lot of sense," said Wes Boyd, the group's president, explaining its decision. "Why not play as much as the folks who attend the rubber chicken dinners play?"</p>
    <p>The group counts 1.4 million members nationwide, and will vote based, in part, on the candidates' responses to a questionnaire it distributed this week. It asked the candidates seven questions, including whether they would seek repeal of the Patriot Act, if they support progressive environmental policies and how they would stand up to the "unhealthy" policies of the Bush administration. The responses to the questions, due next week, will be posted on the organization's Web site. </p>
    <p>Michael Cornfield, a political scientist at George Washington University, said the group's endorsement could be a boon, especially for the party's more liberal candidates. He estimated the group raised $2.4 million during the 2000 election, when its membership was about one-third  its current size. He said the group  now might raise more than $10 million. </p>
    <p>"This could put [Howard] Dean or [Rep. Dennis] Kucinich even with [Sen. John] Edwards in one fell swoop," Cornfield said. "I would say that's fairly significant -- if it happens."</p>
