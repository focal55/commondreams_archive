<p>Will Chavarin didn't become an Oakland school teacher for the pay.
<P>He certainly didn't come to Oakland so he could see firsthand what 
bankruptcy and a state takeover looks like.

</table></font>Chavarin came to Lowell Middle School because teaching is the only job he's 
ever had that "gives me the chills."
<P>He never thought when he started last fall that the bad economy would erase 
his job. But his mother found his layoff notice in the mail on Thursday.
<P>"I'm trying to cry; they say men don't cry, but if I cry, then I won't hit 
the wall," he said, moments after opening the letter, which began: "It is with 
sincere regret that I am writing to inform you . . . your services will not be 
required for the 2003-2004 school year."
<P>Layoff notices are landing in thousands of California teachers' mailboxes 
this week as districts brace for millions in state cuts.
<P>The ax is falling even harder in Oakland, which ran up the highest school 
district deficit in California history and is now awaiting a $100 million 
state bailout and takeover.
<P>"I don't want to teach anywhere else. I feel that if I left Oakland, I 
would be turning my back on my community," said Chavarin, a recent graduate of 
Cal State Monterey Bay.
<P>In urban school districts like Oakland, where 75 percent of students read 
below the national average and the four-year dropout rate reaches 80 percent 
at some high schools, Chavarin is exactly the kind of newcomer principals 
don't want to lose.
<P>Nationwide, 1 in 4 teachers is male -- and just 13 percent of the teachers 
are ethnic or racial minorities, while about one-third of the students are 
minorities.
<P>Young, educated and dedicated, 27-year-old Chavarin returned with his wife 
and three children to West Oakland where he grew up, to give his friends' and 
neighbors' kids a chance to make it to college.
<P><b>LIKE AN UNCLE</b>
<P>"I know their parents -- I can call them when Johnny is starting to mess up,
" said Chavarin, who walks one block to work every day. "I can be that uncle 
who watches out for them."
<P>A second-generation Oakland schools graduate, Chavarin guided the sixth-
graders to a championship basketball season in his first year as their coach. 
He stays after school four days a week to help in the tutoring center. He 
volunteered to be a Saturday school teacher for struggling students.
<P>When Chavarin walks the halls, young boys run up to him, jockeying for a 
chance to slap his hand and say, "What's up, Mr. Chevron?"
<P>He's planning a trip to Marine World, took the basketball team to a Golden 
State Warriors game and acted as chaperone when one boy's essay skills won him 
two tickets to see the Oakland Raiders.
<P>"I'm raising my hand for everything -- I figure the more I do, the faster I 
learn in my first year and the quicker I become a better teacher," he said.
<P>One night a week he goes to Cal State Hayward for a five-hour teaching 
class. He's three months away from earning his full teaching credential.
<P>"I was optimistic -- I figured I'd stay because I brought so much to the 
table," he said.
<P>Oakland district leaders have trimmed 176 full-time teachers, counselors 
and psychologists, plus 260 support staff, to try to whittle a projected $64 
million deficit for the coming school year. That's on top of a combined $82 
million deficit for the current and past fiscal years.
<P>Experts called in to sort out the district's finances say the deficit 
accumulated because the district failed to adjust to declines in enrollment, a 
24 percent salary raise for teachers and the addition of several hundred new 
hires to the teacher pool.
<P>Gov. Gray Davis is expected to sign the $100 million bailout bill this 
month, which will also strip the Oakland school board of its voting powers and 
require state schools chief Jack O'Connell to install a state administrator to 
run the district until the loan is repaid.

</table></font>Chavarin hopes the new administrator will recognize and rehire energetic 
teachers like himself. In the meantime, he'll have to roll up his world 
history maps and look for a new place to hang them.
<P>"I've been applying to other school districts, but it's hard because 
everyone is laying off teachers," Chavarin said.
<P>He might work for a charter school, which manages its budget independently 
of the district. If plan B fails, plan C is to get a job from a relative as a 
janitor or a carpet installer.
<P>"My family is my world, and they have to eat," he said.
<P>His students knew he might get laid off, and they are worried now. Several 
of his first- and second-period students rank Chavarin as their favorite.
<P>"He, like, makes us laugh, and makes the work seem fun," said Champagne 
Zedd. "But he stops us from goofing off," added Vincent Harris.
<P>Chavarin's goof-off quelling skills were put to the test -- literally -- 
last week while a Cal State Hayward supervisor was observing his classroom.
<P>A student from the playground jumped into an open window of his class to 
taunt the students, prompting one of his pupils to yell, "Get back, ugly butt!
" in return.
<P>"Now both of you are being disruptive," he said, silencing the girl.
<P><b>IN CONTROL</b>
<P>Within minutes, he refocused the class on the task of writing a persuasive 
essay. The class groaned until he asked them to write about subjects close to 
their heart, such as why they shouldn't have to do homework, and why they 
should have a two-hour lunch.
<P>Chavarin specifically sought a job at a middle school, and the trade-off of 
working with hormonal preteens, he said, is the chance to steer them onto the 
right path before they decide they know all life's answers.
<P>Two days before he was laid off, two of Chavarin's uncles who were in town 
on a job laying carpet stopped by to check out his classroom.
<P>One examined the decor, taking a close look at a poster of George 
Washington Carver hanging next to a student drawing of the late rap artist 
Tupac Shakur.
<P>"This is cool, man," he said.
<P>Not knowing his fate, Chavarin smiled with pride.
