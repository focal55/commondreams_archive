<p>PHILADELPHIA - Betsey Means has spent the last year or so donning long black dresses and transforming herself from a 48-year-old contemporary woman into Mother Jones, the activist who famously allied herself with America's industrial laborers a century ago.</p>

</table></font>Means, a Chicago-based actress, is taking her act East this month in commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the "March of the Mill Children," a protest that took Jones and a group of children and adult textile mill workers from Philadelphia to Oyster Bay, N.Y., to draw attention to laborers' working conditions.</p>
    <p>Mary Harris Jones arrived in late July 1903 at the Long Island summer home of President Theodore Roosevelt, where she intended to lobby for a federal law "prohibiting the exploitation of childhood." Though Roosevelt refused to see her, Jones's legacy as a labor leader remains relevant, her supporters say.</p>
    <p>"This is so current," said Means, whose company, WomanLore, presents theatrical re-enactments of historic women. "It's tragic how current it is. She talked about corporate greed - welcome to the present day."</p>
    <p>Means intends to retrace the roughly 125-mile route taken by Jones, then 73, and her fellow protesters. She has planned at least 11 appearances in the guise of Jones and using Jones's actual written words.</p>
    <p>Elected officials in New Jersey have been invited on Wednesday to help dedicate a memorial plaque in Princeton, where Jones stopped during her march, which began on July 7, 1903.</p>
    <p>"What this woman did over 100 years ago was really incredible, as we look back," said Charles Wowkanech, president of the New Jersey State AFL-CIO, which is helping to sponsor several events in that state.</p>
    <p>Leslie Orear, president of the Illinois Labor History Society, said he believes there has been more attention given in recent years to activists such as Jones.</p>
    <p>"Over the last 10 or 15 years, there's been a steady growth of popular interest in the history of labor. She is one of the more dramatic figures within that history," Orear said.</p>
    <p>In her autobiography, Jones writes that she traveled in the spring of 1903 to Pennsylvania, where she encountered 75,000 striking textile workers. At least 10,000 of the workers were children, she said.</p>
    <p>"Every day little children came into Union headquarters, some with their hands off, some with their thumbs missing, some with their fingers off at the knuckle," Jones wrote. "They were stooped little things, round shouldered and skinny. Many of them were not over ten years of age, the state law prohibited their working before they were 12 years of age."</p>
    <p>In 1938, President Franklin Roosevelt signed into law the Fair Labor Standards Act, which established a federal minimum wage and a maximum-hour work week for some workers.</p>
    <p>Means said she plans to conclude her journey on July 28, believed to be the day Jones arrived at Roosevelt's home. She has not yet been able to schedule a performance in Oyster Bay and may wind up simply walking to the house.</p>
    <p>But there's one part of Mother Jones' journey that Means doesn't care to recreate: the march itself. She will drive the route rather than walk it. This is, after all, 2003 - not 1903.</p>
    <p>"It did cross my mind, and I thought it'd be dramatic, but I thought, 'My God, you'll kill yourself,'" Means said.</p>
