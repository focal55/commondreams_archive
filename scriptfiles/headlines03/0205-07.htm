<p>"You're not a militarist society. You're not in business when you go to war," said Jackson Browne, the Los Angeles songwriter and anti-war activist, by way of compliments to Australia.</p> <p>Browne, whose song-writing virtuosity ranges from the gentle <i>Take It Easy </i>to passionate political cries, believes his own nation is about to make war on Iraq purely for oil. </p> <p>"When they go to war in the United States, business elites are going to business. They're going to work. I don't think Australians respect that and a growing amount of Americans don't respect it," he said in Sydney yesterday. </p> <p>Aged 54, and after 15 million sales from 13 albums, this singer of the protest generation still marches in the streets, and wants concerned Australians to do so, too. </p> <p>He knows Australia. His son Ryan, 21, by his Australian former wife, Lynne Sweeney, lives in Sydney and studies naturopathy. Now on his fifth tour in Australia, Browne has visited regularly over the past 25 years.</p> <p>He thinks of us as idealists who need to be cynical about Prime Minister John Howard's support for war. "I think most Australians see through it and say 'there's some kind of deal in there. There must be some kind of trade agreement behind closed doors'." </p> <p>Browne is very cynical about his leaders' motives. "The people running the country are oil men. There has been a steady calamitous development of events in the United States and people are beginning to connect the dots and see where it all leads." </p> <p>Last month Browne joined about 20,000 people in Los Angeles who marched against the war. He plans to join a movement that is sending bags of rice to US President George Bush asking him not to bomb Iraq, with a note from the scriptures: "If thy enemy hungers, feed him." </p> <p>At his Australian gigs, including at the Palais in Melbourne and the Yarra Valley, there will be lyrics about both love and war. In a world where news and entertainment converge, he says, "it's no longer true that you must not talk about political things in popular culture".</p><p align="center">Copyright &copy; 2003 The Age Company Ltd</p>
