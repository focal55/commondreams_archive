<p>ISLAMABAD -- A US team is here to investigate a possible link to the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

<p>But <a href="http://www.dawn.com/2003/10/28/top9.htm" target="_new">according to the Dawn newspaper</a>, the visit is being kept under wraps with neither the Pakistan Government nor the American Embassy here willing to reveal any details about the investigating team.

<p>According to the paper, the members of the "National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States" have reportedly been provided with full access to certain classified information, documents, institutions and individuals in different parts of the country. They have also been granted permission to go to the tribal areas.

<p>Created by a Congressional legislation and under the signature of US President George W Bush in 2002, the commission has been asked to prepare a full and complete account of the circumstances surrounding the terrorist attacks.

<p>The paper claims that three of the commission's ten members arrived here last week to meet key government officials and and individuals they deemed relevant to their inquiry.

<p>This is the first visit by the commission to Pakistan since it was formed last year.

<p>The visit assumes significance as all information received from Pakistan will be attributable and recorded in the commission's final report that will be made public, the paper said.
