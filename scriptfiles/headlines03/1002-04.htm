<p>NEWARK   - Stark paintings of young black men  holding their hands up in resignation, frustration and fear are  part of a new exhibit that takes aim at racial profiling in  America and the "war on terrorism."<P>
In New Jersey, a state that became synonymous with racial  profiling during a 1990s police highway patrol scandal, artist  Eric Brown asks whether the hotly debated anti-terrorism USA  Patriot Act and profiling of minorities are "one and the same."<P>

  </table></font>The paintings of silhouettes against brick walls, arms  raised and fists curled or clenched, are dominated by the red,  white and blue colors of the U.S. flag.<P>
The exhibit, "Homeland Security ... An American Profile"  opened on Wednesday and runs through Nov. 7 in this run-down  city struggling to revive itself.<P>
Brown, 30, gave his works titles such as "Homeland  Security," "Empty Streets," and "Day of Absence."<P>
He said in an interview at his "SleepWalker's Art" gallery  he wanted to convey the fear that under the Patriot Act "anyone  can be rounded up, it's not just black people or Muslims, it's  just Americans."<P>
"With the empty street I wanted to pose the question: what  happened to the people? Was it fear from gangs? Was it everyone  rounded up and put in a camp like the Afghans in Cuba?"<P>
He was referring to the U.S.-run Guantanamo Bay military  camp where suspected militant Islamists of the former ruling  Taliban in Afghanistan are held with members of al Qaeda. The  group headed by Osama bin Laden was blamed for the Sept. 11,  2001, attacks on America that sparked the Bush administration's  declared war on terrorism.<P>
The U.S. Congress passed the Patriot Act in Oct. 2001,  which has been criticized by liberals and conservatives for  infringing on civil liberties and constitutional rights.<P>
GANGS AND DRUGS<P>
Brown said he also wanted his exhibit to reveal the scourge  of drug trafficking and inner-city gangs like the Bloods and  Crips on urban black communities across the United States.<P>
"I feel African-Americans are placed in a position of  subservience where we have our hands up in the air, be it out  of frustration, being pulled over by police or getting robbed,"  Brown said.<P>
He believes many people share his fear that in the  post-Sept. 11 era "profiling has taken on a different name as a  means to find acceptance with the majority as a reason for  losing their rights without too much opposition."<P>
The faces of the men each have the number 7 painted on  them, a religious symbol of God's instruction in the Bible to  rest on the seventh day, according to Brown, who is a  Christian.
