</table></font>More than 3,000 angry soldiers from the disbanded Iraqi  army massed outside the administration headquarters, in a  presidential palace, shouting slogans and vowing a wave of  attacks on U.S. troops unless they got their money.<P>
"All of us will become suicide bombers," said Khairi  Jassim, a former warrant officer. "I will turn my six daughters  into bombs to kill the Americans."<P>
Paul Bremer, the U.S. civil administrator for Iraq,  dissolved Saddam Hussein's armed forces, several security  bodies and the defense ministry last month, firing 400,000  people.<P>
Many protestors said they could no longer feed their  families.<P>
"I have only 750 dinars (60 U.S. cents) in my pocket. How  can I feed my family? I have a crippled child who needs  medicines," said Sabah Abdullah, also a former warrant officer.<P>
Many demonstrators demanded that the Americans leave Iraq.  Anger toward U.S. troops has boiled over into violence in parts  of Iraq, which has descended into anarchy since the war ended  with widespread looting and violence as well as power  shortages.<P>
The protesters dispersed in the afternoon after talks were  promised with the U.S.-led administration Tuesday. But they  vowed action if there demands were not met.<P>
"We will carry out attacks on the Americans and we will  declare a jihad if our rights are not respected," said Mohan  Qahtan, another former soldier.<P>
"A MILLION RIFLES"<P>
Protesters carried banners calling for the swift formation  of an elected Iraqi government, the immediate payment of  salaries to former soldiers, and a halt to any moves to form a  force to replace the army.<P>
"The Iraqi army did not fight the U.S. troops because it  did not want Saddam Hussein. If it had fought them it would  have killed them and prevented them from invading Iraq," said  Talib Kazim, who was wounded in the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war.<P>
He said he used to get a salary of 92,000 dinars (around  $80) a month.<P>
"I have been in the army all my life," said Mohammed Karim,  who served first in the regular army and then the elite  Republican Guards.<P>
"America should treat us as it treats employees of other  ministries. They come to humiliate us. We do not fear America  or Britain. The million members of the army are able to use a  million rifles on U.S. troops but we do not want harm."<P>
One Iraqi was hurt during the protest, but witnesses  disagreed as to what happened. Some said the injured man, who  was lying in the road, was hit by a car. Others said they had  seen a U.S. officer hit him with his rifle.
