<p>LONDON  - Prime Minister Tony Blair has been accused of  playing the same propaganda games as Saddam Hussein after chunks of  an "intelligence" dossier on Iraq turned out to have been  Plagiarized from academic papers.

</table></font>The dossier, published this week on a government website, said  Iraq had mounted a massive campaign to deceive and intimidate United  Nations inspectors hunting for banned weapons.

			<p>

	

			The latest in a series of British documents focusing on the  alleged threat from Saddam and rallying support for a possible  U.S.-led war, it was praised by U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell  in the U.N. Security Council on Wednesday.

			<p>

	

			It claimed to draw upon "a number of sources, including  intelligence material". But on Friday, red-faced officials admitted  whole swathes were lifted word for word -- grammatical slips and all  -- from a student thesis.

			<p>

	

			Outraged politicians jumped on the revelation on Friday to  accuse Blair of misleading the public and said it cast doubt on the  credibility of his whole case against Saddam.

			<p>

	

			"This is the sort of thing that Saddam Hussein himself issues,"  fumed opposition Liberal Democrat Jenny Tonge.

			<p>

	

			One of Blair's former junior defense ministers, Peter Kilfoyle,  said he was shocked that the government was trying to win over  Britons on such "thin evidence".

			<p>

	

			"It just adds to the general impression that what we have been  treated to is a farrago of half-truths, assertions and over-the-top  'spin,'" he told BBC radio.

			<p>

	

			INTELLIGENCE IS "THIN"

			<p>

	

			Glen Rangwala, an Iraq specialist at Cambridge University who  analyzed the Downing Street dossier, told Reuters 11 of the  dossier's 19 pages were "taken wholesale from academic papers."

			<p>

	

			"If the nature of the intelligence is actually just web  research, then it rather casts doubt about the plausibility of the  government's earlier claims," said Rangwala, a critic of U.S. and  British policy on Iraq.

			<p>

	

			British ministers have privately admitted that gathering  information on Iraq is extremely difficult and intelligence on  Baghdad is "thin".

			<p>

	

			Rangwala said the document was sloppy and appeared to have been  pulled together in a hurry.

			<p>

	

			"That shows there is anxiety in the British government about  public distrust of the information that they have been circulating  -- and their lack of a substantive case that the inspections route  is not a viable alternative to war," he said.

			<p>

	

			Blair's spokesman insisted the document was fundamentally  accurate, and said no one could dispute its central argument that  Iraq was trying to deceive the U.N. inspectors.

			<p>

	

			"In retrospect, we should, to clear up any confusion, have  acknowledged which bits came from public sources and which bits came  from other sources," he said.

			<p>

	

			Britain, which is pouring tens of thousands of troops into the  Gulf to support U.S. preparations for possible military conflict  with Iraq, also came under fire over its last dossier on Iraq -- a  paper published in December on rights violations.

			<p>

	

			The human rights group Amnesty International accused Britain of  raising Iraqi rights abuses which it had studiously ignored in the  1980s when Saddam, backed by the West, fought an eight-year war with  Iran.
