<p>The Bush administration, dominated by ideologues who oppose multilateral interventions, was yesterday exploring the idea of an international force for Iraq to help cover the huge costs of its occupation. <P>Amid warnings this week from the leader of the occupation authority, Paul Bremer, that the costs of rebuilding Iraq will run into tens of billions of dollars, US diplomats have redoubled their efforts to recruit international support.  <P>They are now discussing a proposal which envisages a multinational force, authorized by a UN mandate but operating under the control of an American commander.  
<P>The latest proposal was first raised in discussions at the UN last week between the American secretary of state, Colin Powell, and the UN secretary general, Kofi Annan.  <P>It gained momentum this week when the deputy secretary of state, Richard Armitage, became the first US official to publicly state that the White House may have relaxed its antipathy towards a greater international role in Iraq.  <P>"There are several ideas that are being explored," he told reporters. "One is a multinational force under UN leadership, but the American would be the UN commander."  <P>It would not entail the deployment of blue-helmeted UN peacekeepers.  <P>The Bush administration has been adamant about retaining control, but with George Bush facing re-election in 14 months, it is acutely aware of the political risks of sending more US troops to secure Iraq, or of taking on more costs for reconstruction.  <P>"The administration has stepped across a huge ideological chasm," said Peter Galbraith, a former US ambassador, and an expert on Iraq. "A UN-authorized force under the command of the principal troop contributor is the model from Korea to Bosnia, and it's a sensible model for Iraq."  <P>Diplomats at the UN and analysts were yesterday uncertain about how much support the idea enjoyed from the White House and Pentagon. However, they said the fact that it was being contemplated suggested serious rethinking in the administration.  <P>An administration official cautioned that the proposal was among several ideas being explored for a "hybrid" force to satisfy the demands of France, Germany and other countries for a broader UN role in decision-making without diluting the Pentagon's overall control.  <P>The French foreign minister, Dominique de Villepin, yesterday repeated France's call for the deployment of an international force under UN command, arguing that troop reinforcements on their own would not pacify Iraq.  <P>"It is not enough to deploy more troops, we need a real change in approach," he said. "We must transfer responsibilities and allow the Iraqis to play the role they deserve as soon as possible."  <P>The head of US troops in Iraq, Lieut Gen Ricardo Sanchez, said he would welcome more international troops, but that better intelligence was the key to stability.</p>
