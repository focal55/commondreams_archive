<p>WASHINGTON  - 

Police arrested two Nobel Peace

Iraq.

</table></font>Police handcuffed Mairead Corrigan Maguire, who won the

prize in 1976 for peace activism in the Northern Ireland

conflict, and Jody Williams, a 1997 winner for her work to ban

land mines, after they refused to leave Lafayette Park opposite

the home of the U.S. president.

<p>

 The Nobel laureates were detained along with religious

leaders and Vietnam-era protester Daniel Ellsberg as they sat

in a circle in the park and chanted "Peace, shalom." They held

roses as well as gruesome posters showing civilian casualties

from the war.

<p>

 Maguire told Reuters before being taken away that she

planned to stage an anti-war protest each day outside the White

House until April 18, Good Friday on the Christian calendar.

<p>

 "In Northern Ireland we were encouraged to resolve our

problems with dialogue and I would like to see that happen

here," added Maguire, who said she had asked President Bush  to

meet her.

<p>

 Williams hugged Maguire before they were both handcuffed

and loaded into a police van.

<p>

 "This is what our democracy looks like," shouted Williams

to reporters when she was handcuffed by police.

<p>

 A spokesman for the U.S. Parks Police said nine people had

been arrested for crossing a police line opposite the White

House and that the rest were held for protesting without a

permit. "We expect them all to be released within a couple of

hours," he said.

<p>

 Ellsberg, a former Marine and high-level military analyst

who leaked Pentagon  secrets about the Vietnam war to the press

in 1971, was cheered by supporters who stood behind police

barriers when he was led away.

<p>

 Catholic and Methodist bishops and a leading rabbi were

also among those arrested in the demonstration, which was

organized by the Catholic group Pax Christi.

<p>

 Bush was not in the White House at the time of the protest

but in Florida for a briefing on the war at Central Command

headquarters at MacDill Air Force Base.

<p>

 About 250 opponents of the war protested in Tampa, a few

miles away from where the president addressed troops.

<p>

 The protesters, who came from across Florida and

represented a host of anti-war and civil rights groups, could

see Air Force One with Bush aboard landing at MacDill as they

gathered for the rally.

<p>

 "The people of Florida say no to war," Mauricio Rosas, a

spokesman for the coalition, told reporters.

<p>

 In New York, 16 anti-Israel demonstrators were arrested on

Wednesday morning after chaining themselves together across

Fifth Avenue near 47th Street and disrupting Manhattan traffic

for about an hour, police said.

<p>

 Protesters were splashed with fake blood and wore t-shirts

saying "Witness to Israeli War Crimes."
