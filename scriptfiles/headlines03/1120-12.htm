<p> Early holiday shoppers looking for an affordable gift with a left-wing political bent might want to visit the Puzzlebox store.
<p>There they can find a deck of playing cards touting the candidacy of former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, along with a deck featuring the &#034;Wall Street Most Wanted.&#034;
<p>&#034;This is so us,&#034; said Cathy Sullivan, owner of the Puzzlebox at 230 State St. &#034;We just got them in Monday and they have been flying out of here.&#034;
<p>The casino-quality playing cards, which sell for $13 a deck, paste head shots of national figures over cartoon bodies.
<p>The Wall Street deck, for example, features a list of corporate evil-doers from Enron CEO Kenneth Lay to Frank Quattrone, the former investment banker who recently beat the rap on fraud charges. It also roasts stock market cheerleaders, such as CNBC personality Maria Bartiromo and Abby Joseph Cohen of Goldman Sachs, who continued to tout stocks even at over-inflated prices.
<p>New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, who has gone to bat for small-time investors, is featured on a &#034;Hero&#034; card wearing a white suit, a badge and a drawn pistol. Volume II of the Wall Street deck now includes references to the mutual fund scandal, with Wisconsin&#039;s own Strong Funds featured on a deuce.
<p>&#034;I would have run Dick Strong&#039;s picture but I&#039;m not sure everybody would have known who that was,&#034; said David Krikorian, co-founder of Parody Productions which is producing the cards.
<p>A former Fidelity Investments employee, Krikorian said he witnessed the Wall Street abuses &#034;first hand&#034; and wanted to find a way to bring them to light.
<p>&#034;The cards tell a pretty sad story in a very humorous way,&#034; he said.
<p>Krikorian even parodies Wall Street in his press release where he boasts the card company has &#034;beaten its managed earnings number for the 65th consecutive quarter.&#034;
<p>&#034;We did it by inflating our revenues, capitalizing expenses and paying senior management boatloads in compensation,&#034; he quips.
<p>The Dean Deck features the candidate himself and a host of presidential hopefuls, statesmen, media personalities and certain players in the Bush Administration. It highlights four major issues of the Dean campaign: Foreign Policy, Health Care, Environmental Issues and the Economy.
<p>&#034;The cards tell the story of Dean&#039;s meteoric rise as a Democratic frontrunner and the next president of the United States,&#034; said Krikorian, who adds quickly that the Dean Deck is not affiliated with the campaign in any way.
<p>Howard Dean is featured, of course, as the ace of each suit, with President Bush and Dick Cheney as jokers.
<p>Sullivan of the Puzzlebox said she only has one regret about the cards.
<p>&#034;I wish we would have had them during the media reform conference,&#034; she said.
<p>The conference was held in Madison earlier this month and featured speakers from Bill Moyers to Al Franken talking about corporate right-wing control of the media.
<p>Parody Productions, Inc. was formed in early 2003 and is headquartered in Cincinnati.
