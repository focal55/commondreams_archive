<p> The leaders of Britain's two main Christian churches united against Tony Blair this morning, expressing doubts about the moral legitimacy of invading Iraq.</p>
<p>The Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, and the Catholic Archbishop of Westminster, Cormac Murphy O'Connor, released a statement at midnight that also warned of the "unpredictable humanitarian and political consequences of war".</p>
<p>The attack on the "moral legitimacy of war" came after Saturday's speech by the Prime Minister in the lead-up to Britain's biggest protest, in which he made a "moral case" for removing Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p>But the clerics also called on President Saddam to comply with UN demands. "War is always a deeply disturbing prospect; one that can never be contemplated without a sense of failure and regret that other means have not prevailed, and deep disquiet about all that may come in its train," the statement said.</p>
<p>"We are very conscious of the huge burden of responsibility carried by those who must make the ultimate decision ... The events of recent days show that doubts still persist about the moral legitimacy, as well as the unpredictable humanitarian and political consequences, of a war with Iraq."</p>
<p>But, in a welcome message to No 10, the men said they recognized that the "moral alternative to military action cannot be inaction, passivity, appeasement or indifference".</p>
<p>They said it was "vital" that all sides engaged through the UN in a process which "could and should render the trauma and tragedy of war unnecessary". They also "strongly" urged Iraq to demonstrate its "unequivocal compliance with UN resolutions on weapons of mass destruction".</p>
<p>"The season of Lent is now approaching, a time when all Christian traditions encourage us to examine ourselves honestly, to acknowledge our shortcomings and to seek reconciliation with God," they said.</p>
<p>Dr Williams, a long-time declared opponent of war, who was appointed last year, is leader of 70 million Anglicans across the world, while Cardinal Murphy-O'Connor is leader of four million Catholics.</p>
<p>Their statement comes after more than five million people marched in protest against the war around the world over the weekend, including more than a million in London.</p>
<p>But Downing Street seemed relaxed about the clerics' statement with a spokeswoman last night pointing to how the men had referred to the need for President Saddam to comply.</p>
<p>"Obviously they're entitled to their views and we have to notice what they say about Saddam complying with the resolution," the spokeswoman said. "Their views are their views but look at what they are saying."</p>
