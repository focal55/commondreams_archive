<p>WASHINGTON, June 5 — The Justice Department has barred a group of employees from holding their annual gay pride event at the department's headquarters, the first time such an event has been blocked by any federal agency, gay rights leaders said today.</p><P> Justice Department officials told the group, called <a href="http://www.dojpride.org/" target="_new">DOJ Pride</a>, that it could not hold its annual event at the department because the White House had not formally recognized Gay Pride Month with a presidential proclamation, Marina Colby, a department policy analyst who is president of the group, said. The group represents several hundred gay and lesbian employees at the department.</p><!-- BIGAD ad not targeted --><P> "This sends a real chilling message to Justice Department employees who are gay and lesbian," said David Smith, a spokesman for Human Rights Campaign, the country's largest gay advocacy group.</p><P> "This says, `You're not welcome,' " Mr. Smith said. "It says that employees can celebrate Asian-American heritage month, and Hispanic heritage month and so on, but you cannot."</p><P> Barbara Comstock, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department, refused to comment.</p><P> The gay pride event has been a tradition at the Justice Department since the late 90's, organizers said, and many other federal agencies have held similar events since the mid-1990's, when President Bill Clinton first declared a Gay Pride Month. </p><P> Last year Deputy Attorney General Larry Thompson — the second-ranking official at the department — spoke to about 150 people at the event in the Great Hall of the department. Ms. Colby said the presence of such a high-ranking official "was a really big deal for us, a real sign of support."</p><P> But Mr. Thompson's appearance drew protests from some conservative groups. Some accused Attorney General John Ashcroft, a social conservative who has spoken out in the past about homosexuality, of abandoning them by allowing last year's event to proceed.</p><P> Public Advocate, a nonprofit group that describes itself as pro-family, has continued lobbying the Justice Department and other federal agencies in recent months to abandon the gay pride events because it says the events are an inappropriate use of federal resources, said Jesse Binnall, a group spokesman.</p><P> Told of the decision to cancel this year's Justice Department event, Mr. Binnall said today, "We're absolutely thrilled that the Justice Department has made such a bold decision to stand up for American families instead of giving in to special interest groups." </p><P> Gay Republicans have become a more vocal force in party politics of late, but President Bush, unlike Mr. Clinton, has refused to issue a proclamation declaring a Gay Pride Month. The White House has said that the president does not believe "in politicizing people's sexual orientation."</p><P> Mr. Bush has issued more than 250 proclamations, acknowledging events like Greek Independence Day, Leif Erikson Day, Save Your Vision Week and National Hospice Month. </p><P> This is the first time any federal agency has forced the cancellation of a gay pride event, Mr. Smith said.</p><P> Ethnic and racial groups have held annual events at the Justice Department. But Ms. Colby, the leader of DOJ Pride, said the gay pride event was the only one she knew of at the Justice Department that was not covered by a presidential proclamation, and she believed that the Justice Department was using the proclamation issue as a convenient way to cancel the event.</p><P> Ms. Colby said she feared that other events that her group holds at the department, like panel discussions, could also be in jeopardy and that the existence of the group could be threatened. </p><P> "This was a total surprise to us," she said of the decision to block the event. "Every other association at the department has its recognized month and event, except us."
