<p>FALLUJAH, Iraq -- To shoot or not to shoot?
<P>Suddenly, it was a life or death decision Private Christopher Hollis had to 
make. Someone had just fired at his 1st Infantry Division checkpoint under an 
overpass on Highway 10, and now, crouching behind a guardrail, Hollis was 
scanning some rickety roadside soda stands 200 yards away for the sniper 
through the scope of his M-16 rifle.
<P>He could fire back at the dusty desert, risking the lives of the Iraqi 
children who had scattered from the kiosks as soon as they heard the shot. Or, 
he could not respond, risking his life and the lives of the dozen other U.S. 
soldiers at the checkpoint.
<P>This is a call GIs in Iraq have to make every day. With Iraqi guerrillas 
mounting between 10 and 20 hit-and-run attacks on U.S. troops daily, U.S. 
soldiers admit that the pressure of constantly being a target has made them 
jumpy.
<P>The only way to respond, they say, is by following new, merciless rules of 
engagement stated one night last week by Lt. Peter Katzfey in front of 299 
Engineer Battalion soldiers preparing for a night patrol in Tikrit:
<P>"Shoot to kill. No questions asked."

  </table></font>Major Robert Isabella, a public affairs officer of the Fourth Infantry 
Division based in Tikrit, elaborated. "This is war. Someone shoots from a 
window, we're gonna put 100 rounds in it. Somebody runs a checkpoint, we're 
gonna fire on that vehicle."
<P>Since May 1, when President Bush declared an end to "major combat," 95 U.S. 
soldiers have died in hostile fire. Most of them were attacked in Baghdad, 
near Saddam Hussein's hometown of Tikrit, or here on Highway 10, about 30 
miles west of the capital.
<P>U.S. authorities insist they have little choice but to respond, in self-
defense. But Iraqi critics and some Western human rights organizations say 
dozens of innocent bystanders are getting killed in cross fire or as a result 
of mistaken raids by overaggressive U.S. troops.
<P>"As attacks against them continue, U.S. soldiers are sometimes resorting to 
deadly force in a reckless and indiscriminate way," Joe Stork, acting 
executive director of the New York-based Human Rights Watch's Middle East and 
North Africa Division, said in a statement last month.
<P><b>CIVILIAN CASUALTIES INCREASE</b>
<P>In the past two months, civilian casualties have been mounting. On Sept. 17,
<P>U.S. troops killed a teenage boy in Fallujah, a hotbed of Iraqi resistance, 
having mistaken celebratory shots at a wedding for an attack against them. 
Nine Iraqi policemen and a Jordanian guard, who were chasing local bandits, 
died on Sept. 12 in Fallujah after an 82nd Airborne Division patrol fired on 
them, thinking they were rebel fighters. A Sept. 23 air strike on a farmhouse, 
which the military thought was a rebel hideout, killed three sleeping 
civilians. A Reuters television cameraman, Mazen Dana, 41, was killed Aug. 17 
by tank fire, when U.S. troops thought the camera Dana was using outside an 
Iraqi prison was a rocket-propelled grenade launcher. In that incident, at 
least two other journalists were shot at.
<P>Lt. Col. George Krivo, the U.S. military spokesman in Baghdad, called the 
shooting of Dana regrettable, but said the soldiers acted within the rules of 
engagement.
<P>No one knows how many Iraqi civilians have been accidentally killed or 
wounded by U.S. soldiers. Lt. Kate Noble, a spokeswoman for the U.S.-led 
coalition forces, said the troops do not keep a record of civilian casualties, 
and many Iraqis interviewed for this story said they did not know where to 
file complaints over alleged misconduct of U.S. soldiers.
<P>Human Rights Watch has criticized the lack of transparency in relation to U.
S. investigations of such incidents.
<P><b>IRAQIS FILING CLAIMS</b>
<P>Shatha al Quraishi, a Baghdad lawyer, said she represents 158 Iraqis who 
have filed claims for financial compensation since May. She said most of her 
clients have been wounded or maimed or had their loved ones killed by U.S. 
troops. Some, she said, had their property destroyed in cross fire.
<P>One of al Quraishi's clients, Anmar Dawood Salman, said a U.S. soldier 
killed his brother Fahad when Fahad's car backfired at a busy rotary in 
downtown Baghdad Sept. 27. Salman said the soldier, who was crossing the 
square on a humvee, had apparently mistaken the sound for a gunshot.
<P>"He fired one bullet, and it went through the windshield and straight 
through his neck. He died on the spot," Anmar said, serving his guests the 
bitter black coffee Iraqi mourning traditions require. "Fahad was a civilian, 
a shopkeeper. He did not even have a weapon."
<P>Although in his claim Anmar demands compensation for the killing of his 
older brother, he said it was not the money he wanted.
<P>"I want Americans to realize how much harm they bring and to pay attention 
to people they kill," he said. "We hope that American commanders will pay 
attention and tell their troops not to act so hastily."
<P><b>ASSERTIONS ANGER U.S. TROOPS</b>
<P>U.S. military officials say the troops are trained to minimize civilian 
casualties, and GIs on the ground angrily dispute assertions they are 
overreacting or firing indiscriminately.
<P>"We do not fire on anybody unless we feel that our life is threatened," 
Joshua Matthews, an infantry soldier with the 101st Airborne Division in 
northern Iraq, wrote in an e-mail. "We don't just kill for the fun of it. Have 
you ever killed anybody? It sucks!
<P>"But, we all plan to go home one day and I'll be damned if some ignorant, 
brainwashed Muslim extremist is going to get in my way of seeing my family 
again," Matthews wrote. "I have lost two very good friends of mine in an RPG 
[rocket-propelled grenade] attack a few months ago. Having to help put them in 
body bags is an image I will never forget."
<P>The frequent attacks, in which the rebels rely increasingly on remote-
controlled roadside bombs, have made many soldiers suspicious of nearly every 
Iraqi they see.
<P>As he rode through the garbage-strewn outskirts of Tikrit in the passenger 
seat of a humvee, Sgt. Derek White of the 299 Engineer Battalion held his M249 
machine gun at the ready. A boy squatting by a roadside soda stand waved 
tentatively. Then, as the humvee sped by, the boy lifted his chin, squinted 
and spat in the direction of the passing vehicle.
<P><b>'THEY SMILE . . . TRY TO KILL YOU'</b>
<P>"I don't need friends like this," White remarked. "They smile in your face 
during the daytime and they try to kill you at night."
<P>The Iraqis "seem to have gotten pretty aggravated with us being around," 
said Private T.J. Knight, the driver of White's humvee. "I asked my 
interpreter if the Iraqi people are mad at us. He said that 90 percent of 
Iraqis hate us, and the other 10 percent have left Iraq."
<P>In this jittery atmosphere of contempt and violence, force protection 
sometimes takes priority over the need to minimize civilian casualties.
<P>"If you see someone and he looks like he's going to hurt American soldiers, 
it's shoot and kill," Knight said. "Hard decisions gotta be made in a few 
seconds."
<P>"Of course, the margin for error is pretty wide," he conceded.
<P>Under the overpass on Highway 10 in Fallujah, Private Hollis saw no signs 
of the sniper. He lowered his weapon.
<P>"What I really don't like is when they just cap off a round like that," 
Hollis said, his face covered in dust. "When they're shooting at you, you 
shoot right back. But when they just shoot like that you don't know what to do."
