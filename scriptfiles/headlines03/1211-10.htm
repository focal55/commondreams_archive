  </table><!--/endimage/-->Only 400 soldiers are left on Thursday, following the mass walkout over terrible pay and conditions.
<p>Salaries in the new army range from $50 a month to $180 for a colonel, a US occupation administration source said. 
<p>Speaking on condition of anonymity, the official also confirmed there had been discipline problems – with some recruits refusing to obey instructions before resigning.

 

<p>"My understanding is that they felt they should be paid more money, for example, than the police," he said, adding that the occupation administration will review all security force salaries. 

   

<p><b>Bad beginning
</b>
<p>Iraq’s administrators had been building a new Iraqi army after dismissing all the members of Saddam Hussein's armed forces following the invasion in April. 

   

<p>"There may have been some confusion when they first joined the Iraqi army. They weren't sure exactly what their terms and conditions are," the official said. 
<p>What remains of the Iraqi First Battalion is serving with the US 4th Infantry Division. 

   

<p>The official said a second Iraqi battalion is now training "and there are no resignations from that." 

 

<p>Another group of more than 2000 recruits are expected to begin their training next year, he said.
