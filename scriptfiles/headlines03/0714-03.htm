<p>TONY Blair has lost the trust of the British people over war on Iraq, an exclusive Mirror poll reveals today.</p> 
<p>Two thirds of voters believe the Premier fed them false information in the months-long run-up to conflict.</p> 
<p>Their damning verdict follows the failure to find Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction, suspect claims that the tyrant could deploy WMD in 45 minutes and allegations that intelligence dossiers were "sexed up" to exaggerate the Iraqi threat.</p> 
<p>More than one in three voters - 35 per cent - say their confidence in Mr Blair has lessened because of the war. Even 11 per cent of Labour voters have lost faith, enough to wipe out the party's majority at a general election.</p>

</table></font>Yesterday Commons Leader Peter Hain admitted that lack of trust, particularly in Mr Blair, was now top of the agenda.</p> 
<p>He told GMTV: "It is one of the most worrying findings of a presentation we had in Cabinet on Thursday.</p> 
<p>"Politics now has a crisis of confidence with the voter. For our government, and Tony Blair specifically as the head, this is a particular problem we're suffering."</p> 
<p>Transport Secretary Alistair Darling added: "Trust is something governments have to fight for every day. We're going through a bit of turbulence."</p> 
<p>The Mirror poll, carried out by ICM Research, showed that only 29 per cent of voters say Mr Blair did not mislead the country over war on Iraq.</p> 
<p>Twenty seven per cent believe he knowingly gave them false information. The rest - 39 per cent - think he did not mean to lie to them, but did.</p> 
<p>Voters feel equally distrustful about the security services. More believe they provided bad intelligence about Iraq than good.</p> 
<p>Twenty nine per cent thought it bad, 18 per cent very bad, 37 per cent said it was good and only a derisory six per cent that it was very good.</p> 
<p>Despite the huge level of criticism about Mr Blair's role in ordering British troops into Iraq, almost half of voters say he was justified in going to war.</p> 
<p>And fewer than one in four, 24 per cent, believe Saddam did not have WMD before the conflict started. Thirty per cent say he destroyed them when war began. Thirty six per cent back Mr Blair's insistence that WMD still exist in Iraq, despite no sign of them since Saddam was kicked out of power three months ago.</p> 
<p>There is also comfort for Mr Blair from the high level of support he continues to receive from Labour voters. Only 18 per cent say war was unjustified while 72 per cent say it was right.</p> 
<p>Almost half are convinced WMD will still be found. A tiny eight per cent say the Premier knowingly misled the nation, with 58 per cent insisting he told the truth.</p> 
<p>Mr Blair's biggest critics over war on Iraq are those aged over 65. Young people aged 18-24 are most supportive with 54 per cent agreeing the attack was justified.</p> 
<p>However, only six per cent say they now feel more confident in him.</p> 
<p>Mr Blair is also under pressure over failing public services. Many in his party say he has lost their trust over plans for foundation hospitals and the introduction of sky-high fees for students. Clare Short, who quit as International Development Secretary over war on Iraq, last week urged Mr Blair to leave office before the situation got "nastier".</p> 
<p>Yesterday, party loyalists sprang to the Premier's defense.</p> 
<p>Mr Darling said: "I think by the time of the next election people will see what we have delivered on the public services.</p> 
<p>"They will have a choice between us and whether or not they want Iain Duncan Smith and his crew back in.</p> 
<p>"I think trust is something you have got to work for, you have got to build. But frankly I don't think Clare's contribution is going to help one way or the other."</p> 
<p>He added that Ms Short - who accused Mr Blair of leading Britain into conflict on the basis of half truths and deceptions - risked "downgrading" her achievements by her continuing attacks.</p> 
<p>Former Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson said: "For the tiny handful of people who are shouting the odds in this way, I'd say this - they don't represent opinion in the Labour Party or in the country.</p> 
<p>"They have a successful Government. It may be that along with successful policies they need an equally successful political strategy to implement those strategies.</p> 
<p>"But the core of the Government's beliefs, its program and its policies have a proven track record of success."</p> 
<p>Tory party chairman Theresa May said the row over Iraq had highlighted lack of confidence in the Government.</p> 
<p>She told Sky News: "The issue about how the Government used intelligence information has raised this whole question of trust.</p> 
<p>"But it was starting to be there anyway."</p> 
<p>Lib Dem foreign affairs spokesman Menzies Campbell added: "Day by day the case for an independent scrutiny of the lead-up to the war against Iraq becomes irresistible.</p> 
<p>"Only full disclosure can restore the reputation of this government."</p> 
<p>ICM interviewed 1,012 adults aged 18+ from July 10-12. Results weighted to the profile of all adults.</p>
