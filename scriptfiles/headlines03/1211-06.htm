<p>A San Francisco nonprofit that has successfully sued foreign 
military leaders for crimes against humanity has again filed suit, this time 
against a former Salvadoran military commander the group says is responsible 
for torture and assassinations during the early years of El Salvador's civil 
war.
<P>The <a href="http://www.cja.org/" target="_new">Center for Justice and Accountability</a>, along with a Tennessee law 
firm, claims in a civil suit filed in Memphis that Nicolas Carranza, a U.S. 
citizen living in Memphis, was El Salvador's vice-minister of defense between 
1979 and 1981, a time during which violent attacks were mounted against 
Salvadorans who criticized their government.
<P>"The case is not about revenge, but sending the message that you can't 
commit crimes against humanity and then retire to the United States," said the 
center's director, Sandra Coliver. 
<P>Carranza did not respond to a message left at his Memphis home requesting 
comment.
<P>The center is bringing the case on behalf of seven Salvadoran plaintiffs  
--  six of whom now live in the United States  --  who say they were tortured 
or had family members killed by security forces under Carranza's command. The 
plaintiffs are asking for unspecified punitive and compensatory damages.
<P>One plaintiff, San Francisco security guard Jose Francisco Calderon, said 
he still vividly remembers the night in September 1980 when members of the 
National Police shot his father to death in the family's home in the town of 
Ahuachapan. 
<P>"I still have nightmares about it," said Calderon, his voice choked with 
tears. "My father was a humble schoolteacher. He was willing to speak up for 
better education for the poor."
<P>Calderon said he fled to San Francisco after witnessing his father's 
murder. He applied for political asylum here but was denied. He has since 
gained legal status and become a U.S. citizen. Berkeley psychologist Adrianne 
Aron, who has worked extensively with Salvadoran and Guatemalan torture 
victims, said such a lawsuit has tremendous psychological value for the 
survivors.
<P>"To see the perpetrators brought to justice, that is the thing that can 
set the world aright again after it's been so terribly disturbed," said Aron. 
"It enables them to believe that the world can again be a safe place."
<P>In El Salvador, a 1993 amnesty passed after the peace accords that ended 
the war prevents charging military officers or troops with wartime atrocities.
<P>The U.S. suit against Carranza was brought under a 1789 law that allows 
victims to seek redress in U.S. courts even if the offenses occurred elsewhere,
as long as the perpetrator is in the United States.
<P>The Center for Justice and Accountability used the same law last year to 
win a $54 million verdict against two retired Salvadoran generals in Florida. 
<P>Legal experts say such victories could make the United States a less 
appealing place for foreigners with a history of human rights abuse.
<P>"It's outrageous that such a man was able to become a U.S. citizen," said 
Coliver. "We hope that the case will result in his being denaturalized and 
deported."
